				 <p><a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/trust-registry-service/">Trust Registries</a> are a powerful technology organizations can use to increase trust and streamline business operations in various industries. One of the most innovative uses of this technology can be found in the financial sector, where trust registries are being used to combat the threat of financial fraud.</p>
<p><a href="https://bonifii.com/">Bonifii</a>, an innovative financial technology company, has developed <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a>™, a solution that proactively protects credit union members from becoming victims of financial fraud. MemberPass™&nbsp;allows member institutions (credit unions and other financial institutions) to issue credentials to their members. When a credit union verifies their members, they use cryptography, self-sovereign identity credentials and communications to prove the following key things:</p>
 
 The connection is the same private connection that was established with their own member (this is two-way – the member knows this too). 
 The member still holds the credential. 
 The contents of the credential haven’t been tampered with.&nbsp; 
 The credit union signed the credential using its Decentralized Identifier – its DID. 
 
<p>Getting cryptographically secure facts like these helps the credit union and their member be sure they aren’t talking to bad actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when another institution starts to use a credential, the cryptography can only go so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another institution can know that:</p>
 
 The person holds the credential (they aren’t a member of that other institution). 
 The contents haven’t been tampered with. 
 A DID signed the credential. 
 
<p>What we don’t know is whether the DID that signed the credential is really a trusted credit union or not.</p>
<p>To know that the institution checks the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry™. The trust registry is maintained under Bonifii’s governance framework, and Bonifii has a solid process that validates the institutions listed in the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry™.&nbsp;</p>
  Increase Trust and Streamline Operations 
<p>The use of a trust registry allows new institutions to join the MemberPass™&nbsp;network and quickly validate the information from any participating member institutions.&nbsp; Further, it provides for the efficient sharing and verification of information among credit unions and their partners, increasing trust and streamlining business operations.</p>
<p>The operational ecosystem, anchored by the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry™, provides Bonifii with a comprehensive solution for managing its identity verification data and interactions. MemberPass™ offers a streamlined and user-friendly interface that allows members to easily manage their digital identity, including adding and removing authorized credentials, viewing transaction history, and monitoring for suspicious activity—allowing members to easily and securely access their financial accounts and complete transactions.</p>
<p>The implementation of Trust Registries in the financial industry, as demonstrated by Bonifii’s MemberPass Digital Trust Registry™, is a powerful example of how this technology can increase trust and streamline business operations. Trust Registries provide a significant step forward in the efficient and secure management of identity verification data and interactions in the credit union industry.</p> 
			        
				
				
				
				
				 <p>About Bonifii: By providing a safe, secure, and convenient identity verification solution, MemberPass™&nbsp;is solving one of the credit union industry’s biggest problems by reducing member friction and injecting trust in digital interactions. The use of a decentralized trust registry in MemberPass™&nbsp;is a real-world example of how organizations can use this technology to increase trust and streamline business operations.</p>
<p>About Continuum Loop: As a leading consulting firm, Continuum Loop played a vital role in the development and launch of MemberPass™&nbsp;and the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®. Darrell O’Donnell was embedded as the CTO, providing crucial expertise and leadership. Through their partnership, Continuum Loop and Bonifii successfully deployed the first-ever Trust Registry for MemberPass™, significantly enhancing the platform’s security and user convenience.</p>

<p>In the first part of this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we welcomed Trent McConaghy, Founder of Ocean Protocol, for the second time on our show. During this two-episode series podcast interview, we spoke about the Ocean roadmap for 2023 and the project’s focus on newer use cases, including DeFi. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;episode.</p><p>Focus of the Ocean Protocol core team in&nbsp;2023</p><p>Ocean Protocol as a project was conceived in late 2016. For the first five years, it was steadily building the infrastructure needed to solve a bunch of different tough problems such as sovereign data ownership, solving private data reconciling with crypto, pricing data, and many other related things. The project launched different versions–V1, V2, V3, and V4. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/datatokens-daos-and-nfts-14aedce1bba7">Trent briefly spoke about these versions in another appearance of Voices of the Data Economy as&nbsp;well.</a></p><blockquote>“The focus is now doubling down on traction. How we measure traction is by ‘data consume volume,’ which means how much data is being bought and sold in any given week or month through the Ocean ecosystem, on the Ocean Market, and other markets powered by Ocean contracts. We have more focused projects now like <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/bounties">data challenges</a> (for predicting the price of Ethereum) and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data Farming</a> (an incentive program where the objective function is data consume volume).”</blockquote><p>Trent quickly recaps the different versions of Ocean: Ocean V1 solved data sovereignty; Ocean V2 solved data privacy through privacy-preserving AI, and Ocean V3 solved a few things at once: How do we simplify things? How do we have really crazy interoperability for the custody and management of data? How do we automatically price&nbsp;data?</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-overview-1ccd4a7ce150">Here you can find an overview of Ocean V4</a>. It got shipped in the spring of 2022. The three things that got shipped in V4 are Data NFTs, in addition to datatokens to map, base IP, and licenses against the base IP; solving rug pulls on the pools, and finally, better monetization for the community.</p><p>Users of Ocean Protocol. Who are&nbsp;they?</p><p>The users of Ocean Protocol can be divided into three segments — by verticals, by profession, and then there are individual or higher level groups. By vertical, it applies to multiple streams — like automotive data, could apply to personal social media data, or health data&nbsp;etc.</p><p>There are several projects within the Ocean ecosystem that focus on personal data, typically via DAOs. Most people don’t want to manage their data themselves — so you can have collective bargaining around that- this is handled via projects like the <a href="https://www.dataunion.app/what-is-a-dataunion/">DataUnion app</a>.</p><p>The relatively larger groups are NGOs, small businesses, large enterprises, and then cities, provinces, and countries — any of those slices of civilization can use Ocean in various ways. It goes up and down different levels; for example, <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/proposal-deltadao-creating-an-ocean-protocol-use-case-and-pitch-deck-library/618">one collaboration is actually via deltaDAO collaborating with the Berlin Library ecosystem.</a></p><p>Data Scientists as Ocean Protocol users and why&nbsp;DeFi?</p><p>The main user that Ocean serves the best right now is data scientists, because it’s data scientists who work with data and know how to create value from data, typically by building AI models or just simple machine learning models. Then making predictions, choosing actions, selecting actions, and then executing those actions. One example is DeFi, where you can predict the price of ETH in 10 minutes from now. And if you are right more often than you are wrong - you can make a buying or selling&nbsp;action.</p><blockquote>“I believe that Ocean will become ubiquitous, and we are on track with that. How do you get to the ubiquity and its sustained growth over long periods? Facebook has become ubiquitous right now. It started with just college students and Harvard. But then it spread itself one university at a time. And eventually, after years and years of sustained growth, it became ubiquitous. And hopefully, it won’t be ubiquitous forever because it’s centralized. And typically, things fade. Ocean, though, I hope, becomes ubiquitous and has decentralized goals. It is an infrastructure for civilization, just like TCP/IP with web protocols on&nbsp;top.”</blockquote><p>While deciding on vertical focus, one good metric is the time needed for going through the data value creation cycle. For DeFi, it can be as little as 10 minutes, and for areas like drug discovery, it can be as long as ten years for data to get monetized with all FDA approvals etc. In those terms, the lowest-hanging fruit is decentralized finance.</p><p>Build, build, build: V4, veOCEAN and Data&nbsp;Farming</p><p>With the launch of V4, Ocean solved these three problems: base IP NFTs, rug pulls, and much better monetization for the community. But before that, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean had already launched Data Farming</a>. In Trent’s words, Data Farming incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (stakers) as a function of consume volume and liquidity. It’s like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned for data consumption. DF’s aim is to achieve a minimum supply of data for network effects to kick in, and once the network flywheel is spinning, to increase growth&nbsp;rate.</p><p>Questions at that point: How do we solve the problem with free assets for Data Farming, fixed price assets for Data Farming, and the pool draining attack? The solution to this was built and shipped by Ocean in the fall of 2022: veOCEAN. It stopped all the issues from before. Read Trent’s blog here on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">Introducing </a>veOCEAN and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/veocean-is-launching-data-farming-is-resuming-abed779211e3">how Data Farming continued with the veOCEAN&nbsp;launch.</a></p><blockquote>“There’s a macro-level problem in crypto. How do you reconcile near-term greed with long-term incentives? You’ve got the people who want to ape into something, make their 2x in a week or a month, and then ape out–take your profits and go. If you would have asked me three years ago, four years ago, five years ago, I would have said just ignore those people. But the fact of the matter is in crypto, they exist, and you should try to make your system somewhat attractive to them, even if they’re not your main target. You still want to be interesting to them, if you can. But for the long term, I still really want to make sure that we serve the builders around data, the data scientists,” concludes Trent in the first part of this interview.</blockquote><p>Here is a list of different topics discussed during the two-episode series interview:</p>  The focus of the core Ocean team in&nbsp;2022  Different user groups of Ocean&nbsp;Protocol  How Data Scientists can use&nbsp;Ocean  Ocean’s focus on constantly building: veOCEAN and Data&nbsp;Farming  Different use cases in DeFi and&nbsp;Ocean  Trent’s view on the future of AI in&nbsp;2022  Trent’s take on 2022 as a year for the crypto industry and what to look forward in&nbsp;2023  <p>We will release the second part of the interview soon.

 DIDs Prove Control with Private&nbsp;Keys <p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a way to identify and authenticate devices. Unlike traditional unique identifiers, DIDs have a private key associated with them that proves control of the identifier. This is especially useful for devices, as they can hold their own private key and make assertions about their authenticity.</p><p>One way to secure devices is to use a hardware-protected private key, such as a TPM (trusted platform module) or TrustZone in an ARM processor. This ensures that the private key is not extractable and can only be used to make signatures in a trusted execution environment. The public key, on the other hand, can be stored on a verifiable data registry and associated with a DID, allowing it to be retrieved upon&nbsp;request.</p> Keys Can Be Generated at the Beginning or Middle of Device Arbitration Process <p>The timing of public/private key generation on a device depends on the specific use-case. For example, if the device needs to be authenticated as a genuine product from a particular brand, the keys may need to be generated at the time of assembly. On the other hand, if the device is being provisioned for a specific use-case, key generation may take place during the provisioning stage.</p> Using Key Generation to Protect User&nbsp;Privacy <p>It’s important to consider privacy when using DIDs and hardware-protected keys to authenticate devices. In cases where devices are being sold to the general public, it’s best practice to generate new keys to preserve the privacy of the&nbsp;user.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@benjamincoll875">Benjamin Collins</a>, Transmute’s Technical Product Owner, spent 10 years working with Linux and Open Source as the creator of DashGL.com, a site which provides tutorials for writing simple games for Linux in C using OpenGL and the GTK&nbsp;toolkit.</p><p>Connect with Ben on <a href="https://twitter.com/kion_dgl">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/BenjaminMoe">GitHub</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasend/">Sasen D</a>, one of Ontology’s Loyal Members. I’m from Sri Lanka. I joined Ontology’s community in April&nbsp;2019.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What are your hobbies? Do you have any&nbsp;pets? <p>I am a passionate sales and marketing professional with over 11 years of experience in the field and I have completed some professional certifications related to the subject. I am also married and have a child. I love animals and have a cat, but other than that, my hobbies include music and playing football.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I work mainly on an online basis, working freelance with the crypto and blockchain communities, outside of my professional role in marketing and sales. I was part of the Ontology member base in 2020, and I attended as many events as I could. This is really how I got so closely involved with Ontology. Because of this, Ontology named me as its first Loyal Member of the team. Now I deal each week with Loyal Member discussions, join Twitter Spaces, and continue to play a role in the wider Ontology community.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>I believe that Ontology’s node staking performance is the highlight of its offerings, as well as its trusted decentralised solution, easy to manage platforms, and 24/7 online&nbsp;support.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>The weekly Loyal Member discussion is the most exciting part of Ontology for me. Seeking out new ideas, topics, and opinions to discuss each week and share with the community increases my personal knowledge. Additionally, engaging in discussions with the community allows me to develop ideas with them and contribute to Ontology’s innovations.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>That is quite an interesting question. I got a huge amount of value for my work in sales and marketing when I worked at a private university. Career-wise, this was probably my best personal accomplishment to&nbsp;date.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am excited to be an Ontology Harbinger and have the opportunity to share my enthusiasm for the project with&nbsp;others.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>We can expect to see more creative uses for digital currency over the coming years, which could have a meaningful impact on many people’s everyday lives. Web3 will be the main cause of this so Ontology will naturally play a large part. Furthermore, decentralized identities are the future. This is something that may be a core part of Ontology’s strategy over the next five&nbsp;years.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-loyal-ontology-community-member-sasen-71ea2e9c79da">Meet the Team: Loyal Ontology Community Member, Sasen</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  The central bank of India, RBI, started with India’s CBDC pilot project in the last phase of&nbsp;2022.  India’s CBDC pilot has two segments: Digital Rupee Wholesale and Digital Rupee&nbsp;Retail.  The pilot is active within a closed user group with eight banks entrusted with the initial responsibilities.  <p>Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India’s central banking authority, defines CBDC as “the legal tender issued by a central bank in digital form.” However, it differs from the existing digital money in the country -a CBDC is the liability of the Reserve Bank, not of a commercial bank.</p><p>According to a brief press note made available by the Ministry of Finance on December 12th, 2022, the RBI has launched CBDC pilots in both the Wholesale and Retail segments.</p> Digital Rupee-Wholesale <p>Launched on November 1st, 2022, this segment of the CBDC pilot aims to facilitate settlements of secondary market transactions in government securities. The goal is to increase the efficiency of the interbank market.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/financial_index/status/1587421636160110592?s=20&amp;t=0iLz4m_thySj3Gf5lJOg5Q">Image Source</a>)<p>The authorities believe that settlement in central bank money would reduce transaction costs. It would be better positioned to pre-empt the need for settlement guarantee infrastructure or collateral to mitigate settlement risk.</p> Digital Rupee — Retail <p>Launched a month later, the retail version comes in the form of a digital token, representing legal tender. The issue denominations of these tokens remain the same as the paper currency and coins. Financial intermediaries, such as banks, can distribute it. The user must have a digital wallet issued by the respective bank.</p><p>In the Digital Rupee-Retail pilot project, transactions can happen the same way as the legal tender: person to person (P2P) and Person to Merchant (P2M). It will come with other legacy tender qualities/advantages relating to trust, safety, and settlement finality. Although it will not be eligible to earn interest, one can convert it to bank deposits or other forms of&nbsp;money.</p> The Pilot&nbsp;Project <p>The Digital Rupee — Retail project started with a closed user group (CUG) as its first set of participating customers and merchants. RBI has named eight banks for phase-wise participation in the retail pilot&nbsp;project.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/Vaibhav96280340/status/1598310672420732928?s=20&amp;t=0iLz4m_thySj3Gf5lJOg5Q">Image Source</a>)<p>These banks include the State Bank of India, the ICICI Bank, the Yes Bank, and the IDFC bank in the first phase and the Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, the HDFC Bank, and the Kotak Mahindra Bank in the second&nbsp;one.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/china-leads-the-digital-currency-future">China Leads the Digital Currency&nbsp;Future</a></p><p>According to mid-January reports compiled by the Indian State-owned banks, trades worth INR7,140 Crores (more than US$850 million) were settled in November 2022&nbsp;alone.</p> The Vision Behind India’s CBDC&nbsp;Project <p>The Reserve Bank of India, while preparing the concept note on its CBDC project, looked carefully at use cases available globally to understand the benefits of a digital currency.</p><p>For instance, the RBI considered CBDCs as a means to restrict the excessive physical movement of cash and as a better option to private virtual currency.</p><p>The RBI believes the CBDC could be a preferred financial instrument for many in the country. It has an Index for measuring people’s inclination towards digital payments, active since 2018, known as the RBI-DPI&nbsp;index.</p><p>The RBI-DPI index, which had a value of 100 in March 2018, increased to 349.30 in March 2022, a growth of almost 3.5 times in four years. This indicates that people’s growing interest in making digital payments was a reason for the RBI to launch its CBDC&nbsp;pilot.</p> The Future of India’s CBDC&nbsp;Program <p>While experts see user behavior as the key to the CBDC program’s success, there is a lot that the country can do to ramp up adoption.</p><p>In a country like India, where a significant number of the population lives in rural areas, creating awareness about the benefits of CBDC should be crucial. The rural payment infrastructure must also support sound and speedy internet networks.</p><p>The CBDC, wholesale or retail, must fulfill some unique user needs that legacy currency can not fulfill. Those who have already adopted it must be equipped with offline payment facilities and should not worry about their data being breached.</p><p>Only time will tell whether these efforts will lead to a paced-up adoption.</p> India &amp; Cryptocurrencies <p>On the crypto front, at one point, India was among the top five countries in terms of adoption. However, several anti-crypto measures, including a 30% tax on crypto profits, no way to offset losses from one cryptocurrency to another, and 1% GST on each crypto transaction, dealt a massive blow to the local crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Recently, the RBI governor called cryptocurrencies akin to gambling, which shows that the Central Bank is against the proliferation of private digital assets in the country. It also believes the growing use of cryptocurrencies can lead to the dollarization of the economy and has urged the Indian government to ban&nbsp;them.</p><p>So far, the government hasn’t banned crypto or regulated them despite introducing a bill for a potential ban on private virtual currencies in 2021. However, the bill was never taken up for&nbsp;debate.</p><p>What must be the reason behind the sudden change of heart? After studying cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology, the government realized that the borderless nature of digital assets requires global cooperation to enforce a ban or even regulate them under any specific framework.</p><p>Finally, with India taking over the G20 presidency, the country saw an opportunity to initiate a global discussion on crypto regulations and build a consensus.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Dr Mark van Rijmenam, Founder and Future Tech Strategist at The Digital Futures Institute. 
<p>Dr Mark van Rijmenam joins Oscar to discuss the importance of Self-Sovereign Identity in the Open Metaverse – including his definition of metaverse, derived from his interviews with entrepreneurs for his latest book, the motivations for entrepreneurs to be building assets in the metaverse, the role of identity and its importance in the open metaverse.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>

<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us to this first episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity in this New Year, 2023. And we want to start hearing very futuristic things about a future, very futuristic. We have a really amazing guest to start this year. Let me introduce you, Dr Mark van Rijmenam. He is the digital speaker, he is a leading strategic futurist who thinks about how emerging technologies change organisations, society and the metaverse.</p>
<p>He is the founder of the Digital Futures Institute with a mission to ensure a thriving digital future for businesses and society. Van Rijmenam is an international keynote speaker. He is five times author, and his latest book is Future Visions, which was written in five days in collaboration with artificial intelligence. I definitely want to hear more about that. Hey, Mark, welcome.</p>
<p>Dr Mark van Rijmenam: Thank you very much Oscar for having me on the show. It’s great to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, definitely our pleasure. Well, happy New Year.</p>
<p>Mark: Happy New Year to you, too.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, we are still in the beginning of 2023.</p>
<p>Please tell us about yourself and how – what was your journey to this world of identity, metaverse and everything that you are doing today.</p>
<p>Mark: I’m sure it sounds good. Well, obviously you already gave a very nice introduction, but I’ll add some things to it. So, I’ve been a keynote speaker for over a decade. I am a strategic futurist, so it means I really think about emerging technologies, and I try to understand what these technologies, these emerging cutting-edge technologies mean for you and me, for organisations, for society, and how we can benefit from them.</p>
<p>Because these technologies are constantly evolving. So, I’ve been doing this for over a decade. I’ve been speaking all around the world about that. I’ve been, as you said, five books. And I really try to always practise what I preach. And so that means that I – when the pandemic hit, I created myself an avatar, created myself as a hologram to deliver keynotes as such.</p>
<p>I’m currently working on building a digital twin of myself to understand – what are the consequences of creating a digital twin of yourself? A synthetic human, so to say. And how does it influence whatever we do? And I am very much involved in, you know, big data blockchain, artificial intelligence and the convergence of these technologies, which we are all coming together in the metaverse of, which was my fourth book, <a href="https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/book-step-into-the-metaverse/">Step into the Metaverse</a>, where a big part of that is also focused on identity. Because I believe that the metaverse will unleash a sort of a Cambrian explosion of identity, and it’s very important how to deal with that.</p>
<p>I’ve also been involved in a start-up, which unfortunately failed, but that’s the start-up life. Focused on identity, focused on fighting misinformation with reputation-based system. It’s very challenging to do anything in this space because we are very much used to a certain identity system that we have in our society. And shifting that is quite challenging, but I’m sure we’ll get to that during this episode.</p>
<p>So yes, that’s basically what I do. And yeah, indeed, my latest book, <a href="https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/book-future-visions/">Future Visions</a>, written, edited and designed by AI, I’m sure some of you have heard of ChatGPT, which is taking internet by storm. And the moment it arrived, I thought, I’m going to grasp this opportunity to write a book with it.</p>
<p>So, I literally wrote it in five days, and I didn’t change a word. I didn’t – I maybe like five or ten words that I changed myself, but the rest is exactly written by AI. And it was an experiment for me to understand what is possible with off the shelf technology, and it’s quite surprising how good it is, but also how not good it is. It’s not the Holy Grail. It’s fantastic technology, but there are definitely some caveats. And it was a fantastic experience to do.</p>
<p>Oscar: That, that sounds very interesting. So, you wrote a full book just using the ChatGPT that many people are talking about these days for the last, at least, last two months, I would say – quite a lot about that. And yes, super interesting journey you have had.</p>
<p>One of the last things you said is about the misinformation that – every time I hear that word like, we really have to do more about that – and it’s not easy, right? It’s definitely not easy.</p>
<p>That will come also on the metaverse, which is actually the main thing we’d like to discuss with you. So, it’s skimming through the pages of your last, second book, Step into the Metaverse, How the Immersive Internet Will Unlock a Trillion Dollar Social Economy. So, I read part of your book it is very interesting, so let’s go into that – to start with a common idea – please, could you give me your definition of metaverse?</p>
<p>Mark: Yes. That’s a very good point to start because the metaverse is a very, very abstract concept which many people have different perspective of what it actually is. And for the book I did about 100 in-depth interviews with the stakeholders who are building the metaverse. I did about 150 surveys, and interestingly enough, I got like almost 250 different definitions of what the metaverse is, which sort of shows you how difficult of a concept it is.</p>
<p>I sort of derive my own definition from this, and to me, the metaverse is the next iteration of the internet, it’s where the physical and the digital world are converging. And where the physical moving to the digital the digital moves into the physical. Now, that’s a lot of information there. And so, we can briefly unpack it a little bit.</p>
<p>So, if we start with the first one, you had a physical move into the digital. Basically, this conversation that we have, you could argue, is part of a very, very early phase of the metaverse because you are physically in Finland. I’m physically in Australia and we are digitally connected through our computers, and we have this conversation. It’s a 2D connection. So yes, our screens are 2D. These are not immersive.</p>
<p>But you could argue this is part of the metaverse. Other parts of the metaverse are, which I think are very, very important, is, for example, digital twins now. Where we create a digital replica of a physical asset that we can interact with in the digital world and we can just monitor it, or we can actually interact with it and then any changes that we make in the digital world, we will have an effect in the physical world. And that’s also part of the metaverse. And often people think that virtual reality is the most important part of the metaverse, but to me it’s only one channel to access the metaverse in an immersive way.</p>
<p>The other part, the other channel so to say, is augmented reality, where basically which means that we bring the digital into the physical world. I think that part is going to be much more important and much bigger because it allows us basically to create like infinite layers on top of reality. And this layer can be for entertainment, so you can have a flying purple dragon above the Opera House here in Australia, or you can use it to understand when you’re driving to have, augmented reality where there’s a parking space available or whatever you can come up with. And I think that’s also a very, very important part of the metaverse.</p>
<p>I think in the next decade or so we will see that computers will disappear, smartphones will disappear, tablets will disappear. They will all be replaced by headsets at first, augmented reality headsets I think, they will become a miniaturised, very sleek glasses that you can wear. And you don’t need a laptop anymore, you don’t need a smartphone anymore because you have it all in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>So, the metaverse is the immersive internet, and this internet will become as pervasive as the air we breathe. And it will mean it will move from making a conscious decision to go on the internet – so, if you want to go on the internet today, you have to grab your phone and start doing something. And it will switch to being “in” the internet. So being fully immersed and being part of the internet. By the internet being as pervasive to the air we breathe or energy that we use. This internet will be 3D, and that’s much more in line with what we humans are used to because we are 3D humans.</p>
<p>So, we thrive in a 3D environment much more so than a 2D environment. So that’s sort of what’s going to happen. There’s a lot of information, but in short, it’s where the physical and the digital world are converging, creating this immersive 3D internet that we can connect with and can be part of.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, you said that for writing this book on the metaverse. You have interview at least 100 of entrepreneurs who are building some their metaverse versions or some product related to the metaverse. So, I like to know from those conversations that you have had – so what has been their main motivation, why they are spending their time building those and not something else. So, what are, let’s say, the main motivation did you find in common amongst these entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, I think it’s a very good question. And I think what I noticed is that everyone that I spoke to, understands that the metaverse is the next iteration of the internet. It is the future. Whether we want it or not, whether we believe in it or not, it will define the next ten, 20, 30 years, if not more.</p>
<p>And so, any smart entrepreneur should dive headfirst into that because if you would have done that in the 1990’s, you would have been, you know, had a good chance to be the next Amazon. And that’s what I think is happening here because first we had one, then we had like sort of the mobile app with the launch of the iPhone. We had the social web, with the launch of all the social media platforms and now we move to the immersion web.</p>
<p>So, there’s a ton of work to be done. There’s a ton of money to be made because, you know, several banks and a major strategy consultants say that by 2030, the metaverse will drive between 5 and 13 trillion dollars for the global economy.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it’s going to be a lot more, simply by looking at the impact that the internet had already on our society. So, it makes just good business sense to dive into the metaverse to see what you can contribute to this next iteration of the internet.</p>
<p>Besides, firstly, I think that the metaverse is a fascinating environment to work in, because it’s all novel, it’s all magical, it’s all – all the things that can become true in the metaverse. There are no laws of physics in the metaverse, so you’re not – we don’t have any restrictions on what we can build in the metaverse. And I think we can create this magical world, this magical virtual world, with these magical augmented digital experiences that are not possible in the physical world. And I personally find it fascinating.</p>
<p>So, I really enjoy being part of that. And I think over time when – the more we step into the metaverse, because mind you, the metaverse is still a few years out. The more a society steps into the metaverse, the more people will experience this magic as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: So different motivation. It sounds to me – it’s most like, I know there will be this new paradigm so that the technology is coming anyway. It sounds like that, and the entrepreneurs have to be there. Sounds like those are the main motivations.</p>
<p>Mark: Yeah, I want to add one to that because it’s – so my book has been, I’ve meant it as a blueprint for an open metaverse. And an open metaverse is really focused on – how can we create a metaverse that’s there for us, for you and me, consumers. And that’s owned and controlled by us and not necessarily controlled by big tech or very, very tiny elite who controls whatever we do online, which currently the current internet is like that.</p>
<p>We don’t control our own data; we don’t control our own digital identity. The internet is basically controlled by a handful of very, very powerful, very big technology companies. Now, with the metaverse, with the amount of data that you create in this immersive internet, which will be 100 times more than we do today, if not even more. I think it’s crucial that we own and control our own data, that we control our own digital assets, and that we control our own identity and reputation. Because we don’t want to live in a world where the Zuckerberg’s of this world can decide whether or not you have access to this immersive internet or not. And I think that’s something really, really important.</p>
<p>Of course, we have to build it in the correct way, because you know, with building something decentralised also come a lot of challenges. But that’s what I did for the book and most people that I spoke to, they tried to do that as well. So, for a lot of people that I spoke to, they’re driven by this quest of building an open metaverse that’s there for us. And to change the paradigm from a centralised internet to a decentralised.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, that’s something I read in your book, the concept of the Open Metaverse. So, it’s great that many of these entrepreneurs have that in mind. So, something else that you just mentioned is – it’s about, of course, identity. Again, thinking of the companies who are now building the metaverse. How in top of the mind is digital identity? So, it’s a component that they are thinking every day, like yes, this is part of metaverse or something that is neglected? So, what would you say?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, I think that the digital identity is a very, very important part of the metaverse. And it was also confirmed, to the very people that I talk to. Simply because, as I mentioned in the start in the metaverse, we can be whomever we want to be, whether that is, I don’t know, a flying dragon, whether that is a walking piano, whether that’s a talking mushroom, it really doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>You can literally be whoever you want to be. And identity in the metaverse is really, really important, much more important than we think today. And if we ask Generation Z, those born after 95 or Generation Alpha, those born after 2010 to them, and this has been done to them, their digital identity is as or even more important than their physical identity.</p>
<p>Let that sink in a bit because that’s the paradigm shift. Your digital identity being more important than your physical identity, completely shift of mind and mindset. And therefore, we see that in the metaverse, digital fashion is really important because just like in a physical world, you want to dress a certain way to showcase who you are, to display your identity. You also want to do that in the metaverse. So digital fashion is a multibillion industry of for people to do that.</p>
<p>Now, what research also has shown is that the moment people can be whoever they want to be in the metaverse, they start experimenting with their identity. And there’s research that people switch gender just to understand what that means. There’s also research which showed that if you are an introvert person in the physical world and you use an extrovert character in the metaverse or in virtual reality, and you play with that character for a couple of hours. Then you will continue to display those extrovert characteristics in the physical world afterwards. Fascinating I think, how that works the digital, our digital identity can affect our physical identity.</p>
<p>So now, of course I think when we talk about identity in the metaverse, we also have to think about the challenges that come with it. Because if you can be walking a piano for that matter, how do I know that that walking piano is Oscar, you know, how do I know that? How can I be certain that I’m not dealing with this with someone else who has stolen your identity?</p>
<p>So digital identity or in this case I would argue Self-Sovereign Identity is very, very crucial for a metaverse, especially in open metaverse. Less so a closed metaverse, which is controlled by companies because they can do your identity check and they can verify that you are a real person. Your identity can still be hacked and be stolen, but that it’s more easy to control it.</p>
<p>That’s also has problems to it. In an open metaverse self-sovereign identity is really, really important because it allows us to control who has access to our data, for how long, to which data, and have full control over assets and our identity. So, I think if we think that identity is important on the current web, we have to think twice because it will be a lot more important in the metaverse. And for many millions of kids and teenagers that digital identity is already more important than the physical identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, that thing that you just said for a second time. It’s very, very important to think about because we need to protect those identities. Because the big bunch of the people who are going to be in when metaverse is more ubiquitous, as we call it, in the next 10/ 20 years. Will be using heavily, and we have to protect those, those identities.</p>
<p>Another thing you mentioned is if you have some of these, what example? Like a flying dragon, for instance, Oscar is a Flying Dragon in some metaverse. Right? So, people who are inside a metaverse will see the Flying Dragon, my name, maybe. But how do I enter to this metaverse? So that’s a point that many people don’t think right? I should have been, call it, logged in or authenticated properly in order to enter to that that metaverse.</p>
<p>Mark: Well, that’s a major technical and cultural challenge that you just mentioned, because what we don’t want is that if I go to Fortnite and into Roblox, into Decentraland and into the sandbox and to whatever other virtual world. That I every time I have to recreate my flying dragon, every time I have to create a new account, just like we do in the real world, actually.</p>
<p>So that’s not what we want to happen. Now in order to achieve that, we need interoperability. So, you need to be able to have an identity that you can take to a place just like you take your identity to a pub or a restaurant or club or whatever, in the physical world. So, we need to have that same approach.</p>
<p>But there are some companies are working on this. Ready Player Me is a company that’s building an avatar tool so that you can create your avatar ones and then you can use that avatar in over a few thousand platforms already. So that’s a start. It’s a centralised company’s nothing self-sovereign identity with it, is nothing blockchain, nothing decentralised. So, you actually don’t control your identity, but at least it’s the first step that you create one account to do this.</p>
<p>But we already have that in the 2D world, which is called a Facebook login in or a Google login, you know. Login with Google account, login with your Facebook account, which by the way, I would recommend not to do. Because yes, it is easy, but it also means that your data goes to Facebook, goes to Google, and they have even more access into what you are doing. So please don’t do that. I know it’s easy, but just don’t do it.</p>
<p>And so from that perspective, your identity is really important and we need to be able to build this interoperability so that you can take your avatar, your identity, that you create – yours, your flying purple dragon that you’ve created to all these different platforms and all these different platforms have different graphical requirements, different computational requirements, which makes it really, really challenging to do that.</p>
<p>You know, if you go to platform A, it might be hyper realistic and your dragon looks really, really hyper realistic, but then you go to a platform like Minecraft or Roblox is very, very blocky, and how do you adapt that? How do you have that one identity work in both worlds? That’s a massive technical challenge, that’s definitely not solved yet and that does require probably quite a bit of work to achieve that. But yes, what we need to have is interoperability, that you can take your avatar, you can take your flying dragon, and you can fly from one world to the other.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, exactly. Now mentioned flying from one world to the other. How open these companies, like Fortnight, say Disney or whichever is the other, Minecraft, no? Are they open to that interoperability? What do you feel that they’re open, to have that? Would they prefer to have it closed?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, most likely they will prefer to have it closed, which I think is a very short-sighted approach. Yes, having a closed network offers you a lot of value. We can only have to look at a mobile, a mobile messaging. WhatsApp was sold for $19 billion in 2014 for a reason because it’s a closed network and you can’t send a WhatsApp message to your signal or to your telegram.</p>
<p>In Europe, that’s going to change with the new laws. Investor rule probably not. So, we are very much used to not having this interoperability because for such large companies it offers a lot of value. If we do have that interoperability for society, it brings a lot of value.</p>
<p>We only have to look at email, we are able to send an email from a Gmail account to a Hotmail account. Imagine that would not be possible or imagine that we, we don’t have interoperability for websites that you can only build a website for, I don’t know, Chrome and then you have to build a completely new website for Internet Explorer, and you can’t just switch between. Imagine what that would mean for the world, it would just ruin the internet.</p>
<p>And email is so successful because I can use Gmail, you can use Hotmail and we can communicate. So, I think it’s very short-sighted for these companies – I understand why they think like that, but I think it’s very short sighted and very selfish almost, to work on value extraction instead of value creation for society.</p>
<p>So, interoperability will add a lot more value to all these platforms. If you really make it easy and make it nice and easy for people to come and also leave, you will see that if you offer the best product, the best service then people will still come, and you will still make money. It’s a different approach, it’s approach from a short-term share approach to a long-term societal stakeholder approach.</p>
<p>And I think as a society, we need to make that shift from a short term to long term. And I argue and I call every organisation to, to make that shift. However, I’m also a realist and I know that that’s not very likely and that most likely regulation will have to step in to force these people because they probably will not do it by themselves.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. I couldn’t agree more with this point about that, and I hope they are listening to. They are listening to Mark and everyone else who is.</p>
<p>Mark: I hope so too.</p>
<p>Oscar: You already mentioned self-sovereign identity. Would you say that this is going to be the dominant paradigm in the metaverse?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, I hope so and I think it should be, because it’s a way that we control who has access to our data. And the best example here is, of course, if I go to pub and I need to show that I’m over 18 currently in the world, I have to show my driver’s licence. On my driver’s licence there’s a ton of information that’s not relevant for the question. Are you over 18, yes, or no? Which is a, just a very simple question and a self-sovereign identity allows, would allow us to answer that question, that we can trust, without providing all that information. And I think as a society, I think we should want it.</p>
<p>We should be able to live in a world where we are not controlled by a centralised entity because generally centralised entities, they corrupt or they get if they become too powerful – in terms of countries, democracies change to non-democracies. So, I don’t think that’s the right direction. So, for me, for a humanity perspective, I think a self-sovereign identity is the best approach.</p>
<p>Now obviously there’s also a lot of challenges to it because if you own and control your own digital identity and it works with the private key and public key, and your private key is 128 bits, whatever, or even ideally more whatever. And you’re going to lose this long string of numbers because people lose passports and smartphones all the time. How are we going to deal with that?</p>
<p>That question hasn’t been answered yet and people will lose their private key. And if your self-sovereign identity is everything that you do and you lose it, then you are in really, really deep trouble. So, we need to solve that.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been solved and we need to – because it’s almost an oxymoron. You know, I am I going to store my private key with a centralised entity. So, then your private key is, you know, your self-sovereign identity is no longer self-sovereign.</p>
<p>And we saw that with that with the collapse of the various crypto exchanges, if you don’t own your private keys, the money is not really yours. Because it can just disappear. And so, this is self-sovereign identity, very, very important. It hasn’t been cracked yet and there’s still quite some technical challenges that we need to resolve here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I believe so. It’s super important to solve that problem. Absolutely. We’ve been talking about – you illustrate very nicely all these scenarios mostly for individuals, I would say. But if we now focus our attention a bit more into businesses, even government, for instance, organisations just in general. So, what are the opportunities or some scenario you can see the metaverse for, yes, for organisations and businesses?</p>
<p>Mark: Well as I mentioned earlier, you know, the metaverse will contribute trillions and trillions of dollars to the global economy. So, there are enormous amount of possibilities.</p>
<p>There are possibilities for consumer B2C, digital fashion, multibillion dollar industry, entertainment, immersive sports, watching sports or using augmented reality to bring a TV show into your living room. Well, Disney recently released a sample of that, which looks amazing. Education, you know, if you can learn something, immersive world, if you can walk around Rome for your history classes and pause whatever is happening to have a discussion with your teacher, that, of course, is a lot more powerful, but also from an enterprise perspective, you know, if I am able to collaborate in a virtual world, in a world that works, in a 3D world that’s a lot more intuitive and much, much more logical for us humans to operate in.</p>
<p>And that will have a big, big impact. Early last year in 2022, I was part of a training done by almost a dozen police forces around the world. And they were doing an exercise in the metaverse, in virtual reality and working with, you know, physical evidence and digital evidence. Everyone was in their own location in Singapore, in UAE, Bahrain, Senegal, France and several other countries.</p>
<p>And they were able to, to solve this scenario, which was a terrorist attack in a hypothetical country. And they all said afterwards that being able to collaborate in a virtual world is really nice and it’s really easy to get along with and also because there was no hierarchy, because all the avatars look the same that help the police forces are very hierarchical that, of course, and that really helped as well.</p>
<p>So, there are a lot of benefits to this. You also see it, for example, in design companies, car companies Volvo is doing a lot by using virtual reality or even mixed reality to design cars with remote teams. So, sort of building a claim model in a physical location, you build a digital model with your design team just living or working anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter where they are. All these things will have a big impact. And that will also have a big impact on society because, you know, if we think that the pandemic changed working from home, the metaverse will enable working from anywhere and where you can be literally anywhere you want in the world and eventually in early next decade, I have the feeling as if you are physically present in the office by but you are on a tropical paradise in the Pacific.</p>
<p>And that that’s something where we are going to still far, far away.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, from sounds nice. Final question, Mark, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Mark: Educate yourself and because the world is changing so fast at the moment, if you blink your eyes, you’ve missed a train. And we could have seen that. We did that with the AI, all the generative AI stuff that is happening at the moment, even for me. And it’s my job to be in to know what’s going on.</p>
<p>Even for me, it’s sometimes difficult to understand and to follow and to be up to date of what’s going on because the developments are going so fast. Now, if this is not your core job which for 99.99% of people, it isn’t. And it often ends up on a very long to do list at the bottom.</p>
<p>But you need to understand what’s happening and you need to understand ideally as an organisation, I would also start experimenting with this stuff, small experiments, just to understand what’s happening. And then you can, you can take it from there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. Excellent. And as you say, your, um, you do what you preach. So, like your last book, just in doing your due diligence, doing this kind of stuff. Yeah, I think I have to do some experiments like that myself.</p>
<p>Mark: Well 100%, and for me doing these experiments, they help me to understand, to better understand these technologies. And so, if you want to understand what technology, X, Y, Z means for your business, start experimenting with it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, thanks a lot Mark. What’s been really fascinating conversation, going for moments very deep into the digital identity, which is something that we are very passionate about, that. And you gave us really good ideas and updates what’s going on. But let us know if someone would like to follow the conversation with you or get more about what you’re doing. What are the best ways?</p>
<p>Mark: So, I’m pretty visible online, so the easiest ways to go to find me on my website, which is <a href="https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/">thedigitalspeaker.com</a>, you’ll find my books there, my academic papers, my videos, my articles. I have almost a thousand articles about these topics all available to consume, feel free to email me, connect with me on LinkedIn, on Twitter. I’m happy to connect with anyone.</p>

 A new paper describes harms rising from digital identity, and accountable responses for 2023.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a> <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/17/why-the-digital-identity-juggernaut-needs-safety-belts/">announced today</a> their “<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Overcoming-Human-Harm-Challenges-in-Digital-Identity-Ecosystems-V1.0-2022-11-16.pdf">Overcoming Human Harm Challenges in Digital Identity Ecosystems</a>” paper for review. <a href="http://linkedin.com/company/widerteam">Wider Team</a>’s <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/philwolff">Phil Wolff</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/come-to-the-edge/about/">Come To The Edge</a>’s <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nickyhickman">Nicky Hickman</a> wrote it with a large team of contributors including <a href="https://th.linkedin.com/in/pyrou-chung-4558b59b">Pyrou Chung</a> of the <a href="https://ewmi.org/">East-West Management Institute</a>.</p>



<p>Six cases track ways people have been hurt when digital identity ecosystems were abused, done poorly, or attacked. </p>



 
 People went hungry, broke, and even died because of digital identity failures.&nbsp; 



 Organizations wrote to the World Bank last year with ‘grave concerns’ about the Bank’s ID4D program and its “<a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/advocacy/4945/letter-global-csos-world-bank">potential for abuse and exploitation</a>.”&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/">Internet Safety Labs</a> lists more than <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/references/digital-harms-dictionary-2-0/">seventy specific ways harms happen in their Digital Harms Dictionary</a>. The sheer diversity of harms makes them harder to identify.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Many of these harms are preventable by standards&nbsp;bodies, developers, and makers of identity systems. Preventable by customers, the enterprises who configure, deploy, and use identity ecosystems. Preventable by public policy makers and the regulators who enforce them. </p>



<p>Despite human harms being preventable, few are doing anything about it.&nbsp;</p>



 So what?&nbsp; 



 
 The coming backlash may devastate open standards efforts. The identity community risks fallout as public cases of outrageous harm pile up. We all rely on vigorous open standards bodies.  



 Backlash hurts identity businesses. When biometrics and AI hit their trust and ethics crises a few years’ ago, they faced regulatory interventions, stalled sales, and investor skepticism.  



 Blamestorms hurt identity ecosystem cohesion. Media outrage blames the closest business or agency. A hospital gets blamed for a vendor’s patient data breach, for example. So shaming and blaming of any ecosystem member will tarnish the rest, and drive abandonment and defection from that ecosystem.  
 



<p> However…</p>



 
 Accountability mitigates backlash. The more we build accountability into ecosystem governance and technology, the smaller the backlash, hopefully.&nbsp;Accountability By Design could be our watchword.  



 Identity can use proven accountability tools and practices. Other technologies and industries dealt with their negative externalities. Drug tampering led to safety caps. Toxic food led to traceability through food supply chains. Racist AI led to ethical AI standards for training ML systems. Environmental pollution led to… well we’re still working on that. So, let’s adapt effective ideas and practices.&nbsp; 



 Next? What can identity technologists, industry, regulators, and standards groups do now? The paper lists low-hanging fruit and suggests first steps.&nbsp; 
 



 Preventable side effects offend me.&nbsp; 



<p>My head hurts over these six identity harms case studies, and the many we didn’t include in the paper. I can’t count the number of aspirational manifestos and value statements by folks who work on self-sovereign identity. We frame identity as a human right, a civil right, a duty of good government, a way to empower the excluded, the poor, and the dispossessed. We champion our digital identity technologies and governance in the name of serving humanity, and business progress, and enabling society, and healing our planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite our pure motives and hard work…&nbsp;</p>



<p>These new, richer identity tools can be abused just as much as old ones. It is human nature that every identification technology will be abused. My cynical take on human nature is grounded in history. </p>



<p>Today’s widely used digital identity tools suffer from cultural blindness and dissonance. <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Asia-Pacific">ToIP’s Asia Pacific Human Experience working group</a> shared stories where Western models of personhood, encoded in nearly all digital identity systems, exclude and distort how identity works for millions of people. The paper tells more about this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We looked at identity systems that enabled predators to hound a child to suicide. To facilitate gambling addiction. To leave a refugee in limbo. All without a responsible person to blame. Without even a single company or policy or technical artifact to blame.&nbsp;</p>



 These harms don’t arrive with accountability.&nbsp; 



<p>Digital identity systems are fundamentally “ecosystems.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are made from many parties, in a complex, diverse, fluid, multijurisdictional web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like cities, identity ecosystems are built up over time, with legacies of cultural assumption and prejudices, of old choices and narrow contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And those of us who have worked with trust frameworks, who bring identity ecosystems into being or refine them, we have not held ourselves morally at fault when they do harm. No more than those who make cars or airplanes or firearms are responsible when those goods result in injury and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You won’t trace those harms back to an open standard committee meeting or to an identity ecosystem rollout any more than you’d trace a spent bullet back to the factory operator that machined it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When chains of causality are hard to map, or are untraceable, the root causes of these harms are unaccountable.&nbsp;</p>



 Inciting action, building in accountability, will be difficult.&nbsp; 



 
 The identity technology community is in denial about downstream risks. Few in the identity professions and industries believe these human problems exist.&nbsp; 



 Untested business cases. Nobody believes this matters enough or matters to them personally or matters urgently.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Anecdotes, not statistics. These threats are mostly uncounted and unmeasured; a weakness in quantified policy and management circles.&nbsp; 



 No ownership. Nobody owns these problems outright. Neither the toolmakers nor any of an ecosystem’s parties own the side effects of a system’s broken trust.&nbsp; 



 Scopes of responsibility are too narrow. Our definitions of “ecosystem” leave out many kinds of people affected by the ecosystem, and harms inflicted on them. Although governance practices include responsibility to other members of an ecosystem, they rarely name negative externalities or speak to accountability for them.&nbsp; 



 Ethics are unevenly distributed. The abilities to discover harms swiftly, make sense of them, and respond well are unequal within an identity ecosystem. They will continue to be. Those who are most ready and able to respond are unlikely to be the only parties generating those harms. And some ecosystem parties will trigger harms emitted by others.&nbsp;“Ethics are unevenly distributed” seems like a universal law that begs for corollaries.  



 IAM industry consolidation reduces individual companies’ fear of side effects. <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/monopolies-and-cybersecurity-disasters">Thoma Bravo buying Forgerock, Ping,and Sailpoint</a> cuts the odds these issues make it to any of their executive OKRs.&nbsp; 
 



<p>This is blue ocean territory: I haven’t found anyone in our space investing to manage these business risks. No companies, government agencies, or NGOs are actively working on human harm reduction, response, or regulation. After my year on the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnYTXKD6yFkhcyE7JO6UawK9doE5AS3Xi">Human Experience Working Group</a>’s <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/SSI+Harms+%28BGBU%29+Task+Force">Harms Task Force</a>, I hope this paper helps folks understand the range of risks digital identity brings. And that we act now, in concert.&nbsp;</p>

  The People’s Republic of China has been into its CBDC project since 2014, with the trials starting in April&nbsp;2020.  Within two years of trial, the country witnessed CBDC transactions of more than 100 billion&nbsp;Yuan.  Experts believe the digital Yuan needs to grow in usability to become more&nbsp;popular.  <p>In a discussion paper released by the Asian Development Bank in February 2022, it came out in no ambiguous terms that the People’s Bank of China is developing a Central Bank Digital Currency, also called the digital Yuan&nbsp;(e-CNY).</p><p>By that time, the country had already witnessed the emergence of significant fintech players like the Ant Group and Tencent, which started with digital payments and eventually expanded into investment products and&nbsp;loans.</p><p>CBDC is one of the central topics of discussion during this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos. With more than 100 countries exploring CBDCs, it is vital to understand the motives and scope of their progress. Could CBDCs increase resilience towards global risks of high inflation, low growth, and the emergence of a high-debt economy, and what are the dynamics with regard to the crypto&nbsp;economy?</p><p>In this context, we take a closer look at China’s Digital Currency&nbsp;Project.</p><p>What is the genesis of the CBDC in China? How far has it come? What are some of the features that make China’s CBDC unique or&nbsp;special?</p> The Genesis of China’s&nbsp;CBDC <p>Four driving factors led to the People’s Bank of China thinking of introducing a digital Yuan (e-CNY), the digital version of the legacy Yuan, the digital RMB, or the digital Renminbi.</p><p>(i) Equip the population with a form of digital&nbsp;cash.</p><p>(ii) Make retail payment services efficient and safe while encouraging fair competition.</p><p>(iii) Make cross-border payments efficient.</p><p>(iv) Finally, in alignment with the philosophy of the ‘digital,’ the PBC believed it could positively impact financial inclusion, which is vital in such a highly populated country as&nbsp;China.</p><p>Whether the digital Yuan has lived up to its promises needs further scrutiny. Before that, let’s look into the time trajectory line.</p> The Evolution of the Digital&nbsp;Yuan <p>The People’s Republic of China started researching CBDCs in 2014 under the Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DC/EP) project. The on-ground development commenced in 2017. It was the time when the Digital Currency Research Institute also started functioning with Yao Qian as its director.</p><p>Multiple distribution and circulation decisions were adopted in the subsequent years. Then in 2018, the Deputy Governor of the PBC, Fan Yifei, declared centralizing the digital Yuan and adopting a two-tier distribution model.</p><p>The Governor of the PBC, Yi Gang, announced replacing a component of the country’s cash with the digital Yuan without affecting the country’s money supply wings such as bank deposits and private payment platforms.</p><p>The pilot program began in October 2020 in the four regions of Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chengdu, and&nbsp;Xi’an.</p> The success of the Digital Currency Pilot&nbsp;Program <p>The PBC gifted 10 million digital Yuan to 50,000 Shenzhen residents. They could spend these gifted currencies at more than 3,300 businesses. It took a week for the population of 50,000 people to spend 8.8 million digital Yuan in more than 62,000 transactions.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/business/status/1413046213360898049?s=20&amp;t=W2xmFy4El-b1iFgKmDROjA">Image Source</a>)<p>Did all these efforts lead to people proactively opting for CBDC? According to numbers gathered till 30th June 2021, Chinese people had opened nearly 21 million personal wallets and more than 3.5 million corporate wallets. Digital Yuan transactions went nearly up to 71 million, resulting in a value of almost 5 billion&nbsp;US$.</p> The Latest&nbsp;Numbers <p>It is still too early to judge whether CBDC has taken off the way it should have in China. However, there has been noticeable growth, with the total number of digital Yuan transactions hitting the number 360 million and the total transaction value crossing the mark of 100 billion Yuan by August 31st, 2022, close to 15 billion US$. In essence, digital Yuan transaction value took a little more than a year to grow three&nbsp;times.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/dhdeans/status/1608912310768107522?s=20&amp;t=W2xmFy4El-b1iFgKmDROjA">Image Source</a>)<p>Fifteen provinces and cities have come under the digital Yuan pilot program. The number of stores that accept digital Yuan payments in the country is around 6 million. According to the government, the pilots ran without any setbacks, covering a range of application scenarios in Wholesale, Retail, Catering, Travel, Education, Medical Care, and Public Services.</p> Bottlenecks and&nbsp;Concerns <p>A People’s Bank of China official recently stated that the growth in digital Yuan usage was “not ideal.” Xie Ping, a former director-general of research, spoke of a few reasons why the CBDC did not get as much success as it should&nbsp;have.</p><p>Xie believed that for digital currency to become successful, it must expand its usability. Having the digital Yuan only as a substitute for cash does not make it compelling enough for users to go beyond the traditional payment mechanisms of cash, bank cards, and third-party payment apps like&nbsp;Alipay.</p><p>Whether the Digital Yuan will go beyond being just a means of consumption is yet to be&nbsp;seen.</p> The Current Situation <p>Presently cryptocurrencies, considered hard to control, are banned in China while the country is doubling down on its digital currency.</p><p>Interestingly, NFTs, called digital collectibles within China, are seeing a surge in sales, recording almost <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=china+nft+sales+%22billion%22&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzWmXRki1DgmQdbOLrClmfXovkJouQ%3A1673973658511&amp;ei=ms_GY4_4Ht2Y4-EP4MWX0AQ&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPrZ3qhc_8AhVdzDgGHeDiBUoQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=china+nft+sales+%22billion%22&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCCEQoAEyCAghEBYQHhAdOgoIABBHENYEELADOgQIIxAnOgcIIRCgARAKSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUO8CWPgkYKwmaAJwAXgAgAG1AYgB6guSAQQwLjEwmAEAoAEByAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">$4.8 billion</a> in sales in 2022. The country is also launching a national NFT marketplace, which may contribute to higher growth. A strong indicator that the Government of China prefers digital assets it can&nbsp;control.</p><p>Recent reports also indicate that the Asian powerhouse may be treating Hong Kong as its playground, considering its <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/hong-kong-becoming-a-crypto-hub">recent affinity to digital assets</a>. If that is true, China may roll back its crypto ban in the future, but that may not happen anytime soon, as the country is pushing for higher usage of its digital&nbsp;yuan.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>We're kicking the New Year off with the release of Webnative SDK version 0.35!</p> An Introduction to Webnative <p>Here at Fission, we build identity, data, and compute protocols that empower developers to build decentralized edge apps without a complex back-end. We're actively working on a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">decentralized database</a> and <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-breaking-down-ipvm/">virtual machine</a>, and our solutions for decentralized identity and storage are available today in Webnative SDK. Our SDKs and protocols have been integrated into many edge apps, including <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/capyloon/">Capyloon</a>, <a href="https://web3.storage/">web3.storage</a>, and <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/noosphere-a-protocol-for-thought">Noosphere</a>. </p><p>The Webnative library provides:</p>
 
 User accounts using the browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">Web Crypto API</a> or a blockchain wallet using the Webnative <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/webnative-walletauth">WalletAuth</a> plugin 
 Authorization using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> 
 Encrypted file storage using the <a href="https://runfission.gitbook.io/latest/developers/webnative/file-system-wnfs">Webnative File System</a> backed by <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a> 
 Key management using the <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/awake">AWAKE</a> protocol to link devices 
 Platform APIs for publishing apps from the browser 
 
<p>Let's break each of these down.</p> User Accounts <p>Developers can choose whether they would like the browser or a blockchain wallet to store a user's encrypt and decrypt keys. The best choice depends on what kind of user experience the developer would like their users to have. For example, if they are building an app for a blockchain audience, using the blockchain wallet user account is likely the best option. </p><p>Our team is also currently working on a third user accounts option - passkey support. Passkeys are secured by the device's OS.</p> Authorization <p><a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> stands for User Controlled Authorization Network. UCANs are a way of doing authorization (“what you can do”) where users are fully in control.<br>There’s no all-powerful authorization server, or server of any kind required! Everything that a user is allowed to do is captured directly in a key or token, and can be sent to anyone that knows how to interpret this format.</p>The UCAN mascot Encrypted File Storage <p>The Webnative library provides developers the tools to make their edge apps work seamlessly offline while being encrypted at rest. We created an encrypted file storage system called <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/diving-deeper-webnative-file-system/">WNFS</a>, which is built on top of the <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> protocol and backed by <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a>, making it interoperable across the Web.</p>Winnie the WNFS mascot Key Management <p>Device-linking is a breeze with the <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/awake">AWAKE</a> protocol. AWAKE is an authenticated key exchange that provides a way to know something provable about what the other party can do, even if they have no sure way of knowing who the party is. To do this, the protocol leverages UCAN capabilities that don't require a root source of truth. </p>The AWAKE mascot Platform APIs  <p>As well as using the <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/developers/cli">Fission CLI</a> to register and publish apps, developers can create web apps that publish an app directly from the browser.</p> What's New <p>Webnative version 0.35 is a major rewrite to improve the reliability and extensibility of Webnative. Here are a few of the big changes:</p> Namespaced Apps <p>Webnative can now have many apps run on the same domain without any conflicts. Each app is namespaced by default and has its own accounts and WNFS. This should help developers when building apps on the same localhost port. </p> Customizable + Extensible <p>A new component system makes it possible for Webnative to run independent of Fission infrastructure. For example, you can use the web3.storage IPFS platform to host your encrypted data. This system also enables the webnative-walletauth plugin.</p> Increased Reliability <p>We've made improvements to the device-linking feature so it works smoothly across multiple browsers.</p> Temporary Filesystems <p>Multiple filesystems can be loaded at the same time now that conflicts with identifiers have been resolved in the latest version. This allows users to access a temporary filesystem until they are ready to create their own account. When the user ends their session, the developer can give them the option to either store their files locally or create a new account.</p> Next Steps <p>Learn all about the latest version of Webnative SDK by reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/webnative/blob/182a8157d1c0d3c30df7c349fe3c87a348057853/CHANGELOG.md#v0350">changelog</a> and <a href="https://runfission.gitbook.io/latest/developers/webnative">guide</a>.</p><p>Developers with existing Webnative apps will need to make some changes in order for their apps to be compatible with the latest version. Details on what needs to be updated are available on the <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative/migration#version-0.35.0">migration page</a>.</p><p><a href="https://fission.codes/blog/webnative-app-template/">Webnative App Template</a> is up to date and ready to use with version 0.35, so now is a great time to take Webnative SDK out for a test drive.<br></p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 9th January to 15th&nbsp;January <p>Here is another in-depth and amazing Veriscope Regulatory Recap! This week, while the Taiwanese and Hong Kong authorities insist on setting up a stringent operational framework for crypto assets, the U.S. Republicans are keen to use the 118th Congress effectively to create clarity in the industry. Let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Taiwanese Government Debates a new Crypto&nbsp;Act <p>Followed by the FTX debacle, the Taiwanese Government agencies have taken it upon themselves to decide whether there is a need for a special act to keep crypto trading under&nbsp;check.</p>(<a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-china-s-taiwan-strategy-signals-growing-resolve-to-unify-/6655068.html">Image Source</a>)<p>The country is still at an early stage with its intent to lay out regulations. According to the Financial Committee Chairman Huang Tien-Mu, Taiwan is yet to finalize how to classify digital assets and their legal characteristics.</p><p>As it has come out so far, the Taiwanese Government may ask banks for supervision or set up an autonomous crypto&nbsp;union.</p><p>Irrespective of the institution bestowed with the responsibility of regulating crypto, the task would be to protect consumer interests, safeguard data, and ensure fair&nbsp;trade.</p><p>The existing Money Laundering Control Act in Taiwan only looks at crypto trading platforms when they report transactions exceeding NT$500,000, nearly US$16,500.</p> Hong Kong SFC to Prepare an Allowlist of&nbsp;Crypto <p>In the latest regulatory step, the Hong Kong authorities insist on mandating which crypto assets its citizens can invest&nbsp;in.</p><p>To offer more detail, the Hong Kong Securities and Future Commission will develop a list of whitelisted crypto assets for retail traders based on their liquidity.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/EllianaHancock2/status/1614951258670129155?s=20&amp;t=7Au1ZJgI1rJgZoJnKJDqsA">Image Source</a>)<p>The regulatory drive, of which this list will be a component, would include new crypto exchange and VASP licensing protocols. Since this regulatory push aims to protect investors, the SFC will also conduct correspondence with the public on crypto trading regulations.</p><p>Hong Kong has reportedly suffered from stringent crypto regulations over the past couple of years, with investor sentiment towards a growth-potential market getting discouraged.</p> Republicans Eye Crypto&nbsp;Clarity <p>With the House of Representatives in their control, US Republicans have formed a unique digital assets-focused congressional group.</p><p>Congressman Patrick McHenry, the representative for North Carolina’s 10th congressional district, announced the subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/xiaomai76409159/status/1614886868746919937?s=20&amp;t=7Au1ZJgI1rJgZoJnKJDqsA">Image Source</a>)<p>Congressman French Hill, the US representative for Arkansas’s 2nd congressional district, will chair the subcommittee whose primary objectives would include creating rules for federal regulators looking after the digital asset ecosystem.</p><p>It will also help build policies to penetrate underserved communities through financial innovation. According to French Hill, the subcommittee’s responsibilities would include creating a safe ecosystem for FinTech innovation to thrive in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Many industry experts expect the Republicans to use the 118th congress effectively to create clarity about the digital asset class as many sector-specific regulations keep coming up, including the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation act and the Stablecoin Trust&nbsp;Act.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/hong-kong-becoming-a-crypto-hub">Hong Kong Becoming a Crypto&nbsp;Hub</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mandatory-licensing-for-crypto-businesses-in-france">Mandatory Licensing for Crypto Businesses in&nbsp;France</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-questions-micas-effectiveness">EU Questions MiCA’s Effectiveness</a></p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, the decentralized data exchange protocol that unlocks data for AI, is excited to announce the launch of DesightsAI, a web3 platform bootstrapped by the community and built on top of Ocean’s technology to crowdsource business solutions to toughest data and AI challenges.</p><p><a href="https://desights.ai/">DesightsAI</a> is built on the Web3 principles of self sovereignty over data where creators and contributors have complete control over their creations. For each submission to these challenges, DesightsAI uses Ocean’s technology to create a unique ownership in the form of ERC721 token and allows for a royalty structure to be added around that submission. This has the goal to allow all contributors to own and earn revenue from their creations without any middlemen.</p><p>Bruce Pon, Founder, Ocean Protocol, commented:</p><blockquote>The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-the-ocean-data-bounty-7eb1e3bf3c0a">Ocean Protocol data challenges</a> have been designed to help data owners discover contexts around their data, and turn ideas into a commercialisable reality. By leveraging the Ocean stack, DesightsAI strengthens our value proposition for data owners, whilst giving more control to data scientists so that everyone can be an active participant in the new Data&nbsp;Economy.</blockquote><p>Manan Patel, Founder, Desights&nbsp;added:</p><blockquote>We’re excited to play a leading role not only in furthering the growth of the Ocean ecosystem but also in creating an entire supply chain of datasets, models, and algorithms that will allow the best data scientists on the platform to thrive from the new data&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><p>DesightsAI starts as a data challenges platform but has an ambitious lineup of innovative tooling for data scientists in the roadmap. Its goal is to build a decentralized community of data scientists and like minded individuals that, together, can spin off innovative AI/ML concepts and take ideas from generation all the way to execution in just a few simple&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The platform launches today in closed Alpha, and kicks off the <a href="http://bit.ly/3w4Wt93">third round</a> of the Predict-ETH data challenge series. This data challenge will be available in early access mode to community members that have previously taken part in the&nbsp;program.</p><p>To claim and/or request access to DesightsAI please visit their discord&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/uBhKRmQ5H6">here</a>.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a New Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality data. Ocean’s intuitive marketplace technology allows data to be published, discovered, and consumed in a secure, privacy-preserving manner by giving power back to data owners, Ocean resolves the tradeoff between using private data and the risks of exposing&nbsp;it.</p><p>About DesightsAI</p><p><a href="https://desights.ai/">Desights</a> is a web3 platform to crowdsource solutions to toughtest Data and AI challenges. Organisations/DAOs can fund these challenges and invite brightest minds in the Data and AI industry to solve these challenges.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Customers need solutions, not SSI technology. We will struggle in fostering adoption if we try to sell SSI technology to end customers. We should rather focus on selling them solutions to business problems. For example, Slack sells productivity/collaboration tools to enterprises, not Internet technology or communication protocols. The same approach should be taken but us identity folks!</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Riley Hughes, we discuss,</p>
 
 
 Since we recorded the last episode (<a href="https://northernblock.io/building-digital-trust-ecosystems/">Episode 10</a>), how have the value propositions and adoption of SSI changed? 
 
 
 What are the different ways that SSI adoption is happening, and what ways are easier than others to push adoption? 
 
 
 <p>Taken from “Intro to IDtech: How Decentralized Identity Will be Adopted” (https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb)</p> 
 
 
 Do Enterprises see any incentive to issue digital credentials? 
 
 
 Why the term ‘Digital Wallet’ is a bad analogy for what they actually are, and why it’s not positioned well to be a solution to business problems? 
 
 
 Does Digital Identity still have an Identity problem? Why is terminology important to be used under the right contexts?

<p>2022 was a big year for us.</p><p>In this recap (not ReCap… read on to learn about ReCaps), we’ll share a non-exhaustive list of some of our accomplishments from the past year, starting with our company updates, then highlighting key development work across our open-source products and libraries. </p><p>As the builders of open-source software (essentially public goods), we have to toot our own horn a little bit.</p> Our Company <p>💡Fundraising</p><p>In April, we announced a $34M Series A round led by a16z crypto. This funding enables us to lead research efforts in cutting-edge privacy and usability technology for identity, while growing our product teams and executing partnerships across the Web3 ecosystem. You can learn more in our announcement <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-raises-34m-to-unbundle-the-login-for-a-user-controlled-web/">here</a>. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-raises-34m-to-unbundle-the-login-for-a-user-controlled-web/">  Spruce Raises $34M to Unbundle the Login for a User-Controlled Web  We’re excited to announce that we have raised $34 million in a Series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Spruce enables users to control their data across the web as the world becomes increasingly dependent on cryptography, networks, and digital economies.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>🌲Our Team</p><p>Our Spruce team grew in 2022, but we’re still small and mighty! Spruce is currently across three continents and eight countries. </p><p>Our team is globally distributed and remote-first. Rather than having a physical office, we gather in different locations twice per year for multi-day workshops and team events. </p><p>🎉Events and Hackathons</p>  We sponsored bounties at ETHDenver, ETHAmsterdam, and Graph Hack, working with developers to apply Sign-In with Ethereum to core workflows in hackathon projects.  We also sponsored the event dinners and were the Diversity &amp; Inclusion sponsor for the Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View, California.  We attended and spoke at various conferences around the world, including Devcon, Oktane, and more.  <p>🌍Standards and Working Groups</p><p>Spruce participates in various working groups and has implemented and architected various global emerging identity standards, such as W3C Verifiable Credentials, Sign-In with Ethereum, and more. Here are some highlights from our participation this year:</p>  We co-authored, built, and supported Sign-In with Ethereum (EIP-4361), which moved from “Draft” to “Review” in July on the Standards Track.  We authored and built additional specifications that extend Sign-In with Ethereum, with one being &nbsp;ReCaps (EIP-5573), enabling SIWE to include human-readable authorizations.  We participated in the <a href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/crossword-security-cyber2022.html">Jobs for the Future (JFF) Plugfest</a> to demonstrate the interworking of Verifiable Credentials with Decentralized Identifiers for learning and employment records (LERs) to be used for proving career qualifications.  We participated in the ISO/IEC 18013-5 mDL Interoperability Party in Brisbane to demonstrate interoperability with solutions from Microsoft, Ping, and Panasonic for online presentation of driver’s license data to websites in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.  We <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/casa-presentation-extending-sign-in-with-ethereum/">spoke about extending Sign-In with Ethereum</a> at the Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance (CASA) Gathering in April.  Spruce and TBD <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-and-tbd-demonstrate-decentralized-identity-interoperability/">demonstrated support</a> for all defined JWS algorithms for Data Integrity and JWT proofs for W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and W3C Verifiable Presentations (VPs), which is a significant step towards vendor interoperability.  We participated in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 Cards and security devices for personal identification in WG4 and WG10 as delegated experts from different national ISO bodies to work on the mobile driver's license (mDL) and, more generally, the mdoc (mobile ID) standards.  We participated as co-editor in the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group to work on the next version of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model &nbsp;(VCDM) standard.  We participated in the DIF JWT interoperability presentation profile initiative and demonstrated interoperability with MSFT, Avast, Workday, and IBM at the IIW demo table.  We participated in the OpenID Foundation AB/C WG as co-editor of the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP) and contributors to the OpenID for Credential Issuance (OpenID4CI) to help advance the specifications.  <p>As a company, our most important achievements this year were in the products and libraries we built and maintained, bringing us closer to a future where users control their identity and data across their digital interactions.</p> Our Open-Source Products <p>🏠SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything):</p><p>We <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">launched SSX</a> in November based on feedback from the community about their experiences installing Sign-In with Ethereum and additional capabilities they wanted. SSX will be the gateway to decentralized identity, combining our core libraries to power user control across the web. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">  Announcing SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything  We’re happy to announce the release of SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything - the easiest way to get started with decentralized identity and install Sign-In with Ethereum  SpruceSpruce    </a>  We made SSX the easiest way to install Sign-In with Ethereum and reduced the amount of code it takes by up to 80%.  We pioneered DAO login via a collaboration with the Safe team.  We added support for various frameworks to ensure as easy of a developer experience as possible.  <p>🚗Credible:</p><p>With Credible, we are <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">creating a solution</a> to provision mobile driver’s licenses to a smartphone application using ISO/IEC 18013-5, along with the W3C standards for Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, and OpenID for Verifiable Credentials to create secure, privacy-enhancing, and tamper evident identity solutions. We have exciting work underway that we will be able to share soon.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">  Credible: Introducing Mobile Driver’s Licenses  We believe that in the modern, technology-driven world, an ID will become much more composable than a piece of plastic that sits idly in your wallet. That’s why we’re excited to share a new solution we’ve been working on with early partners as a part of our new Credible Product Suite.  SpruceElissa Maercklein    </a> <br>Our Open-Source Libraries <p>🧱Sign-In with Ethereum:</p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  Built the <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/">Sign-In with Ethereum developer portal</a> with a quick start guide and installation instructions.  Released libraries for multiple languages, including <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-rs">Rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-go">Go</a>, and more, ensuring any developer can easily get started.  Released a <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth">Discourse plugin</a>, which enables any self-hosted Discourse forum to enable Sign-In with Ethereum.  <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/sign-in-with-ethereum-siwe-now-available-on-auth0/">Launched a SIWE integration</a> in the Auth0 (powered by Okta) marketplace, leveraging our OIDC Identity Provider Server.  Launched the first community-hosted OpenID Connect Identity Provider Server <a href="https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep10-executable-a-dao-governed-identity-server/11125">in collaboration with the ENS DAO</a>.  Specified ReCaps as an extension to SIWE as <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573">EIP-5573</a>.  SIWE received shout-outs from Vitalik, Bankless, and other thought leaders as a top trend to watch in 2023.  SIWE is currently used by or in the process of being incorporated by hundreds of projects and individual developers - with examples including Tally, Lens Protocol, Unlock, Boardroom, wagmi, WalletConnect, and many more.  <p>🧱DIDKit and ssi:</p><p>DIDKit is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Verifiable Credentials, W3C Decentralized Identifiers, and a variety of related data models and protocols.</p><p>DIDKit is in production use, powering credential workflows such as those found on <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin Passport</a>. We plan on continuing to enhance and refine DIDKit this year to make it even easier for a developer to get started using W3C Verifiable Credentials.</p>  We restructured our ssi library into constituent workspace crates to make it easier for developers to import and use.  We enabled the external signing of verifiable presentations in DIDKit-WASM and VP holder bindings.

  MiCA, the EU-wide regulation for crypto services, is expected to come into effect by&nbsp;2024.  While authorities believe the new regulations would help streamline crypto operations in the region, they also admit to loopholes in the proposed&nbsp;regime.  Regulators worry that the new framework would not suffice for non-EU interactions and will prove burdensome to a service provider’s operations from compliance and taxation perspectives.  <p>The crypto world has witnessed many downfalls in the recent past. Globally revered crypto exchange FTX, a pioneering exchange in many ways that had raised US$400 million at a valuation of <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ftx-crypto-implosion-sam-bankman-fried-loses-billions-sequoia-trillionaire-2022-11#:~:text=Less%20than%20a%20year%20ago,in%20a%20Super%20Bowl%20commercial.">US$32 billion</a> in January 2022, filed for bankruptcy in November.</p><p>Terra, a payments app in South Korea that rose to a US$60 billion crypto ecosystem, suffered phenomenal losses when its US$18 billion algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) depegged in May 2022. The terraUSD depeg event also impacted LUNA, the companion token of terraUSD, following terraUSD’s crash.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/travel-rule-will-be-mandatory-in-the-uk-by-23-september-2023">Travel Rule Will be Mandatory in the UK by 23 September 2023</a></p> EU Moves Forward With&nbsp;MiCA <p>Amid all of these events, the EU was deliberating on introducing a union-wise regulation. Set to come into effect in 2024, the Market in Crypto Assets Regulation, or MiCA, started as a collective initiative between three entities: the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of the European&nbsp;Union.</p>(<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593">The Directive</a>)<p>Hailed as the first comprehensive regulatory regime in the world with a specific focus on crypto assets across Europe, a continent responsible for 25% of the global crypto market, MiCA is expected to offer a regulatory framework to a host of crypto services. The regime will look into non-stablecoin and stablecoin offerings, publishing of transferable securities, authorization for crypto-asset services, and crypto-exchange dealings.</p><p>While the EU looks at MiCA as an effort to streamline the crypto industry, many policymakers, analysts, and experts are anxious about MiCA’s apparent effectiveness.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-european-unions-proposed-markets-in-crypto-assets-regulation-mica-law-is-far-from-perfect">The European Union’s Proposed “Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MICA)” Law is Far From&nbsp;Perfect</a></p> Impact and Blind&nbsp;Spots <p>The anticipation for MiCA is already tempered with much caution and anxiety. The Chair of the European Banking Authority, Jose Manuel Campa, has already admitted to blind spots in the package. For instance, the EU regulation will not be of much use if consumers opt for interactions with offshore crypto&nbsp;firms.</p><p>There’s also a concern about the lack of expertise among EU officials to ensure adequate compliance with MiCA’s provisions once it comes into&nbsp;effect.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/CoinsPaid_Media/status/1552907964666740737?s=20&amp;t=7hrA3HdLWblHTXNU-T8h2A">Image Source</a>)<p>Once MiCA gets introduced, only one country can authorize a crypto-services company to earn exposure throughout the bloc. It raises concerns, especially if a particular country’s national financial supervisory authority is not thorough with its scrutiny and follow-up. In this case, faults committed by one country’s authorities may adversely impact the entire&nbsp;union.</p><p>The impact of MiCA will also be felt by the taxation and transfer pricing mechanism existing across the union. Tax administrations in member countries will have to ramp up their operations to keep crypto asset service providers under check. The tax authorities will have to proactively assess the operating structure of these providers to gauge the potential impact of MiCA when implemented.</p><p>The process will be burdensome for service providers who are willing to comply. They might need to restructure their operations, identify value drivers afresh, characterize entities in the value chain from scratch, and take a fresh look at their intangible assets and intragroup transaction prices.</p><blockquote>Also, once the MiCA arrives, service providers must comply and seek authorization in accordance with the new regulations and laws in line with the guidance provided by <a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/crypto-asset-reporting-framework-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.htm">OECD&nbsp;CARF</a>.</blockquote><p>With all these doubts and concerns in place, it remains to be seen how effective a change MiCA brings to the existing&nbsp;system.</p><p>_________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>It’s 2023—do you know what your identity is doing? As the adoption of digital channels continues to be matched by corresponding levels of fraud, the ability to achieve digital identity verification will take on new urgency in the coming year. At least, let’s hope so.</p>
<p>According to Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, fraud costs consumers and businesses <a href="https://javelinstrategy.com/2022-Identity-fraud-scams-report">$52 billion per year</a> in just the US. Worldwide, the figure could be as high as <a href="https://martechseries.com/analytics/customer-identity-management/new-report-reveals-fraud-management-is-vital-to-the-business-strategy-of-most-organizations/">$5 trillion</a>. Account takeovers (ATOs) and account origination fraud increasingly play a role in these losses.</p>
<p>Thanks to never-ending credentials harvesting attacks and data breaches, fraudsters pilfered more than <a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/how-to-protect-consumers-from-account-takeover-fraud/">$11.4 billion</a> through ATOs last year, a 90% increase over 2020. When account hijackings lead to yet another breach, the average additional cost to US-based organizations now tops <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">$9.44 million per incident</a>, though it can go <a href="https://betanews.com/2022/02/21/the-most-expensive-data-breaches-of-the-2020s/">much higher</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, account origination fraud has emerged as a top attack vector. In these scams, fraudsters use stolen or synthetic identities to open new banking, credit card, or retail accounts. According to Forbes, that could spell <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2022/10/20/socure-report-examines-rise-of-synthetic-identity-fraud/?sh=6261d5295a34">$5 billion</a> in losses by 2024. With all of this in mind, here are six things to watch for in the year ahead.</p>
 1. US Regulators Require Tech Giants to Adopt Non-Proprietary Identities 
<p>With the Improving Digital Identity Act nearing passage and federal government agencies accelerating the transition to <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/800-63-3/">Kantara-certified</a> <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">certified biometrics</a>-certified digital identity verification systems, look for regulators to begin formalizing similar requirements for US businesses.</p>
<p>In 2023, measures will likely require US tech giants to adopt non-proprietary verified digital identities that protect against fraud and allow individual consumers to control what personal information they share with organizations they do business with online.</p>
<p>Modern digital identity technologies enable identity to be verified without storing that information centrally on servers belonging to companies like Google, Apple, Meta, or Amazon. This form of verified identity protects companies and consumers from fraud while safeguarding privacy and preventing personal information from getting hacked, sold, or shared.</p>
<p>While the GAMA companies may be first, such measures are likely to be extended to all consumer-facing businesses. It’s already the law for all companies doing business in California—effective January 1. Given that <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/ecommerce/2022/the-future-of-digital-identity-verification-driven-by-technology-shaped-by-regulators/">90% of US businesses</a> are unprepared for even that change, organizations are advised to begin evaluating technologies that accept distributed identifiers now.</p>
 2. VPNs Give Way to an Identity-based Perimeter for the Virtual Workforce 
<p>When the corporate “network” now extends to every employee’s bedroom, breakfast nook, or go-to coffee bar, relying on VPNs for perimeter security is like locking the back window while leaving the front door wide open. As recent cyberattacks on <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/uber-hack-mfa-cant-fix-the-problem-until-we-fix-mfa/">Uber</a> and others have demonstrated, VPNs are simply no match for compromised credentials.</p>
<p>Whether they’re to corporate systems, email accounts, or the VPN itself, the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/paypal-passwordless-authentication-apple/">2 billion login credentials</a> stolen in recent years mean threat actors have easy access to corporate secrets, data, and more. It doesn’t help that 64% of us use variations of the <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/03/08/exposed-data-trends/">same passwords</a> across multiple accounts—and often share them with colleagues.</p>
<p>Traditional forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) aren’t proving to be much of an obstacle either. As a result, look for next-gen MFA solutions to gain traction in the year ahead. Today’s <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/remote-workforce/">most robust offerings</a> use biometric markers tied to a registered smartphone to provide phishing-poof authentication impervious to account takeover.</p>
 3. 80% of Fortune 500 Greenlight Passwordless Projects 
<p>The same drivers behind the shift from relying solely on VPNs and traditional MFA will accelerate the push toward passwordless authentication projects in 2023. By year’s end, we predict 80% of Fortune 500 companies will have formalized and budgeted these projects, and 50% will implement it in at least two of the most commonly targeted systems—remote access and operating systems.</p>
<p>With passwordless authentication, corporate users can log in and access systems, resources, and applications without using passwords. Instead, they leverage another form of <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/4-ways-businesses-benefit-from-passwordless-authentication/436261">identity verification</a>. But not all paths to passwordless security are created equal.</p>
<p>Passwordless authentication can involve a one-time passcode (OTP), SMS confirmation, and a PIN. But while helpful, these can be easily <a href="https://www.securityinfowatch.com/cybersecurity/information-security/breach-detection/article/21229613/how-hackers-bypass-mfa-and-ways-to-stop-them">bypassed by hackers</a>. To be successful, organizations will need to deploy <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/passwordless-enterprise/">modern MFA technologies</a> that bridge <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/news-and-trends/how-biometric-solutions-are-shaping-workplace-security/380786">biometrics</a>, offline government-issued IDs, and device-based authentication to make it virtually impossible for systems or accounts to get hacked.</p>
 4. Transaction Signing Moves From NFTs, Crypto Exchanges to Banking 
<p>In the year ahead, transaction signing will expand from digital assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and crypto exchanges to traditional financial markets with major banks implementing the technology.</p>
<p>To those in the know, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/datadecisionmakers/secure-second-factor-authentication-for-custodial-wallets/">transaction signing</a> introduces an additional layer of security over common two-factor authentication methods by requiring users to key in details embedded in their transactions to generate a random one-time QR code that is then authenticated with an authenticator app. This helps prevent interception or modification to transaction details from malware or viruses employing “man-in-the-middle” schemes. While the friction this creates has slowed adoption, customer demand is building.</p>
<p>Organizations using <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-multi-factor-authentication/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Digi-mfa-sl-Ext&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkt6aBhDKARIsAAyeLJ1KVm2MVIwyql-Xwq-rmxozkhrmA_wfTEq72mbDzXitz0CA_hyHiJIaAiXzEALw_wcB">tamper-resistant forms of transaction signing</a> will have a competitive advantage. Investments in use cases like transaction signing of digital assets will eliminate fraudulent activities that have cost the cryptocurrency market <a href="https://finbold.com/study-crypto-hackers-stole-more-than-2-5-billion-over-three-quarters-in-2022/">$2.5 billion</a> during just the first three quarters of 2022, expanding its appeal to a wider array of high-value, high-risk transactions.</p>
 5. From Trust to Bust: Recession Brings New Boom in Fraud 
<p>The chances of an economic downturn in the next year now range between 60% and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-17/forecast-for-us-recession-within-year-hits-100-in-blow-to-biden">fait accompli</a>. If the economy does go south, there’s one thing you can bank on—a massive surge in fraud. The COVID pandemic was just the latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/hackers-posing-as-cdc-who-using-coronavirus-in-phishing-attacks">lure du jour</a> for fraudsters looking for a hook. But the most relevant historical precedent for online fraud dynamics would be the Great Recession that began in 2008.</p>
<p>At the time, Reuters reported the number of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-internet-idUSTRE52T6EL20090330">online fraud complaints</a> reported to the FBI jumped 33%–the first increase in three years. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2008/11/18/cybercrime-boom-fraud-tech-security-cx_ag_1119crime.html?sh=682b02522c43">Phishing emails doubled</a> from 400,000 to 800,000 a day between August and November. Meanwhile, financial services firms saw a surge in <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2535189/opinion--bust-out-schemes-are-a-fraud-designed-to-make-you-go-bust.html">bust-out scams</a> perpetrated by fraudsters armed with synthetic identity information. By 2014, <a href="https://www.fico.com/blogs/bad-debt-ruining-your-balance-sheet-look-bust-out-fraud">10% to 15% of all banks unsecured bad debt</a> was believed to stem from this fraud.</p>
<p>If similar dynamics play out now, the financial services industry’s shift from traditional forms of MFA to biometrics- and device-based authentication and distributed identity couldn’t come at a more pivotal moment.</p>
 6. The ‘Identity Score’ Gains Traction Over Conventional Credit Scores 
<p>As ownership and control of personal data starts to fall away from tech companies and credit bureaus, digital reputation—or our “identity score”—will be managed and nurtured by individual consumers. A likely scenario could be the ability to store personal information in a privacy-focused wallet or another decentralized verification mechanism.</p>
<p>Government identity documents, bank account relationships, and verifiable credentials or receipts that establish transaction and credit history will be held by the individual instead of a credit bureau or tech platform. When the individual opts to share this data, it can be scored without contributing any private user information or metadata to third-party providers. Or it can be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/08/30/digital-identities-will-change-the-nature-of-online-reputation/?sh=6740c174584a">time-based</a> and deleted after a predetermined period.</p>
<p>Beyond the aspect of personal control, reputation and risk established with this kind of digital <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">identity score</a> are verified to be accurate and up to date (as in real-time), unlike current credit bureau-based reputation systems. Exactly the kind of verification that will rank among digital identity’s primary benefits in 2023—and beyond.</p>

<p>(Re-posted from MetaMask original&nbsp;blog)</p><p>Snaps is the roadmap to making MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world. As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel Snaps being built&nbsp;today.</p> Web3Auth Snap <p>Snap Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/">https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/</a></p><p>Why did you build&nbsp;it?</p><p>At Web3Auth, we’ve always believed that multi-factor authentication is the best way to secure crypto assets, and is much better than seed phrases. When we saw at ETHBogota that the latest build of MetaMask Snaps allowed Snaps to provide external key management capabilities, we decided to challenge ourselves to integrate MPC tech into MetaMask at the Sozu House hackathon.</p><p>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</p>  Our goal was to allow a new user to login and set up 2FA to access their account in MetaMask. Subsequently, under the hood, whenever they try to sign a transaction, our MPC SDK does a threshold ECDSA signature. This is done by splitting a private key into two parts: a local share that’s stored in the snap and one that’s stored on a signing server. Over several communication rounds, the signing server and the snap should be able to jointly sign an Ethereum transaction and have it be confirmed on the Goerli network. Unlike seed phrases, this setup does not have a single point of failure that leads to irreversible loss of keys: if the user’s laptop is hacked, or if the signing server is hacked, the user does not lose their private&nbsp;key.  Like every other snap, our snap consists of two parts, the actual snap package, and a page that loads/interacts with the snap. Our ideal user flow was to keep all key management interactions within the Metamask extension’s UI, but due to limitations in permissions, we could not do that. Instead, the user authentication happens outside of the snap, and then once that is complete, we migrate the state into the snap. Subsequently, we hook into the RPC engine of Metamask and respond to transaction requests by using our MPC SDK and the migrated state in the snap to generate threshold ECDSA signatures on the transactions. Surprisingly, we were done with the state migration part within the first few hours of the hackathon and were just left with the signing functionality.  The rest of the process can be further split into two major&nbsp;tasks:  Repurposing existing Web3 providers with our MPC SDK to handle the incoming transaction requests  Getting the MPC SDKs running in the Metamask Snaps SES environment  If you’re familiar with how Metamask works, or how other wallets function, you’ll know that signing an Ethereum transaction requires much more work than just using a private key to sign a message. A lot of work goes into forming the message object that is to be signed. Each transaction follows a particular format that’s specific to each chain and transaction type, has legacy behaviors that need to be supported for backward compatibility, has to get information about the current gas prices, has to calculate the gas to be used / gas limits, and also has to track the account nonce, etc. Thankfully, most existing Web3 providers already do these things out of the box. However, in order to get our threshold signature library to work well with these SDKs we had to dig deep into every single module and replace the eth-sig-util library’s signing functions with our own threshold signature library signing functions, which took a significant amount of time. In addition, because our MPC SDK was chain-agnostic, and didn’t account for Ethereum-specific checks, we also had to reverse engineer and reimplement checks from the eth-sig-util libraries which we had replaced. For example, EIP-2 specifies that the s-value in an ECDSA signature must not be larger than n/2 + 1, where n is the order of the secp256k1 elliptic curve, in order to prevent transaction malleability attacks, which requires ECDSA signing libraries to do a “flip” of the signature if its s-value falls outside of this&nbsp;range.  Another challenge we faced was getting our MPC SDKs to run in the Metamask Snaps environment. Our MPC SDK uses wasm (compiled from rust) to run efficiently in the browser. Due to the multiple rounds of communication between the SDK and the signing server, it also uses Socket.IO to communicate to avoid the overhead of HTTP headers. While attempting to load our wasm code into the snap, we ran into some strange issues with mixed argument types in the wasm methods. Unfortunately, wasm debugging tools are still very lacking, with error messages being unhelpful and uninformative (eg. “Uncaught RuntimeError: unreachable”). In the end, we hacked our way around this limitation by accepting all mixed inputs arguments as strings, and parsing them as integers/byte arrays within the wasm code itself. Another problem we encountered was that socket.io did not work in the Metamask Snaps environment. Socket.IO is a separate library/specification built on top of normal WebSockets that handles things like connection upgrading, dropped connections, fallbacks to long polling, etc. which are very helpful when using WebSockets in production environments. Unfortunately, we could not get Socket.IO’s libraries to run in the Metamask Snap environment. As such, we had to fallback to normal WebSockets, and also rewrite the signing server to use default WebSockets instead of socket.io, and fallback to a polling strategy if the websocket had&nbsp;issues.  <p>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your&nbsp;team?</p><p>Zhen and I are the cofounders of Web3Auth, and our company specializes in providing intuitive, secure, and non-custodial key management solutions. We believe that good security must be easy to use and invisible, or it will not get adopted widely. That is why we are huge proponents of using multi-factor authentication for private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</p><p>We tried Metamask Snaps about a year ago, but unfortunately, it didn’t have the capabilities to allow us to extend the private key management functions within MetaMask back then. With the introduction of SIP-2 recently (thank you Olaf!), which allows snaps to extend MetaMask’s keyring, we’ve been very excited to see what’s possible! While building our snap, I also explored the SES system that MetaMask Snaps is based on, and I think it’s a very solid foundation for MetaMask to act as a platform for developers to add functionality through&nbsp;Snaps.</p><p>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other&nbsp;wallets?</p><p>The extensibility! I think MetaMask Snaps provides a secure interface for developers to experiment and augment MetaMask without compromising the security of the MetaMask extension itself. Unlike other types of projects, wallets require high standards of security, which means merging in new functionality from third-parties is always a long, arduous process of code review and audits, which stifles innovation. MetaMask Snaps allows the MetaMask team to continue building a secure product, while still allowing external developers to experiment and extend its functionality.</p><p>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your&nbsp;team?</p><p>I think Snaps is definitely the way forward, allowing people to build functionality while still keeping the base MetaMask extension secure. There are a few kinks now but improvements are coming every day but I think it’s very exciting&nbsp;overall.</p><p>What does Snaps mean to&nbsp;you?</p><p>I hope that adding multi-factor authentication capabilities to MetaMask through snaps helps the millions of mainstream users on MetaMask to more securely manage their accounts and prevents them from falling victim to scams and hacks. MFA is already doing this today for billions of Web2 users, and we want to bring those secure best practices to&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3&nbsp;space?</p><p>In general, I think Snaps represents a realistic way for MetaMask to open up its codebase for others to contribute to it without compromising security.</p><p>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask&nbsp;Snaps?</p><p>Just try it! It may seem a little new but it’s been very approachable so far and the support for it is great on the ConsenSys discord channel for Snaps. Lots of amazing devs are working on it and if you want to be part of the conversation in shaping Snaps, now is the time to be building on it and giving feedback!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-snap-integrating-multi-factor-authentication-into-metamask-4e57f07af77">Web3Auth MPC Snap: Integrating Multi-Factor Authentication Into MetaMask</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  In the grand picture of decentralized identity, the leger plays a relatively boring role; it’s an important role however, and we’ll discuss why.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>When exchanging verifiable credentials, there is information that needs to be known by all participants in the ecosystem or network; a distributed ledger, such as the Indicio Network,&nbsp; stores this information to facilitate verifiable interactions.</p>
<p>The following information — and only this information — is, typically, stored on the ledger:</p>
<p>DIDs for an Organization, Company, or Institution</p>
<p>A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is linked to public cryptographic keys and a service endpoint. These are used to verify credentials from a particular issuer; the endpoint allows you to communicate with that issuer.</p>
<p>Generally, public organization DIDs comprise Issuer DIDs, Verifier DIDs, and the DIDs of other well-known authorities.</p>
<p>Credential Schemas</p>
<p>A credential contains information and Schemas define the different fields containing that information. For example, if you look at a physical driver’s license, it will have sections for birth date, address, height, and weight. Each of these fields would be attributes within a Schema for a driver’s license verifiable credential.</p>
<p>TDLR: The Schema stores the definition for the attribute but not the specific values for the attribute.</p>
<p>Credential Definitions</p>
<p>These are specific to the use of the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/anoncreds">AnonCreds</a> credential format with <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>. Credential Definitions link a cryptographic key to each of the attributes in a Credential Schema. This allows a holder of a credential to share information in privacy-preserving ways, such as through selective disclosure (only a single attribute is shared) or a predicate proof (an attribute value can be numerically assessed without the actual value being disclosed, such as &gt;21 or &lt;21 for purchasing items that have legal age requirements).</p>
<p>Revocation Registry Accumulators&nbsp;</p>
<p>This provides a way of signaling which credentials are valid by keeping track of which credentials have been revoked and which have not been revoked. It is called an accumulator because the information on non-revoked and revoked credentials is compiled into an aggregate value without revealing the underlying information. As a consequence, the accumulator does not directly reveal the revocation status of any individual credential. Instead, this aggregate value is used by the credential holder to prove that their credential has not been revoked. This calculation is called a “proof of non-revocation.”</p>
<p>Put simply, the revocation registry accumulator is a way of proving your credential is valid.</p>
<p>What’s not on the ledger</p>
<p>Personally Identifying Information (PII)</p>
<p>No PII or personal data of any kind is recorded on the ledger.</p>
<p>Credential Issuance</p>
<p>No information about the issuance of any individual credential is recorded on the ledger.</p>
<p>The Verifiable Credential</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are not written to or stored on the ledger in any context.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful features of decentralized identity is that you can create an ecosystem of&nbsp; millions of people using millions of credentials with only three or four writes to the ledger: the credential type, the schema, the credential definition, the issuer DID, and the revocation registry</p>
<p>How do we ensure no personal identifying information ends up on the ledger?</p>
<p>Distributed ledger networks prescribe rules for who can write and what can be written (no PII!) to a ledger and these rules are enforceable through legal agreement. These governance rules typically require that writes to a ledger must be approved by a Transaction Endorser.</p>
<p>Seems complicated — why bother using a ledger?</p>
<p>The question “If you’re only going to write three-to-four things to a ledger, why have one at all?” comes up a lot. But these three-to-four things are critical to the way a decentralized ecosystem functions and as a consequence they need the following features provided by the ledger:</p>
 
 Immutability: The data cannot be changed—by anyone. Having the Schema change underneath a credential would cause chaos.
 
 Tamper resistance: The structure of a distributed ledger makes it very difficult for a malicious actor to break in and change material. For example, if you wanted to change the private key associated with a DID you would have to break into the ledgers of a significant number of network nodes, whereas in a centralized system, you would only need to compromise one database.
 
 High availability: A ledger is distributed across many nodes with each containing a copy of the ledger. If one node goes down for any reason, there are plenty of others to receive data from.
 
 Geopolitical and infrastructure diversity: By hosting the ledger on servers located in&nbsp; multiple geographic areas and by diverse organizations, network resilience to technical problems is maximized—data is capable of being written and read even if multiple nodes succumb to problems. 
 
<p>It is technically possible to run a decentralized ecosystem without a ledger. It is possible to achieve immutability and tamper resistance by using some other technology. But as of now, the technology required to provide those features is extensive and will often come to resemble a ledger anyway. With a few exceptions, it turns out that an existing, purpose built ledger is actually the perfect tool to support decentralized identity ecosystems.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with Jay Baskar. Jay is a director of our solutions engineering. I’ve invited Jay to talk about deploying Passwordless authentication across the diverse IT environment. Jay, you’re joining us from Pune, India this morning, so thank you very much for taking time.</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Thank you. Thanks for having me. Yeah.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Yeah. So can you talk a little bit about the enterprise environment today and some of the challenges in deploying Passwordless solutions? Are there gaps in this approach?</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Absolutely. So when you take large organizations, these mega organizations. So there are a lot of solutions that are in play. So you have solutions that take care of how the identity starts. So you have the provisioning platforms that create identities or it takes the identity through its lifecycle. And you have governance platforms, you have authentication platforms, authorization platforms. So there are many, many solutions that are in play. And we need to make sure that any point a user tries to access something, the user is authenticated.</p>
<p>So there needs to be a way a user can securely authenticate, be it just a Windows authentication, opening up your laptop or your Mac, and from there you are firing up your VPN. There you are authenticating again, and then you are going onto a browser to access a cloud application. Again, the user’s identity needs to be verified there as well. So there needs to be a way to identify the user security, and authenticate the user, and all needs to be done in a manner that is more secure. And to reduce the user passwords, we need to have a platform that can address all of these different endpoints. So anything the user touches, the solution needs to have a way to accommodate a passwordless authentication for the user without compromising on the security.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. So passwordless, it sounds fairly easy, but you’re talking about accessing the endpoint, accessing the VPN, accessing apps, browser-based access. How do we get to this? I mean, we talk about the latest federated apps that seems fairly straightforward, passwordless access to those, but we’re talking about environments that have been over decades. So what are some of the thorny issues that you have to deal with?</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Absolutely. That’s a great question. So if you are a small organization that started in 2014, security’s easy for you to build it. So you take a particular identity as a service vendor, you create your identities there, and then you get single sent onto all the apps. Every apps that you use are probably cloud apps that do modern SSO, modern ways of doing governance. But if you’re an organization that has been there for decades, you still probably have mainframes, you still have legacy applications that does form based authentication.</p>
<p>A developer probably developed the code in 1997 and then left and nobody touches the code. It just works, don’t touch it. So these kind of applications are easy targets, so you’re only as strong as your weakest link. So that’s the big problem for these large organizations. So you need to have a solution that can cover all of those as well. So legacy applications, how can you authenticate into that right now? Typically, you use your network ID and password, and that once you’re exposed, it’s easy to hack. So the solution needs to have a way to provide a password is authentication for these systems as well. So security, it’s only better if the weakest applications are also accommodated.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So I did a search on my mobile handset earlier today, and four different authenticators came up. How does a passwordless solution deal with the two-factor authentication that’s already existing within the enterprise?</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
That’s a great question. So then, we speak to a lot of organizations that are like Fortune 100. And a lot of these organizations have an existing two factor solution already. And we have seen the scenarios where they want to, that there is a big push or an appetite for using a modern passwordless authentication platform, but they still have some legacy 2FA platform. So what we are seeing is some organizations have gone through this process of acquiring a modern solution, but they ended up seeing is that this modern application, the modern passwordless platform was not supporting all endpoints. It supports some cloud apps. It supports some OS authentications, but it doesn’t do some thick lines, for example, or legacy applications.</p>
<p>So what the organizations are forced to do is to have two separate sort of authentications. One is using the legacy 2FA, one is using modern MFA. So the risks there are twofold. One is you have split scenarios. So you have one set of applications using a less secure legacy 2FA and one set of applications that use a more secure way of authentication. But attackers go for the least resistance. So they will always choose the easiest way to get in, and then once they’re in, they can do some lack of movement.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Got it. Got it. So biometric authentication is now getting quite a bit of airplay. Does biometric authentication also have security gaps?</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Biometrics. Yeah, you can… As a security professional, I would never say anything is the most secure and can never be hacked. So if you look at the password list, where it came from. So the passwords have been in use for since 1960s, and then the OTPs came about in the late ’90s and they were mainstreamed by early two thousands. So those two factors are something you know and something you have. But if you look at the most secure way to do authentication, which is biometrics, and we knew it all along. It’s not that we didn’t do it, so we humans knew it all along that something you are using biometrics is the most secure one. But back then the biometric authentication was only possible in some Tom Cruise movies. But now we have all these smartphones that have the capability to do biometric authentication and also your laptops have the capability. So biometric authentications using the capabilities that we already have, your smartphones, your laptops are becoming the center stage of authentication now, and rightly so.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
The reality is that some of these systems, you mentioned mainframes, these systems are not going passwordless, not anytime in probably our future. So, what does biometric authentication or any of this passwordless authentication have to do with these systems that cannot go passwordless?</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Good question. So you are still going to be stuck with some applications that will force you to use passwords to authenticate, and they can never be compatible with any kind of passwordless way to authenticate. But what you can do is, and we are seeing organizations do this, right? So time and again, I’ve been seeing our organizations move from eight character passwords to 12 character passwords, and then increasing the complexity of the passwords.</p>
<p>And then now we are seeing organizations trying to push for a 16 character passwords. I mean, I would argue that it’s humanely impossible for me to remember a password, 16 characters with special characters. But that’s where the organizations are heading because these mainframe applications, for example, they cannot do passwords. So the only way to increase security is make the passwords more complex. But when you do that, what you inherently do is you reduce the user experience, so the users hate it and they are going to forget their passwords more and more. So the password reset becomes a bigger pain. They have already been a big pain.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to make it a bigger and bigger pain as you increase the password complexity. So you need to have a solution that also allows you to reset your password, let’s say for example, in a very easier way, like say from your smartphone, just using biometrics. So don’t ask them for their old password because that’s a pain. And then don’t ask them to pick up a phone and then contact help desk. That’s an even bigger pain. So users should be able to have everything on the tips of their fingers, on their mobile phone, use biometrics, authenticate yourself, change your password to something very secure, use it with these applications that cannot do password. And then for the rest of the applications, you just use your biometrics. You don’t need to touch anything.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Great. Well, that’s really good insight. Appreciate you sharing that. Listen, we have a webinar coming up on January 26th. It’s at 10:00 AM Pacific time, 1:00 PM Eastern. If you’re seeing this after the 26th, they’ll be available for replay on the webinar. But this is going to cover how to deploy passwordless in these complicated environments that you’ve described. I really appreciate you walking through this, Jay. Passwordless sounds easy, but when you start to deploy it, some of the devil’s in the details or God is-</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So thank you very much. Appreciate your time today.</p>
<p>Jayaram Baskar:<br>
Thanks for having me on. Thank you.</p>

<p>You know a conference audience is thoroughly enthralled when they skip happy hour to keep chatting to the speaker.</p>



<p>That was Anonyome Labs’ Chief Architect Steve McCown’s experience when he presented at the New Mexico Technology Council’s (NMTC) Experience IT Conference in September. He was the speaker for whom the gathered audience forewent an end-of-day drink (an unlikely scenario at any conference!). And it’s no wonder they did: Steve is an interesting and engaging&nbsp;speaker&nbsp;at the best of times, but at the NMTC event, he was presenting on one of the hottest topics of our time: the new cryptographic identity paradigm known as&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/one-thing-experts-always-say-about-decentralized-identity-the-metaverse-and-web3/">decentralized identity</a>.</p>



<p>Steve told the conference audience that&nbsp;data breaches disclosing sensitive medical, financial, and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>&nbsp;have become a ‘cost of doing business’ on today’s internet. “Hackers are challenging traditional centralized identity and access management systems and exploiting compromised credentials as a leading initial attack vector. While privacy laws and fines are necessary, they are also post-breach actions made in hopes of spurring security innovation,” he said.</p>



<p>Steve explained that the new cryptographic identity paradigm known as decentralized identity (DI or self-sovereign identity) exchanges centralized architectures for a&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2022/10/innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">modern decentralized ecosystem</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the DI paradigm, identity is established using cryptographically generated decentralized identifiers (<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">DIDs</a>), which can be either private or anchored in online immutable storage (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">blockchains</a>). DIDs enable parties to communicate using an encrypted messaging protocol called&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2022/10/securing-private-communications-with-didcomm/">DIDComm</a>, which protects messages independent of any service or transport provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“DI also introduces a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">verifiable credentials</a>&nbsp;(VC) capability whereby VCs are issued to DID owners who can assert them to verifiers using privacy-preserving zero knowledge proofs, which enable instant verification of authorization, access, and revocation status,” Steve said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steve explained the key innovation behind DI is that every connection is a unique cryptographic relationship, which overcomes the problems associated with contemporary credential usage and authentication methods. Along with other advancements, this helps users stop reusing passwords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While many of today’s attacks exploit compromised credentials, the decentralized identity paradigm protects access and communication through a new application of strong cryptographic methods,” he said.</p>



<p>Steve is just one of Anonyome Labs’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/12/why-dr-paul-ashley-is-in-demand-on-the-decentralized-identity-speaking-circuit/">executives in strong demand</a>&nbsp;on the speaking circuit discussing decentralized identity and related concepts. Read some of our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/whitepaper-blog/">whitepapers</a>&nbsp;on the topic.</p>



<p>The NMTC Experience IT conference program focused on leading trends; forward-thinking, cutting-edge IT solutions; key consumer insights; and solution roadmaps encompassing the theme of&nbsp;Resilience and Reinvention. A range of experts shared best practices around how these technologies are changing how we do business, the economy, and our lives as a whole.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Long long ago when people used “pay-phones” and listened to the music of our modems connecting to the internet, I was part of a small and curious community. We called ourselves “hackers” and enjoyed learning how this internet thing worked. We took things apart and ran a prank or two; no ransomware for us! Back then, hacking was about learning and exploring. The community was a fascinating place filled with brilliant people. But Fear of the Man meant that people in the community could not trust each other with their real-world identities.</p>

<p>So, how can a community work together and moderate itself without that trust? The answer was simple: we had anonymous identities that we used consistently.</p>

<p>I probably interacted with hundreds of people over that time, but I never knowingly met any of them. We never used our real names; we used aliases. To keep track of each other, each of us used the same alias consistently. Sometimes we’d maintain multiple aliases and have different identities in different places. We’d need to protect against impersonation because our aliases were who we were. A hacker’s alias could be interrogated and hackers could build a reputation. Reputation was earned “on the job,” by being the first to reverse engineering this or the first to gain access to that.</p>
<p>
A solid reputation would get you invited to smaller groups where we discussed more sensitive topics. These smaller circles would have strict rules that could be enforced - add/remove members, for example. Groups would be formed spontaneously, and self-organize. We had a community that was learning, teaching, and most importantly: producing (by our own definition of producing), even while everyone hid their true identity.</p>

<p>There was no secure way to prove ownership of an alias. Some might remember using `/msg nickserv identify`, to claim ownership of an alias on a specific IRC server. There could be many servers claiming to have a hacker called “NullCipher” but they might not all be equal. </p>

<p>Same with email addresses. Is <a href="mailto:bill.gates@yahoo.com">,bill.gates@yahoo.com</a> the same person as <a href="mailto:bill.gates@microsoft.com">,bill.gates@microsoft.com</a>? These identities are not portable and you don’t control them. Still, today, our digital identity is largely bound to an email address on a mail server you might not run, a specific domain over which you have only partial control. If the provider, for whatever reason, ever decides to close your account, it’s game over.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine something better than today’s email/facebook/twitter handle-as-identity and write some requirements: </p>
<p>1/ Decentralization. A user can create and manage their own digital identity without a centralized authority. </p>
<p>2/ User Control, Privacy. A user controls who has access to their digital identity. </p>
<p>3/ Security. A user can prove ownership of the digital identity and use it to authenticate to various services and applications.</p>

<p>This sounds great, right? However, something is missing. If I can create my own digital identity, verify what I created, and share it freely - who is it to say it is true? For example, how can I prove to you that I am indeed Alex who works at YeshID? Currently, the best I can do is send an email from @yeshid.com domain. By you trusting that yeshid.com wasn’t compromised (or spoofed) and is indeed owned by the company, you would trust that an email from me, from an address issued by YeshID the company (alex@), is proof I work at YeshID. It’s not much, but better than nothing. </p>

<p>To achieve this functionality with the digital identity above, we need to add some more requirements: </p>
<p>4/ Issuance &amp; Revocation. An issuer (e.g. YeshID) can issue and revoke credentials to a holder (e.g. Alex). </p>
<p>5/ Verifiability. Upon presentation of the above credential by the holder, the receiver can verify the authenticity (e.g. Alex claiming to work for YeshID, and the receiver can verify it by asking the issuer if that’s true or not)</p>

<p>So, with these requirements, I would be able to receive a digital document from YeshID that verifies I work for YeshID. I have complete control over who I share this information with, and I do not depend on the issuer for doing that - so I have privacy and decentralization. When I try to use it to log into the company bank, for example, the bank can ask the credential issuer - YeshID - if the credential is still valid or not and grant me access or not based on the credential’s validity, and maybe my role, or other parameters it needs. </p>

<p>Does that sound too good to be true? Too futuristic? It’s not! You might have encountered some of this functionality if you ever received and used a digital COVID pass (in the UK, sorry, USA.) The whole solution is built upon <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">,Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DID) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">,Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC), a couple of new standards that have undergone extensive reviews and are being recommended by <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/">,W3C</a> - “The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [is] an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web.”</p>

<p>In the near future, when you go to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexvaystikh/">,LinkedIn profile</a>, you will see a digital credential that proves I work at YeshID. You might even be able to use that link to request more information, such as how to get in touch with me. You might also find that my YeshID persona is linked to another persona called Alex Vaystikh, decoupling the professional persona from the private person, and you will be able to use these documents to ensure you’re talking to the intended person. In the UK, health professionals in the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards/whats-happening-in-identity-and-access-management#digital-wallets-staff-passports:~:text=NHS%20and%20other%20professionals%20should%20be%20able%20to%20own%20and%20control%20their%20verified%20digital%20identity%20and%20proactively%20share%20this%20with%20NHS%20Organisations%20to%20enable%20streamlined%20onboarding%20and%20access%20to%20systems.">,NHS will use VCs</a> to improve onboarding and permission management. In Europe, thanks to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/use+cases">,EBSI</a>, you might see the advantages of verifiable credentials when moving between borders or notarizing documents. And maybe somewhere else entirely, you will find some self-issued digital identity that misses BitchX and talks complete nonsense, anonymously and securely. All of these are powered by DIDs and VCs.</p>

<p>In YeshID, we are leveraging the latest technologies to make identity and access management simple and secure, both for companies, employees, and beyond.</p>

<p>If you’re an admin responsible for the identity, access management, on-and-offboarding employees, compliance, and license provisioning, and you hate how repetitive and time-consuming it is both for you and your team, then email us at “iam” + “@” + yeshid.com, or ping Dana or me by LinkedIn. </p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/humptycalderon/">Humpty Calderon, Head of Community</a> at <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>. I’m from Los Angeles, California. I joined Ontology’s community in April&nbsp;2019.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I studied Computer Science with an emphasis on Information Technology. I owned and operated my own IT consultancy for eight years. When I have free time, I love to read, hike, and spend time with my family. I also love to build stuff. I have a wood shop where I build cabinets and shelves for my&nbsp;home.</p> Do you have any&nbsp;pets? <p>I don’t have any pets, but I can’t help but feed a stray cat when given the chance. So I am still quite an animal&nbsp;lover!</p> What would your superpower be? <p>Some say that you’re born knowing everything, so we don’t learn new things, we’re just remembering. If I had a superpower, I’d like to be able to access the full breadth of my memories and create things with that knowledge to help the&nbsp;world.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I connect with Web3 communities, participate in conversations about meaningfully engaging these communities, and I look at how we can develop more robust incentive and governance processes. For Ontology, I onboard community members to become ambassadors for decentralized IDs and data. I also engage with developers to build with the rich DID stack that Ontology has&nbsp;built.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>Ontology has, in my opinion, developed the most comprehensive decentralized identity ecosystem. ONT ID, OScore, Wing Finance, Orange Protocol, and ONTO Wallet are all incredibly powerful tools for Web3, with huge potential.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>I am happy to work with incredibly talented and kind human beings who are about their work and creating a better, more secure future for everybody.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>Innovation in decentralized identity is happening on a day-to-day basis at Ontology. This in itself is something very important that I’m excited to be a part of. On a personal level, since starting my podcast, I’ve been able to open doors that were once closed and develop friendships with many Web3 leaders. That has been hugely important for my&nbsp;career.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>Helping to continue onboarding community members and developers to build with Ontology’s DID stack. I think self-sovereign identity and reputation are the next big unlock of&nbsp;Web3.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>What we’re going to see is more people owning their identity and data whilst creating monetization opportunities. Both privacy and self-sovereignty are important to people, so promoting prosperity on a monetization level over the next five years is going to be very important.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontologys-head-of-community-humpty-calderon-547ae851c73">Meet the Team: Ontology’s Head of Community, Humpty Calderon</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What is your identity? Who or what defines it? </p><p>Who you are is hardly defined by your drivers license or passport. And yet, this is often how we understand ourselves and others. The metrics of our birthdate, ethnicity, eye color, height. The document number linked to a government database. The photo taken on a bad hair day despite our best efforts. </p><p>Not only do these documents reduce our identifiable information to fixed numbers, they don’t hold any information about our communities, relationships, profession, skills, interests, or desires. They also lack the nicknames, in-jokes, and knowledge that comes with those connections. </p><p>I’m not sure I want my in-jokes or hobbies included in my passport, nor do I want to be defined by such a flat description as what is currently included. But identity documents are just a tool for representing ourselves, not who we are. In reality we show up as multiple, fluid identities in different settings: parent, investor, co-worker, friend, activist, and many more. Both how we see ourselves and how others see us matters in these social equations.</p><p>On the internet we also show up as multiple identities. Just think about how many separate email accounts you have and how you might use each for different purposes. I have nine I can count off the top of my head. From personal identities to school and work, to organizations and accounts I share with others. So some of my online identities aren’t even solely ‘me’ — they’re also ‘we’. A single identifier used to represent a group in digital space.</p><p>In some ways, the internet enables this multiplicity, yet it is also data-first. Everything is inherently numbers, quantified metrics that have trouble capturing nuance and flow. There is a risk of identity being reduced to digital markers, detached from the complexity of living humans.</p><p>Without answering “what is identity,” as that seems to be incredibly contextual, I want to explore with you the uses and challenges of digital identity infrastructures while holding in mind the multiple ways we can think about identity.</p> Why is Identity so Hard? <p>Developing a comprehensive identity infrastructure for the internet has proven to be a wicked problem. </p><p>One clue in the above is my nine separate email accounts. I control each of them, but in order to keep those parts of my digital existence separate, I have to keep them as distinct logins without any continuity for me as a user. I don’t need work emails in my personal inbox, nor do I want to sign into social media with the email of my collaborative writing project. </p><blockquote>Developing a comprehensive identity infrastructure for the internet has proven to be a wicked problem. </blockquote><p>There is a tension between secure, authenticated, cross-platform digital identity and compartmentalized, fluid, personas that let us show up as different parts of ourselves in different spaces. Thus attempts to develop a single identity tool that does it all face a lot of issues, from ethics to usability, that come from collapsing multiple personas into a single identity. </p><p>For instance, one issue we can imagine is that my job title might be attached to my digital identity, which makes sense in a professional setting, but which I might not want to forefront in a social setting. Now, even without my digital identity credentials providing you that information, you could google me and learn it for yourself fairly easily, but there is a little bit of friction to that interaction — you have to intentionally seek the information out. This is where the concept of progressive trust comes in. </p><p>Rather than relying solely on cryptographic trust (which is actually about developing “trustless” environments) Christopher Allen suggests <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/progressive-trust.md">Progressive Trust</a> as a model of how trust functions in-person. In different settings I’m going to present different information about myself and slowly reveal more as it becomes relevant to an interaction. This lets me disclose information at a rate that I'm comfortable with, maintaining my privacy, and for you to understand the information because you aren’t overwhelmed with every available fact about me, unable to distinguish what is important and what isn’t. &nbsp;</p><p>Identity infrastructures also raise the issue of control. Who should be able to say who I am? Should my digital identity always tie back to my legal identity? Should my digital identity be controlled by a corporation like Google, as is the case for many people’s email addresses? There are often different answers to these questions depending on the particular use case, but as these infrastructures are developed it’s important to consider who they give power to. In many situations it should be possible for users to self-assert and control their identities. Certainly, users should be able to control what information they make visible, when, and to who. </p><p>Identity infrastructures face a lot of conflicting needs. Some of those conflicts include:</p>  Anonymity and identity authentication are both important in different situations.  We want to provide information, but also seek to control how and when.  We want to compartmentalize our personas, but also want to be able to prove the continuity between them when needed.  <p>There are technical challenges to get identity to work well, but there are also social ones like usability. An identity infrastructure that allows users to manage all of these conflicts themselves risks being unwieldy. Further, we as designers, developers, and builders of all kinds face the challenge of getting down to basics and away from our own preconceptions so as to build composable systems that can hold all of these contradictions together.</p><p>How then to navigate all of these contradictions and do digital identity well? Instead of claiming to have the answers, let’s explore the technical and project landscape, consider some important critiques, and keep learning together.</p> A Brief Recent History of Identity Technology <p>When we log in to a website online we are providing identity credentials. It used to be that each site would hold data about us like our username and password in their databases and thus would be the authority over our identity. This also meant that identity was balkanized, without any continuity between digital spaces. To this day, many websites require unique login details. But a new option has become prevalent. You can sign into many websites via a third party like Apple, Google, or Facebook that acts as the authority on who you are. You gain continuity between digital spaces and the individual sites no longer hold your password — which is good for security but centralizes data into the hands of a few organizations. This is how digital identity works for most today.</p><p>Each of these solutions has approached the tradeoffs inherent to identity infrastructures from different perspectives. And over several decades of incredible work, members of the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> and other organizations have continued to evolve this technology, developing capacities to balance the contradictions posed by identity.</p><p>The newest developments in the space, coming from many of the same minds, center around Self-Sovereign Identity, which comes from a desire for persistent credentials that originate from the individual. Much like data sovereignty, this is a claim that instead of external authorities holding our identity information, each one of us should be able to hold and provide all of our identity information.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity: Decentralized, Digital, and Self-Proving <p>Controlling your own identity is technically tricky. You need a unique name, a way to prove that it is your name and not someone else’s, and ways to prove information about yourself. The main standards that have been developed to solve these problems are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials which we’ll explore in a little more detail below. Additionally, I’ll talk a little about how this is playing out in Ethereum. </p><p>There are also situations where you need to not only prove your name, but that it refers to a unique person. This will be discussed in a section about Sybil Resistance. <br></p>Can you define who you are? Or is identity more tied up in defining relationships? <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/D44kHt8Ex14?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Source</a> Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) <p>Decentralized Identifiers allow a name (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI</a>) to be authenticated without needing to reference a central authority. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C’s specification</a> (which exists under an open, royalty-free license), describes how the holder of a DID can prove control over that name by providing a document with verification methods for cryptographically authenticating the identity. <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a> (who are behind the standards Google and others use for their identity infrastructure), are <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">developing standards</a> with DIDs to allow end-users to self-issue identity credentials to themselves which they’ll be able to use to login across a variety of sites without needing a central authority like Google. </p><p>Now, these identifiers don’t only have to refer to people; they could also refer to groups, datasets, or any other digital object. They also don’t possess, on their own, a way to say what the name refers to; rather, what is important is the ability to independently verify the name itself and that the agent presenting it has a right to it. To say things about a name, we’ll have to use Verifiable Credentials. </p> Verifiable Credentials <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#trust-model">Verifiable Credentials</a> (again defined by the W3C) are a way for credential holders to prove that a third party has said something about them and to present that information in an authenticatable way without verifiers needing to check it against the issuing party’s databases. </p><p>Take your driver license. It’s tied to your name and has tamper-resistant markings on it verifying that it was issued by the local government. It also asserts other information about you like your date of birth or nationality. At the same time the document contains its own constraints like its expiration date. </p><p>Instead of pointing to a legal name, a Verifiable Credential will point to a DID or other URI. The Verifiable Credential then is filled with all the appropriate information about the particular credential, including who is issuing it. It also includes a proof which allows a verifier looking at the document to confirm that the issuer generated the document without the verifier needing to contact the issuer for confirmation. The owner of the credential also has the ability to present only part of the information in the credential if they desire. For instance, if a verifier is looking to confirm the holder’s age, they can use zero-knowledge proofs to show just the information about their age and the issuer from a driver-license-like document without needing to reveal anything else from that document, enabling minimization of data sharing. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials provide a framework that can be used to say all sorts of different things about an agent, ranging from possession of concert tickets and club memberships to legal identity. Coupled with DIDs, they allow agents to self-assert their name and to carry authenticatable information about themselves without needing to rely on a central authority to hold that information.</p> Soulbound Tokens <p>Ethereum is doing something a little different. Because they already have wallet addresses which serve as URIs, they are operating outside the W3C’s standards to provide identity solutions that operate within their ecosystem. Soulbound Tokens have <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">been proposed</a> as a way to hold credentials and other attestations in a crypto wallet which make them similar to a non-transferable NFT. Like with Verifiable Credentials, issuers can attest any sort of information about an agent, in this case by minting a Soulbound Token directly into the agent’s wallet. &nbsp; </p><p>Binance for instance recently <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-to-launch-binance-account-bound-bab-token-the-first-ever-soulbound-token-on-bnb-chain-0fe1e7c8781844e29f56cb674231dfd7">released an implementation</a> of Soulbound Tokens as an identity credential to their customers who completed KYC. This token effectively ties user’s wallet addresses back to their legal identities through Binance’s KYC databases, making the company the trusted authority for other projects that want to accept that identity credential. </p> Sybil Resistance <p>Fake identities and bots abound on the internet and are often used to disrupt spaces or give individuals undue influence like in a vote. These are known as Sybil attacks and create an issue for identity infrastructures. After all, I shouldn’t be able to use all nine of my email accounts to create fake social media profiles and repeatedly ‘like’ one of my own posts.</p>Distinguishing humans from bots is an increasingly difficult and important task. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/46n7zVCoFHk?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Source</a><p>So how do you prove that a particular DID or wallet address refers to a unique individual? Many current digital identity infrastructures tie to legal identity in some way or another depending on the level of security needed. For instance, verifying your phone number on Google or Discord ties that account back to the phone company. For more secure implementations like KYC on exchanges and the like, you have to provide direct confirmation of your legal identity by uploading images of your state issued ID or similar documentation. </p><p>You could theoretically authenticate your legal identity in a similar way under a Self-Sovereign paradigm by getting the phone company or government to give you a Verifiable Credential authenticating your legal identity. There are even government projects working towards this like <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-id-technology-and-standards">Ontario’s Digital ID</a>. </p><p>In the web3 space there are also projects attempting to develop alternative methods of sybil resistance that let individuals prove that they are unique human beings without needing to rely on legal identity. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.590171/full">This 2020 paper</a> reviewing approaches to “Proof of Personhood” is a helpful introduction to the space. The methods they use feel more like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party">key signing parties</a> of old, but updated for the modern internet. So instead of getting together in person to check each other’s public keys, they authenticate identity on a peer-to-peer basis via video chat or recorded attestations. The protocols also utilize social graphs or other mechanisms like financial incentives/penalties to help weed out bots and fake accounts. </p><p>Without taking the narrative too deep into the pros and cons of different implementations, I will say that I love the idea of peer-to-peer authentication of identity, but that we are still on rocky terrain that needs to be navigated carefully.</p> Generative Identity: Critiques and Opportunities <p>From this broad overview of Self-Sovereign Identity projects, you can see that the tools for a secure, authenticated, cross-platform digital identity are in development, and while there is ground yet to cover, a lot of promising work has been done in this space. But you’ll also notice that there is little discussion of the other face of the coin. The multiplicity and contextuality of identity and the need for compartmentalized, fluid personas is really missing from the technical developments and conversation around them. And this is where a lot of the following critiques come from. </p><p>Philip Sheldrake has proposed <a href="https://generative-identity.org/">Generative Identity</a> as a framework for thinking about digital identity from a perspective that allows for evolution, change, and fallibility. It builds on Self-Sovereign Identity and makes a call for transdisciplinary work that moves beyond code in order to design from a holistic perspective. The following is largely in reference to his work and is presented here to help us consider how to design identity infrastructures that are better suited to meeting our conflicting needs.</p>Generative Identity asks us to dig into the messy, contextual, and interpersonal. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/9bnJPZdU_pU?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Source</a> A Verb not A Noun <p>One way of thinking about the contradiction of identity is to ask whether it is a noun or a verb. Is identity a thing? Or is it a series of living processes that we enact? And if identity is something we do, then how do we build infrastructures that are representative of that? </p><p>One danger of digital identity is that our multiple identities, which are always shifting as we act them out over time, could be collapsed into a single, definitive document which is used to define “who we are.” Now, this happens some with legal identities, but legal identity is limited to a narrow set of use cases. The diversity of ways that we interact online don’t all require legal identity, and many would be negatively affected by it. Unfortunately a lot of identity projects are developed with a legal conception of identity. After all, “code is law” is a pervasive refrain. &nbsp;</p> Cultural Pitfalls of a Datafied Self <p>Let’s look at an example of how this could play out. </p><p>Imagine that Bob and Alice meet on a dating site. Now, in order to ensure that everyone on the site is a real person and relatively safe, the site requires them to link their Self-Sovereign Identities which have been through a KYC process. If progressive trust tools are in place and everyone has the ability to keep their information private (while sharing certain details with the platform for safety) then the site might function fairly similarly to how dating sites do today. But if those tools aren’t in place, or if there is a culture that doesn’t prioritize them, then we might expect some serious privacy issues. For instance, if Alice is a whale and has her crypto accounts linked to her DID, Bob might have ulterior incentives for asking Alice out. They might also judge each other based on their college degrees, height, genetics, or any other metric that might be attached to their identities via a Verifiable Credential.</p><p>As Sheldrake has <a href="https://generative-identity.org/the-dystopia-of-self-sovereign-identity-ssi/">stated</a>: </p><blockquote>“If you fail to offer up the requisite verifiable claims then you fail to get to ‘trust building’ first base in the SSI century. (Note: this is in fact trust avoidance not trust building.)” </blockquote><p>Part of what is happening here is the decontextualization of information. Shared merely as verifiable facts rather than as rich accounts, we lose sight of the person at the center of these data points. If Bob never finished a college degree, the story of ‘why’ might be really important to who Bob is, but it’s entirely missing from his identity credentials. </p><p><a href="https://blog.mollywhite.net/is-acceptably-non-dystopian-self-sovereign-identity-even-possible/#the-trilemma-of-digital-identity">Molly White</a> warns about the social divides this could accelerate. If our college grades or criminal records are no longer locked up in frustrating bureaucratic processes and are rather tied to our digital identities, they become available as requirements and disqualifiers for access to any number of activities and spaces. &nbsp;</p> Interpersonal Information <p>Part of this loss of context comes from a focus on “personal data.” Most information is in fact interpersonal. Our identities are bound up in the ways that other people identify and experience us. My trust in someone is also solidified much more by the recommendation of a mutual friend then by seeing their legal ID. It’s our relationships who really make us who we are. </p><p>This is a lost opportunity as well. “Big Data” knows that interpersonal information is valuable, thriving off of the overlap in our data trails and looking at the ways we are interconnected. Now, I’m all about data sovereignty, but I also want our shared data to be used in productive ways that help our communities. Data cooperatives, data commons, and other similar projects feel like a positive middle ground between data extraction and private data silos. Similarly, I am wondering how identity might take on similar patterns.</p> The Fable of Rationality <p>Finally, I want to warn against assumptions of rationality. A lot of identity projects are well designed for people who act in their own best interests. But we are all fallible, and it’s not just technical systems we have to navigate but social, legal, and cultural systems as well, each with competing goals and rules. My best interests in a cultural sense might be directly opposed to the actions I need to secure the technical privacy of my digital identity. I might be compelled to give up information or rights I would normally protect fiercely, if it meant I could access valuable cultural or economic opportunities. This is not to disparage the capability of end users but rather to recognize the complexity we all exist within. It’s always wise to design for humans who make mistakes.</p> Complexity: Holochain’s Perspective <p>Learning about this topic, I was reminded of how we at Holochain talk about Mutual Sovereignty. Holochain is designed to protect and enable both the agent and the community. These parties are always bound together in responsibility and agency. Digital identity seems to have a similar dynamic with the tension between identity infrastructures and our multiple lived identities. </p><blockquote>Holochain is designed to protect and enable both the agent and the community. These parties are always bound together in responsibility and agency.</blockquote><p>Rather than a proper conclusion, I want to leave this article with an invitation to think expansively and critically about identity, and to join us as we continue to explore digital identity and how Holochain might factor in. As always, Holochain is committed to holding space for the complexity of these issues and is looking to approach identity with sensitivity and intention. We obviously have strong beliefs about the matter, but I don't want this to be a one-sided conversation led by supposed experts — I want it to be a starting point for discussions which will lead to much richer answers than we could come up with alone. More soon.</p>

Thanks to the cooperation, Billennium’s Inperly app allows Microsoft Teams users to check identities and sign documents with qualified electronic signatures, using ID documents from 200+ countries. </p>



<p>Inperly, an application developed by Billennium, supports remote customer service, consulting, and sales processes on Microsoft Teams. Billennium has recently implemented automated identity proofing and e-signatures services from IDnow into its app. The new feature allows the issuing of a one-time qualified signature (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">QES</a>), equivalent to a handwritten signature within the European Union. The feature can be used in most EU countries.</p>



<p>“By integrating Inperly with IDnow solutions, companies and institutions can conveniently, quickly, and securely verify a user’s identity and sign documents with qualified signatures within Microsoft Teams. Our solution helps companies in the digitalization of documentation workflow and prevents fraud attempts. It can be successfully used in government institutions, banks, insurance companies, universities, HR firms and other organizations offering their services remotely,”&nbsp;commented Tomasz Goźliński, Head of Products at Billennium.</p>



<p>“Helping build trust in the digital world is one of our main goals and enabling our partners to create secure and trustworthy relationships is part of our mission. Our all-in-one solution with a qualified electronic signature is paired with remote identity proofing and is compliant with Anti-Money Laundering European Regulation, which ensures secure conversations with Inperly on Microsoft Teams for all parties. Checking or proving who you are is fast and easy, thanks to automated verifications based on AI. This cooperation thus helps to prevent identity theft by biometric checks and electronic signature,”&nbsp;said Bertrand Bouteloup, Vice President of Sales at IDnow.</p>

<p>You didn’t hear it here first, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6935746692759609344/">because LinkedIn</a>, but the folks at <a href="https://aueb.gr/">Athens</a> and <a href="https://www.aalto.fi">Aalto</a> universities were recognized for their “Capabilities-based access control for IoT devices using Verifiable Credentials” paper. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Abstract — Capabilities-based access control is a promising paradigm that can handle the particularities of IoT systems.<br> <br>Nevertheless, existing systems are not interoperable and they have limitations, such as lack of proof of possession, inefficient revocation mechanisms, and reliance on trusted third parties.<br> <br>In this paper we overcome these limitations by designing and implementing a system that leverages Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to encode the access rights. Our solution specifies protocols for requesting and using VCs that can be mapped to OAuth 2.0, includes an efficient and privacy preserving proof of possession mechanism, and it supports revocation. We implement and evaluate our solution and we show that it can be directly used even by constrained devices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://wider.team/tag/widerpov/">WiderPoV</a>: The context for this is interesting. </p>



 
 First, we have some very IoT-specific challenges. Like teaching devices which humans to trust. And fitting more complex auth into a device’s tiny footprint.  



 And then you have interop challenges, like helping a cloud service manage diverse device fleets.  



 While Verifiable Credentials can do much more than access control, for many industries, IoT interop and access control seems to be the gateway drug.

   Creating secure applications requires authentication. Delegating all the tedious details of the sign-in process to Okta is the most secure method to authenticate, not to mention speedier for development. So you’ll see us advocating for and using the Okta-hosted sign-in page in our blog posts. 

 But the default sign-in page can look too different from the personality you have in your application.

  <p>Creating secure applications requires authentication. Delegating all the tedious details of the sign-in process to Okta is the most secure method to authenticate, not to mention speedier for development. So you’ll see us advocating for and using the Okta-hosted sign-in page in our blog posts.</p>

<p>But the default sign-in page can look too different from the personality you have in your application. And the login URL redirects to a domain outside your application, which is also different from what we want. Fortunately, you can add some flair to your Okta-hosted sign-in page, allowing your application’s character to carry through in the user authentication process while maintaining the highest level of security. In other words, winning with the best of both worlds.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This post walks you through how to customize your sign-in page using a custom domain and by selecting fun styles using Okta-hosted redirect model. We’ll use a pre-existing e-commerce cupcake site built using an Angular Micro frontend application and customize the sign-in page to be full of mouth-watering cupcakes. 😋</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note
The process outlined in this post is not Angular-dependent, so feel free to substitute the web app with your favorite SPA application.</p>

 Prepare your Okta account and Okta application 
<p>You’ll need an Okta account. If you already have one and an Okta application you want to use for this tutorial, feel free to skip this section. Otherwise, let’s continue!</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Note the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You’ll need those values to configure Okta in the web app.</p>

 Theme the Okta-hosted sign-in page 
<p>Let’s make the sign-in page more enticing by beautifying it with a cupcake or whatever theme sparks joy.</p>

<p>You can make these customizations in the Admin Console through the Okta Dashboard or API calls. We’ll use the Okta Dashboard in this post, but let me know in a comment below if you want to see the API calls’ instructions.</p>

<p>To get to the Okta Dashboard, navigate to <a href="https://developer.okta.com">developer.okta.com</a> and sign in. Notice the sign-in page looks neutral. It will look much more delightful after we apply the customization changes.</p>

<p>Once you’ve authenticated, you’ll see your Okta Dashboard.</p>

<p>Access the Admin Console by pressing the Admin button in the toolbar at the top of the page. You’ll encounter a sign-in challenge, and once you emerge victorious, you’ll be in the Admin Console.</p>

<p>Navigate to Customizations &gt; Branding on the sidebar. Here you can theme your login page. Select your primary and secondary colors used within the sign-in widget. Add a logo, a favicon, and optionally add a background image. Press the Edit button for Okta-hosted Sign-In Page, select your background style and save your changes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>My selections are full of colorful, happy cupcakes — a theme that sparks joy for me and matches the personality of my cupcakes e-commerce site.</p>

<p>Sign out of the Okta Dashboard and sign back in to see your new sign-in page in action! My sign-in page makes me smile. 😊</p>

<p></p>

 Customize the sign-in URL with a custom domain 

<p>Next, let’s tackle the sign-in redirect URL to have a domain name that matches our application. Feel free to skip this section to see the themed sign-in page in a web application if you don’t have a custom domain.</p>

<p>In the Admin Console, navigate to Customization &gt; Domain in the sidebar. Press the Edit button to start the customized URL process. Be sure to have access to your Domain Name Registrar so you can make the required modifications. You will also need to allow Okta to manage a TLS certificate or provide your own. In the following steps, we’ll have Okta manage the certificate. Press the Get started button to continue.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the next screen, add the domain name you want to use for the sign-in URL and select Okta-managed for your certificate. Staying true to my cupcake theme, I have a cupcake-based domain name and added a subdomain for the sign-in URL. Press Next.</p>

<p>The next screen has instructions for you to update the DNS records in your Domain Name Registrar. The instructions to do so depend on your registrar, so you’ll need to follow the instructions your registrar provides. 😅 You’ve got this! 💪</p>

<p>The final step to customize the URL for your domain is configuring your Okta application. In the Admin Console, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications and find the Okta application you’re using in this tutorial. It might be the one you created earlier in the post or already had. Navigate to the Sign On tab. You’ll see a section for OpenID Connect ID Token where you’ll select the URL. Press Edit and choose your URL for the Issuer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The DNS changes may take a few minutes to propagate, so prepare a soothing cup of tea to decompress from that DNS work while you wait. Let’s see how the sign-in page looks in a web app with a matching theme!</p>

 Set up the Angular Micro-frontend site and add Okta 
<p>To reduce the overhead of creating a web app, we’ll use an existing sample cupcake e-commerce app. Grab the pre-built <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example/tree/deploy">Angular application from the GitHub repo</a> by running the following commands in your terminal:</p>

   <code>git clone --branch deploy https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
npm ci
</code>   

<p>Open the project in your favorite IDE.</p>

<p>The site already includes the libraries required to authenticate using Okta. You’ll need to configure the app with the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code>.</p>

<p>Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app.module.ts</code>. Find the following code block and replace <code>{yourDomain}</code> and <code>{yourClientID}</code> with your Okta application values. If you used a custom domain, the <code>{yourDomain}</code> domain value is the issuer value from the previous step. If you didn’t set up a custom domain, <code>{yourDomain}</code> is the issuer value generated in the output of the Okta CLI.</p>

   <code>const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: 'https://{yourDomain}/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
});
</code>   

<p>Now we can run the site. Start the app by running the following command:</p>

   <code>npm run run:all
</code>   

<p>This command opens three tabs in your browser. Find the one running at port 4200 with beautiful pictures of cupcakes and try signing in. The Okta-hosted sign-in page looks more themed, and better matches the application! If you set up a custom domain, you’ll see the domain name matches your application too! 🧁</p>

  Both the AMF and Banque de France want to make licensing mandatory for crypto service providers.  More than 50 firms, including the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, have already applied for registration.  So far, the country has an optional licensing system for crypto service providers.  <p>France seeks to expedite the mandatory licensing of crypto service providers. The country’s objective is to force crypto companies into obtaining a license if not already registered.</p><p>The call comes straight from France’s Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) or Financial Markets Authority, the country’s financial regulator, and is in line with Banque de France. Its Governor Villeroy de Galhau insists on enforcing stringent regulatory requirements on crypto businesses in the&nbsp;country.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/DaviDRocka/status/1612811700507492353?s=20&amp;t=PfSRsUDymMP-pXInxm4yUQ">Image Source</a>)<p>The licensing, according to Villeroy, should replace the existing registration process to address the industry’s prevailing volatility challenges.</p><p>The AMF optional licensing system came into effect in 2019. Over 50 firms applied for AMF registration, and well-known global players in the field, including Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, were among the applicants.</p><blockquote>The apparent “disorder” in 2022 in the crypto space, for Villeroy, is a sound reason for this policy drive and moreover is “desirable for France to move to an obligatory licensing of DASP as soon as possible.”</blockquote><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/hong-kong-becoming-a-crypto-hub">Hong Kong Becoming a Crypto&nbsp;Hub</a></p> Implementing Before&nbsp;MiCA <p>Licensing has to happen before MiCA, the Europe-wide crypto regulations, come into effect by 2024, as clarified by Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, the head of AMF, the financial body responsible for overseeing the crypto space in&nbsp;France,</p><p>Along the same line, Villeroy de Galhau urged the authorities not to be reluctant about commencing with the licensing of Digital Asset Service Providers even before the EU regulations take&nbsp;effect.</p><blockquote>In spite of the constraints, Barbat-Layani insists that licensing would not imply throttling innovation in the sector. Instead, it would attempt to resist&nbsp;fraud.</blockquote><p>At present, cases where registration with the AMF is mandatory include providers willing to offer digital asset custody services, and services pertaining to the buying or selling of digital assets in a currency that is legal tender, trading of digital assets against other digital assets, operating a trading platform for digital assets,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>However, the lower chamber of France’s parliament is yet to discuss the bill that advocates for making licensing mandatory. If it gives greenlight to the said bill, crypto service providers with business interests in the country will have no option but to register with AMF and obtain appropriate licenses to operate within France’s boundaries.</p><p>_________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>With the EU becoming a major economic player, its rules and regulations are being felt around the business world.</p>
<p>What is GDPR? GDPR is a set of regulations specific to businesses in the EU governed by seven principles to protect individual data rights in a data-driven world.</p>
 What Is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? 
<p>GDPR is the governing data privacy and security standard in the European Union. Unlike many other standards outside of the EU, GDPR emphasizes the rights of individuals over their personal data and attempts to balance these rights against legitimate businesses interested in data collection and processing.</p>
<p>At the heart of GDPR exist several core ideas that inform every requirement. These include:</p>
 
 Data Ownership: Individuals from or inside the EU, known as “data subjects,” own their private data. As such, they have certain rights over that information, including the right to see all information an organization has from them, the right to correct errors in that data, and the right to demand the deletion of that data (the right to be forgotten). 
 Consent: Marketing isn’t a free-for-all in the EU. Any use of data for marketing purposes (collecting email addresses for a mailing list, using cookies to track behaviors, etc.) must come with an explicit consent given by the data subject. 
 Business Limitations: Businesses may only use data pursuant to the reasoning given for collecting that data. That is, businesses must disclose to data subjects the reason for collecting data to receive consent, and they may not process that information outside of that reasoning. 
 EU Locality: GDPR governs businesses and individuals inside and sometimes outside of the EU. Broadly, if a company collects or processes data in the EU, or collects or processes data from EU citizens (regardless of their current location), they must follow GDPR rules. 
 
<p>Thus GDPR is an expansive and rather strict set of laws that fundamentally shape how organizations do business within the EU.</p>
 What Are the Seven Principles of GDPR? 
<p>To expand on these broad ideals, the language of the law within GDPR will align with seven basic principles. These principles cover business operations, IT infrastructure, and interactions with individual data subjects. These principles are defined in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a> of GDPR.</p>
<p>The seven core principles of GDPR are:</p>
 
 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: Article 5 of GDPR states that organizations must collect and process data legally and transparently. This means that they cannot break any laws, and their collection and processing operations must be open and transparent to regulating bodies and data subjects. 
 Purpose Limitation: Organizations collecting information from data subjects must gain consent, and part of that consent is that the reasoning for collecting that data is made clear to the individual. Furthermore, the organization may not use that information for other business reasons–all data processing must be explicit, specific, and for legitimate purposes. 
 Data Minimization: Organizations collecting information from data subjects may only gather the minimum data adequate and relevant to the stated purpose. Data retention should continually adhere to the minimum information required to perform the specified processing purpose. This excludes collecting data for future potential business purposes. 
 Accuracy: Organizations must keep data up-to-date as much as possible. Furthermore, any requests from a data subject to change incorrect data must be fulfilled as soon as possible (within 30 days). 
 Storage Limitation: Any data storage must maintain protections such that the exposure of private information is limited to a time frame no longer than necessary for the stated processing and business purposes. Additionally, once those purposes are completed, the organization must delete that information or justify governing GDPR bodies as to why retention is still necessary. 
 Integrity and Confidentiality: All data storage and processing must be done with consideration of appropriate security and privacy measures, including protection against unauthorized disclosure, loss, destruction, or damage to integrity. Privacy measures must include proper encryption, authentication and authorization controls, and privacy practices. 
 Accountability: Organizations must adhere to these principles, including demonstrating compliance. 
 
<p>There are benefits to complying with GDPR, but primarily any data-gathering and processing operations impacting individuals from or in the EU face mandatory compliance.</p>
 
What Happens If I Don’t Meet These Requirements? 
<p>It’s not uncommon for large enterprise organizations to weigh the risks of security breaches against business needs and the costs of non-compliance–including fines and legal expenses. This typically isn’t the case for GDPR, where steep fines are the norm.</p>
<p>The penalties for non-compliance with the seven principles of GDPR include:</p>
 
 Tier 1 (Less Severe Infringements): Organizations that don’t adhere to the lawful basis of processing data, auditing organizations that don’t correctly certify organizations, and other general non-compliance will result in fines up to €10 million or 2% of the organization’s worldwide annual revenue from the previous year, whichever is greater. 
 Tier 2 (More Serious Infringements): Violations of processing or security principles, data subject rights, consent rights, or the transfer of EU data to third countries will result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of the organization’s worldwide annual revenue from the previous year, whichever is greater.

 Why AI and the blockchain need each-other to access the physical&nbsp;world <p>AI Oracles super empower Real World Assets on the blockchain — and super empower AI to act in the real&nbsp;world</p> In the (near) future AI Agents will become Non-Human customers for RWA Smart Contract&nbsp;Rails <blockquote>Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a breakthrough technology in the past year, particularly in the development of limited AIs designed for specific tasks. These AIs, such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated significant progress in their ability to respond believably to inputs. In order for AI to reach its full potential, it needs to be able to interact with the physical world. Mattereum’s Asset Passports (MAPs) on the blockchain can provide a bridge for AI to interact with physical assets in a trustworthy way, enabling them to identify, buy, sell, track, and move things. The integration of AI and the blockchain has the potential to revolutionize industries and change the way we live and&nbsp;work.*</blockquote><p>It’s not often that you can point to the moment that the future arrives, that there’s been a phase change in reality, that the paradigm has shifted and whole new vistas of possibility have suddenly opened, but this is one of those&nbsp;moments.</p><p>As 2023 dawns, it is clear that the breakout technology of the last year has been artificial intelligence (AI). For all the hype about the Metaverse from certain tech companies, it has struggled to gain popular traction; self-driving cars have shown that they are years away from being reliable enough for popular adoption; nuclear fusion has achieved a <a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/uk-contributes-to-a-breakthrough-in-nuclear-fusion-energy/">crucial milestone</a>, but is a long way from practical rollout. The blockchain has gone through its frenzied bubble phase and is now undergoing its “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/crypto-and-theories-of-value-b505d560c7f2">Great Disinfection</a>” before finding its mature role. The blockchain’s time will come, and then it will be massive; but for the moment it’s getting purged of criminals, scams and gimmicks before being repurposed to become the world’s operating system for the future. but AI has really broken out of the pack, and it has broken&nbsp;big.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/crypto-and-theories-of-value-b505d560c7f2">CRYPTO AND THEORIES OF VALUE</a></p><blockquote>AIs are astoundingly better at responding believably to inputs than anything seen&nbsp;before</blockquote><p>We’re not talking about general AI, the William Gibson/ Iain M Banks sentient human-plus intelligences (yet), although Google software engineer Blake Lemoine did <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/23/google-fires-software-engineer-who-claims-ai-chatbot-is-sentient">cause a stir</a> back in July by claiming the chatbot he was working on had achieved sentience, swiftly followed by Google firing him. It’s the more limited AIs, developed to carry out specific tasks, that have made the impact. Things like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT </a>are astoundingly better at responding believably to inputs than anything seen before, and the improvement in image generators like <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">Stable Diffusion</a>, <a href="https://www.craiyon.com/">Craiyon</a> and <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F">Midjourney</a> has been perceptible, even since the first ones went public last&nbsp;spring.</p><p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue</a></p><p>This is clearly just the start of something special — AIs are going to be doing a lot more than chatting and drawing pictures. They’re evolving fast too; when I started drafting this just before Christmas I wrote a sentence here speculating about the potential for integrating AI and search engines, and before I finished editing it, in early January, Microsoft <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-aims-ai-powered-version-bing-information-2023-01-04/">announced </a>they are adding ChatGPT functionality to Bing. Initially it’s not going to take us to completely new areas, AI is going to help people achieve their current goals more efficiently, but even that will be revolutionary. The things were roughly performing at the level of a primary school child just a year or two back; more recently, an average 12 year old; now more like a college student — there are already think pieces being written about the <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2022/12/10/23501933/does-ai-mean-the-death-of-the-college-essay">death of the college essay</a> because AIs can now write a plausible one at undergraduate level, they’ll even provide the citations.</p><blockquote>AI needs to have ways of interacting with the physical&nbsp;world</blockquote> With Mattereum, AIs can buy/sell physical things in the real&nbsp;world <p>All these uses for AI have been in the digital realm, but for AI to achieve its full potential it needs to have ways of interacting with the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>Sure, they could operate physical devices — waldoes, self-driving vehicles, robot bodies etc, but their reach could be far greater than those would allow, and <a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/">Mattereum Asset Passports (MAP)</a> on the blockchain can give them the API to make this possible, providing the bridge to the physical world they need to make things happen. This is how the blockchain becomes the world’s operating system. To buy, sell, track and move things AI needs to identify them and be sure they are what they claim to be. MAPs provide the trustable information about physical objects, connected to warranties that are legally enforceable in 170 countries that would enable an AI to be certain that they are really dealing with a particular physical asset. With the MAPs connected to a trustable NFT on the blockchain, the AI can use these NFTs to interact with the assets in the physical world safe in the knowledge that they are actually attached to something real that will be bought, sold, tracked or moved. You can imagine AIs instructed to only use MAPs to define objects, then searching the blockchain for the ones they need and working with those. MAPs enable AI to see and grasp the real&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/">Mattereum Asset Passports</a></p><blockquote>There are ways that Mattereum can use AI to be more effective as a&nbsp;company</blockquote><p>That’s where Mattereum can contribute to the big picture in the future; in the shorter term there are ways that Mattereum can use AI to be more effective as a company too. It’s really too early to be able to see all the opportunities that may exist for AIs at Mattereum, but it is clear that they will make a profound impact. I can make a stab at where things are likely to go though, and for certain this is an area we’ll be paying close attention to as we go forward. There are six use cases I can come up with now, and this is just the beginning — I am sure we’ll identify more as the technology evolves and Mattereum grows.</p> 1) NeoSwap <p>We have already taken steps to incorporate AI into what Mattereum does; our <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/11/24/announcing-neoswap-x-mattereum-partnership/">new partnership with NeoSwap</a> is the first step in that direction. <a href="https://neoswap.ai/">Neoswap</a> is an AI-powered framework for web3 commerce that finds optimal multiway trades that redistribute assets and currency in a win-win-win manner. Combining their marketplace with NFTs backed by MAPs opens the way to a phase shift in the way items are traded that completely aligns with Mattereum’s work to bring physical assets on-chain. NeoSwap uses AI to figure out, of all the near-infinite number of possible trades, which trades are most likely to be beneficial to both parties and therefore accepted (among other optimisations). In the limit, if lots and lots of goods were in the Mattereum/NeoSwap ecosystem, it could produce a sort of “magical river” where you just give away what you don’t want any more and things which surprise and delight you just turn up in your life: minimal environmental impact, and near-zero cost!</p> 2 ) AI Certifiers <p>I have, let us say, an AI certifier that does comic books, and my AI certifier is very, very simple; you show it the cover of the comic book, and it goes away and it comes back with comprehensive publication history for your comic — published on this day by the following people, these folks worked on the cover, these people worked on the story, this is the illustrator, the inker, this is how many were published, this is the price history and so on. I take all of the information out of the databases that I have using the AI and I sell it to you in the form of a warranty. Right? Very, very, very low risk. As long as my AI recognizer is good. I’m just giving you information that already&nbsp;exists.</p> 3) Wear&nbsp;Analyzer <p>I give the AI a picture of a handbag and it comes back and says, “mint condition, almost new condition, slightly battered, really battered, distressed and finally “Oh my god, what have you done to that thing?”. Now, that’s a little trickier because this is a judgement call and you could have somebody that disagrees and then you’ve got to have some human coming in to give a judgement about whether the AI is doing a good enough job of this or not. So, categorical identification of a thing. The first activity is an assessment about a thing based on available data, now this second activity is very, very, very, very, very fiddly, but it’s the kind of fiddly the AI is actually pretty good at. If I show it a training dataset of 50 handbags, and tell it “these ones are less worn, these ones are very worn” the AI will be able to generalise what it’s looking at. But once in a while I will show it a handbag which is intentionally distressed, but is in mint condition and the AI will say that this handbag is horribly beaten and damaged, so it’s essentially worthless. At that point we will have a problem, but that is what the warranties are for. If it’s wrong, the buyer or seller claims against the warranty and gets their money back, and the AI will learn that this particular kind of handbag is mint when it looks like most other ones do when they’ve been run over by a truck and buried for three&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>These last two functions are both AI recognizers and are basically very much like the systems that will ultimately offer you a bid on car insurance, or health insurance. They’re looking at the available data, they’re making an estimate of what something is. Some of those estimates are nice and objective and clear and clean and easy, others are very, very, very subjective and there’s a strong risk of humans coming in overturning them. The next three opportunities are more sophisticated.</p> 4) Clustering <p>This is the holistic formation of story through material objects. So I have an AI and it knows of my clothes and knows my size and when it sees something which is in my style and made in size hippo, then it just goes out there and automatically searches for things with the appropriate info in their MAPs and tells me that what I want exists and maybe even gives me multiple options for it because I’m not sure on exactly what I want. It can then even show me multiple things simultaneously — “Okay, hey, Vinay, how would you like a Penguin costume? I got a monocle. I got a top hat. I got a karate thing. I got a cane with a spike in the bottom of it and I have these really wicked white wingtip shoes all in your size and you already have the black pants and the waistcoat” and I go, “yeah, I’d quite like a Penguin costume — buy!”</p><p>Perhaps a more common use for it would be interior design; I say I want an Art Deco furniture set for my living room, I say “hey, here’s my room, get me Art Deco furniture that will fit”. It goes off, looks at the asset passports of furniture for sale and comes back with furniture set one, furniture set two, furniture set three at 350 grand, 75 grand and 175 grand and I can choose which one I like and it buys them for me. This can work in the short term too. You rent an Airbnb, unfurnished. The AI uses Mattereum asset passports to find 12 sets of potential furnishing options you can have installed for it. You pick one and it goes out and buys all that and fits them into the place. You stay for three months. At the end you leave and the AI resells all the furniture.</p><blockquote>AI provides the ability to customise the experience of&nbsp;space</blockquote><p>AI provides the ability to customise the experience of space, the AI knows what the style of furniture you choose looks like, it knows how big the place is, it knows what furniture is available, it understands what price is good, and what it does is it creates experiences for me. I know I’m getting actual Art Deco furniture and the price is good because it’s all warrantied in the MAPs so there’s no need for me to scrutinise the details, check out the individual seller’s reputations and all those kinds of things you’d have to do now. The combination of AI and MAPs makes the whole transaction fast, safe and trustworthy. Now imagine wedding planning; so you’ve just a big empty building and warehouses of furniture and people figure out what they want and it just finds stuff and arranges everything and off you&nbsp;go.</p><p>What AI is doing is synthesising multiple different streams of goods into a holistic whole, which has more value than the individual components. It could do this using the NeoSwap ecosystem now, just using seller info, but adding the MAP to the mix just makes everything more trustworthy and means it could also use regular auctions, it could use street purchases, anywhere something with a MAP is being&nbsp;sold.</p> 5) Prediction <p>This is where the AI buys stuff just as you need it, sells it when you don’t by learning and anticipating your use patterns for various things, This might be the same thing multiple times, so it buys you a bike in the spring and sells it in the autumn every year; it knows you pressure wash the car on every third Sunday of the month, so buys you a washer on the Friday and sells it on the Monday, removing the need for you to have the thing cluttering the garage in the meantime. There’s a small cost differential perhaps, but it’s the convenience cost of always having what you need when you need it and not having piles of stuff hanging around until the day you finally need it. It uses the MAP to find and verify things, and by circulating things between people when they need them removes the need for everyone to have one of everything just hanging around for the day when we need it — this reduces waste and makes the spiral economy&nbsp;viable.</p><p>This would be really effective for travel. I’m going on holiday to Ibiza and in my hotel room, when I arrive, is everything I need, given that the AI knows what kind of person I am and I’ve got an express list of preferences for the things that need to be there. I buy my ticket weeks in advance. The AI organises it and comes back and says “I’ve been unable to find white platform shoes in your size. You’re going to have to bring those yourself. I got you a couple of special bonus items too”, and they’ll be things you like because it recognises your taste and can extrapolate. So the work of having to look through the space of all possible objects to select what I want is no longer necessary, and I won’t have to cart everything and fret about airline baggage allowances.</p><blockquote>This is where AI has become a synthetic engine that can reshape physical&nbsp;reality</blockquote><p>This is the mega payoff because this is where AI has become a synthetic engine that can reshape physical reality in the same way it filters and reshapes images. Today the super-rich are the only people who can do this, they say they want something and point a hose of money at it until it happens; how much is not important because they no longer think in terms of value for money; they work on the metric of want=get and money simply lubricates that process beneath their level of attention. With AI suddenly that becomes everyone’s experience because it does all that work in the middle for you, which billionaires have gophers to do. It makes it a whole lot cheaper too, and can work within the financial parameters you&nbsp;have.</p> 6) Modelling <p>This works by the AI knowing all the new and second hand goods which are available in an area and using the information to identify a gap. In New York, there’s a roaring market for this object. The object is not currently for sale in London. The AI then proposes moving a bunch of this thing from New York to London to sell it here, or suggests you commission it to be manufactured in Bradford and sold. It can work out that if a whole bunch of fashionable teens in Nigeria like this thing, then there’s probably a bunch in London and Beijing who will too. AI can do market gap analysis based on patterns that it can perceive in culture, or based on a whole bunch of people saying they want to buy something that isn’t in the market yet. In that case I make a MAP for a thing that I wish existed, I publish it as specification and say “if this existed I would buy it”; get enough people who want that and it prompts manufacturers to make something that fits the MAP and sell it to the people who want it. Everything comes with MAPs so it is warrantied and can be tracked and this helps it to keep its value, so when the fad is over, it can still be sold on at a good&nbsp;price.</p><blockquote>There’s going to be more, much&nbsp;more</blockquote> Mattereum Provides a Marketplace for AI&nbsp;Services <p>So, this is just what I can see extrapolating from what we know about AI now; there’s going to be more, much more, but we’re going to have our hands full bringing all this to life. We’re just at the start; some AI stuff will no doubt be done within Mattereum itself, but most of it will be done by partners, like we are doing with&nbsp;NeoSwap.</p><p>What Mattereum provides structurally is a marketplace where <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/p9CSjcCoLqFptogjW/ai-oracles-on-blockchain-1">companies that have AI technology can monetise it</a> by attaching it into transactions as a certifier. Imagine a bunch of kids in college; they’ve come up with some fantastically sophisticated recogniser technology. I apply it inside of the Mattereum system and we use it for something like clothing sizing. You show me a bunch of pictures of a piece of clothing with a ruler somewhere in the shot and I’ll tell you exactly what size this thing is. Rather than having to measure a piece of clothing, I download the app then just slap a ruler on a table, take three or four pictures, I upload them, and it comes back with sizing information for the clothing, and it automatically generates size warranties for every garment that goes by. They could just run that as a business because it’s far more economically efficient for customers to just lay all the clothes out and take pictures of them rather than having to pick up the garment and measure every sizing dimension.</p><blockquote>Mattereum provides a marketplace where companies that have AI technology can monetise&nbsp;it</blockquote><p>The market provides the AI creators with a way of monetizing their product because they can now take a margin on the transactions of the goods to which they’re attaching AI generated information. Without that, they wouldn’t have a market because they would have to then generate an entire ecology around their AI to be able to get access to a transaction stream, but Mattereum provides them with a ready-made market where they can very, very rapidly monetize their AI work simply by plugging it into an existing transaction stream. They’ll need to raise some capital so that they’ve got a pool of money to back the AI with when it occasionally makes a mistake and they have to pay out on certification. They need to have the funds, but if they’re good, what they’re getting is a continuous revenue stream from de-risking other people’s transactions, and they don’t need very much capital because they will want to be super reliable.</p><blockquote>There’s a whole fascinating AI ecosystem out there waiting to&nbsp;happen</blockquote><p>There’s a whole fascinating AI ecosystem out there waiting to happen, and Mattereum has the potential to form its core by using the blockchain to drive innovation through real world asset NFTs that come with Mattereum Asset Passports. The future really is here, and we aim to be part of making it more evenly distributed.</p><p>*introductory summary created by GPT3&nbsp;AI</p><p>If you are working on an AI project that you think could enhance or be enhanced by the Mattereum system get in touch with us via contact@mattereum.com</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/ai-oracles-super-empower-real-world-assets-on-the-blockchain-and-super-empower-ai-to-act-in-the-619aa2ba5bf1">AI Oracles super empower Real World Assets on the blockchain — and super empower AI to act in the…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">Gambling</a> has been a hotly contested topic for many years in Germany, which begs the question: Is online gambling regulated in Germany? Yes, it is indeed as of July 2021.</p>



<p>That year saw the new German Interstate Treaty on Gambling (ISTG) or Glücksspielstaatsvertrag (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">GlüStV 2021</a>) come into effect, which legalizes and regulates online gambling in Germany across all 16 states.</p>



<p>The ISTG was originally established in 2012 in response to the growing popularity of online gambling, but failed to get all states on board and thus neither banned nor legalized it. That left the German market in limbo, attracted international operators, and drew consumers to a black market. The new treaty of 2021, however, legalized various forms of gambling online in Germany and set out strict regulations for gambling operators, including a ban on certain games, deposit limits, an advertising ban as well as mandatory ID-checks.</p>



<p>A newly established authority – Gemeinsame Glücksspielbehörde der Länder (<a href="https://www.gluecksspiel-behoerde.de/en/">GGL</a>) – oversees the market and issues licenses to operators which are valid for five years. This regulatory body is based in Halle (Saale) in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.</p>



 Controversy surrounding gambling restrictions. 



<p>While the treaty has been controversial amongst operators and players, with some critics arguing that it unfairly restricts the rights of German citizens to gamble online, its main objective is to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">protect players, promote responsible gaming and prevent problem gambling</a>.</p>



<p>These are the restrictions applicable to players while gambling in Germany:</p>



  €1,000 monthly deposit limit  €1 stake limit on online casino slots  No Live Casino Games or progressive Jackpot-Slots are permitted  Reduced sports betting opportunities as live betting is not allowed  



 Different types of gambling and their regulation. 



<p>Online gambling can be categorized in online casino games, sportsbooks and sports betting as well as lottery games. Each has its own legislation that operators need to be aware of, and each requires a separate license.</p>



 Online Casinos in Germany 



<p>In 2021 <a href="https://www.statista.com/study/46614/gambling-and-betting-in-germany/">regulated online casinos yielded returns of €6.4 billion in Germany</a>. Combine this with the revenue of the still thriving yet unregulated black market, and the significance of the online gambling market cannot go unnoticed.</p>



<p>The Interstate Treaty distinguishes between online casino games such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and virtual slot games. Each federal state can decide whether to issue limited licenses to operators or impose a state monopoly to offer casino games. This means certain states could restrict providers from offering roulette, blackjack or baccarat.</p>



<p>Gambling operators wishing to offer online poker games can apply for a separate license through the GGL. The process to obtain a sports betting, virtual slot game or poker license is very similar and has only minor differences.</p>



 Sportsbooks &amp; Sports betting 



<p>Sports betting continues to grow in Germany. For example, <a href="https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1211874/umfrage/umsatzentwicklung-auf-dem-markt-fuer-sportwetten-in-deutschland/">2016 saw €6.14 Billion in revenue, which grew to €9.28 Billion in 2019</a>. The drop to €7.79 Billion in the following year was due to reduced sporting activity in the midst of the Covid-19 -pandemic. Yet, the numbers remain high and are growing year after year thanks to easier access to sports betting, for example through mobile betting sites and a versatile offering that also includes esports and virtual sports.</p>



<p>Sportsbooks are by no means a new feature in cities all around the country, though. <a href="https://www.tipico-group.com/en/">Tipico</a> opened over 1,300 franchises in Germany and Austria since its formation in 2004 and was able to move parts of its business online after <a href="https://www.tipico-group.com/en/tipico-receives-license-for-sports-betting/">obtaining a sports betting license in 2020</a>. Other big players have long been established through extensive sponsorships of professional football clubs and other sports teams.</p>



 Lottery 



<p>Lotteries have a long history in Germany, as the state lottery is very popular. States also have their own local lotteries. Private operators can act as brokers for state lottery products. Should they operate in multiple states, the gambling regulator of Rhineland-Palatine is responsible for licensing until January 2023, when the newly established GGL takes over. Bingo products fall under lotteries, too, and can be offered online.</p>

 How does the online gambling regulation affect players? 



<p>The German government has put a number of measures in place to ensure that online gambling is safe and fair for all involved. Protection of players is most important, including the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">prevention of underage gambling</a>. Therefore, consumers can feel safe and secure when playing.</p>



<p>Thanks to the new gambling treaty, all online casinos operating in the country are required to obtain a license which ensures that the internet gambling site meets certain security standards and implements the many restrictions that other international licensors don’t require. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta Gaming Authority (MGA)</a> – the most popular licensor within the EU – requires no deposit or stake limits but has strict Anti-money-laundering regulations and prohibits minors from accessing real-money gambling products. This is just one example of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">how gambling regulations differ from country to country</a>.</p>



<p>Players must be aware, that they cannot deposit more than €1,000 per month and that stakes on slots are limited to € per spin. A centralized database will collect player information such as name, date of birth, address and the amount deposited. There is also an option to pause or block access to online gambling sites, should one wish to. Measures such as these are meant to promote responsible gaming and avoid gambling addiction.</p>

 How are operators affected by the ISTG? 



<p>Looking at the various restrictions of the gambling treaty, operators must be aware of the impact the Glücksspielstaatsvertrag (ISTG) may have on their business. The following should be taken into consideration:</p>



 Deposit limits 



<p>Players are not allowed to deposit more than 1,000 Euros each month across all licensed operators. This means there is a relatively low cap on potential earnings. Operators must stand out and be attractive to numerous players to be profitable.</p>



 Stake limits 



<p>Stakes are limited to €1 per spin on slots. In addition to a 5-second wait for each spin, another revenue stream for operators is restricted. Offering <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/germany-aml-kyc-regulations/">the best user experience is therefore key</a>.</p>



 Games restrictions 



<p>What players may find at unlicensed casinos and sports betting sites is not necessarily available in Germany. Namely, live casino games, progressive jackpots and live bets are all prohibited according to the new treaty.</p>



 Taxes 



<p>In addition to revenue caps, there are also taxes to be paid. 5.3% stake tax applies to every euro wagered. In order to remain competitive and profitable, many operators chose to lower the return-to-player on certain games.</p>



 Advertising 



<p>Advertising is restricted. Influencer marketing for virtual slots is prohibited. Furthermore, it is not allowed to broadcast any ads promoting virtual slots, online poker and casino games between 6:00 and 21:00 on TV, radio and other medium. Most importantly, ads must not be targeted at minors or other vulnerable groups and cannot feature them in any form.</p>



 ID verification 



<p>One of the most consequential new regulations is player verification. Upon registration, players must verify their identity which seeks to prevent underage and fraudulent gambling. Operators must choose an approved ID-verification service provider and implement a seamless and simple process to keep players engaged. A tedious process leads to users abandoning the verification step and moving to another provider. IDnow is one such approved service provider that assists operators with a world-class player verification experience powered by AI.</p>

 Preventing underage gambling. 



<p>The protection of minors in a landscape such as the online gambling world is a vital task that the new Interstate treaty is addressing head-on. Whereas players at MGA-licensed sites only need to verify their identity when withdrawing winnings, German online casinos require this verification upfront to prevent underage gambling.</p>



<p>In order to obtain a license from the GGL, online casinos must meet a number of requirements. These include ensuring that they have appropriate security measures in place to protect player data, having their games independently tested for fairness, and complying with strict anti-money laundering regulations. They must prove that no minors have access to real-money casino games.</p>

 Remaining EU-compliant with AutoIdent from IDnow. 



<p>Having to verify players’ details upon registration in the online gambling sector before any deposit has been made can make or break an operator. If you fail to keep players engaged and struggle to provide a seamless, compliant and easy-to-use verification process, you lose revenue.</p>



<p>IDnow tackles this issue with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>. Thanks to the power of AI, our tool can accommodate a large number of verifications simultaneously while checking users biometric data and adhering to the strictest regulatory requirements. This remote KYC method has been approved by the Commission for Youth Media Protection (Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz – <a href="https://www.kjm-online.de/en/">KJM</a>) and is available in over 30 languages and compliant with 195 jurisdictions globally.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Passwordless authentication has become a trending topic in IT over the past two years. This comes to no surprise, with all the password-related security incidents that happened in the past years. Passwords are known as a security risks, and passwords are inconvenient to the users. Passwordless authentication bears the promise of increasing security and reducing friction. Done right, this is true. Passwordless authentication can overcome the notion of “balancing security with convenience”, which factually says that convenience goes down when the level of security increases, to a win-win approach: Security increases, while convenience improves as well.</p>
 What is passwordless authentication? 
<p>It seems to be very clear what passwordless authentication means. But the fact that some vendors claim being “truly passwordless” already indicates that there are different flavors of passwordless authentication. At the end, it is a matter of definition what is perceived as being passwordless authentication, and what not.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the user, every approach for authentication where no password is needed is passwordless. But there are solutions such as traditional Enterprise SSO where a user could use a passwordless authentication to a password vault, from where the password then is sent to an application. The same happens in privileged SSO of PAM solutions, where administrators authenticate to a console and can start session with passwords being sent in the background. These types of solutions are not in the scope of passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>There are two elements that are required for passwordless authentication</p>
 
 No password is required for user authentication (but a strong authentication is performed) 
 No password (or password hash) is travelling over the network 
 
<p>Sometimes, there is a password used for authentication, but no password is travelling over the network (more frequently, a password travels anyway for initial authentication to a server). That does not qualify for being named a passwordless authentication solution.</p>
<p>Passwordless authentication means that there is a strong MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), commonly 2FA( Two Factor Authentication) happening, and no password is travelling. “Truly passwordless” then means that there is no password needed neither for initial setup nor as a fallback solution. KuppingerCole Analysts uses the more generic definition, based on the two above-listed elements.&nbsp;</p>
 Is passwordless authentication safe? 
<p>When authentication becomes more convenient, this triggers the question of whether this is sufficiently secure. Passwordless authentication, by definition, must be about a strong authentication. This, by definition, means that there must be more than one factor.</p>
<p>The common factors involved in passwordless authentication are a smartphone and the user’s biometric. In the setup a binding between the device and the user takes place, where cryptographic information that is used for the authentication is placed in a secure element – a piece of hardware that securely holds encrypted information. Modern devices such as computers and smartphones come with such secure elements.</p>
<p>This binds the user to the device. With biometric authentication enabled at the device, such as fingerprint readers or face recognition via the camera, the user can authenticate without a password, while the device binding provides a second factor. Only if it is the specific user with a device associated to him or her, the authentication is valid.</p>
<p>There are other options such as FIDO2 tokens or smartcards that can be used for passwordless authentication. We also observe an uptake of wearables such as wristbands and smart watches, where biometric authentication even becomes continuous by for instance tracking the heartbeat.</p>
<p>Done right, passwordless authentication provides a strong level of security. Saying that it is safe anyway is problematic, given that there is no 100% security. But passwordless authentication commonly provides a significant higher level of security than traditional username/password authentication and even than many of the established 2FA approaches.</p>
 What should be considered when choosing passwordless authentication solutions? 
<p>There are two main groups of passwordless authentication solutions. One are the ones that are integrated into Access Management solutions such as the ones from Microsoft (Entra Azure AD), Okta, Ping, OneLogin or one of the many other vendors in this segment. Then there are the specialized solutions, provided for instance by Beyond Identity, HYPR or 1Kosmos, to name just a few.</p>
<p>An important differentiator is that integrated solutions serve every authentication to the Access Management solution and thus to the services that are integrated with that solution. In contrast, specialized passwordless authentication solutions are focused on either specific use cases such as customer/consumer authentication, or at serving a broader variety of use cases, starting with integrated desktop authentication and a common passwordless authentication approach across multiple Access Management solutions.</p>
<p>Integrated solutions are easy to implement and come with products that might already be in place, but are, in tendency, more limited in scope.</p>
<p>That scope is one of the important differentiators. Another one is the breadth of supported authenticators. The more flexible that is addressed, the more use cases within the organization can be served. Also important are the account recovery capabilities, which define how lost, stolen or just new devices are treated in efficient processes.</p>
<p>A comprehensive overview about passwordless authentication solutions and the criteria to consider when picking a solutions is provided by the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81215/passwordless-authentication">KuppingerCole Leadership Compass on passwordless authentication</a>.</p>
 When will passwords finally die? 
<p>“The password is dead” is a saying that exists for way over a decade. Unfortunately, passwords are still ubiquitous. They will not quickly disappear. A lot of websites for customers and consumers still only provide username and passwords for authentication. However, there is a trend towards utilizing passwordless authentication, and there is a significant uptake in adoption in enterprises. But with all the legacy applications and services in place that still expect passwords, instead of supporting federation protocols such as OIDC and OAuth2 or even direct passwordless authentication with the FIDO Alliance WebAuthn protocol, we will be able to reduce passwords. Like the mainframe exists still, passwords will be here at least for decades. We will need (way) less of them, and we are able to hide them. Most will be based on passwordless authentication approaches in the future. But somewhere, there will still be passwords around.</p>

				  Indicio will upgrade Hyperledger Indy’s SDK thanks to a Code With Us challenge; plus the first ever Bifold Summit.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>2023 has started with a bang in the Hyperledger identity community as the open-source Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries projects are the focus of new development goals sponsored by the government of British Columbia in Canada.</p>
<p>BC Gov is one of the leading developers of open-source decentralized identity technology, and one of the tools it uses to do this quickly and effectively is through its <a href="https://marketplace.digital.gov.bc.ca/opportunities/code-with-us/5992f66c-b2ac-4b2a-a3a3-3eb3473e9eca">“Code With Us”</a> challenge, a procurement mechanism for public sector organizations to pay developers to code.</p>
<p>Thanks to winning one of the latest challenges, Indicio will upgrade the Hyperledger Indy SDK in all Hyperledger Indy and Aries software. This includes updating all BC Gov Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) installations still using the Indy SDK to use Aries Askar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aries Askar is an open-source project in the Hyperledger Foundation providing secure storage and cryptographic operations for Aries agent wallets. It is written in the Rust programming language and allows the creation and deletion of wallets, cryptographic key management, and generic record management. Aries Askar’s wallet implementation assists in various decentralized identity interactions such as establishing connections, DIDComm messaging, and receiving and presenting credentials. To enable all this, Indicio will create a Python script that uses an Aries Askar feature to migrate ACA-Py Indy SDK format storage data into Aries Askar format.</p>
<p>If you aren’t currently working with Indy SDK or Aries Askar, you might be wondering what this all means. For developers currently working in the space, this is very exciting news and something that will make it easier to update their projects to the next generation of open-source identity tools, functions, libraries, and repositories. This work is a milestone in the evolution of Indy and Aries to make room for further enhancements and project developments in 2023.</p>
<p>“BC Gov’s Code With Us challenge is a model for driving public sector digital transformation,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “As a company, we’re deeply committed to advancing open-source decentralized identity technologies and initiatives like this really move the needle in ways that benefit everyone.We’re excited to work with BCGov on this—especially as several of Indicio’s developers have already been developing and contributing to these particular efforts even before the challenge was announced.”</p>
<p>BC Gov also selected another company for the Code With Us Challenge project to <a href="https://marketplace.digital.gov.bc.ca/opportunities/code-with-us/7febdc1a-5ae9-4c23-b022-60ee0db5db30">Implement a version of the Indy CLI based on the Hyperledger Indy / Aries Shared Components.</a> And because Indicio was also working on efforts related to this challenge, we were able to also contribute portions of our work to the team that was tasked with this project as well.</p>
<p>The Bifold Summit</p>
<p>Indicio is also involved in another open-source project, the first ever <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/Bifold+Summit+2023">Bifold Summit</a>, which is focused on developing a digital wallet for using verifiable credentials. Indicio contributed the <a href="https://indicio.tech/hyperledger-aries-sees-new-coordinated-effort-to-produce-complete-mobile-agent/">initial Bifold code</a> to Hyperledger Aries after <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-is-a-finalist-for-dhs-digital-wallets-user-interface-challenge/">Indicio’s own wallet was named a finalist</a> in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) Trusted User Interface for Digital Wallets Challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By donating the user interface (UI) to Aries, other developers would have access to a baseline to develop on. Now, with over a dozen organizations and individual developers helping to grow the project, Bifold is one of the most exciting projects at Hyperledger, garnering attention from a wide range of stakeholders from across the blockchain community.</p>

<p>Functionland is a decentralized cloud alternative that puts data back in users' hands with personal servers, and profits back in developers' hands through blockchain protocols.</p> Getting Rid of the Data Middleman <p>Users today know that if they use a centralized server, there is a good chance that their data is being used to develop and sell them products. Decentralized apps put private data back in users' control, and decentralized storage solutions utilize a network of nodes to keep files accessible (both on and offline) to users. But what if you want to store your personal files yourself and for free? No middleman - just you and your own personal server?</p><p>This was the impetus for FxBlox, a storage device that is powered by open source, and built on top of Functionland's Fula Protocol (more on this in a moment). </p>FxBlox was designed by industrial designer Yves Béhar.<p>FxBlox is modular, meaning you can choose how much storage is right for you. Usually cloud storage providers offer either too little or too much storage, making it difficult for developers and users to find a solution that meets their needs. With FxBlox you can have anywhere from 1TB to tens of TB of storage capacity in one unit. </p><p>You start with a base tower - the Fula tower for the FxBlox. It includes three USB-C ports and can connect to external devices. Then you add on individual towers for more storage capacity or other features like a hub tower as a docking station. </p><p>Users engage with the Fula Network as both resource consumers and resource providers when they own an FxBlox. Owning an FxBlox is not required to access services on the network, but users will have to pay fees to FxBlox owners if they don't have one operating in the network. This incentivizes users to participate in the network so they can break free from storage subscriptions and "end the rental web", as Functionland says.</p> Fula Protocol <p>The Fula Protocol enables consumers to replace their central cloud providers with a decentralized alternative built on the IPFS ecosystem by leveraging three sub-protocols: File, Graph, and AI. Each enables users to securely receive and provide resources on the Fula Network. </p><p>Importantly, there is an abstraction layer attached to each sub-protocol. This is the final piece in the puzzle for app developers. With the Fula Network handling the back end/server and the FxBlox handling file storage, all you need is to know how to write front end code!</p><p>Functionland is currently integrating Fission's WNFS into the Fula Protocol to empower developers with a ready-to-go decentralized and encrypted file system. They created <a href="https://github.com/functionland/react-native-wnfs">a bridge for rs-wnfs</a> to enable mobile developers to use it in React Native.</p><p>WNFS is used on the client side and data is backed up on a network of connected backend devices with Graphsync and libp2p. Backups can exist on a trustless network since only the user has the keys to decrypt the files. So even when part of the network goes offline, the user can still access their data from the backups. </p><p>Ehsan, Co-Founder of Functionland, had this to say about why they chose to utilize WNFS:</p><blockquote>Functionland is on a mission to put full ownership of individuals' most important digital assets - data, photos, files, etc. - back into their own hands. We use WNFS to ensure data security, because encryption and security play a key role in Functionland's mission. </blockquote> Fotos <p>The first dapp to connect to FxBlox is Functionland's FxFotos app. <a href="https://fx.land/fotos-functionlands-dedicated-photo-app/">FxFotos</a> is a media gallery app to back up and sync media files. It can use any decentralized wallet for user authentication. As stated previously, when the app is connected to FxBlox no other back end is required and the data is stored locally and (optionally) across the entire Fula Network. The FxFotos app doesn't store any of your data, it only accesses it when you give it permission (by connecting).</p>FxFotos and FxFiles (coming soon!)<p>Our CEO Boris Mann had this to say about Functionland:</p><blockquote>It's awesome to see the IPFS ecosystem being able to adopt and implement protocols together. We've been wanting to see more mobile-first usage of the protocol stack that Fission is working on, and it's great to see Rust WNFS be live in the app store. Congrats on shipping, Functionland team!</blockquote> Explore FxFotos and Functionland <p>If you'd like to learn more about Functionland, you can visit their <a href="https://fx.land/">website</a>. The FxFotos app is available in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=land.fx.fotos&amp;pli=1">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/fx-fotos/id1640008383">Apple App Store</a>. There is also a file manager app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=land.fx.files&amp;pli=1">FxFiles</a>, and plans for an identity/password manager app as well!</p>

 Web Assembly<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">Web Assembly</a> is a popular format for running binary applications in web browsers (with wide support).</p><p>This can have a few advantages but the interesting thing for us is that this can allow sharing of implementations of functionality: eg credential issuance, DID resolving, cryptographic functions etc which you may not want to necessarily re-implement in javascript or typescript.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk">SSI-SDK</a> is an implementation of a lot of standards for self soverign identity, so it is a great candidate to expose via WASM to web apps. </p><p>Now there is a whole lot of (lets face it: tedious) machinery to get wasm to be compiled from go (ok if you are really curious you can <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/pull/265/">read the code</a>), but the upshot of it is that there is a .wasm file produced which when consumed in just the right way in a web page, allows you to call functions from javascript, that look and feel like javascript, but are actually running in the web-assembly machiner (and compiled down from golang).</p><p>Say you had a function in golang land which looked like this: </p>   <code>// Resolve attempts to resolve a DID for a given method<br>func (dr Resolver) Resolve(did string, opts ...ResolutionOptions) (*DIDResolutionResult, error) {<br>  ...<br></code>   <p>You could call it from the web via:</p>   <code>console.log(resolveDid("did:peer:0z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH"));<br></code>   <p>and it would Just Work thanks to WASM!
Well, thanks to WASM and a lot of boring glue. </p> ChatGPT<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>But the boring glue is what I am hear to talk about it, as it turns out ChatGPT can be quite helpful for the boring (but important) glue. </p><p>(If you have been under a rock and haven't heard of ChatGPT - google it now and then come back)</p><p>So firstly, there is some work to be done to build a shim between the JS type world and the Golang type world: </p>   <code>// 1. Simplest function - note we wrap things with js.ValueOf (if a primitive you don't technically need to)<br>func sayHello(_ js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {<br>    return js.ValueOf("Hello from golang via wasm!")<br>}<br></code>   <p>This gets more complicated when you have more complicated types, but essentially this is the pattern you follow to expose functionality.
Now I am a pretty ordinary golang developer, so being lazy I thought I would see if I could teach ChatGPT about WASM and if it could write this glue code for me. </p><p>Helpfully the ssi-sdk has a good amount of test coverage, so to teach ChatCPT about the api I was trying to expose, I pasted in a test case which exercised the api.
The functionality was the "Resolve" function above, and the test code showed how to use it. </p><p>I then asked ChatGPT to provide a WASM friendly wrapper for that functionality:</p><p></p><p>To do this, I gave it an example of some previously written code that uses some (unrelated) functionality and also exposes it to WASM.
As yoyu can see it was happy to provide an implementation which whilst close, with some minor tweaking. </p><p>I was able to tidy it up and include it in the <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/pull/265">pull request</a>. Handy - thanks ChatGPT!
Moreover, as I am an ordinary golang developer I was able to ask it to put in a retry on error (also some important glue) when using WASM from a web app (this staved a minor amount of googling): </p><p></p> Parting thoughts<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>WASM seems surpremely useful, and ChatGPT, while terrifying on one level, looks like it can really take away some of the grind work from developers, allowing us to move much faster into more platforms. And no, this post was NOT written by ChatGPT, but by a human.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

 First at all: What is Decentralized Science: 
<p>Decentralized Science (DeSci) is a new approach to scientific research that utilizes decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, to facilitate collaboration and data sharing among scientists. The goal of decentralized science is to create a more open and transparent scientific process that allows for the free exchange of ideas and data, and to ensure that the research is conducted in a fair and impartial manner.</p>
 Main benefits and advantages of DeSci: 
<p>One of the key benefits of decentralized science is that it allows for greater collaboration among scientists from different institutions and countries. Traditional scientific research often relies on centralized institutions, such as universities and research labs, which can create barriers to collaboration and data sharing. By using decentralized technologies, scientists can collaborate and share data in a more seamless and efficient manner, regardless of their location or affiliation.</p>
<p>Another advantage of decentralized science is that it can help to reduce the risk of scientific misconduct, such as data fabrication or plagiarism. With decentralized technologies, it is easier to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. This can help to increase the integrity and reliability of scientific research.</p>
<p>Decentralized science also has the potential to democratize the scientific process by making it more accessible to a wider range of researchers. For example, scientists in developing countries may not have access to the same resources and funding as those in developed countries. With decentralized technologies, these researchers can more easily collaborate with their counterparts around the world and contribute to the scientific community.</p>
DeSci – Decentralized Science
 More benefits and challeges for Decentralized Science implementation 
<p>There are already several projects that are utilizing decentralized technologies to facilitate scientific research. For example, the Open Science Chain is a blockchain-based platform that allows scientists to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform also provides a decentralized repository for scientific data, which can be accessed by researchers around the world.</p>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of decentralized science, there are also some challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the issue of trust. With traditional scientific research, scientists rely on established institutions and peer review processes to ensure the reliability of research. With decentralized science, it may be more difficult to establish trust in the research process.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the issue of data security. Decentralized technologies, such as blockchain, can provide a high level of security, but there is still the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks. Scientists will need to take steps to ensure that their data is protected and secure when using decentralized technologies.</p>
 Some cases of DeSci in the real life: 
<p>There are several examples of decentralized science projects that are utilizing decentralized technologies to facilitate scientific research. Some examples include:</p>
 
 Open Science Chain: This is a blockchain-based platform that allows scientists to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform also provides a decentralized repository for scientific data, which can be accessed by researchers around the world. 
 Science Token: This is a platform that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized marketplace for scientific research. Scientists can use the platform to fund their research projects and to receive rewards for their contributions. 
 DataCoin: This is a decentralized platform that allows scientists to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform uses blockchain technology to ensure the security and integrity of the data. 
 Researchpool: This is a decentralized platform that connects researchers with funding sources and allows them to share data and collaborate on research projects. The platform uses blockchain technology to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 
 Zencity: This is a decentralized platform that allows scientists to collaborate on research projects and to share data in a secure and transparent manner. The platform uses blockchain technology to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 
 
 DeSci future potential and importance: 
<p>Decentralized science has the potential to revolutionize the way that scientific research is conducted. DeSci utilizes decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, to facilitate collaboration and data sharing among scientists. Some of the reasons why DeSci is important include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Increased collaboration: DeSci allows for greater collaboration among scientists from different institutions and countries. This can lead to faster and more impactful research, as scientists can more easily share ideas and data. 
 Increased transparency: DeSci can create a more open and transparent scientific process by making it easier to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 1st January to 7th&nbsp;January <p>Welcome to another astounding edition of our Veriscope Regulatory Recap! This week we cover ECB’s plan to regulate crypto under online gambling laws, Israel’s Securities regulator’s actions to bring crypto under its oversight, and the Moroccan Central Bank governor’s announcement on the country’s first draft of crypto regulations. Let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> ECB calls for regulating Crypto as Online&nbsp;Gambling (<a href="https://www.brinknews.com/what-will-happen-when-the-ecb-stops-bhttps://www.brinknews.com/what-will-happen-when-the-ecb-stops-buying-euro-bonds/uying-euro-bonds/">Image Source</a>)<p>The European Central Bank is comparing cryptocurrencies with gambling in its blog of Jan. 5th, 2023, citing the speculative nature of unbacked virtual&nbsp;assets.</p><p>ECB advocates for building efficient “guardrails that address regulatory gaps and arbitrage” in the crypto world, which according to the Bank, will reduce the social costs of the crypto&nbsp;asset.</p><p>That said, the ECB admits that introducing regulations could be like walking a tightrope. This is why it insists that while making people aware of the crypto market’s loopholes, it must not introduce poor regulation and broken&nbsp;models.</p><p>For their implementation, the EU’s “Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets” is considered the main tool along with regulations in all industry segments, including crypto-asset lending and non-custodial wallet services.</p><p>Overall, the overarching goal of the ECB is to have regulation with a global reach to prevent regulatory arbitrage.</p> Israel’s Securities Regulator Wants to Oversee&nbsp;Crypto <p>According to Israel’s securities market watchdog, crypto assets are often used for investment and, therefore, should be covered under its oversight.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/antoniocensabel/status/1610893885647069185?s=20&amp;t=rWbFOzqn3KKpa_RWJdKsAA">Image Source</a>)<p>The ISA suggests legislative amendments to extend the existing securities laws to digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>While justifying its advocacy for regulation, the ISA cites the need for protecting investors and tackling crypto-asset risks.</p><p>The document has now moved into an intermediate phase for public feedback and comments. It will remain open until mid-February and will wait another six months for their eventual transition into final approval.</p> Morocco’s Central Bank Drafts the Country’s First Crypto&nbsp;Bill (<a href="https://www.townandtourist.com/best-time-to-visit-morocco/">Image Source</a>)<p>Morrocco’s first-ever crypto bill is ready to be discussed with several industry stakeholders, according to Abdellatif Jouahiri, the Governor of Morocco’s Central Bank, Bank Al-Maghrib.</p><p>The draft bill aims to define crypto and its role within the country’s context and protect consumers without throttling innovation.</p><p>While the Central Bank has collaborated with the IMF and the World bank to prepare the document, it will discuss it with other regulators, including the Moroccan Capital Markets Authority (AMMC), the Insurance Supervisory Authority and Social Security (ACAPS),&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Morocco is the fastest-growing crypto-user economy in Northern Africa. The percentage share of the country’s population owning digital assets increased from 2.4% in 2021 to 3.1% in&nbsp;2022.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-regulation-world-how-laws-for-digital-assets-changed-in-2022">Crypto regulation world: How laws for digital assets changed in&nbsp;2022</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-winter-wef-blames-it-on-regulators-indecisiveness">Crypto Winter: WEF Blames it on Regulators’ Indecisiveness</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-what-why-how">Shyft Veriscope — What, Why,&nbsp;How</a></p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies have received a lot of attention in recent years, and for good reason. These cutting-edge technologies can revolutionize the way we exchange value and conduct transactions. They are likely to become much more common by 2023. These technologies have the potential to transform the way we live and work, from financial transactions to supply chain management. Blockchain is an emerging technology with the potential to change the way we live and work. The reason blockchain is predicted to emerge as a key technology is that it can offer new business models and possibilities. It will also emerge because it will greatly improve the efficiency and security of a wide range of transactions and procedures. Many businesses are investing in blockchain to get a competitive advantage over their competitors by embracing this emerging technology as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Cloud Computing</p>



<p>Cloud computing will be an emerging technology in 2023 because of its potential to supply scalable and flexible computing resources. Organizations may access the resources they need on-demand and pay only for what they use by storing and processing data on a network of distant servers. This makes it suitable for enterprises of various sizes since it lets them scale their operations up or down as needed. Cloud computing may expedite operations and minimize expenses by removing the need for costly hardware and IT infrastructure. Cloud trends are largely influencing enterprises' investment plans, digital business decision-making processes, and vendor and technology choices. In 2021, the worldwide cloud computing industry was worth USD 368.97 billion, and it is predicted to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.7% from 2022 to 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IoT (Internet of Things)</p>



<p>The Internet of Things has emerged as one of the most promising technologies of the decade. The potential for IoT in the future is boundless. Today, many gadgets or 'things' are wifi-enabled, which means they can connect to the internet. Devices in the network may connect, gather data, and send it across the network without the need for human involvement. As more gadgets connect to the internet, the number of IoT devices is likely to expand significantly. Because of its potential to alter the way we live and work, IoT is predicted to be an emerging technology in 2023.

 With crypto fraud at an all-time high, the UK’s National Crime Agency announces a brand-new dedicated unit. 



 



<p>The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) will form a brand-new division specifically designed to tackle crypto crime, in the latest sign of crypto making inroads into the mainstream, with both good and bad results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NCA’s ‘Crypto Cell’ will initially contain just five officers who will be solely responsible for providing support on new and existing crypto-related investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UK’s decision to create a dedicated unit for the crypto sector, rather than merely having a national crime agency that also investigates crypto, is a forward-thinking move, especially considering its April 2022 pledge to make the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">UK a global hub</a> for crypto asset technology and investment. In May 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it would add 20 new positions to its renamed Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (formerly the Cyber Unit).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The announcement of the new UK initiative comes at just the right time, following recent reports that from 2021-2022 <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/crypto/crypto-fraud-leaps-in-uk-as-scammers-target-unwary-amateurs?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=CRNW&amp;utm_campaign=00000184-be95-dc5a-ad8f-feb5066e0003">cryptocurrency fraud in the UK</a> rose by 32%, from £171 million to £226 million. The stark rise has been attributed to the cost-of-living crisis, with people more desperate and therefore susceptible to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/top-crypto-scams/">crypto scams</a>, such as Phishing Scams, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">Romance Scams</a>, Investment Scams, and some even being duped into using fake crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Against the backdrop of 2022 being a turbulent year for crypto, 2023 promises to be an interesting time for crypto, not least for the UK with its aspirations in becoming a global crypto hub. Such aspirations can only be achieved through robust, well-defined regulatory frameworks. UK crypto firms can expect to need to register with the FCA under its crypto AML / CTF regime.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>In fact, in 2022, the global crypto asset market spent so long underneath the spotlight that it almost caught a suntan, with crises including Bitcoin falling below $29,000 in May; its lowest valuation in 16 months, and Three Arrows Capital earning the dubious award of becoming the year’s first (but not last) cryptocurrency company to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bankrupt-hedge-fund-three-arrows-liquidator-begins-taking-control-assets-block-2022-12-02/">go bankrupt in July</a>. The year ended much like it began with a crypto catastrophe. In November, cryptocurrency company FTX collapsed during a liquidity crisis, triggering widespread anxiety and igniting calls for stricter regulatory supervision of the sector.&nbsp;</p>



 Fear, Fines and Fraud: The great British hope.&nbsp; 



<p>When the UK government announced plans to become a pioneer for crypto asset technology and investment, at-the-time Chancellor of the Exchequer, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-plan-to-make-uk-a-global-cryptoasset-technology-hub">Rishi Sunak said</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset technology, and the measures we’ve outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest, innovate and scale up in this country.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>While creating an environment that attracts exchanges to the UK is important, having clear regulations, along with swift punishment for institutions that do not comply is equally as integral in ensuring users feel safe and secure when using UK-based crypto exchanges. To become a global hub for crypto is a bold aim, especially considering how painfully prohibitive the UK crypto money laundering registration can be, and how difficult competing on the global stage will soon become as UK crypto exchanges juggle both domestic and European regulations. The NCA’s new unit is only likely to make the UK’s crypto landscape more perilous to traverse and may result in exchanges and users going elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since January 2021, crypto firms that wish to operate in the UK must register with the FCA, and therefore comply with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017 (including the FATF guideline amendments). Only firms with appropriate Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, source of funds checks, and proof of funds checks, can be registered to ensure no illicit money is coming through the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Financial Conduct Authority, more than 80% of crypto firms that had begun the process to become registered had either withdrawn their applications or <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/24/crypto-firms-face-being-booted-from-uk-as-fca-register-deadline-nears.html">been rejected</a>. The most common reasons for not passing were that they did not meet the required AML standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The creation of the Crypto Cell sends a clear message to crypto exchanges and users alike that the days of lax controls are over. The implementation and maintenance of robust KYC controls and technologies are imperative for the long-term viability of any crypto business.&nbsp;</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Crypto exchanges without these measures in place can expect to encounter increases in both fraud and fines in 2023. Fines that are only getting bigger, with no sign of slowing down. For example, in October 2022 <a href="https://decrypt.co/111676/treasury-fines-bittrex-53-million-sanctions-violations">Bitrex was fined $53 million</a> by the SEC (the more trigger-happy cousin of the FCA) over violations of sanctions and anti-money laundering laws.&nbsp;</p>



 With great crypto opportunity comes great crypto responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The year of 2022 wasn’t all doom and gloom for the UK and European market, however, with American crypto exchange giant <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/coinbase-crypto-winter/">Coinbase announcing plans</a> to appoint new executives to its “top team” to boost European expansion efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investment, upcoming crypto regulations, and dedicated crypto crime divisions are all strong signs that there is a consensus to create a strong and stable environment where crypto exchanges can thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the UK no longer being legally required to follow the rules outlined in the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD</a>), it decided to transpose the cryptocurrency regulation criteria from 5AMLD and 6AMLD into domestic legislation. It is also expected to do the same when the two major pieces of European crypto regulation, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">MiCA</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">TFR</a>, come into play in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, the UK Parliament passed the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3339">Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill</a>, which “will make it easier quicker for law enforcement agencies such as the National Crime Agency to seize, freeze and recover crypto assets – the digital currency increasingly used by organized criminals to launder profits from fraud, drugs and cybercrime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Crime Agency <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/who-we-are/publications/606-national-crime-agency-annual-report-2021-2022/file">seized almost £27 million</a> worth of crypto assets in 2021-2022 from zero in previous years. What it will seize in 2023, especially with its new crypto-dedicated crime division, remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is clearly a balance to be struck between offering a comparatively lighter crypto-friendly environment to attract crypto companies and users away from the US and the EU, and a robust-enough regulatory regime that offers sufficient consumer protection to placate the FCA and the newly empowered NCA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What part the Crypto Cell will play, alongside the notoriously cautious FCA, in the balancing act will become clear very soon. &nbsp;</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving crypto regulatory landscape. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;For more information on why using crypto platforms without KYC processes is a risk, check out our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">‘Buying crypto without a KYC check?

<p>2022 was a good year for SelfKey, carried by growing discussions and attention toward the importance of identity verification on Web3. In this article, we take a look at some of the major events from last year that have shaped SelfKey and the crypto industry.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re at the beginning of yet another year. While we may have seen several setbacks in 2022, it has probably cemented crypto’s position in the wider mainstream financial industry. Despite unprecedented, adverse market conditions, crypto is still here, living to fight another day.</p>
<p>2022 was a good year for SelfKey, carried by growing discussions and attention toward the importance of identity verification on Web3.</p>
<p>In this article, we take a look at some of the major events from last year that have shaped SelfKey and the crypto industry.</p>
 SelfKey Updates 
<p>SelfKey has continued its focus and vision on the decentralized identity ecosystem for Web3 and the Metaverse.</p>
<p>Products like the Metaproof Platform (formerly known as the POI Platform) and Living Avatar NFTs – utilizing the innovative technology of Soulbound NFTs governed by LOCK DAO – now make up the vital cogs of a decentralized, user-powered identity verification ecosystem that includes the SelfKey identity wallet. Users who actively contribute to secure the network can earn the work token, LOCK.</p>
<p>SelfKey believes that this ecosystem can be widely used and adapted by Web3 platforms to securely verify the identity of users on these platforms – and to effectively distinguish real users from bots.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the decentralized identity ecosystem envisioned by SelfKey and LOCK DAO can help the crypto industry in its transition toward regulatory compliance. Several events during the course of last year have led to increased discussions surrounding regulations and a greater understanding of the need for effective compliance with the crypto industry and its products.</p>
<p>SelfKey believes that policymakers should consider a decentralized and user-centric approach when creating regulatory frameworks: implementing the same centralized policies used in the legacy financial industries might very well be counter-productive for crypto and its products.</p>
<p>SelfKey views the discussions surrounding regulatory policies as a positive and necessary change that will help users take more responsibility and control over their digital assets. This evolution bodes well for bringing the crypto community closer to a decentralized future.</p>
 ETH 2.0 &amp; Merge 
<p>The much-awaited ETH merge – which marked the transition of Ethereum from a Proof-Of-Work (POW) to a Proof-Of-Stake (POS) network – also happened last year.</p>
<p>The merge and the subsequent transition – dubbed ETH 2.0 – was a major event that the crypto industry and enthusiasts watched closely. This was probably the biggest update to date for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that $KEY, the native token of the SelfKey ecosystem, is an ERC-20 token, SelfKey was also excited to see the impact the upgrade could bring to the Ethereum network.</p>
 Celsius, BlockFi &amp; FTX 
<p>Along with all the great things that have happened during the course of 2022, some unfortunate events also made it to the headlines. The biggest of these was when Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX froze withdrawals for their users and filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Although on first impressions this may have felt like a squarely negative series of events for the crypto industry, the most important takeaway is that all these failed platforms were centralized.</p>
<p>Crypto and the underlying blockchain technology were developed to help rectify the flaws of the centralized financial industry. Yet, a majority of the crypto industry still relies heavily on centralization – and that’s where we are still continuing to see major failures.</p>
<p>Even though the industry still has a way to evolve toward being decentralization positive, it is evident that the industry is on the right path – the purge of incompetent centralized platforms and products is evidence of this trajectory. In parallel, more products are being developed with a focus on decentralization.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>2022 has been an eventful year for SelfKey and the crypto industry. We have witnessed clear signs that the community is evolving toward a decentralized future.</p>
<p>We saw the failure of centralized platforms that gambled with user funds, which has led to serious discussions and recommendations for regulatory compliance in the crypto industry. Proper regulations that will offer clarity and security for users and platforms alike are a necessity.</p>
<p>Decentralization is a cycle and an ever-evolving process, and the community will have to continuously work toward achieving more decentralization as we move through 2023. Similarly, regulations need to focus on the pain points of users and aim to be more user-centric. Combined, these goals can further ensure more user participation in the space, making the industry more decentralized.</p>
<p>SelfKey and LOCK DAO aspires to help the community during this crucial period of evolution. SelfKey hopes that 2023 will be yet another year filled with new challenges and new opportunities that will help the crypto community thrive.</p>
 Happy New Year!

<p>Everyone who loves passwords and multi-factor authentication, raise your hand. </p>

<p></p>

<p>“I’m MEEEE!” I want to yell at a website that’s asked me for the 4th time to go to my email and phone and get a 6-digit code, or go to my email and click another link, or… some stupid thing.</p>

<p>Here’s another thing that drives me nuts: I have a password for my Mac and another for my Google Account. I’m in security, after all, so they are different. </p>

<p>The point is, I know both by muscle memory. Do you know how many times I type the wrong password into the wrong prompt? Any guesses? Nope. More. A lot. </p>

<p>I’m ME!!! Why can’t I get into my accounts by just being ME? I can use my fingerprint for my pixel phone and FaceID for my iPhone. Why can’t I do that everywhere?</p>

<p>Wait? Is there something new out there? Can I finally give passwords the finger and move on? Please tell me about it!</p>

<p>Let’s start with Multi-Factor Authentication, specifically the One Time Password (OTP) type.</p>

<p>If you wanted to play the blame game (and I do), you could blame passwords for the existence of SMS OTP and its variants (and I do that, too). Passwords are weak and can easily be stolen or guessed. So to prove (digitally) that I am who I say I am, websites prompt me to enter a second password -- information that shows I have something or am someone, and if someone stole my password they hopefully do not have access to my SMS messages. Thanks, passwords, for introducing more complexity into my life.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn">,WebAuthN</a> (which my co-founder Alex wrote about <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/passkey-user-experience-two-steps-forward-one-step-back">,here</a>) is changing that. WebAuthN is a not-so-sexy technical term for Web Authentication. Passkey is a sexier marketing term for the latest extension of WebAuthN. Instead of inventing a complex password you’d never remember or reuse everywhere, or a simple one that a hacker would figure out (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/23/most-common-passwords-of-2022-make-sure-yours-isnt-on-the-list.html">,qwerty</a> anyone?), WebAuthN lets people securely log into websites or applications using a phone or a security key. Because your security key must be physically accessible, and your phone needs to be biometrically (or PIN, if your finger is dirty) unlocked and in proximity. you get a much stronger second factor without needing to wait for that annoying SMS to copy-paste What? I’m drinking whatever Kool-aid you are making! How does it work?</p>

<p>I’ll give you the user experience, then rip the cover off and tell you geekier folks how it works: </p> 
   Enter your user name in the website login form and click to authenticate. 
   Pickup phone, unlock via FaceID or Fingerprint 
 <p>And that’s it. No password. Simple. And way more secure.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened behind the scenes: When you registered your user ID on the website, you stored a passkey instead of a password. During that process, WebAuthN created a magic key that was stored on your phone. When you logged onto the website from your laptop, WebAuthN used Bluetooth from your phone to communicate with your computer. It validated the physical proximity of the phone and verified who you were with the biometric unlocking of your phone. And you authenticated! The result is passwordless multi-factor authentication that is easy to use and phishing-resistant. </p>

<p>The technology is backed by the FiDO alliance, with the support of players like Apple, Google, Microsoft, (YeshID!) and others, which means your devices are likely already compatible and ready to use WebAuthN today, where they are supported, and enjoy a secure, passwordless experience built into your device - no new software required! </p>

<p>In security, we always talk about how there’s no “silver bullet.” But a great “bronze bullet” is focusing on the protection of identities &amp; credentials.</p>

<p>If you are a small or mid-sized company using Google Workspace and want to protect yourselves against identity-based attacks (which are involved in <a href="https://spycloud.com/key-takeaways-from-the-verizon-2022-data-breach-investigations-report/">,85% of breaches</a>) with a secure solution that is dead simple to use, you’ll want to sign up for the YeshID Alpha, coming in April.

  A recent World Economic Forum article highlighted how regulators had failed the crypto ecosystem, citing their inability to develop well-thought-out regulations.  The report noted that despite the setbacks, cryptography and blockchains would continue playing a crucial role in the interconnected global financial ecosystem.  The most significant damage that back-to-back failures of major crypto projects in 2022 inflicted was the waning trust in crypto&nbsp;finance.  <p>In preparation of its <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2023">Annual Meeting in Davos</a> later this month, WEF published <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/future-of-cryptocurrencies-davos2023/">an article </a>that looks into what the future holds for cryprocurrencies, and whose responsibility is the current state of the industry.</p><p>We are in 2023 now, but the after-effects of the past year’s debacles, from the Terra/Luna crash and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) failure to the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, haven’t been fully realized&nbsp;yet.</p><p>These numerous setbacks have wiped out more than $2 trillion from the global crypto market cap, with the digital assets sector officially entering the bear phase, which according to the World Economic Forum (WEF), could be “more of an ice age” than just another crypto&nbsp;winter.</p><p>According to the author of the WEF article, Dante Disparte, Head of Global Policy at USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, while millions of consumers lost money due to the failure of large crypto protocols, the more worrying part is the “waning” trust in the promise of crypto-finance.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/ddisparte/status/1609919364215586817?s=20&amp;t=FvMG3Tu3BTGdD3X_ypeQCQ">Image Source</a>)<p>Despite the setbacks, there are no doubts that “cryptography and blockchains will continue to be integral parts of the modern economic toolkit,” the WEF article added. Countries that enable responsible competition in the crypto sector will likely shape the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Disparte further pointed out how global regulators failed the crypto ecosystem, as all they have done so far is just talk about sensible regulations instead of forming one. Yet, they never missed a chance to sound an alarm about crypto’s excessive risks.</p> Crypto to Remain a “Protagonist” <p>Cryptocurrency regulation is a complex and evolving area with different jurisdictions having different approaches.</p><p>Recently, India’s central bank called for a global crypto framework while mentioning that FTX and Terra crash highlight “inherent vulnerabilities” in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>India’s apex bank recommended three options, viz: “same-risk-same-regulatory-outcome” approach, outright ban of crypto, stablecoins, and DeFi, and let the sector implode and become systemically irrelevant.</p><p>The US SEC has also been intending to boost crypto exchange enforcement as well as increase its scrutiny of virtual asset service providers. The agency has further called on companies to fully disclose crypto risks, citing “financial distress.”</p> A string of Failures: Is it a Death&nbsp;Knell? <p>The crypto industry setbacks emboldened the crypto critics, who are now blaming all major global problems on the rise of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>On top of that, the bear market has forced many crypto businesses to close their doors while others have been imploding.</p><p>All these has led to a lot of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bd850edf-9c4c-49b0-9449-e0da314f5729">negative press</a> for the industry, and many people are now questioning whether or not it is a viable investment.</p><p>Yet, the article argues, history is riddled with examples of otherwise good technologies being co-opted by bad actors and those ever-present human follies of greed, which are amplified in lightly regulated sectors.</p><p>We could now see the handover of crypto technology and blockchain infrastructure to more regulated and established institutions, much like how the dot-com bubble bursting saw the handover of the future of the internet to more durable companies.</p><p>“Indeed, as a test of the staying power of digital assets and blockchains at the core of financial services (and other areas of the global economy), watch what the big banks and mature financial services firms do, not what they say,” points out Disparte.</p><p>The adoption of crypto technology is inevitable, and “for all its faults, this technology remains a protagonist in the global financial world.”</p><p>The way to create a safer crypto industry, as the article concludes, is punishing errants at speed, “giving bad actors few places to&nbsp;hide.”</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Online, always-on finance and banking have led to significant security challenges for institutions trying to thwart international terrorism, identity theft, and fraud.</p>
<p>What are KYC regulations? KYC requires sufficient identity assurance and verification standards during customer onboarding to mitigate fraud and money laundering in finance and banking.</p>
 What Are Know Your Customer (KYC) Regulations? 
<p>Know Your Customer, or KYC, are regulations around identity assurance and verification in the financial sector implemented to protect against money laundering, fraud, and identity theft.</p>
<p>These regulations require that financial institutions have specific controls in place to assure user identity, with increasingly complex requirements based on the type of institution in question, the economic profile of the user, and other factors.</p>
<p>KYC requirements typically extend beyond traditional authentication standards. KYC can include identity assurance in line with government standards, including providing multiple forms of official government ID (driver’s license, passport, etc.) and even in-person identification with company personnel.</p>
<p>KYC laws exist to stop a few critical crimes:</p>
 
 Money Laundering: Money laundering, or using financial institutions or businesses to sanitize illegal funds by mixing them with legitimate pools of money, has been a significant issue for banks since banking started. KYC attempts to stop money laundering by linking customers with verified identities and credentials. 
 Identity Theft: With robust KYC in place, banks and other institutions can mitigate identity theft by requiring identity assurance–that is, official documents or even in-person assurance using company personnel or certified security professionals. 
 Fraud and Funding: KYC can also provide security against the fraudulent use of funds for organized crime or terrorists by creating a strict and rigorous chain of identity for all customers. 
 
<p>Many countries have some form of KYC laws. In the United States, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) of 1970 established requirements for anti-money laundering practices that included identity assurance requirements. However, the onset of widespread digital banking and international terrorism (funded through money laundering and fraud) led to the Patriot Act and updated AML laws.</p>
 What is KYC Compliance? 
<p>Financial institutions must perform regular due diligence on their customers to comply with KYC laws, including identity assurance and expanded authentication.</p>
<p>Some of these requirements for due diligence include:</p>
 
 Customer Identification Program (CIP): The <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/kyc-cip/">CIP</a> is a baseline requirement for financial institutions. It stipulates that these institutions collect several official documents or identification from customers to ensure their identity. 
 
<p>There may be more or fewer requirements depending on the risk of fraud (including factors like the volume of money involved and the user’s financial history).</p>
 
 Customer Due Diligence (CDD): CDD involves collecting some basic forms of identification to confirm the customer’s identity. These documents will be used to check associated risk and background databases to identify any issues. 
 
<p>Online databases and services are known as “eKYC” and serve as a highly secure and regulated operation executed by international expert firms.</p>
 
 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Advanced document collection or identity assurance may be required for customers with more significant risks for fraud or terrorism. 
 
<p>Required documents and practices will differ based on context. On the higher end of the risk scale, customers may need to provide several forms of official, marked government ID along with physical identity assurance.</p>
 Know Your Customer From Around the World 
<p>While we’ve covered laws in the US, money laundering and fraud are international challenges. As such, many major governments have enacted some form of KYC.</p>
<p>These international laws include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.finma.ch/en/documentation/legal-basis/laws-and-ordinances/anti-money-laundering-act-(amla)/">Anti-Money Laundering Act (France):</a> AMLA includes several constituent laws that define an umbrella of KYC requirements, including the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (details of professional KYC practices), and the FINMA Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (governing KYC and financial intermediaries). 
 <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/692/pdfs/uksi_20170692_en.pdf">The Money Laundering Act (UK):</a> This law governs KYC laws for financial institutions in the United Kingdom, including basic requirements for due diligence and practices to address financial blackmail and fraud against public figures. 
 <a href="https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng">Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada):</a> This law lays out standard KYC requirements in tandem with UK laws, addressing the range of regulated industries in Canada. These industries include accounting, gambling and casinos, precious stones dealers, finance, life insurance, real estate, and others. 
 <a href="https://www.electronicid.eu/en/blog/post/aml5-new-anti-money-laundering-directive/en">The Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (EU):</a> The latest in a series of conferences held by experts and officials in the European Union modernized KYC in EU territories while adding new laws and requirements for financial organizations dealing in cryptocurrency.

<p>Every company has different needs. These will depend on company size, location, products they offer, not to mention the current infrastructure in place. Unfortunately, there is not a solution that “fits them all”, and the high maturity of the IT market leads to&nbsp;numerous vendors offering their services. In this context, the main issue is not to cover the needs of an organization, but to choose the best solutions and to understand their advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Process phases&nbsp; 
 
 
<p>Evaluating and selecting vendors and solutions is not an easy task. It is a process and having a solid methodology in place will certainly mitigate the risks in this choice and allow you to evaluate the value of the wide range of options available more quickly. It is challenging to make decisions considering the job to be done, tasks to be completed and customers’ demands. Generally speaking, this process can be divided into five phases:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
  
 
<p>Definition</p>
 
  
 
 
 
<p>It is vital to define the goals of your organization and understand why you need to achieve them. In this sense, it is feasible to identify the priorities, learn about the context, know the vendors and evaluate their performance. At this stage, it is also necessary to establish a time frame. Moreover, businesses will have a clearer description to avoid issues or misunderstanding along the practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
  
 
<p>Framework creation</p>
 
  
 
<p>In order to find the best solution, it is necessary to understand the entire business model and the IT strategies of your organization. Creating a framework also allows you to spot vulnerabilities in your current strategy and tend to them. Thus, this stage should be considered as an opportunity to redesign and improve the practices, moving from good to great. In any case, and regardless the findings on the go, it is essential to keep the existing issues in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
  
 
<p>Request for information</p>
 
  
 
<p>Once the problems are defined, it is time to contact different vendors. There should be a minimum criterion to shortlist the suppliers, such as payment, contracting, disbursement, maintenance, and monitoring. Moreover, it is essential to analyse the services from the technical perspective and understand whether it matches the technical structure of the business that seeks for solutions. It is worth mentioning that having strong knowledge on the market is key to speed this stage up.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
  
 
<p>Request for Proposal</p>
 
  
 
<p>At this point, your company already has an idea of the vendors that offer the – apparently - best solutions for your business, and thus final details are to be discussed. You and your stakeholders ask vendors for clarification and for the possibility to amend things in the contract in case they decide to move on. The answers of the vendors must be evaluated to decide for the most suitable supplier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
  
 
<p>Implementation</p>
 
  
 
<p>Choosing a solution does not mean that the implementation will be a one-time task. There should first be a pre-implementation process, where the solution is tested, and professionals identify gaps. It is likely to change procedures, timing, number of employees, among other factors that might affect the final results. Once the changes are made, the operation runs again with these modifications and the process is tested again. Moreover, monitoring is part of the cycle and a vital procedure during the implementation phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
  
 
<p>Proof of Concept</p>
 
  
 
 
<p>Every tool and process have weaknesses and advantages. It is vital to compare the reality with what was expected. Identifying that the solutions focuses on the problem to be solved is a priority to ensure a well-functioning of the processes. A fair evaluation is needed in order to make changes on time or improve the solution.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Can companies do it on their own?&nbsp; 
 
 
<p>There is nothing to indicate that companies cannot attempt to accomplish this process on their own. However, deep knowledge of the market and of its many vendors is undeniably necessary. There are also several risks associated with this process. One of the most common issues companies have is assuming that they do understand their needs, leading them to implement a solution which does not fully satisfy them – when at all. Additionally, implementing the wrong solution could be twice as expensive as implementing a solution which turns out to be inadequate and undoing the damage caused comes at a cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>On the other hand, organizations must consider their staff capabilities. Solutions are very complex and unique requiring training new or existing staff, which could be costly. It is important to keep in mind that every company will promise “the best”, but they do not consider every organization’s particular needs and competencies. In a similar vein, considering the compatibility between the solution offered and the organization’s architecture is crucial. Trying to implement a solution that does not fit properly would be both a waste of time and assets.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>In that sense, a company like KuppingerCole Analysts can help organizations like yours not only to find the best possible solution in the market, but it will also save you time, money, and resources. Structuring and carrying out an IT implementation process is a critical factor of success. Assuring the correct planning will minimize risks, maximize the outcome of endeavours, and consider affordability within the priorities too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>To support organizations in their search for the solution matching their needs, KuppingerCole Analysts launched KC Open Select, an interactive tool that allows users to map their organization's individual Cybersecurity &amp; Digital ID requirements to KuppingerCole’s Intelligence. This user-friendly, fully automated process provides the user with a shortlist of solutions best-suited to the particular needs of their organization from a wide range of services and solutions available. The tool also provides a rating for the vendors, which allows the user to know what other customers think about the services, and whether the vendor will be the best fit for the organization and to face the challenges. KC Open Select will enable organizations to save time, money and resources when researching industry leading vendors and solutions. Try KC Open Select for free: <a href="https://go.kuppingercole.com/open-select">https://go.kuppingercole.com/open-select</a>.</p>
 
 
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
 
 
<p>While no solution can guarantee a 100% efficiency, it is possible to find the best fit possible. Naturally, automation processes to acquire a shortlist of vendors and solutions is a huge help, nevertheless human expertise is also needed. At KuppingerCole our advisors have extensive experience negotiating with vendors, a clear understanding of the market, and proper knowledge about what leaders are doing. The combination of KC Open Select and advice from expert would undeniably support organizations to find what they need. KuppingerCole can offer this, and in the process to find and implement solutions, we will state hypotheses, validate them, and find the most efficient techniques for your organization.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Are there cases where focusing on governance instead of identity helps achieve our same digital trust goals, while enhancing privacy preservation?</p></blockquote>
<p>In user-controlled digital identity, we often classify entities under the categories of Issuers, Holders and Verifiers. The issuers issue signed credentials to holders (verifiable credentials), while holders present proofs of these signed credentials to any verifier.</p>
<p>A lot of the excitement around this model is because it moves us away from centralized or federated identity management models. This means that identity assertions can now be made directly by the Holder/Prover, without having to ask a third party identity provider (IdP) if an assertion can be trusted. This model makes the Prover their own IdP, creating direct and controlled interactions for them, which should lead to increased privacy-preservation for everyone involved.</p>
<p>This new model that involves the exchange of verifiable credentials is resulting in the emergence of new trust frameworks that can specify things like:</p>
 
 Which issuers are authorized to issue what types of verifiable credentials. 
 Which verifiers are authorized to request what types of verifiable presentations. 
 
<p>If a Verifier no longer relies on the assertions of a trusted IdP, they must gain confidence that the assertions being made by the Prover are in line with the trust frameworks (or governance) they rely on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In federated identity systems, governance is more critical than identity to establish trust. Federated identity systems rely on trust relationships between identity providers, identity brokers, and relying parties. These trust relationships are established through governance mechanisms that ensure that the identity provider and intermediaries have robust processes in place for accurately authenticating user identities and issuing trusted assertions. Without strong governance, relying parties may not have confidence in the system and may be hesitant to accept identity assertions made through it. So can we think that perhaps the same will be true when Provers are their own IdP?</p>
<p></p>
<p>^ [A <a href="https://northernblock.io/governance-and-trust-with-scott-perry/">podcast episode</a> on Governance and Trust that Scott Perry and I did recently which you may find interesting.]</p>
<p>Inside the user-controlled model, the adherence to trust frameworks can be verified cryptographically. This means that a Verifier can gain confidence that an assertion being made by a Prover meets their policies, since it relies on credential data issued by what they would categorize as an authorized Issuer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as Verifiers know that credential data originated from an authorized Issuer, is Identity information then even required to be shared with them? In order to validate that my financial report was issued to my company by a certified audit body, must a verifier know the issuing firm’s identity, or can they gain enough assurance just by knowing that my company’s financial report comes from an audit firm within a trusted list that they use?</p>
<p>If there is a legal/policy requirement for the Verifier to know the Issuer, then of course their identity information can be exchanged. But should exchanging identity information be a baseline requirement? In a lot of cases, enough trust can be established simply by knowing that the assertion guarantees compliance to a set of governing rules that are important to you.</p>
<p>Being able to cryptographically prove adherence to trust frameworks is more valuable than proving an identity itself. I would have to prove adherence to a trust framework anyways, even if I divulge the identity information, whereas the opposite isn’t always true.</p>
<p>If there is no policy reason for a Verifier to know the identity information of the Issuer, can’t we achieve the same trust by (1) cryptographically proving credential data hasn’t been altered since issuance, and (2) cryptographically proving that the issuing entities who signed my credentials are within your accepted trust framework for the assertion that I’m making?</p>
<p>Doesn’t this model set a far better baseline for privacy preservation?</p>
<p>Just some thoughts..</p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/prioritizing-governance-assertions-over-identity-assertions/">Prioritizing Governance Assertions Over Identity Assertions</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.<p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/prioritizing-governance-assertions-over-identity-assertions/">Prioritizing Governance Assertions Over Identity Assertions</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Yuga Labs, the production company of Bored Ape Yacht Club, announced the completion of a $450 million seed round of funding at a $4 billion valuation, once again igniting the NFT industry and market. And tThe origin of this legendary story is only one sentence&nbsp;↓↓</p>*Image source: Yuga&nbsp;Labs<p>So, how to make NFT? Do you draw it first and then upload it? NO NO NO~! Let usNext, we will start with the two roles of painter and architect to help you get started quickly and join the metaverse world!</p> If you are a&nbsp;painter <p>If you are a painter, then congratulations on the relatively easy way to make an NFT. ~ You can choose to make a PFP type of NFT, easy to make, and more popular and approachable.</p> Step 1:&nbsp;Drawing <p>Most of the current PFP projects utilize have the concept of attributes, and the difference between different NFTs is determined by different attributes. Typical attributes are background color, eye shape, facial accessories, and so on. Random permutations of these attributes can create different NFTs.</p><p>*Image source:&nbsp;Internet</p><p>So, if you want to create a series of 1000 NFTs with 3 attributes of eyes, face ornaments and clothes, what you need to do is not to draw 1000 pictures, but 31 PNGs, i.e. 1 picture of the main character, 10 pictures of eyes, 10 pictures of face ornaments and 10 pictures of clothes, and then complete the combination of NFT pictures in batch (1*10³) by a random generation program.</p> Step 2: Upload to Marketplace <p>Once you have done so, you can publish your NFT work through the various NFT marketplaces.</p><p>Take Opensea as an example, after logging in with your own data client, click [Create] and fill in the information about the NFT to publish your NFT. When you want to sell it, you need to pay a certain amount of Gas fee to be able to auction it on the&nbsp;market.</p> Step 3: Display in the metaverse <p>Of course, NFTs areis not only showcased onin the NFT market, but metaverse projects such as Decentraland and Cryptovoxels also provide athe stage for&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>*Image source: Decentraland</p><p>If a visitor is interested in your work, and your work happens to be for sale on Opensea, there is the possibility of a direct transaction., Ffor example, Decentraland can jump directly to Opensea, and of course the metaverse is not limited to the work that can be shown in PFP (although PFP is still the most popular hottest at the moment). With the growing interest in the virtual land sector, NFTs and the metaverse are opening their doors to architects as&nbsp;well.</p> If you are an architect <p>For architects, the current phase of the virtual land and property boom is the perfect time to get in on the action, such as the creation of scenes in Decentraland.</p><p>Let’s take here the example of The Builder, a tool for creating 3D scenes in Decentraland that does not require writing&nbsp;code.</p> Step 1: Create a&nbsp;scene <p>After entering the official website and logging in, click on [BUILDER], you can start creating scenes on this page. The size of the scene can be adjusted by rows and columns (the current area cannot exceed 32). FAnd for the time being, only rectangular scenes are supported, irregularly shaped scenes can only be achieved through the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>Also, the ground in the scene can be selected from the ‘Asset’ column with various ground textures. In addition to this, Decentraland itself offers a wide range of content for the creator to choose from. It is up to the user to decide how the contents of the scene are combined, displayed, etc. The user can simply click on the item and drag it to any location in the scene. If you want to add a 3D model built outside Decentraland, you can do the following:</p>  Create 3D models using SketchUp, Blender, Maya,&nbsp;etc.;  Use The Builder tool to import, the model format must be gltf or&nbsp;glb;  Click New Asset Pack in the scene&nbsp;editor;  Drag in the model&nbsp;file;  Select Import&nbsp;Assets;  After naming the asset pack, press 【Create Asset&nbsp;Pack】.  <p>After importing, there is no difference between using the new asset package and using the asset package that comes with the&nbsp;project.</p> Step 2: Release scenarios <p>When you have finished creating it and pressed [Publish], it means the publishing is successful. There are two options for the launch: one for the scene pool and one for your own&nbsp;land.</p><p>Note that if you have your own land, you can choose to use the created scene on your own land. Of course, you can also choose to publish it in the scene pool for display, and for others to use to earn&nbsp;money.</p> Conclusion <p>Whether you are a painter or an architect, there is a tremendous opportunity to take a shot at and cash in on the metaverse in the future. Such spontaneous opportunities are rare in the centralized Web2 and will be more readily available in a metaverse with fewer rules and strictures. In addition to the above areas, unprecedented directions like Digital Fashion are giving traditional apparel designers new options.

<p>Here we are again, the start of a new year. It does feel like 2023 arrived more softly than previous years. Maybe due to 2022 being a year that globally progressed very differently than we all expected.</p>
<p>At Ubisecure we’ve been pushing forward on many initiatives for the last 12 months, and now is a good time to surface and reflect on what has been achieved.</p>
 Continued Growth 
<p>Ubisecure is a private company and so we do not publish detailed financials, but we are pleased to announce that we are definitely the right side of the ‘<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/saas-and-the-rule-of-40-keys-to-the-critical-value-creation-metric">rule of 40</a>’. I think given the global economic climate and the continuing macro situation this is a great result and will serve us well into 2023.</p>
 The return of face-to-face events 
<p>One of the really positive aspects of 2022 has been the return of in-person events. In 2022 we were fortunate to meet identity ecosystem stakeholders and present at the Gartner IAM event in London (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/european-reusable-strong-identity/" title="read our event summary">read our event summary</a>), as well as cybersecurity events in New York, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland. We also attended our first face-to-face KYC in Banking event where we presented alongside the GLEIF on the value of organisation identity in client onboarding., The immediate feedback and connection you get from face-to-face presentations results in a far more fluid, engaged and valuable session. I do expect 2023 to continue and grow in that regard and we already have a number of speaking engagements booked.</p>
 And the rise of the vLEI 
<p>We were very proud to be working closely with the GLEIF back in May and June for the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/vlei-101/" title="Verifiable-LEI pilot">Verifiable-LEI pilot</a> that took place. Ubisecure acted as the Qualified vLEI Issuer for the pilot and the credentials issued were used to sign the GLEIF 2021 report. This is a great step forward for the wider LEI eco-system and directly supports our previous predictions of the convergence of classical identity and Verifiable Credentials. During 2023 we will be working with the GLEIF to become a full QVI that can deliver commercially consumable and scalable credentials, so watch this space for more details.</p>
 New Logo Wins 
<p>Taking great care of our existing customers is always a #1 priority for us but growing that customer base is a close #2. We’ve welcomed some great new customers in 2022 – ranging from global media giants to several of the world’s largest banks. UK innovation and Nordic excellence are a winning combination and serving us very well as we expand beyond our Nordic footprint.</p>
 Organisation Identity growth 
<p><a href="https://rapidlei.com/">LEI registration</a> through our RapidLEI brand is going from strength to strength. We remain the #1 issuer of validated LEIs per month, every month. We are the leading provider of GLEIF Validation Agent services through our <a href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">LEI Everywhere</a> proposition, which is now being used by several of the top ten largest banks.</p>
<p>The LEI eco-system itself is growing well through a number of initiatives, the <a href="https://iccwbo.uk/blogs/press-releases/icc-centre-for-digital-trade-innovation-launches-preparations-for-uk-trade-to-go-digital">UK paperless trade bill</a> and the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/cbp-customs-border-protection-lei/">US Customs &amp; Border Protection global business identifier program</a> clearly mark the LEI as the essential identifier of 2022.</p>
 Spreading the word 
<p>Being at the center of a number of digital identity initiatives we have a wide array of connections into the broader identity industry who we think have plenty of interesting things to say, and it seems many of you agree with us. Over the last year our ‘Lets talk about Digital Identity’ podcast series has doubled its listenership, thanks to the many fantastic guests and introduction of the innovative “Identity Stories Series”. If you have not heard it yet, please have a look and listen to our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/lets-talk-about-digital-identity-podcast/" title="#LTADI podcast episodes">#LTADI podcast episodes</a> and see why so many people are subscribing. </p>
 Looking forward in 2023 
 Driving the vision 
<p>Our belief in the power of digital identity to precisely express who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have when representing them through a combination of highly assured Organisation Identity and strong authenticated Individual Identity defines the core of our focus as we navigate 2023. Read about the Ubisecure <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/corporate/vision-the-future-digital-identity/" title="vision for the future of digital identity">vision for the future of digital identity</a> or watch the short video below:</p>
 
  
 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Driving growth through global initiatives 
<p>There are a number of global initiatives in play that intersect with our vision, from the cross-border EU ID to GAIN to vLEI. These global efforts all leverage the LEI as the underlying Organisation Identifier and go some way to enabling an expression of representation. The derived, most often through delegation, expression of rights connected to that representation is where Ubisecure delivers a step change in value to these propositions.</p>
 Driving pace 
<p>We have a lot to do but we have a growing team of experts who are working hard on pushing us forward, both technically and commercially. It’s the Ubisecure people that really make the difference to what we do. If you would like to be part of the journey, please speak to us, we are always looking for great, like-minded people to <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/careers/" title="join the team">join the team</a>.</p>
<p>I wish you all a happy and prosperous new year, wherever you are, and look forward to what 2023 brings to the world of identity management.</p>

<p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>내년 상반기 예정된 DEX(탈중앙화 거래소) 런칭에 앞서, 여러분의 이해를 도울 수 있는 아티클을 준비했습니다. DEX란 무엇이고 왜 DEX가 필요한지 메타디움 앰배서더의 아티클을 통해&nbsp;소개합니다.</p><p>메타디움 팀</p> DEX란 무엇이고, 왜&nbsp;필요한가 <p>안녕하세요 여러분! 메타디움 앰배서더 Cyber G입니다. 오늘은 메타디움에 처음 생기는 DEX와 관련하여 여러분께 설명드리고자&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>암호화폐를 거래해보신 분들이라면 업비트, 빗썸과 같은 암호화폐 거래소에 익숙하실거라 생각합니다. 이메일을 통해 가입을 진행하고, 강력한 비밀번호를 지정하고, 계정을 인증하고, 암호화폐를 거래하는 방식의 거래소 말입니다. 이러한 중앙화 거래소의 경우, 자산을 거래하기 위해서는 플랫폼 내부로 먼저 입금 과정이 이루어져야 합니다. 그런데, 최근, 세계에서 두번째로 큰 FTX 거래소의 경우, 사용차 예치금의 일대일 준비금을 보유하지 않은 것으로 보여집니다. FTX 거래소 측은 사용자 자산을 FTX 경영진에게 개인 용도로 빌려주거나 자회사인 알라메다 리서치에게 빌려주는 등 다양한 방법으로 자산을 유용하였으며, 결국 사용자들은 인출이 불가능하게 되고 FTX 거래소가 파산하는 등 국내에서도 많은 피해자가 생기는 등 글로벌적으로 큰 이슈가&nbsp;되었습니다.</p>그림 1. 암호화폐 거래소 FTX의 급속한&nbsp;붕괴<p>이러한 사건 이후, DEX에 대한 관심이 급격히 늘어나고 있습니다. 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX)의 거래량은 2022년 11월에 이미 910억 달러에 이르렀으며, 이는 10월 전체에 비해 79% 증가한 것입니다. DEX는 중앙화 거래소를 제치고 현재 현물 거래량이 2022년 9월의 10.8%에서 16.7%로&nbsp;증가했습니다.</p>그림 2. 유니스왑의 일일 DEX 거래량 볼륨&nbsp;차트<p>이더리움 체인 위에서 이더리움과 ERC-20 토큰 간의 자동 교환 거래를 용이하게 하도록 설계된 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX)의 대표주자, 유니스왑의 거래량 차트를 보면 이를 확인할 수 있습니다. Uniswap은 거래량과 사용자 수를 기준으로 최고의 DEX입니다. 설립자 Hayden Adams는 최근 Twitter에 Uniswap이 이더/미국 달러 거래 쌍의 일일 거래량에서 Coinbase를 능가했다고 게시하기도 했는데요. 초기 탈중앙화 거래소는 과도한 가스비 초래, 확장의 한계성, 부족한 유동성 등의 문제가 있어 큰 관심을 받지 못했습니다. 유니스왑은 이러한 한계성을 보완하여 출시하였는데요. 특히 AMM(유동화된 마켓 메이커) 알고리즘 기반으로 유동성 풀(pool, 스마트 컨트랙트 내에 동결되어 있는 자금)을 제공하여 낮은 유동성이라는 한계점을 보완하였습니다. 유니스왑은 유동성을 공급하는 자들에게 별도의 보상을 지급하는 방식으로 유동성 공급 문제를 해결하였습니다. 유니스왑은 유동성 마이닝이라는 시스템으로 성립되어 있어 토큰을 특정 풀에 맡기면 전용 거버넌스 토큰인 UNI를 보상으로 받을 수 있습니다. UNI는 일종의 거버넌스 토큰(Governance Token)으로서 가격이 결정되어 있으며 디지털자산 거래소에서 간편하게 교환할 수 있습니다. 또한, 유니스왑은 중앙관리자가 없어 디지털자산의 상장 이라는 개념이 존재하지 않습니다. 이에 누구나 유니스왑에 ERC-20 토큰의 유동성을 공급하여 해당 토큰의 교환을 용이하게 만들 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p>그림 3. 중앙화 거래소와 탈중앙화 거래소의 차이점&nbsp;제시<p>이처럼 DEX에서는 개인 자산을 중앙화 기관인 제3자에게 맡기지 않고 본인의 암호화폐 지갑에 보관하고, DEX 사용시에만 스마트 컨트랙트에 의해 자산을 거래하게 됩니다. 그렇기에 귀찮은 가입 과정을 요구하지 않습니다. 대부분의 경우, 암호화폐를 입금 또는 출금할 필요도 없습니다. 거래는 두 사용자의 지갑 사이에서 직접 진행되며, 제3자의 개입 또한 스마트 컨트랙트에 의해 제한되게 됩니다. 따라서, 자신의 자금에 대한 통제권을 넘겨주지 않아도&nbsp;됩니다.</p> 그렇다면, Metadium에 DEX가 생긴다는 건 어떠한 의미를&nbsp;가질까요? <p>첫번째로, 메타디움 2.0에서 많은 Dapp을 생태계로 온보딩시키기 위해 각 Dapp들의 생태계를 이어주는 징검다리 역할을 DEX가 하게 됩니다. A라는 프로젝트가 있다고 가정해볼께요. DEX에서는 해당 프로젝트의 토큰을 구매하거나, 혹은 유동성 풀에 유동성을 제공하여 프로젝트에서 제공하는 A 토큰을 에어드랍받는 등 각 프로젝트에 참여할 수 있는 기회가 DEX를 통해 생기게&nbsp;됩니다.</p><p>두번째로, 다양한 체인의 자산들이 Metadium 생태계로 들어오게 됩니다. 체인별로 암호화폐 자산을 전송하는 브릿지를 통해 메타디움 메인넷 안의 DEX에서 각 자산들이 활용되게 되면서, 생태계 내 유동성 볼륨은 더 성장하게 되고, 이는 메타디움 메인넷에 크게 기여하게&nbsp;됩니다.</p><p>마지막으로, DEX 사용을 통해 투명하고 안전한 거래를 할 수 있습니다. 모든 거래는 메타디움 블록체인 상에 기록되며, 누구나 그 정보를 열람할 수 있습니다. 또한, 자산의 거래는 P2P 방식으로 진행되며, 스마트 컨트랙트에 의해서만 구동되게&nbsp;됩니다.</p><p>이처럼 탈중앙화 생태계의 확장에 기여하게 될 DEX. 그리고 DEX를 통해 온보딩되어 성장하게 될 다양한 프로젝트들. 여기의 주인공은 메타디움을 사랑해주시고 이용해주시는 여러분입니다. 국내 최정상급의 블록체인 기술 기업 Ozys와 함께, 메타디움 재단은 생태계 확장에 도움이 될 DEX 런칭에 최선을 다하고 있습니다. 이전 메타디움의 로드맵 중 하나였던 Defi 서비스 “MSPACE” 관련 기획 경험과 암호화폐 시장 현황을 토대로 분석하여, 최적의 시기에 최고의 DEX서비스를 런칭할 것입니다. 메타디움 2.0의 빛나는 미래. 지금 함께&nbsp;시작합니다!</p> 참고문헌 <p>1. “DEXs Gain Market Share As Faith In Centralized Crypto Players Erodes”, Forbes, last modified Nov 23. 2022, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2022/11/23/dexs-gain-market-share-as-faith-in-centralized-crypto-players-erodes/?sh=44cde3b33f40">https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2022/11/23/dexs-gain-market-share-as-faith-in-centralized-crypto-players-erodes/?sh=44cde3b33f40</a></p><p>2. “Uniswap의 대응 가능한 시장 확대”, messari report, last modified Nov 21. 2022, <a href="https://messari.io/report/expanding-uniswaps-addressable-market">https://messari.io/report/expanding-uniswaps-addressable-market</a></p><p>메타디움 공식 채널 팔로우하고 메타디움의 최신 소식을&nbsp;확인하세요!</p><p><a href="http://metadium.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/2dhC5Zfay7">Discord</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Metadium">Facebook</a> | <a href="http://t.me/MetadiumNotice">Telegram</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metadium">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/%EB%A9%94%ED%83%80%EB%94%94%EC%9B%80-%EC%95%84%ED%8B%B0%ED%81%B4-dex-%ED%83%88%EC%A4%91%EC%95%99%ED%99%94-%EA%B1%B0%EB%9E%98%EC%86%8C-ff7d58ee9694">메타디움 아티클: DEX(탈중앙화 거래소)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I promised an update on the status of all the moving pieces of the Holochain development experience. I wanted to do it once it was ready for hApp devs to port their existing codebases over to the new beta release candidate, and while it took longer than we expected, it’s finally here. And not only that, but the new scaffolding tool is ready for new devs ready to build their first hApp!</p><p>Here’s a full list of things that are ready for existing and new devs:</p>  Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2  HDI 0.2.0-beta-rc.1 and HDK 0.1.0-beta-rc.1  The <code>hc</code> command-line tool, including <code>hc launch</code> and <code>hc scaffold</code>  Tryorama, the hApp testing framework  The JavaScript client  Integration of all the above into Holonix, the Holochain development environment  <p>Here are the things that are still being updated:</p>  Holochain Launcher for end-users  The DevHub hApp for distributing hApps  The Rust client   Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0: Signed zome calls, API and gossip changes <p>Release date: 15 December 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.0<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0<br>Breaking changes: admin API, app API, network protocol</p><p>The developers have packed a fair number of changes into this release in order to present a first release candidate that resembles our vision for the beta release as closely as possible. Read on to learn what you need for refactoring your hApp and tests.</p><p>Breaking (app API): The change with the biggest impact is that all zome calls must have a valid capability and be signed. The end-user Launcher hosts UIs in a WebView and signs calls with the author key using the built-in Lair keystore, which lets it use the author capability for all calls. That means you don’t need to worry about hApps deployed for use in this context. The Holo-hosted context has also had support for built-in signing and now applies it to zome calls. Finally, the web browser context lets you authorise a browser-generated public key for signing calls. There are some other changes to the RPC message envelope format, but the JS client lib already supports those. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1510">#1510</a>)</p><p>Breaking (admin API, app API): The two conductor APIs have had name changes and removals of some deprecated endpoints. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1662">#1662</a>,<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1704"> #1704</a>,<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1707"> #1707</a>,<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1719"> #1719</a>) In the admin API:</p>  The deprecated <code>InstallApp</code> has been deleted, and <code>InstallAppBundle</code> has been renamed to <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.InstallApp">InstallApp</a></code>. (Note: this endpoint can receive app bundle manifest blobs or filesystem paths.)  The deprecated <code>ActivateApp</code>, <code>DeactivateApp</code>, <code>ListActiveApps</code>, and <code>ListEnabledApps</code> have been removed.  <code>RestoreArchivedCloneCell</code> has been renamed to <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.EnableCloneCell">EnableCloneCell</a></code> and moved to the app API.  <code>DeleteArchivedCloneCells</code> has been replaced with <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.DeleteCloneCell">DeleteCloneCell</a></code>, which only allows the deletion of one cell at a time.  <p>In the app API:</p>  <code>ZomeCall</code> has been renamed to <code>CallZome</code>.  <code>ArchiveCloneCell</code> has been renamed to <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.DisableCloneCell">DisableCloneCell</a></code>.  <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.EnableCloneCell">EnableCloneCell</a></code> (formerly <code>RestoreArchivedCloneCell</code>) has been moved here from the admin API.  <code>GossipInfo</code> has been replaced with <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.NetworkInfo">NetworkInfo</a></code>, which now returns only the number of ops a node expects to receive and their combined size. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1662">#1662</a>)  <p>Breaking (admin API, app API): All data structure names (struct names and fields, enum names and variants) are serialised to snake case over the WebSocket ports. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1694">#1694</a>)</p><p>Breaking (network protocol): Gossip rounds no longer transfer ops; they only share information on what ops should be transferred, for later transfer via a processing queue. This is intended to break up network bottlenecks as part of our ongoing real-world performance improvement work for beta. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1662">#1662</a>)</p><blockquote>We’ll keep testing the impact of this change in the coming weeks, but preliminary automated and human testing with simulated and real networks is looking very good. The DHT feels more ‘live’, which is exactly what we want to see as we get Holochain ready for production-ready hApps serving real users.</blockquote><p>New: The <code>hc</code> command has gotten the ability to run subcommands — any commands in your system’s <code>PATH</code> that start with <code>hc-</code>. This includes the new <code>hc launch</code> and <code>hc scaffold</code> commands: <code>hc launch</code> uses the Launcher in CLI mode to start a hApp and open up a WebView window, and <code>hc scaffold</code> is a powerful new tool that lets you build out boilerplate code really quickly. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1680">#1680</a>)</p> Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.1: Bug fix in app installation <p>Release date: 16 December 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.0<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0<br>Breaking changes: none</p><p>Bugfix (admin and app APIs): This is exactly why we have release candidates, folks — to find and fix bugs. As part of the work getting the Launcher updated to 0.1.0-beta-rc.0, we discovered some bugs in a couple API functions. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1725">#1725</a>)</p>  The admin API’s <code>InstallApp</code> was returning an empty set of cells; now it returns the cells that were installed.  The app API’s <code>CallZome</code> would let you call functions in disabled clone cells; now it returns an error.   Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2: Wildcard cap grants <p>Release date: 23 December 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.1<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.1<br>Breaking changes: HDI, HDK, admin API</p><p>Breaking (HDI, HDK, admin API): The <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.1.0-beta-rc.1/holochain_types/prelude/enum.GrantedFunctions.html"><code>GrantedFunctions</code></a> type in a capability grant has changed to an enum, with which you can specify either a list of functions (as before) or a wildcard. This was prompted by the need to make Tryorama tests easier to write after signed zome calls became mandatory, but it can also be useful for UIs. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1732">#1732</a>)</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20221223034701">Read the full release notes</a> for the last three releases.</p> Known issues   The ‘latest’ version of the documentation for the release candidates, including <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.2.0-beta-rc.1/hdi/">hdi</a></code>, <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.1.0-beta-rc.1/hdk/">hdk</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/">holochain_conductor_api</a></code>, are pointing to the pre-beta-RC version; use the version selector at the top of the page to choose the latest version.

(<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/1580">#1580</a>)  If a countersigning session fails, the results returned by <code>must_get_*</code> in the middle of the session (either in the zome call or during validation) are inconsistent with the actual DHT state.  macOS builds of the Lair keystore are currently having troubles. We intend to officially support macOS (and Windows via WSL2) for developers by the beta in January.  Passing <code>InstallApp</code> a large hApp bundle as a blob over Websocket can fail; we believe this is because of a WebSocket transfer limit.   Client release notes  JavaScript client 0.10.0 to 0.10.4: Holochain/Holo API unification <p>I’m going to collapse the 0.10.x release series into one changelog, because (a) none of these releases support Holochain 0.1.x (the only supported version is 0.0.175), and (b) the work all pertains to the unification of the Holochain JavaScript client with the Holo Web SDK. Once this work is done, you’ll be able to code to one API and swap out the connection backend based on the environment the app is running.</p>  0.10.0, released 7 December 2022, updates the client to work with Holochain 0.0.175, which included some<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-approaching/#holochain-00175-renaming-things"> changes in the HDK and conductor APIs</a> that ripple out to the client. It also introduces <code>AppAgentClient</code>, a common interface for accessing hApps via a local connection or the Holo hosting network. (Currently the only implementation is <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code>, which uses a local connection.) As the changelog says, “hApp devs will now be able to write the majority of their client code using the <code>AppAgentClient</code> interface, completely agnostic as to whether they're in a pure holochain or holo context.” Support has also been added for the admin API’s <code>GossipInfo</code> endpoint, which lets a UI display DHT health info. (Note: this endpoint will change in Holochain 0.1.0-beta.rc0, which means it’s incompatible with this client release.)  0.10.1, released 8 December 2022, changes the event emitter library from <code>events</code> to <code>emittery</code>, to make bundling easier.  0.10.2, released on 12 December 2022, makes the <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code> object available to consumers (note that this is hidden again in 0.11.7).  0.10.3, released on 12 December 2022 as well, replace a dependency on lodash with lodash-es to give better compatibility with modern ECMAScript implementations.  0.10.4, released on 14 December, changes the <code>getLauncherEnvironment</code> function to synchronous. This function is exposed by the backend object representing the Launcher environment with its embedded WebViews in place of spawned browser windows.   JavaScript client 0.11.0: Holochain Beta-RC support, signed zome calls <p>Release date: 18 December 2022<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 and 0.1.0-beta-rc.1</p><p>In addition to the breaking conductor API changes that came with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 (see above), this client also supports the new requirement that every zome call have a valid capability. In general, this is handled automatically or nearly automatically for all three client contexts that this library supports:</p>  In the Launcher and Holo-hosted contexts, the environment will handle signing using the author capability (that is, all calls are signed using the private key of the source chain owner).  In the web browser context, there’s a new async function <code>authorizeNewSigningKeyPair()</code> that generates a key in-browser and asks the conductor to authorise it using the admin API. This is not secured right now; the conductor will always approve the request. In the future, conductor managers (such as the Launcher) will likely show some sort of popup asking for authorisation, and the in-browser keypair will be secured with a password on page close. Note that this function has a name change in 0.11.4.   JavaScript client 0.11.1 to 0.11.9: Maintenance, bugfixes, and breaking changes <p>Once we released the updated JavaScript client we discovered some issues that necessitated a series of bugfixes. There are also some refactors of previously introduced functionality. Versions 0.11.1 to 0.11.8 all support Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 and 0.1.0-beta-rc.0, while 0.11.9 supports 0.1.0-beta-rc.2.</p>  0.11.1, released on 18 December 2022, introduces a breaking change: the provenance field has been removed from <code>AppAgentCallZomeRequest</code>, because the provenance is provided by the backend in all three contexts (Launcher, web browser, and Holo-hosted).  0.11.2, released on 20 December 2022, fixes a bug in bundling the client module, where the WebSocket serialisation module (written in WASM) wasn’t getting bundled. It also introduces a breaking change, in which all deprecated conductor API functions (see release notes for Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 above) have been removed. Finally, it adds a TypeScript type definition for the new <code>authorizeNewSigningKeyPair</code> function.  0.11.3, released on 21 December 2022, fixes a bug in serialisation.  0.11.4, released on the same day, refactors the in-browser signing key machinery and introduces one breaking change, renaming <code>authorizeNewSigningKeyPair</code> to <code>authorizeSigningCredentials</code>.  0.11.5, released on the same day, fixes a bug in the Launcher context implementation.  0.11.6, released on the same day, reverts some of the changes introduced in 0.11.3 that caused a regression in compatibility with the Launcher.  0.11.7, released on the same day, introduces a breaking change, re-hiding the <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code> implementation introduced in 0.10.2.  0.11.8, released on 21 December 2022, reorganises some code involved in the new signing code and introduces breaking changes as a consequence.  0.11.9, released on 23 December 2022, introduces a breaking change in the introduction of the new wildcard option for capability grants, bringing it up to date with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2’s admin API.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases">Read the full changelogs.</a></p> Test framework release notes <p>Note: if you’re writing Rust-based tests with Sweettest, the version included in the <code>holochain</code> crate is always up to date.</p> Tryorama 0.9.1 and 0.9.2: TryCP additions and Holochain 0.0.175 <p>Again, I’m collapsing the 0.9.x series of Tryorama because they target older Holochain versions.</p>  0.9.1, released 26 October 2022 and compatible with Holochain 0.0.165 to 0.0.171, features two additions to TryCP, the distributed test orchestrator. <code>ClientsPlayersOptions</code> can take a partial config parameter, allowing you to specify defaults for all players and fill in specific missing config for each player later. And the shortcut function <code>stopAllTryCpServers</code> lets you shut down multiple servers at once.  0.9.2, released 12 December 2022 and compatible with Holochain 0.0.175, bumps the JavaScript client to 0.10.3 and breaks compatibility with previous Holochain releases. The TryCP orchestrator also now exposes the conductor admin API endpoints <code>get_dna_definition</code> and <code>grant_zome_call_capability</code>.   Tryorama 0.10.0: Holochain Beta-RC support <p>Release date: 21 December 2022<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 and 0.1.0-beta-rc.1</p><p>This is the release needed to test your hApp against the updated Holochain — and test Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.* and report any bugs you find! Building on the newest JavaScript client, it reflects all the changes to the conductor APIs that I described above.</p> Tryorama 0.10.1: Wildcard cap grants <p>Release date: 21 December 2022<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.2</p><p>Breaking: After updating Tryorama to the new beta release candidate of Holochain, tests became much more challenging to write because of the requirement to sign all zome calls. Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2 introduced wildcard function matches for cap grants for this very reason. This version adds support for wildcards, allowing you to generate a single wildcard grant at the beginning of your test script.</p><p>To update your tests for the Tryorama 0.10 series, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/pull/152/files">check the diffs</a> to see all the name changes, removals, and additions, and read the excellent<a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/v0.10.0/docs/tryorama.md"> documentation</a>.</p> The new scaffolding tool: like Rails, but for dApps! <p>Guillem Cordoba, creator of the previous scaffolding GUI tool, has applied his skill once again to this tool after receiving feedback from other devs in the community.</p><blockquote>Now it’s a lot &nbsp;like Ruby on Rails’ celebrated scaffolder, which empowered a generation of developers to create basic, working web apps in just a few minutes. This brings that same power to distributed web apps!</blockquote><p>It’s all driven by the command line, and it lets you create and edit project folders, DNAs, zomes, UIs, entry and link types, and collections. It’ll even update existing code as you add new features to your hApp.</p><p>We think this scaffolding tool will be a game-changer for hApp development. Now, newcomers to Holochain who are comfortable with the command line can <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/#scaffold-your-first-holochain-app">create and run a demo forum hApp</a> in less than a minute, and create the basic code for their own hApp in less than an hour. Because the design decisions involved in building a hApp are slightly different from what devs are used to, it guides you through sensible default choices. It’ll also likely have contextual help in the future.</p><p>What it makes accessible for new hApp devs, it also makes quick and easy for experienced ones. A lot of boilerplate code can be generated in moments with the various scaffolding commands available.</p><p>I’ll feature the scaffolding tool in the next Dev Pulse, but until then, try <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/#scaffold-your-first-holochain-app">generating a sample hApp</a> learn more about its <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/happ-setup/">project structure</a> in the Holochain developer website, and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_scaffolding_cli/latest/holochain_scaffolding_cli/">check out the full documentation</a>. I think you’ll like what you see, no matter your level of experience.</p> Go forth and code! <p>If you’re a hApp developer with existing code, now is the time to update your zome, UI, and test code and look for bugs and rough edges in Holochain. Your <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/">feedback</a> will help us get Holochain ready for its beta release.</p><p>If you’re a newcomer with some Rust and JavaScript experience who wants to start building hApps, I invite you to <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/">install Holochain</a>, read the Core Concepts, and try creating something this weekend!</p><p>If you’re an end-user who’s eager to start using a real hApp, we have a working-but-unreleased version of the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/">Launcher</a> with greatly improved network performance. We're testing it internally and fix any bugs before we release it. Once that happens, you’ll find a sample sticky notes / kanban app in the hApp store, and you can expect to see more apps as devs update them.</p><blockquote>Happy new year to everyone who follows the Gregorian calendar. I wish you great success whatever you’re up to, and I’m excited about all the ways that a rapidly maturing Holochain might be able to support your endeavours.</blockquote><p>And by the way — I love talking with people about this stuff. If you’ve got a plan for a way to use Holochain to support new ways of creating, sharing, connecting and doing business, come to the <a href="https://discord.gg/HhhxQkNUsr">Holochain developers’ Discord</a> and share your ideas. I’ll be there to help you figure out how Holochain can fit into your plan.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@philton88?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Parker Hilton</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/JqDNL8vBsHs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 Shyft Veriscope — What, Why,&nbsp;How <p>During the last two months of the past year, we ran an extensive social media campaign to educate our audience on everything about Veriscope and why it matters to the ecosystem’s future. Before continuing with our educational series, we want to sum up all the key insights we covered during the campaign for a better understanding of what Veriscope actually is and why it&nbsp;matters.</p> WHAT  The Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>First things first: the Travel Rule. With more countries enforcing the Travel Rule, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) have no choice but to comply. To be compliant while respecting user privacy, VASPs must solve two critical issues: address attribution and data transfer.</p><p>The attribution problem refers to the need to identify &amp; provably verify the owner of a beneficiary wallet address accurately. As for the data transfer issue, it arises because there is no global framework for securely transferring Travel Rule data between&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Shyft Discover <p>Shyft Discover, the first component of Shyft Network’s critical Travel Rule infrastructure, enables a VASP to know who their counterparty VASP is. This is crucial as VASPs share critical user data along with the crypto transaction to comply with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Sharing critical information with a wrong VASP having dubious intentions would constitute a data privacy breach. Here’s where Shyft Discover can make a difference, as it can save VASPs from such a predicament.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1592616375113195522?s=20&amp;t=-V4SQXgM31xRKaB1SbYkmg">Click here</a> to learn all about Shyft Discover.</p> Attestations <p>Attestations enable Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to transmit user data along with a transaction while keeping user data confidential.</p><p>Analogically, the attestation workflow resembles sticking confidential notes on a public bulletin board. <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1594873575336710144?s=20&amp;t=-V4SQXgM31xRKaB1SbYkmg">Click here</a> to learn all about attestations.</p> Address Proofs <p>When VASPs send or receive digital assets, they must share certain information with their counterparty to comply with the FATF Travel Rule, such as their users’ names and wallet addresses.</p><p>Sending such sensitive data to the wrong VASP could have devastating consequences.</p><p>This is where Address Proofs come in. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscopes-address-proofs-enable-vasps-to-protect-critical-data">Click here</a> for more information on Address Proofs and how they can help VASPs protect critical&nbsp;data.</p> WHY  Shyft Discover: A Global Address Book of&nbsp;VASPs <p>Virtual Asset Service Providers can register and create a profile on the Shyft Network in order to participate in the network and take advantage of its features. However, to create a profile, VASPs must provide certain information about themselves.</p><p>The information can then be verified and validated by other parties on the network. The fundamental idea behind this step is that the more attestations a VASP’s profile have, the higher the level of trust it has on the&nbsp;network.</p> Veriscope Share: Answer to Data Transfer&nbsp;Issues <p>Some Travel Rule solutions do handle the data-sharing part, but they process the sensitive user data through their servers before sending it to the relevant&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>While this may seem convenient, it also carries certain risks. Veriscope Share solves these problems by enabling VASPs to share user data in a P2P, VASP-to-VASP mode. Head over to this Twitter thread to learn more about Veriscope Share: <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1595598374643941376">The Basics of Veriscope Share</a>.</p> The Veriscope Share&nbsp;Workflow <p>Veriscope Share’s workflow begins when an originator VASP (oVASP), or the crypto business whose customer has requested a withdrawal, posts an attestation on the Shyft Network. The following flowchart describes the entire&nbsp;process:</p><p>We have covered the workflow of Veriscope Share in <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1600309816865464322">Part-3(4)</a> of the Veriscope campaign.</p> HOW  Shyft Veriscope-the Only Frictionless Travel Rule Compliance Solution <p>The HTTPS-based Shyft Veriscope is an end-to-end solution designed to help virtual asset service providers (VASPs) comply with the crypto Travel Rule. All its payloads are encrypted.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1605571878256627712?s=20&amp;t=m_ykOHfZCr9233hJ0VXjDw">Image Source</a>)<p>Its impressive features include RESTful APIs, webhooks, and the option for on-premise installation. There are several advantages of using Shyft Veriscope, which you can find in <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1605571878256627712">Part-5(1)</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1605020855528030209?s=20&amp;t=Evvm4flbhlAhq6Pn7oVviQ">Part-5(2)</a> of our Veriscope social media campaign.</p> The Current State of Travel Rule Compliance <p>Outside Shyft Veriscope, facilitating user data transfer between VASPs for Travel Rule compliance is a complex and often suboptimal process.</p><p>One of the major issues with the current state of Travel Rule compliance is the wrongful interpretation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, which causes various problems for&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Transaction Workflow From VASP’s&nbsp;POV <p>Both Originator VASPs &amp; Beneficiary VASPs have to engage in Name Screening, Wallet Screening, Know Your VASPs, and Transaction Threshold checks throughout the Travel Rule transaction workflow.</p><p>We looked into three unique cases to understand the workflow better in <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1606107783061016578">Part-6</a> of the Veriscope campaign.</p> How to Download Shyft Veriscope? <p>To download Shyft Veriscope, VASPs must first visit the <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.0.0/install/introduction.html">Veriscope Github repository</a>. It contains the complete installer and various components needed to download Veriscope.</p><p>However, before VASPs start the installation process, they must ensure they have access to a server that meets specific requirements, as shown&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1606289432331620358">here</a>.</p> Shyft Veriscope Testing and Onboarding <p>There are two ways to test the Shyft Veriscope API: the Postman Collection and the Sandbox Environment.

For example, someone could prove they live in an eligible city to qualify for a program without revealing the actual city. </p><p>2) White Label Wallet Service </p><p>Organizations that don’t want to spend resources building their own wallet can simply use &nbsp;the functionality of the Dock Wallet and offer their own branded wallet to their customers.</p><p>3) New Feature: Communication Between EVM Module and Native Modules</p><p>This release will enable developers to <a href="https://blog.dock.io/enhanced-evm-contract-capabilities/">build richer dApps</a> with the flexibility of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) smart contracts and use Dock's native features like DIDs. This was not possible before because the smart contracts didn’t have direct access to the data on the Dock blockchain. With our new feature, the EVM smart contracts can now read data like DIDs, revocation statuses, and more in addition to being able to verify signatures from DIDs and credentials.</p><p>4) Circom Language Integration: Anonymous Credentials Protocol Update</p><p>Previously, the expressivity of our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/circom-language-integration/">anonymous credential proving system</a> was limited. The holder could prove things like “I have a credential” or that “certain attributes across my credentials are the same”. But verifiers couldn’t request proofs for more complicated conditions like the sum of certain attributes should be less or more than a certain value.</p><p>Examples of these more complex requests:</p>  Someone wants to prove that his yearly income is $20,000 or less to show that he qualifies for a government benefit  Someone wants to prove that her yearly income is $200,000 or more to show that she is eligible to access an investment fund  <p>Because of these limitations, we updated our anonymous credentials protocol to enable developers to express "predicates" (checks that return true or false) on credential attributes using the Circom language. This language is a developer-friendly programming language that could also be used with our proving system. </p><p>Here are examples of applications that demonstrate the use of Circom along with credentials: </p><p>1.

Image by Jakub&nbsp;Novacek<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>It’s an extraordinary mystery. Despite all the incredible technologies developed to smash atoms and build telescopes able to see billions of years into the universe’s past, scientists are unable to see or measure 85 -95% of everything that exists. Yes, 85% of it, which is why it’s called ‘dark matter’ and ‘dark energy’. We know it’s there because of its immense gravitational pull. Everything else in the universe revolves around it. But we cannot see it, touch it, or measure it. Amazing. And extremely challenging for theories about how the universe&nbsp;works.</p><p>Modern economics has its own dark matter and dark energy. Virtually all economic activities revolve around it, pulled by its immense gravitational force. But it remains largely unseen and unmeasured. This economic dark matter/energy is called&nbsp;people.</p><p>Economics textbooks are full of endless discussions of entities such as firms, markets, products and prices. Now and again you might find a reference to ‘consumers’, but these are just an abstract entity used to explain something else called ‘demand’, which is far more convenient because it can be turned into a number and used as part of mathematical equations where people somehow get forgotten.</p><p>In economics, real people do not exist. Their lives are not seen and their activities remain unmeasured. For example, the concept ‘Gross Domestic Product’ ignores all the work done by individuals and households to maintain homes, bring up children, care for loved ones, and so on. These activities are not traded for money in markets and they are not undertaken by ‘firms’ or organisations so, in economics-land, they don’t get&nbsp;counted.</p><p>Likewise, every activity undertaken by organisations is investigated and measured down to the finest detail. How to improve its productivity, efficiency, effectiveness and performance? But meanwhile all the complex things that individuals have to do to manage their lives remain unseen and unmeasured, just like the physicists’ dark matter. We all know it’s there lurking in the background. But somehow it never comes into&nbsp;focus.</p><p>If you read our last three blogs on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">productivity</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">joined up services</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-struggle-to-connect-f233bd480d44">go-to-market processes</a> you might think we are falling into the same organisation-centric trap. These blogs seem to focus on organisations’ efficiency and productivity — and the way we talk about them there, they do (mostly).</p><p>But they account for less than half the picture, because the immense benefits we are highlighting don’t stop there — and don’t even start there. They are a byproduct, a part of something much bigger: a change taking place in the dark matter of the economy itself, outside of organisations’ sight and control, in the lives of individuals and the unexplored realms of household management.</p> Working the dark matter of the&nbsp;economy <p>For Mydex as a Community Interest Company this isn’t a problem. It’s our bread and butter. Our mission and our purpose is the community we serve: individuals and their households and communities. It starts with and exists inside the economy’s dark matter, empowering people with their own data via personal data stores that help them access, hold and use their own data for their own purposes independently of organisations that may have collected data about them, so that they can manage their lives&nbsp;better.</p><p>For those mesmerised by traditional organisation-centric economic theories this is alien and baffling. If everything that matters and counts is done by organisations and happens inside organisations, why bother with anything that happens elsewhere, in the dark&nbsp;matter?</p><p>We have two answers to&nbsp;this.</p><p>First, the ultimate purpose of all economic activity is people — not profit, or productivity, or growth. That may sound like a sentimental cliche but it’s a simple fact. If an economic activity doesn’t in some way alleviate human suffering or enable and enrich their lives, it’s pointless. Profits, productivity and growth are just a means to this&nbsp;end.</p><p>It’s hardly a new idea. Aristotle (who died in 322 BC, 2300 years ago) stated it perfectly in his Nicomachean Ethics when he said “wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else”. So why not address the end directly, rather than focus only on the&nbsp;means?</p><p>Second, because when the dark matter stirs it triggers earthquakes in the organisational part of the economic universe that we can see and measure. Mydex’s purpose is improving the lives of people, which takes us inside the economy’s dark matter into individuals’ lives, independently of and beyond the reach of the organisations that seem to dominate&nbsp;it.</p><p>But it was in the process of doing this that we discovered something important. Helping individuals and households improve their personal productivity and capabilities can also help service providers do the same thing: by enabling safe, efficient, privacy-protecting data sharing (which is what Mydex’s personal data logistics infrastructure does). Transforming the economics of organisations is a byproduct of transforming the economics of the household, not the other way&nbsp;round.</p>  When we highlight the ways in which data sharing helps service providers <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">eliminate FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost)</a> these benefits arise from work done elsewhere to help individuals eliminate their own FERC: all the time, effort and (sometimes) money they have to spend seeking and accessing information about themselves, gathering it, presenting it and proving it to service providers.  When we highlight the way better data logistics <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">helps service providers to deliver better, more joined up services at lower cost</a>, this arises from our efforts to reduce the frustration and effort individuals experience in being forced to provide the same information again and again (often to the same organisation), just to complete one, single&nbsp;task.  When we highlight the way PDS-based data sharing can <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-struggle-to-connect-f233bd480d44">streamline organisations’ go-to-market costs</a>, it comes from our efforts to help individuals find and access the services they need, when they need&nbsp;them.  <p>Yes. We are talking about an economic revolution that will transform how organisations work. But this revolution doesn’t actually come from inside organisations. It is not one of their ‘innovations’. It starts inside households, with individuals trying to manage their day to day lives better. It comes from inside the economy’s dark matter (which is one of the reasons why traditional organisations struggle so hard to see it and comprehend it).</p> The economy’s unseen, unmeasured gravitational force <p>What we are doing isn’t new by the way. It’s not as if the dark matter of individuals and households has only just popped into existence. Far from it. It’s always been there, exerting its gravitational pull.</p><p>Take food. The money price that people pay for food in shops is just a fraction of what this food costs them: all the time and effort spent planning meals, shopping, cooking, eating, washing up, acquiring and maintaining utensils, and so on. Likewise, the value of this food isn’t limited to its taste or nutrition either. Preparing and eating food is a deeply emotional, social thing. It’s got countless dimensions of non-priced, non-material value including sociability and bonding with other people, demonstrating love, the joy of developing and using a skill, demonstrating status, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>The measures, processes and purposes that explain households’ use of food have got very little to do with the measures, processes and purposes that obsess food producers. The latter hardly touch the former, which remain like dark matter: a mysterious gravitational force in the producers’ background.</p><p>Yet it’s this dark matter of the personal, human costs and the personal, human dimensions of value that has shaped the food industry over decades. Ready meals, fast food outlets, posh restaurants, home deliveries: they all different ways of addressing this personal, human cost/value equation. It is this invisible gravitational pull — of what it costs the person in terms of time, energy and emotion and the value it brings to that person (also in terms of time, energy and emotion) — that shapes everything the food industry&nbsp;does.</p><p>This is true for the economy as a whole. The 20th century was defined by the rise of the ‘consumer society’. This novel economic arrangement revolved around households acquiring and using thousands of manufactured gadgets: washing machines, fridges, vacuum cleaners, kettles, motor cars, radios, TVs, microwaves, computers and so on — a far, far cry from earlier times that revolved around land and agriculture.</p><p>Why were consumer products so popular? Because they transformed personal and household productivity, freeing up time and energy that enabled people to enrich their lives in other ways. The washing machine saved (mostly) women seven hours of labour a week. Central heating removed six hours a week shovelling coal and dust. Fridges helped people reduce time spent shopping, improved access to fresh healthy food, and reduced food waste. The motor car gave individuals and households freedoms and opportunities that were unthinkable before it became affordable.</p><p>It was this impact on peoples’ day-to-day lives that made this economic revolution so compelling and exciting, and it happened because of one basic thing. It was achieved by taking the machine out of the factory and making it available as a tool in the hands of individuals and households — empowering people in their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>In the early days of the industrial revolution the machine remained inside the factory. Cotton mills may have transformed clothing production, but what people purchased was the cotton product, not the machine. But with the 20th personal productivity revolution they also bought machines in the form of household gadgets to use for their own purposes.</p><p>The personal data revolution is doing the same with personal data. It is taking data out of the organisation and domesticating and democratising it, turning it into a tool in the hands of individuals and households, empowering people to use their data to eliminate FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost) and to organise and manage their lives&nbsp;better.</p><p>This is worth doing in its own right, regardless of its impact on organisations. But when it impacts both, the effects are economically transformational, just as the consumer goods revolution was transformational.</p> A critical&nbsp;insight <p>Returning to the potential benefits for service providers, there is one crucial point that stands out. Without grasping this point it’s impossible to see or understand what’s going in. None of the benefits to organisations we’ve been talking about can happen without individuals first being empowered with their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The elemental force driving this economic revolution is not more of the same — organisations empowering themselves to do more, better — but something new and unfamiliar: citizen empowerment. Organisations benefit only as a byproduct of citizens being empowered with their own data. Without citizens’ ability to gather, store and use their data for their own purposes, independently of organisations that may be collecting data about them, this revolution simply cannot&nbsp;happen.</p><p>To this degree, the revolution is taking place outside of organisations jurisdiction, sight and control. In the dark matter. For those immersed in organisation-centric views of the world, where everything that matters is generated inside organisations and done by organisations, this can be utterly baffling and disconcerting. Like dark matter. But that doesn’t make it any the less&nbsp;true.</p><p>Yet this is still just scratching the surface. The 20th century consumer goods revolution created entirely new industries, employing millions of people. The personal data revolution will do the same. We turn to this in our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

				  Indicio’s public benefit mission is to advance decentralized identity. How did we do in 2022?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Indicio began as a conventional corporation, but its founders made the decision, a little over a year ago, to reincorporate as a Public Benefit Corporation: Our founding mission — advancing decentralized identity — would be our public benefit mission.</p>
<p>The rationale for this was simple: decentralized identity technology has the capacity to protect individual privacy, enhance digital security, enable consent in data sharing, and provide a pathway to formal identity for hundreds of millions of people currently without any legal means of proving who they are. In short, it can deliver significant material benefits to society besides serving as the missing verification layer to the internet.</p>
<p>Reincorporating as a Public Benefit Corporation means that these material benefits must shape how we do business—that shareholders and stakeholders must align when it comes to business decisions so that we stay on mission.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? How did we advance decentralized identity as a public benefit? The answers are laid out in our first Public Benefit Report — along with our assessment of what we want to achieve in our public benefit mission in 2023.</p>

<p>Modern cyber threats require dynamic and evolving security countermeasures, especially regarding authentication.</p>
<p>What is adaptive authentication? It is a dynamic, risk-based approach to authentication that can use real-time information to guard against system breaches.</p>
 How Does Adaptive Authentication Work? 
<p>An adaptive authentication is an approach to identity verification that relies on risk assessments of users and their activity to determine whether or not to allow access. Furthermore, adaptive authentication enables systems to dynamically assign specific types of authentication to users based on several criteria to increase security based on real-time events.</p>
<p>The goal? To address the ever-evolving challenges to identity fraud and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a> that can threaten sensitive IT systems. In many contexts, authentication is seen as a one-time activity–the user seeks to enter a system or a sub-system, and the security infrastructure requires that users provide credentials to identify themselves.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to this approach. For example, if an employee’s work credentials are stolen due to a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">phishing attack</a>, then any authentication requirements will prove primarily useless.</p>
<p>Adaptive authentication attempts to solve this problem by addressing some of the limitations of traditional authentication through a specific set of features:</p>
 
 Risk Profiles: Adaptive authentication relies on evaluating risk in a system and applying criteria to that risk to determine authentication results. In extremely simplistic authentication schemes, the system may assign different access requests with high, medium, or low-risk profiles based on specific criteria. 
 
<p>Based on these profiles, the authentication system may require different verification forms (biometrics, PINs, etc.) or automatically reject the request.</p>
 
 Real-Time Assessments: These risk profiles and evaluations are conducted in real-time. That is, there isn’t a straightforward approach to risk that relies on a prior knowledge of an account or user. Instead, the system can compile information regarding risk categories and apply them to specific user requests as they happen. 
 Automated Decision-Making: To build more sophisticated authentication systems, risk-based systems will use machine learning and AI to monitor user and system activity to apply risk profiles dynamically. 
 
<p>AI can learn from these activities and risk profiles and more effectively and securely apply different authentication requirements to specific requests… if not outright denying them due to risk.</p>
 
 Trust: Trust is a significant factor in adaptive authentication… by assuming different levels of risk, an organization can then define who they trust and how they develop that trust. Furthermore, zero-trust security schemes can leverage adaptive authentication to strengthen their underlying security without relying entirely on standard authentication. 
 
<p>To summarize, adaptive authentication is a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to identity verification that addresses some of the limitations of traditional and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a>.</p>
 What Are Some Risk Factors Used in Adaptive Authentication? 
<p>Adaptive authentication can use several approaches to monitoring and identifying risk in an authentication system. These approaches provide sufficient information to provide any risk-scanning or AI systems to decide how, or even if, to allow users to authenticate themselves.</p>
<p>Some of these factors include:</p>
 
 Location: If a user attempts to access system resources from a specific city, state, or country, then risk-based authentication can take steps to require additional identification factors to mitigate fraud. Once the user is verified, the system can include their location information in a directory of accepted locations for authentication. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/what-is-behavioral-biometrics-authentication/">Behaviors</a>: Dynamic systems can monitor user behaviors, including purchases made, files or resources accessed, or login attempts to influence risk profiles. If a user’s account behaves in ways that align with fraudulent activities, the system can automatically require additional authentication or outright reject the user’s access. 
 Attributes: Attributes are more static than dynamic and require administrators to set policies around account information. These attributes can include roles, permissions, or devices used to attempt access. 
 Risk: The authentication system can combine the above-listed criteria with the sensitivity of the resource being accessed to determine specific risk attributes used to specify authentication requirements. 
 
 What Are Some Examples of Adaptive Authentication? 
<p>Based on applying these risk factors (and upon deciding regarding risk and authentication), an adaptive authentication system can apply different factors or authentication not only to a specific user, but to a user based on the actual request being made.</p>
 
 Low Risk: If a user has previously authenticated with the system, it may consider their following verifications low risk. For example, suppose the user has verified and authenticated a device like a work laptop, and they attempt to access system resources using that laptop. In that case, the system may only require a PIN or password. 
 Medium Risk: Suppose the system determines that the user request poses a moderate risk. In that case, however, the authentication system may require some factor of MFA in the form of a biometric scan or a one-time password over SMS. 
 High Risk: The system picks up on a user account, raising red flags–this could mean a combination of repeated bad authentication attempts, changes to core account information, or account access from a non-standard IP address or geographic location. 
 
<p>At this point, the system might read these activities as signs of fraud and deny further authentication from that account. Follow-up action might include direct contact with the user, a reset of login credentials, and verification of MFA.</p>
<p>In any of these cases, the utility of adaptive authentication is in assessing these factors and providing appropriate security measures.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Adaptive Authentication? 
<p>Any evolution in security technology will come with some benefits, and adaptive authentication is no different. Specifically, adaptive authentication provides a level of flexibility and adaptability that can only be achieved through intelligent, risk-based security systems.</p>
<p>Some of the key benefits of adaptive authentication include</p>
 
 Frictionless Authentication: Adaptive authentication can provide organizations with a way to streamline identity verification for trusted users and devices. While this approach might throw up more challenges for non-standard or unrecognized devices or user variables, it also allows for streamlined authentication for trusted users. 
 Sophisticated Risk Management: With a smart risk assessment system (and even some AI capabilities), adaptive authentication provides a more sophisticated approach to resource access versus static policies and complex, role-based schemes. 
 Up-to-Date Security Policies: Adaptive authentication can better adjust to a shifting security landscape. Instead of building new security policies and access schemes, this approach can better adjust to new vulnerabilities or attacks based on behavioral criteria. 
 Easy Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD): Smart adaptive systems can adjust to different devices, applying new and evolving policies around mobile, desktop, and IoT devices seeking access to network resources. Following that, the system can apply different levels of security to each to ensure secure access.

 We sit down with our new Head of Crypto Sales, Jason Tucker-Feltham to discuss the hidden costs of regulations, upcoming crypto trends, and why 2023 is set to be crypto’s coming out year. 



 



 With the launch of region-wide regulations, 2023 is predicted to be crypto’s coming out year in Europe. Do you think the upcoming regulations (e.g. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">TFR</a>) go far enough to protect consumers and crypto exchanges from nefarious activities? 



<p>Absolutely. As of now most crypto assets are unregulated. The key segment captured by MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) are security tokens, but that is a relatively small subset of the overarching crypto asset class. So, the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. are generally unregulated, and the EU was very sensible in identifying the need for there to be a strong regulatory framework that can capture those instruments that are currently unregulated. MiCA starts where <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-rules/mifid-ii-and-mifir">MiFID</a> ends in the crypto industry, and it has been described as the MiFID of crypto regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some say it goes too far, and you’ll mostly hear that from crypto businesses and crypto entrepreneurs. One of the reasons they say it’s going too far is the substantial cost of implementing MiCA. This may play to the benefit of TradFi firms that are looking to go into the crypto space, but for those crypto firms that are building emerging technologies, it may dissuade them from building, and it may lead to a certain number of crypto firms opting for other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, to do so might be short sighted because MiCA, as the biggest crypto regulatory framework that has ever been built, is not going to be the last piece of regulation for crypto. As other major jurisdictions are considering their own regulatory frameworks, by complying with MiCA now you are future-proofing your business and opening yourself to one of the biggest financial markets worldwide. In my opinion, MiCA does go far enough for now. Indeed, the big banks have already invested a lot of resources into lobbying for proportionate crypto regulation. For smaller players, however, they may say it goes too far.</p>



 So, would you say that the costs associated with implementing the MICA framework is prohibitively expensive? 



<p>Yes, absolutely. Even as of now, in the UK for example, a lot of crypto firms have estimated that the cost of implementing and getting on the FCA’s Money Laundering Registration is between £100 – 200,000, so that’s just one sunk cost on anti-money laundering compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, the cost of MiCA, as an incredibly comprehensive suite of regulatory requirements, is going to be significantly higher than that, which is going to put off a lot of crypto businesses from implementing the MiCA framework. However, MiCA is undoubtedly going to protect consumers, reduce risk in the markets, and be conducive to institutional adoption of this asset class. So, there is a real purpose and need for this regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>



 The European Central Bank recently warned European countries against the premature finalization of national crypto rules before EU regs were implemented, for fear of a patchwork system of regulations. Are there major differences in national crypto rules? If so, how will the euro zone be able to reconcile this? 



<p>Some jurisdictions have seen the inevitable implementation of MiCA as an opportunity to get ahead of the curve, and by sharing how applicable its national crypto regulations are, to attract crypto business. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Some jurisdictions have even gone as far as to offer certain tax advantages. A notable jurisdiction would be France, where two major crypto exchanges – Crypto.com and Binance – have shifted their European headquarters to, because there’s a certain amount of regulatory certainty, and research and development tax credits available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These jurisdictions are trying to futureproof themselves and cement their presence in the EU, which, of course, is a significant market for their business operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For businesses themselves, it could be operationally inefficient to implement MiCA-esque requirements before the full implementation of MiCA, but trying to make progress in the direction of MiCA could be very beneficial for certain players in the long term.</p>

 What do you see as the major challenges currently, or in 2023, prohibiting further mass adoption of crypto assets? 



<p>I think the key thing at the forefront of people’s minds is going to be the actual security of those centralized exchanges and custody providers. As of now, it is very much an unregulated space, and so we’ve seen huge, catastrophic casualties in the industry, and that is partially as a result of it being pretty much a “free for all” for those companies that decide to build technologies and offer services in the space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think custody and protections for consumers is at the forefront of people’s minds and that is something that needs to be resolved in the near term. Big losses in the crypto industry are nothing new, fraud in the crypto industry is nothing new, but what we need to see is more corporate governance and structures to act in favor of consumers, even in the absence of regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I am fully of the opinion that we need to have similar controls and processes that you would see in a traditional financial institution.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>From the get-go, you would expect there to be strong onboarding processes to ensure you’ve got a client set that you are willing to take on per your risk tolerance, and you are operating in jurisdictions that you wish to operate in, given there are varying considerations depending on the jurisdictions of your clientele. In addition, I think it’s a case of rebuilding trust, and that will not happen overnight. People are going to be thinking about what happened with FTX and a whole host of other industry titans, where trust was strong until relatively recently. Trust needs to be built up within the industry over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of that is ensuring there are controls and solutions and technologies that help rebuild that trust, yet do not detract from the user experience too much.</p>



 What role will KYC, and in particular, eKYC play in the future of cryptocurrency, with regards to a) ensuring operators adhere to multijurisdictional regulations, and b) ensuring operators know who their customers are? 



<p>It is a common misconception that everything is harmonized across the EU in terms of regulatory frameworks and data protection etc. Each jurisdiction has its own interpretation of EU regulatory requirements, meaning there is regulatory divergence, even within the EU. In general, these are relatively minor deviations, but there are some notable differences, like in Germany, with the requirement for video verification, and video conference-style onboarding. However, with the right solution, there are more streamlined processes available, even for Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, solutions need to offer a certain amount of flexibility, yet this cannot fall below the regulatory standards. So it’s an evolving landscape and providers need to closely track regulatory change and where required they need to adapt their solutions to that change so that their customers can remain in full compliance with local regulatory requirements, and then when it comes to the point where the likes of exchanges or crypto businesses are applying for licenses, be it from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">BaFin</a> or other major competent authorities, they are going to be well positioned to attain those licenses, because ultimately regulators around the world want to be assured that crypto businesses are doing the right thing; in particular observing local regulations, and selecting the right solutions in order to achieve regulatory compliance. The likes of IDnow are well poised to work with crypto businesses, to move their business in the right direction.</p>



 Increased levels of transparency and accountability is sure to appease the mass market and newcomers to the sector, but how about ‘old school’ crypto consumers, and so-called ‘cypherpunks’, how have/ are they likely to react to the new regulations and requirements? 



<p>I think a lot of the “old school” users of crypto are more likely to have libertarian values and, in some cases, enjoy the privacy afforded by crypto protocols. The likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum are pseudo-anonymous, and that gives a certain amount of privacy. There are numerous tools for users to enhance that privacy if a user so wishes, but ultimately all centralized crypto platforms must onboard users using KYC solutions, which obviously requires the verification of identity as part of that process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those who are really against revealing their true identity, a certain populace is moving to decentralized exchanges that do not require KYC, because as of now there is no generally accepted KYC platform for decentralized platforms, even though there are some undergoing development as we speak. The days of anonymous on-chain crypto usage may be numbered, especially as institutions want to gain exposure to decentralized finance yet are not going to operate with anonymous actors on-chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I believe it’s only a matter of time before KYC is just an accepted hurdle to getting access to crypto, even though as of now there may be some individuals who dislike that identity must be revealed as part of that process.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Obviously, it’s a necessary step for crypto businesses to understand who their customers are, and without understanding who your customers are, you don’t know what risks you are taking on; you could be transacting with criminals, or with sanctioned entities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some cases, exchanges want to reduce their US exposure because there are stronger punitive measures for that territory than in most other jurisdictions, so it’s a case of businesses establishing what their risk tolerance is, and if their risk tolerance means they need to understand who their customers are, they need to go through KYC, there’s no other option.</p>



 Why do you think fraud and other illicit activities are so rife in the crypto world? 



<p>I would disagree – this is a misconception in the industry. The percentage of fraud in the crypto industry is significantly lower than traditional finance. Chain Analysis and Elliptic – market leaders in understanding on-chain activity – have conducted a lot of research and established that a <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">relatively low percentage</a> of crypto trading and crypto transactions are attributed to fraudulent activity or illegal activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, there are bad actors in crypto, but there are bad actors in any industry, and it should not be the technology that is blamed. It is always going to be the responsibility of the people that use the technology. The optics of crypto have improved over the years, and I think this is part of the reason why larger corporates and institutions are more receptive to the technology and this emerging landscape. But there are still opportunities to reduce incidents of fraud and reduce the ability of bad actors to engage in the space. It just takes the right technology and solutions to be built to create a more secure perimeter in which people can transact. To say there is a negligible amount of fraud or criminal activity in traditional finance, done using traditional financial instruments, is therefore incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are the major risks and rewards of integrating crypto payments, or launching as a crypto exchange? 



<p>One of the major risks and challenges is safeguarding the privacy and custody of crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A major issue with crypto custody is that if crypto assets are lost by a third party such as a crypto custodian, the owner can’t go to a bank or intermediary and say, “reverse that transaction, that was an error.” There’s no safety net in that regard; once a mistake is made and it’s a catastrophic mistake, there is very little recourse, and significant amounts could be lost as a result. In addition, with decentralised finance, there have been several protocols that have had security deficiencies and led to a loss of funds. Ultimately, the risks in&nbsp; storing crypto assets are significant, and I think this is an area which needs to a lot more work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There needs to be a lot more work done in terms of providing custody solutions that are battle-tested and can be relied upon for significant holdings of crypto. Although fraud, percentage wise, is lower in the crypto industry than in TradFi, there is still a significant risk of fraud, as evidenced by the recent disaster with FTX, which appears to be displaying the tell-tale signs of fraud. Given the sheer scale of that event, I think a lot of eyes are going to be on ways of reducing the risk of fraud, especially with major exchanges. So, a lot of work does need to be done to safeguard consumers, and I think over time, regulatory frameworks and improvements in the technology will play a massive part.</p>



 If crypto exchanges manage to meet the aforementioned challenges and implement all the different measures, what is awaiting them at the other end of the rainbow? 



<p>Increased adoption! The safer people feel with crypto, the more likely they’re going to open an account with an exchange and start procuring crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately adoption requires a certain amount of trust and this needs to be established over time, and so by opening the crypto market to those individuals who currently feel safer within the confines of TradFi, you’re going to see increased volume come to your exchange once there is a shift in perception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the overall equities, commodities, derivatives, and other markets are huge in comparison with the crypto asset market, which is currently hovering around the trillion-dollar market cap level, if you want to have a bigger piece of the quadrillion dollar derivatives market for example, you’re going to need to establish yourself as a trusted asset class, and that will take time.</p>



 Why do you think online gambling and crypto has struck up such an unhealthy relationship? 



<p>The online crypto gambling industry started in 2012, with an online casino called SatoshiDice (a homage to the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto). It was the first online casino to feature bitcoin payments and soon became highly popular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the attraction of SatoshiDice was that by using Bitcoin instead of traditional payments mechanisms, those who chose to gamble online could do so with relative privacy. For those bad actors who are intent on using crypto for money laundering have long viewed this privacy aspect to be advantageous. However, most platforms nowadays mandate KYC which, when implemented effectively, reduces the risk of illicit activity.</p>



 What crypto trends do you envisage for 2023? 



<p>What is happening and will continue to happen is a lot of people who operate in crypto will fully migrate to decentralized finance, as DeFi is fully transparent; you can’t hide financials in DeFi platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As there is instant proof of reserves and the code is auditable, DeFi is the most transparent way of transacting in the crypto market. Many of the major brands that have gone under are centralized crypto operators, not decentralized crypto operators.&nbsp; Binance, crypto.com and others have been doing what they can to reassure the public by demonstrating proof of reserves, showing what they hold on their balance sheet, but that is still often reliant on humans providing audited financials, and so on. As such, it’s always going to be prone to human error. With DeFi, it’s all written in code, and participants in DeFi get that transparency in real time, and that is a major benefit of operating in DeFi. We’re already seeing trends of individuals that are going for DeFi protocols over CeFi just because they don’t know who they can trust in CeFi, until such a point where trust has been rebuilt.</p>

<p>Another year is coming to its end, and what a year it has been — one like no other in the over-decade-long history of cryptocurrencies. As hard as it is to say, this time is actually different. Not only did it test our resilience, focus, and determination, but it also rewarded us for all our perseverance.</p><p>Despite the ups &amp; downs and almost back-to-back hacks, rug pulls, collapses, crashes, etc., crypto enthusiasts and supporters remained steadfast in their belief that digital assets will continue to change the world for good. We continue to move forward through the calamities, the coldest of all winters, and do whatever it takes to see our mission of global adoption complete.</p><blockquote>Amid all the challenges the crypto industry has been facing in 2022, Shyft Network continued driving discussions with governments, regulators, and key stakeholders to strengthen the future of the entire crypto ecosystem and ensure that regulation of the space does not obliterate the ethos that drove us to innovate in the blockchain industry.</blockquote><p>The immense failures resulting from over-leveraged counterparties have led to the reality of accelerated pressure. Being in a position to guide policy and regulation, the most critical job for us is to ensure that failures are defined independently at all costs and regulations — stipulated adequately.</p><p>There is a great risk and an opportunity in front of us, while the timeline has drastically accelerated. We will do whatever it takes to ensure our mission is accomplished as we continue to ensure that open, decentralized, and censorship-resistant protocols can continue to build a better future, even when regulations are required.</p><p>Now, let’s look at what we achieved in 2022 in a bit more&nbsp;detail.</p> Strategic Partnerships <p>We inked many partnerships in 2022 and onboarded many Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) on Veriscope, which includes <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/dla-piper-partners-with-shyft-network-through-toko-platform">DLA Piper</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-network-partners-with-cointelegraph-to-throw-light-on-growing-institutional-demand-for-cryptocurrencies">Cointelegraph</a>, etc. Veriscope also went live <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/were-live-veriscope-launches-on-mainnet-with-binance-bitfinex-tether-huobi-moonpay-deribit-gate-io-and-more">on the Mainnet</a> this year, endorsed by Binance, Bitfinex, Tether, Huobi, Moonpay, Deribit, Gate.io, and&nbsp;more.</p> A String of Critical Developments <p>Keeping in mind the Shyft community and our end users, we undertook many critical changes this year. The most significant development of the year was the launch of Shyft DAO, which was formed after the Shyft Community voted in favor of&nbsp;it.</p><p>We also rolled out many new features in line with the demand from VASPs, which include <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscopes-address-proofs-enable-vasps-to-protect-critical-data">Address Proofs</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscope-launches-open-source-validator-to-help-vasps-verify-their-ivms-files">IVMS Validator</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/announcing-the-launch-of-veriscope-2-0-a-state-machine-with-an-enhanced-vasp-experience">Veriscope State Machine</a>, and&nbsp;more.</p> Growing Shyft&nbsp;Family <p>Increasing the scope of Shyft Network operation demanded changes and expansion in the team. We surrounded ourselves with top professionals — Malcolm Wright (Head of Strategy), Irena Mihova (Chief Marketing Officer), Nilang Vyas (Head of Technology), and Bryan Bishop (Core Development Team).</p> The Community: Campaigns &amp;&nbsp;Growth <p>In the midst of all developments, we kept growing and educating our community; we launched a series of initiatives where education was combined with a dose of fun. We celebrated the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom?61d0acf8_page=10">Lunar New Year</a> together, learned for almost two months about everything Veriscope, and recently hosted <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-special-competition-for-creatives">Shyft Special Competition for Creatives</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-networks-holiday-raffle">Shyft Network’s Holiday&nbsp;Raffle</a>.</p><p>One of the most impactful series we launched this year was Veriscope Regulatory Recap, which today has become one of the most insightful weekly newsletters in the crypto regulations space.

<p>Bruce Pon, Founder of Ocean Protocol, comes back for Ocean’s latest release, the future of data ownership and&nbsp;crypto</p><p>In our 21st episode, we bring back Bruce Pon, Founder of Ocean Protocol Foundation, to discuss the future of Web3. During this episode, Bruce talks about overcoming crypto downturns, establishing a free, new data economy, and the future of data ownership. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>Why is Bruce optimistic about Web3 at&nbsp;present?</p><p>If you look back at 2014, Bitcoin was just a meme, an idea for a movement to own your money and be your own bank. By 2018, about 200 ICO projects were funded. The first tentative apps were coming, but nothing hit the Product-Market-fit except Ethereum. From that period, only 20 or 30 teams survived, and Ocean Protocol was one of&nbsp;them.</p><p>In 2022, dozens of unicorn projects and thousands of projects were funded, with countries opening up access to crypto and making Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies legal tender. There is nothing but optimism. Don’t be like Paul Krugman, who mistook temporary setbacks as something that would kill innovation and adoption. All you need is time. So when there’s blood on the streets and everyone’s tapping out because it feels like it just cannot get any worse, that’s when you enter the ring. That’s when it takes conviction, courage, some adventure, and a lot of fortitude.</p><blockquote>“Being through this two times already, I’ve seen how it happens. I am betting it all, personally, within this company because I have been there, and I know that anybody who sticks around will be rewarded. I have nothing but optimism for this space because if you look back to 2014 or 2018 and where we are now–it’s an exponential curve, and we’re still&nbsp;early.”</blockquote><p>Keeping the Ocean Community motivated through&nbsp;2022</p><p>Bruce points out that what’s good at Ocean is that there have not been a lot of unforced errors. While they tried out AMMs for pricing, minting, and more, he considers it more experimentation than unforced&nbsp;errors.</p><blockquote>“I think we’ve done well by the community. We devote a lot of time to just cleaning up everything and preparing for the downturn, which will last another year or so. The ethos that carries us forward now is that we are very conservative.”</blockquote><p>From the community perspective, it’s natural that there’s fatigue, frustration, and pain from losing money. There are so many ways that you could have lost money this year, and not a lot of ways that you could have made money. The same has been felt in the previous two downturns. What this moment does is take away the tourists and the dilettantes. It keeps the people who are really into crypto and have a long-term horizon. It’s not bad that people leave and find other things–this space moves so fast, and it’s so intense. Some people just need to pause and explore other&nbsp;things.</p><blockquote>“We’re going to be there when the crypto winter ends because we’ve been trying to be as conservative as possible to make sure that we are successful as one of the next projects that come out of this phase kicking and screaming.”</blockquote><p>FTX incident and Trust in the Crypto Community</p><p>The first thing that comes to mind is to take money off the table. Remember the feeling that you have right now and the gut-wrenching hole in your stomach because you didn’t take enough off at the peak. It’s important to keep that in mind because the next cycle is coming, and we are all going to have a shot&nbsp;again.</p><p>People outside have a hard time distinguishing between crypto and FTX. Still, FTX embodied the worst of the existing financial system: centralized control, opaqueness in the books, buying political influence in cover, outright fraud, lies, and virtue signaling while robbing&nbsp;people.</p><p>Crypto, on the other hand, has had complete transparency of the books, unwinding billions of dollars time and again, and the ability for people to withdraw to hard wallets when it got too hot and they felt insecure.</p><p>There’s a two-year run-up, and everything’s great. Then you have a two-year detox to eliminate the tourists and the scammers. Those who know, know. With every cycle, the curve becomes more compelling and unstoppable, and crypto will be adopted. What do we learn from this? Take money off, stay humble, keep building, and don’t lose sight. Tourists come and go, but in the end, the people who stay will be&nbsp;alright.</p><p>Is VC money good for&nbsp;Crypto?</p><p>Is VC industry’s foray into crypto good for Web3? Bruce tells us his point of view, having been on both sides of the&nbsp;table.</p><p>Unfortunately, VCs are former investment bankers, people who have high net worth or have very well connections to do their own type of signaling. They follow a pack, and they don’t necessarily do proper due diligence on projects–that’s good and bad. It means that some projects that should never have gotten funding to get funding in the hype, and frauds can continue to do their&nbsp;thing.</p><p>It also means that projects that don’t get to be looked at by more established VCs get funding to continue. If you look at something like Polygon, the founders asked for $5–6 million and got laughed out of Silicon Valley. In the end, they put together a friends-and-family round in India, and look at them now, they are one of the biggest successes out there, and that’s&nbsp;amazing.</p><p>You look in Romania, Elrond (the country’s first Bitcoin exchange platform), they got a little bit more backing, but nobody knows who they are. They have over and above delivered because of their network and the VCs who believed in&nbsp;them.</p><blockquote>“So yes, VC money is good. Yes, VC money corrupts and lets many frauds and scams through the gate that should not be let through. But I would always err on destroying the capital of many VCs in order to get two or three gems that contribute to the world. When Ethereum came out in 2014, it was overwhelming, and most people said it was a scam–probably one of the worst bets you could have done from a financial perspective.”</blockquote><p>VC money is money–we need money for innovation, and we need it for other things. There are dark sides to VCs and corrupting influences, but as a founder and a community member, VCs are your friends because they bring money. As long as we get 20 unicorns out of all the funding rounds, it pays for all the losses in aggregate.</p><p>A Free, New Data Economy on the&nbsp;Internet</p><p>Speech, money, data: there is no distinguishing factor between them. They’re all currencies; they’re all value. They’re all something that you can transport, own, and digitize that you were never able to before. We just learned that with Bitcoin where it was a fringe concept of owning your own&nbsp;money.</p><p>A free and open data economy has just free and open speech and free and open money–the ability for someone from Iran to communicate, share, and have commerce with anybody else on Earth. It’s for people to get agency in a world where there are a lot of shadowy powers that control large portions.</p><blockquote>“I want individuals to have the ability to take control of their own data and to monetize it in whatever way. I want for data scientists to then access it in an ethical manner, where people opt-in, where we have the provenance of the data, so when AI is trained, we know where the biases lie, but also who owns that&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p>Global borderless micro-payments, monetizing IP, transferring value, all the things speech, money, and data–it’s the same thing. Ocean focuses mainly on the data side. The world that has been created in the structures that were designed to exclude more people than they protect. A free and open data economy is fully decentralized.</p><p>As a team, Ocean looks to make our stack more decentralized so that people don’t have to trust the Ocean team members; rather, they just have to look in the code and know that it’s decentralized.</p><p>Why Data Scientists should be interested in&nbsp;Web3</p><p>It is going to be a 10-year process to educate. We’re still early and it’s a blue ocean–the data economy is just starting. Just like Bitcoin was a fringe concept. Just 10 years later, people understand the value of Bitcoin as this uncensorable form of money. It’s the same with data. It’s a little bit different in that we have copyright laws and intellectual property laws–but there are hundreds of tools emerging for data and&nbsp;AI.</p><p>There are challenges in training the data: What’s the provenance? Where does it come from? What are the biases? Just as an example, pharmacological data from the past 50 years has been mainly biased toward the white European male around 40 years old. That ignores ethnic differences, genetic differences, and a host of other types of differences. Training data provenance through a data economy that is blockchain-secured helps to understand that we need to go back to those pharmacological studies and figure out what those biases are. Then, we may need to retest many of the drugs that are out there to identify the impacts on, say, a small woman at 45 kilograms versus a man at 60 kilograms.</p><p>Another thing is orchestrating data flows across multiple tools and platforms. If you are a data scientist, you work on multiple tools and platforms. Ideally, Ocean is designed well so that you can orchestrate between all of that. There’s a menu that allows you to do this transformation, process its analytics, and dump it somewhere else. It’s an orchestration that&nbsp;is:</p>  Managed through a decentralized manner so that there’s provenance and there’s a tracking process that’s never forgotten  Owned completely by you: that intellectual property of a process of 25 steps through multiple tools, you can actually sell that as an industrial process.  <p>Everything blockchain does nowadays is not geographically bound–that’s the Web2 world. The world we operate in is borderless. If I have to use Visa or Mastercard, I have to enter my address for whatever&nbsp;reason.</p><blockquote>“That’s not the world I want to live in. I want to create a world, where if I’m a data scientist and somebody needs to use my data, they have filters on who can use the data or how they can use it, or at least the choice to do&nbsp;that.”</blockquote><p>Monetizing intellectual property, transferring value–there are many things where Ocean as an orchestration layer helps to solve problems, which we have not really thought of because we just assumed it was not possible until&nbsp;now.</p><p>Ocean for Data Scientists</p><p>We spoke to Bruce about the stakeholders that Ocean will focus on in 2023. Moving forward, Ocean is focusing on data scientists, AI researchers, as well as users. It will be use-case driven. It will be what a data scientist needs to set up a data orchestration pipeline. What does a user need in order for them to have a privacy-preserving computation for their algorithm? How do they load the algorithm? How do they get an indicator that their algorithm is completely safe? There’s some sort of cryptographic bond that tells them what has happened and is provable–that’s the angle Ocean is going&nbsp;for.</p><blockquote>“I just want to focus on use cases that really simplify and make Web3 more natural and organic, and integrate with the existing tools in the Web2 space. I think we will just focus on the narrow case of data scientists and AI researchers. If we can do that and execute that plan, Ocean will be successful and that will make all the crypto enthusiasts happy.”</blockquote><p>How far are we from having a dream data&nbsp;economy?</p><p>Crypto blockchain is a general-purpose technology. There are 30 technologies that have driven humanity, and from these 30, you can develop thousands of innovations that build on each other. Blockchain crypto is one of them. Rolling out a general-purpose technology takes about 30 years–it takes one generation.</p><p>So money, speech, data–we are going to be talking about this for a long time, we are still early. Somebody else is going to pick up the baton, but the power of what we are doing is immense. We are going to give agency to people–not everybody will take it, and only a small fraction are actually going to take control over their data, speech, and money. We are building toward the ability for people to have that option when they realize it’s important and there’s a utility to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Has General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&nbsp;worked?</p><p>We asked Bruce whether the European Union’s GDPR has worked in protecting internet consumers. He says, “Yes and&nbsp;no.”</p><p>Putting a stake in the ground and saying people should own their data and have the right to have some sort of control is good. In terms of implementation, the GDPR leaves a lot to be desired. Take website cookies, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>What is better is that when your data is generated, it goes into your data vault. In that data vault, there are different segmentations–freely shareable, partially shareable, and under certain conditions, not shareable at all. If we go to a world like that, you don’t need GDPR, because, by default, when you have a smart contract that matches up with an opposing smart contract, you have cryptographic certainty on the tracking of your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Ocean is trying to go for an implementation of GDPR that was not as prescribed as what the EU tried to do, but rather something more organic and gives people true control. It will not be just clicking a button to accept or reject cookies. Whatever you click does not help you. It shows how little control you have over what it essentially exposes you to what people were already doing before. Do you have more power? No, you&nbsp;don’t.</p><p>Message on Data Ownership</p><blockquote>“It’s a long journey–we have decades ahead of us, and it is unknown how it all looks. We are in an experimentation phase, and as long as the community has the patience for us to experiment and experiment with us, we will move forward. We are going to make a data economy happen one way or another. The only question is, how good is it going to be? How empowering is it going to be for people, or how dystopian is it going to be? That’s why my hat is in the ring, so I can fight for the one that gives the most people the most opportunity and control.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>1:43 to 2:43 — About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>3:00 to 6:03 — Ocean Protocol’s achievements in the past few&nbsp;years</p><p>6:05 to 9:34 — Getting through the crypto winter of&nbsp;2022</p><p>9:41 to 12:10 — What makes you optimistic about&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>12:20 to 15:41 — What the Web3 community needs to do for trust in the aftermath of the FTX incident?</p><p>15:42 to 19:15 — On the VC industry putting money into&nbsp;Web3</p><p>22:15 to 25:06 — Vision for a new, free data economy in&nbsp;Web3</p><p>25:07 to 29:31 — Why data scientists should invest in learning about blockchain and&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>29:43 to 32:15 — Who are the stakeholders that can come on board&nbsp;Ocean?</p><p>32:18 to 34:09 — How far is the new, free data&nbsp;economy?</p><p>34:13 to 37:09 — Has GDPR&nbsp;worked?</p><p>37:10 to 40:15 — What kind of projects does Ocean look at for giving&nbsp;grants</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 A year of growth and innovation: Our product highlights from 2022 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in December 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>🎉 Happy New Year! As 2022 draws to a close, we are proud to reflect on all the progress we have made with our product this year. We have made significant improvements in security, scalability, user experience, and connectivity for liquidity and DeFi. Below, we’ve listed the key achievements:</p>
 Security and scalability are essential 
<p>We have accomplished great strides in terms of security and scalability. To ensure security, we have conducted comprehensive security audits of our smart contracts and platforms, including penetration tests, code reviews, and preparation for the SOC2 certification. Additionally, we implemented innovative scalability features:</p>

		 
	 
      <a href="https://tokeny.com/from-start-up-to-scale-up-how-tokeny-prepared-for-large-scale-tokenization/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 Blockchain Indexer 
<p>We launched our own indexer and nodes management system to interact with blockchain and eliminate any downtime. It increases our capacity to handle thousands of tokens in parallel.&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/from-start-up-to-scale-up-how-tokeny-prepared-for-large-scale-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
          <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-onchain-factory/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 ERC3643 Onchain Factory 
<p>This feature enables issuers to deploy all of the ERC3643 smart contracts with one single blockchain transaction, as well as use the same address on every EVM compatible blockchain if issuing multichain tokens. <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-onchain-factory/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
          <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-v4/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 Upgradable ERC3643 V4 
<p>The version 4 of the ERC3643 smart contracts provides upgradability via proxy smart contracts that delegate their logic to an implementation contract to add more functions or fix any vulnerability. <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-v4/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 Enhanced UX for issuers and investors 
 
 
 
<p>The T-REX platform is now the most user-friendly tokenization solution on the market, even for those unfamiliar with blockchain technology. We have streamlined the process of issuing tokens and onboarding investors, making it easier and more intuitive than ever before.</p>
 
 
 

		 
	 
      <a href="https://tokeny.com/introducing-lego-like-onboarding-solutions-for-digital-asset-investors/"></a>   <a href="https://tokeny.com/introducing-lego-like-onboarding-solutions-for-digital-asset-investors/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 LEGO-like onboarding modules 
<p>Qualification:</p>
<p>This module enables platform owners to set up a customized website with smart workflows to check the eligibility of investors.</p>
<p>Subscription:</p>
<p>This module allows qualified investors to purchase tokens with different currencies and payment methods.</p>
<p><a href="https://tokeny.com/introducing-lego-like-onboarding-solutions-for-digital-asset-investors/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
                   
	 
		 
			 Vertical menu 
<p>As the T-REX Servicing now has a lot of features, we had to switch from a horizontal menu to a vertical menu to improve the UX. By doing so, it improves the organization and navigation of the platform.</p>

		 
	 
                   
	 
		 
			 Token agent management 
 
 
 
<p>This feature allows issuers to easily add or remove agents with specific permissions, enabling them to delegate responsibilities to the appropriate parties.</p>
 
 
 

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 Connectivity for the ecosystem to access liquidity and DeFi 
<p>As a technology enabler for our customers, we have to ensure that tokens issued with the ERC3643 standard can connect and interact with the service providers they need, from issuance to secondary trading.</p>
<p>We are proud to have achieved this, and we are now going even further by enabling DeFi. This allows our customers to access a wider range of services and opportunities, strengthening their position as leading innovators to quickly conquer the new market.</p>

		 
	 
      <a href="https://tokeny.com/dino-the-largest-distribution-network-for-tokenized-securities/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 Built an interoperable ecosystem 
<p>We integrated dozens of service providers to the ERC3643 ecosystem, which now covers the entire value chain. Tokens issued with our solutions are interoperable with all of them. <a href="https://tokeny.com/how-we-are-building-an-interoperable-ecosystem-for-private-markets/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
          <a href="https://tokeny.com/dino-the-largest-distribution-network-for-tokenized-securities/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 DINO distribution network 
 
 
<p>Assets tokenized with the ERC3643 standard are immediately interoperable with DINO to access liquidity provided by trading venues and distributors in the network. Partners are regularly being added. <a href="https://tokeny.com/dino-the-largest-distribution-network-for-tokenized-securities/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>
 
 

		 
	 
          <a href="https://tokeny.com/complydefi-the-compliance-sdk-for-defi-protocols/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 Permissioned DeFi SDK 
<p>The ComplyDeFi SDK is an easy-to-integrate tool that enables Web3 developers to launch permissioned DeFi protocols via verifiable credentials of identities to restrict participation, paving the way for institutional DeFi. <a href="https://tokeny.com/complydefi-the-compliance-sdk-for-defi-protocols/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			<p>I am proud of the progress we have made this year, and I am excited about the possibilities that the future holds. I am confident that, with your continued support, we will continue to grow and innovate, delivering even greater value to you.</p>

Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.  <p>As usual, the Ocean core team reserves the right to update the DF rewards function and parameters, based on observing behaviour.

<p>Modern threats are evolving rapidly in both scope and scale. Hackers are targeting governments and businesses alike with increasing sophistication.</p>
<p>What is an APT? It’s a complex, long-term attack against an IT system that intends to steal information, focused on obfuscation and concealment.</p>
 Modern Attacks and Advanced Persistent Threats 
<p>The concept of hacking or cybercrime has evolved significantly over the past decades. What was once seen as the world of strange loners and savants is now an underground economy of elite consortiums and state-sponsored criminal groups.</p>
<p>Types of threats have evolved as well. Sophisticated attacks, rather than looking to cause maximum damage, will use deception and little-known flaws to embed themselves into massive cloud systems for weeks or months.</p>
<p>Consider some of these notorious attacks:</p>
 
 Stuxnet: The Stuxnet worm is a widespread Windows work found in the wild in 2010. Its origin was traced back to a long-term attack against Iranian nuclear centrifuges and is generally believed, via deduction and direct evidence, to be the product of cyber warfare. 
 Hydraq: In 2010, Google disclosed an attack against their systems the previous year using a zero-day exploit in Internet Explorer. Considered a state-sponsored attack, the Hydraq trojan was able to infiltrate Google systems and steal their IP. 
 GhostNet: Researchers at the Information Warfare Monitor uncovered a large cyberspying ring with controls from China. Security experts detected its presence in the systems of high-ranking officials in 103 counties. 
 Cozy Bear: A long-term hacker group generally believed to operate under Russian military sponsorship. They are responsible for attacks on SolarWinds network management products that led to widespread infiltrations of private and public sector systems. 
 
<p>Advanced persistent threats aren’t simply a type of attack in the traditional sense. Because of the resources and time involved, an APT is often considered a group of hackers leveraging a specific approach to cyber espionage. At the same time, they are often simultaneously referred to as the collection of tactics and strategies that these groups use.</p>
 How Do Advanced Persistent Threats Work? 
<p>Some key aspects of an advanced persistent threat are its sophistication, multi-pronged approach, and time is taken to infiltrate a system.</p>
 
 Reconnaissance: The attacking group will begin to plan their infiltration. This will include understanding the systems in question, the personnel running these systems, the software the organization uses, and so on. In some instances, this may take weeks or months of in-depth research to understand the minutiae of every moving piece of the system. 
 Establish System Access (Incursion): The initial attack. This often comes from targeted spear <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">phishing attacks</a> or some combination of phishing and sophisticated zero-day exploits. 
 
<p>Once the group finally gains access, they will work to install trojan software as far as they can without alerting security. Often, this includes disguising the APT as benign software and using existing network traffic to hide communications between the trojan malware and the controlling group.</p>
 
 Deepen Access: Once the APT group has infiltrated the system and gained its foothold, they will take time to gather information about the system and its users. At this point, the primary goal is to deepen their access through elevated privileges. They can use these to dig deeper into protected infrastructure if there are weak authentication or authorization programs in place or poorly configured IAM solutions. 
 Move Laterally: In the world of cloud computing, everything is connected. As such, the hacking group will start to push their infection out into any connected services. This can include internal servers, private and public cloud systems, vendor systems, and client systems hosted on managed cloud platforms. 
 Watch, Wait, and Learn: If the APT group has evaded detection thus far, the goal is to sit and wait. With the right controls, the group can have unfettered access to any information they want in real-time as it moves through a network. At this point, they can work to broaden their reach, gather resources for other attacks, or find ways to infect other software created by the group (for example, patches for new versions). 
 
 What Are Some Signs of an APT Attack? 
<p>Unfortunately, one of the primary threats that APTs pose is that they are so sophisticated and hard to detect. Even as common cybersecurity tools and strategies change, modern advanced threads evolve rapidly. The fact that many of these threats are typically well-resourced (either through successful ransomware attacks or through state sponsorship) only makes them harder to get ahead of.</p>
<p>There are, however, some practices you can use to identify APTs in your organization:</p>
 
 Investigate Recent Phishing Attacks: Many APTs begin with a well-coordinated phishing attack, often targeting someone or some group with enough seniority to have significant IT access. Suppose your security team ever identified a phishing attack at any level. In that case, it’s crucial to determine if credentials were accessed or if users were directed to malicious websites where browser-side code could have compromised local business machines. 
 Follow Up on Malware and Trojans: A single security breach should never be considered an anomaly. If your team finds malware, always take steps to investigate the full potential impact of the breach and its spread. 
 Track Anomalous Account Behavior: APT activity may look non-suspicious at first, but there are almost always some strange patterns that emerge. This might include rapid or remote logins to local accounts or attempts by specific user accounts to escalate privileges or access confidential information. 
 Information Moving Unexpectedly: A surefire red flag of some security issue involves tracking data flow throughout an internal network. 
 
<p>If there is a sudden transfer of data from one location to another, to a location outside the network, or from archival systems, this could be a sign that a malicious actor is at work. This tell-tale sign can also include the movement of smaller pieces of data into large, unnecessary files that could be a staging ground for external transfers.</p>
<p>Actionable prevention of APT’s involves a coordinated effort across all technical aspects of your organization. This includes comprehensive policies and procedures around functions like:</p>
 
 Ongoing monitoring and logging of system and user events. 
 System-wide <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/zero-trust-identity/">zero-trust architecture</a> that eliminates security holes due to mismanaged privileges and system access controls. 
 High-level tracking and logging of data movements and security events. 
 Regular systems scans and annual penetration tests. 
 In-depth forensics analysis immediately following a breach or attempted attack. 
 Robust anti-phishing solutions and education. 
 
 Resist APTs with Strong Authentication from 1Kosmos 
<p>One of the most prominent attack surfaces for APTs is social engineering–namely, a phishing attack. The inherent weakness of traditional password-based security can exponentially increase your organization’s risk of falling victim to a sophisticated attack.</p>
<p>With a platform like 1Kosmos, you can resist APTs through decentralized identity management, strong passwordless authentication, and streamlined onboarding with verified identity assurance. Without passwords to compromise or a central honeypot to hack, your organization can close several attack surfaces forever.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you can leverage the following protections against Advanced Persistent Threats:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/sim-binding-definition/">SIM Binding:</a> The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>We’ve been talking about NFT technology and industry changes, with new people/brands/companies entering the NFT industry every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Karissa Bell, senior editor on the well-known electronic technology blog Engadget, tweeted that Mark Zuckerberg’s entry into the NFT space is working to bring NFTs to Instagram in the near future, and that users can cast their own&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Coinbase NFT announced earlier this year that it has contacted over 100 creators. Perhaps we will see its live NFT product&nbsp;soon.</p><p>While new products are mushrooming, already popular NFT pieces have gone through a round of waves, and those that remain have risen in value. According to the Nansen NFT-500 Index, the price of 500 premier NFTs denominated in ETH rose 68.5% between January 1st and March 9th,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>For example, according to the NFTGO platform statistics, as of writing, the The Bored Ape Yacht Club series NFT 24-hour trading volume was over $4.33 million, an increase of 48.55%, the series NFT floor price was 92 ETH, a 24-hour increase of&nbsp;5.03%.</p><p>Despite this booming trading market, the fact is that most NFTs are “asleep”. According to the NFTGO platform, there are over 2 million total NFT holders, but the average number of daily trades recently is only about 40,000. What’s the&nbsp;problem?</p> NFT is difficult to&nbsp;realize <p>In terms of functionality, what added value can a PFP bring beyond a collection and avatar? Considering the high price of NFTs, it may not be worth it for the average person to pay for an avatar that can only be collected (when they may not even be able to sell🤷🏻‍♀).</p><p>To put it bluntly, for most existing NFTs, they function more like a permanent collection; or they are too expensive to realize&nbsp;quickly.</p><p>In response, the resourceful Web3 developers have found another way, and the EIP-2615 NFT rental program has been launched!</p> Simple Logic of&nbsp;EIP-2615 <p>To realize NFT leasing, there is a problem that must be solved — how to transfer the right to use an NFT while keeping the ownership of the NFT in the hands of the&nbsp;lessor.</p><p>As a result, the EIP-2615 protocol was proposed. The ERC-2615 standard extends the original ERC-721 by defining additional roles to support leasing and collateral functions. In order to facilitate understanding, next I will show you a simple example of the NFT leasing&nbsp;process.</p><p>Step 1 Suppose Alice wants to lend an NFT that she owns, then she will create a blank [tenant] role on the Lease Agreement.</p><p>Step 2 Bob wants to rent this NFT, then he needs to fill out the rental request and pay the&nbsp;rent.</p><p>Step 3 Alice fills in the [Tenant] role with Bob’s&nbsp;name.</p><p>After this simple process, the NFT is ready for Bob’s use. During this time, Alice cannot transfer the [tenant] role, protecting Bob’s usage rights. However, if Bob violates the lease agreement or the lease expires, then the contract will revoke Bob’s [tenant] role and reset it to&nbsp;Alice.</p> Advantages of&nbsp;EIP-2615 <p>The EIP-2615 makes NFT leasing possible, depending mainly on the following EIP-2615 function&nbsp;points：</p> Unsecured lease <p>ERC-721 cannot separate the right of use and ownership, so to achieve a trustless lease, funds must be deposited as security. EIP-2615, on the other hand, realizes the separation of the right to use and ownership, and the ownership of NFT will not be transferred, so there is no need to deposit funds for security.</p> Finding the value of NFT&nbsp;usage <p>In conventional realization interactions, NFTs are usually blocked in the agreement as collateral and are not available to all. The EIP-2615, on the other hand, enables a leasing model that not only realizes NFTs for the holder, but also allows the tenant to fully utilize the NFTs during the lease&nbsp;term.</p> Enhance the security of business management <p>This separation of ownership and usage rights provides convenience and security for the management of the company, especially the management of DAOs. For example, if a company needs to provide a new employee with the right to operate a certain account, it can provide the employee with an NFT as the management credential of the account. The EIP-2615 allows the new employee to obtain the right to use the NFT, but the ownership still belongs to the company, thus playing a role in guaranteeing the security of the&nbsp;account.</p> Conclusion <p>Leasing is one of the rigid demands in human social activities, both for owners to cash in and for renters to use. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, NFT leasing will become an important part of the ecology as the industry develops. Especially in GameFi and Metaverse, NFT leasing brings asset management and asset liquidity for game guilds in GameFi and Metaverse real estate investors, and these empowerments will feed the ecology toward prosperity and encourage continued development.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/nft-for-rent-mind-opened-f428c93b4789">Ontology Tech Viewpoint | NFT For Rent?

 Context Matters for Identifiers <p>Identifiers as we know them are paired with and understood by the service that is providing them. For example, I might have a unique identifier for a bank account, and each bank provides a unique identifier for all of the bank accounts they issue. But as the world and therefore the services we use become more interconnected, what happens to the identifiers that are outside of the services they are being used&nbsp;in?</p><p>For example if I gave you an identifier, RQFCVKROOZGLC, there’s nothing in that identifier that tells you where it belongs or what it’s for. You could try to search for this identifier through various online services, and they would probably tell you they don’t know what this is for or that it could be an identifier for many things such as package tracking or an order confirmation. But what if I told you the context of this identifier was an Amazon Review? Then you would be able to resolve this identifier to find a glowing<a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/RQFCVKROOZGLC"> review of Blast Knuckles</a>.</p><p>This is one of the values that Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) provide. DIDs tell the system where to look to resolve the resource for the identifier, that is they provide&nbsp;context.</p> Using a DID Document to Resolve a&nbsp;DID <p>In the above section I provided an example of an identifier providing context for resolving a resource. With DIDs, we would expect to obtain a specific resource called a DID document to resolve the identifier and provide the context for the&nbsp;DID.</p><p>The DID did:web:transmute.industries resolves to the URL<a href="https://transmute.industries/.well-known/did.json"> https://transmute.industries/.well-known/did.json</a>. That URL resolves to the following DID document shown in the figure&nbsp;below.</p><p>A DID document contains three sections that we want to focus&nbsp;on:</p>  verificationMethod  assertionMethod  authentication.  <p>Their relationship is pretty straightforward: verificationMethod provides a list of public keys. AssertionMethod and authentication contain references to public keys in the verificationMethod list. Basically this means you can use those sections to allocate different keys for different functionalities.</p><p>The ability to define one or more keys for a specific purpose is a massive benefit of DIDs. In addition to telling you where a DID document can be referenced, a DID document also shows who has control of an identifier.</p><p>Anyone can claim control of any identifier, but with DIDs the ability to prove control over the identifier is built into the standard.</p><p>If I claimed control of the did:web:transmute.industries identifier, I could also prove that I have control of that DID if you provided me a challenge to sign. You could then retrieve the list of public keys from the did:web:transmute.industries DID document in the authentication section.

<p>Many words<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/#basic-features-of-holochain-alpha"> have</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-approaching/#what%E2%80%99s-on-the-roadmap-holochain-beta-and-more">already</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/full-featured-holochain-beta-rc/">been</a> said about last week’s Holochain release. And it’s finally here! The first release candidate for the upcoming Beta of Holochain! We’re not quite ready for most devs to jump in, but we’re very very close — we plan to release the official 0.1.0 beta in late January, and the constellation of developer and end-user tools around Holochain are being updated as we speak. In fact the core team has already published a second release candidate, 0.1.0-beta-rc.2, to support new needs discovered as components were being updated.</p><p>What makes it very, very close but not quite there? A number of things changed in this release — anticipated functionality was turned on, deprecated functionality was turned off, and APIs changed in subtle ways. We prepared for this leap in many ways, but couldn’t anticipate every single dependency. As the developers working on components and tooling updated to Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc, they uncovered some issues with functionality they’d depended on. This triggered some Holochain core updates to make the new release candidate functional in each of these situations.</p><p>One example is that Holochain now requires all zome calls to be signed. This is a huge leap in maturity, as it means that a user can protect their running hApps from malware on their device. But it also means big changes to every client that accesses Holochain. It took a few rapid iterations to smooth out incompatibilities and nail down a good dev experience.</p><p>We’re also working on integration of all the dev and userland tooling. From our developers’ perspective, many things are ‘done’, but they wouldn’t feel mature to a new dev visiting <a href="https://developer.holochain.org">https://developer.holochain.org</a>. There are also some rough bits for existing developers accessing the dev tools via Holonix, the Holochain dev environment— while the code may be tested and working, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re integrated into the dev environment consistently, and some components are only available and working if you enter Holonix via a particular GitHub branch.</p><p>While individual changes might have been surprising to devs working on core components, at a high level it’s not a surprise. This is exactly what a release candidate is about — creating a hypothesis that a certain bundle of functionality is ready for release, then testing that hypothesis. This means we’re actually tackling the heavy integration and tooling work now, with the intention that it will be complete well ahead of actual beta in January.</p> Component status <p>Here’s a list of all the most important components and their current status.</p>  Holochain: currently at 0.1.0-beta-rc.2 and available on crates.io and via Holonix (note: the version at <a href="https://holochain.love">https://holochain.love</a> is still at 0.1.0-beta-rc.1).  JavaScript client: currently at 0.11.8 and available on NPM, compatible with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.1 but not 0.1.0-beta-rc.2.  Rust client: the <code>beta-rc-untested</code> branch is working with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2, and one Linux-related bug needs to be fixed before a release is made.  Tryorama, the testing framework: The code has been updated and a new release has been cut, but it was discovered that the new zome call signing requirement made it challenging to write tests. Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2 allows you to grant a capability for all functions in a zome at once, which resolves this problem, and Tryorama is being updated to eliminate the need for adapting existing tests to signed zome calls.  Launcher CLI, a new <code>hc</code> subcommand that spawns a running app in a Launcher window: Complete and integrated into Holonix, but requires better integration for a smooth dev experience.  DevHub: bug-free but requires the most up-to-date versions of Holochain and the Launcher, and further testing, before a release will be cut.  Launcher: A version is ready for internal testing using Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2. Our next steps are to update DevHub integration and test everything together before creating a release with downloadable installers.    The new scaffolding tool: currently waiting on a Tryorama release and a few bugfixes.  <p>Happy holidays! Very soon (probably next week) we'll be ready to invite you to start using Holochain, whether that means updating and testing your hApps, getting started with hApp development, or using a hApp via the Launcher. I’ll be back next week to report updates to this list, along with release notes.</p>

<p><a href="https://login.xyz/">Sign-In with Ethereum</a> (SIWE) has become the dominant standard for web3 login. It empowers any user to begin the journey to control their own identity not rely on "Big Login," or centralized identity providers that have incentives to extract value from users. At Spruce, we authored the Sign-In with Ethereum standard, <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/">p</a>rovided multiple libraries to simplify integrations, and led community support for any developer interested in integrating SIWE.</p><p>Back in November, we released SSX to further our mission to build a future where users control their identity across all their digital interactions:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">  Announcing SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything  We’re happy to announce the release of SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything - the easiest way to get started with decentralized identity and install Sign-In with Ethereum  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>After talking to a number of developers about SIWE, one of the largest problems we heard was that it's difficult to integrate with <a href="https://docs.login.xyz">just the core libraries</a>. We built a number of basic libraries to make it possible across multiple languages, but it made sense to give developers an even easier way to integrate it into their applications. </p><p>The other problem we found was a lack of additional tools that truly made SIWE an experience for users, rather than just a signing operation. We started to explore additional ways we could build something where users could bring their identity and data across applications, with SIWE as the first necessary touchpoint. </p><p>We can revisit our friend Steve from a previous post on decentralized identity.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/decentralized-identity-and-web3/">  Decentralized Identity and Web3  Decentralized identity is the continual catalyst that will unlock a new host of use-cases on top of those existing paradigms.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>Steve is now a web3 developer, building a dapp exclusively for people who own the paintings of Steve created by Alice. He's interested in adding Sign-In with Ethereum to his dapp, but there are other functionalities he is looking to add to his dapp as well.</p>SIWE: Batteries Not Included<p>Steve, in this case, has manually configured everything from the Sign-In with Ethereum library to all the other bespoke functionality derived from a few packages he found on the internet. He spends time carefully adding Sign-In with Ethereum through a library, and has to figure out how to add each additional feature he wants, such as his desired web3 provider, ENS resolution, and credentialing. Throughout this process, he's encountering endless documentation and joining endless Discord servers to find answers and get help troubleshooting.</p><p> With <a href="https://docs.ssx.id">SSX</a>, this gets a lot easier.</p><p>SSX is the functional equivalent of a Sign-In with Ethereum: Special Edition that includes the base game plus all downloadable content, add-ons, optional cosmetics, and more. For example, do you want to enable DAO logins or ENS resolution? Instead of doing the full configuration in your app from a number of disparate guides, just enable a feature flag – for example:</p> <code>const ssx = new SSX({
      enableDaoLogin: true,
    });</code> <p>We also never wish to limit developers in either flexibility in their code or the functionality they're interested in. Going back to our previous analogy, SSX doesn't just become Sign-In with Ethereum: Special Edition, but it also opens the door to modifications via extensions. </p><p>At Spruce, we're an open-source first organization that welcomes developers to have access to our code and also extend it as they please. There's no limit to what can be added regarding decentralized identity and data functionality with SSX.</p><p>For example, Steve would be able to add any functionality to SSX that wasn't available yet, such as imbuing users with decentralized chat functionality after they Sign-In with Ethereum.</p>Big closed-source software HATES this. Find out how Steve went from developer to contributor with this easy trick.<p>The core purpose of SSX is to be the foundation for what's possible with decentralized identity in web3. It doesn't just end with authentication; it's only the start of an entire journey for a user to own and control their identity and data across the web. </p> Getting Started  <p>Interested in getting started with SSX?

Mydex CEO David Alexander<p>The international publication <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/david-alexander-mydex-protecting-yourself-online-is-limited-by-the-systems-you-are-operating-within/">Cybernews</a> has just published an interview with Mydex CEO David Alexander. We reproduce the interview below.</p><blockquote>Current global events have proven that private and reliable digital storage is essential for every citizen, say Mydex specialists.</blockquote><p>These days, it is hard to imagine the sheer amount of data each of us stores both online and offline. However, making sure your data stays safe can be a challenge as it is rapidly becoming one of the most valuable assets that cybercriminals are&nbsp;after.</p><p>Avoiding these dangers without dedicated protection is rather impossible. Therefore, the <a href="https://cybernews.com/">Cybernews</a> team has interviewed David Alexander, the CEO and Chief Platform Architect at <a href="https://mydex.org/">Mydex</a>, a Cloud-based platform security company focusing on personal and identity data management. Here, he will point out the most important measures we should consider to maintain our data safe&nbsp;online.</p><p>How did the idea of Mydex originate in 2007? What has your journey been&nbsp;like?</p><p>Mydex founders held two core beliefs: 1) that how personal data was being collected and used by organizations was often unfair. Individuals were being excluded from participating in decisions about their data and were failing to access the benefits of their data; 2) that the resulting loss of trust and conflicts would undermine the efficient workings of the data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>We founded Mydex to empower individuals with their data — to provide a foundation for personal safety, trust, and&nbsp;agency.</p><p>We have learned since then that practical benefits such as reduced friction, effort, risk, and cost, for both citizens and service providers, are powerful reasons for adopting a different, citizen-empowering approach to the collection and use of data. We have designed our platform to deliver these benefits along with multiple quality improvements e.g. improved access; improved quality of service and outcomes; practical help for people wanting to get things done e.g. applying for something, accessing a new service, or communicating changes in preferences and&nbsp;status.</p><p>Our API-based data sharing technologies allow data to be accessed and used without the need to fill out forms or repeat information, and for trust (e.g. metadata about individual pieces of data) to travel with data as it is accessed and used. This enables radical reductions in duplicated effort, cuts out delays, and reduces risks for both&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Can you introduce us to what you do? What methods do you use to protect personal&nbsp;data?</p><p>At the heart of our platform lies a personal data store that enables individuals to safely assemble electronic copies of data held about them by many different organizations. They can also add information that only they know (for example about plans, goals, and preferences), and can share selected portions of this data with service providers when they need it, and always under their complete&nbsp;control.</p><p>Our services are free to individuals. Organizations wishing to interact with these citizens pay subscription fees to do so. Our platform services&nbsp;include:</p>  Personal Data&nbsp;Services  Identity Services  Next-generation two-way engagement services  <p>The protection of personal data is built into everything we do. All data is encrypted in motion and at rest. Each individual’s personal data store is separately encrypted, with each individual holding their key: we do not, and we do not want to, know what data individuals have in their PDSs. By distributing the data rather than creating one big centralized database, we greatly reduce hackers’ incentives to hack while greatly increasing the costs and complexity of their doing so. Mydex as a company has been independently audited and certified under ISO 27001 for Information Security and Management for the last nine&nbsp;years.</p><p>In your opinion, what data privacy issues should more people be concerned about?</p><p>We think the term “privacy” is often unhelpful when discussing issues relating to the collection and use of personal data. It is much more helpful to think of these issues in human terms of safety, agency, and fairness.</p><p>These are the key points to have in&nbsp;mind:</p>  Agency/utility. Looking at data through the lens of personal utility addresses the universal human need and desire for agency: the need to act effectively in their&nbsp;world.  Safety/”Safe by Default”. Humans have an instinctive desire for safety. When it comes to the collection and use of personal data this desire is best addressed by adopting “safe by default” processes. Much data sharing occurs as part of the normal provision of services to individuals by service providers.  Transparency. Transparency is needed for Safe By Default to work effectively: it should be easy and simple for individuals to see which organizations they have shared their data with, and for what purposes.  Data Empowerment. It should be simple and easy for individuals to exercise their rights under GDPR. For this, they need consent and data management dashboards where they can see all the data relationships they have in one&nbsp;place.  Fairness. It is best addressed by fair processes — e.g. processes that give individuals the right and the ability to shape what gets done and how to fit their own needs and preferences; that give them effective voice and mechanisms of control/influence.  <p>How do you think the recent global events affected your field of&nbsp;work?</p><p>Portable proof of claims and status has never been more important as people migrate across the globe whether driven by conflict or economic hardships. This is a trend that will not&nbsp;change.</p><p>Every man, woman, and child needs to be equipped with a portable repository of their lives and the data about their lives that is theirs and theirs for life that can travel with them and be protected from deprivation, loss of access to their devices, or single-point-of-failure reliance on state and local systems. Such a repository is essential to ensuring people are not left destitute or unable to rebuild their lives wherever they end up. Examples of the data held by such repositories are qualifications, experience (e.g. at work), assets, identity, marital status, parental status, DNA, and biometrics.</p><p>Recent events have shown that independent cloud-based storage that is resilient and independent of state or commercial actors is a fundamental requirement, as is the protected legal structure for any entity providing citizens with such services.</p><p>What are some of the worst mistakes organizations tend to make when it comes to handling large amounts of personal&nbsp;data?</p><p>These mistakes fall into three categories: mindset, purposes/priorities, and tech&nbsp;design.</p><p>Mindset. Many organizations see personal data as a corporate “asset” like any other — to be owned and monetized as efficiently and effectively as possible. But because personal data is about people, these organizations get sucked into treating people like&nbsp;things.</p><p>Purposes. Many organizations have fallen for the “insight myth”: the belief that the more data they can gather about an individual the more insights they will generate, making their resulting actions more efficient, effective, and profitable.</p><p>However, very often these activities do not require “more” data. They require exactly the right data for the task at hand. This makes data logistics — getting exactly the right data to and from the right people and organizations at the right times — the core driver of data value. Again, we are building the infrastructure and tools to enable this to&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Tech design. In their quest to build better customer experiences (and to access more personal data), many organizations expose internal systems that hold large amounts of data to the internet. This may make them part of the web or app experience layer, but most large systems holding high volumes of personal data were never designed to be available to the outside world, have not been designed to work at scale with high volumes of transactions, and often depend on perimeter-based protection which is all too often compromised.</p><p>What types of threats do you think can arise in the near future as digital identity becomes a significant part of our&nbsp;lives?</p><p>The risks we are currently dealing with are created mainly by this process of transition. The main risks&nbsp;are:</p>  Linking the wrong person to a set of credentials represents a real risk of fraud, identity theft, and all the bad things that could happen if this process is compromised or poorly executed.  Not linking a person to a set of verified digital credentials in an interoperable and portable manner that is independent of any specific scheme. In the dash for establishing markets and identity ecosystems, we see states, sectors, and large corporations seeking to define and take control of identity. The underlying proofs are not interoperable or portable across different use cases. This creates risks and huge inefficiencies, mostly arising from unnecessary duplication of&nbsp;effort.  <p>Mitigation of these risks can be achieved&nbsp;by:-</p>  Linking digital identity credentials with different factors (one or more sets of credentials) with other factors such as devices, email addresses, mobile numbers, and biometrics. There is a lot of interest in the processes being undertaken to bind these things together and then make those bindings irrefutable so that they can be trusted and monitored for any changes and used to secure multiple means of authentication.  Seeking real-world identity assurance linked to digital credentials. This is the next level of consideration where specific forms of proof of existence and status in the real world can be captured in a way that others can trust. These include relationships with the state (central and local government), and service providers (Banks, Credit Cards, Energy Suppliers, Health and Social Care, Third Sector, and Membership organizations).  <p>What are some of the best practices that organizations should adopt to protect their workforce and customer&nbsp;data?</p><p>Data should be encrypted in motion and at rest. Following the 12 principles of <a href="https://www.mrs.org.uk/fairdata/principles">Fair Data, Trust Mark</a> is a very good place to start. Mydex is certified under FairData as well as ISO27001 for information security management.</p><p>The Fair Data principles apply to any organization that works with personal data. Organizations that are certified under FairData are audited independently so they can demonstrate that they work in adherence to these 12 principles.</p><p>Talking about individuals, what actions should average Internet users take to protect their data&nbsp;online?</p><p>Individuals’ ability to protect themselves online is limited by the nature of the systems they are operating within: the rules and regulations, the policies and priorities adopted by organizations, the technologies used, etc. Most of the necessary solutions lie at the level of system design, not that of individual actions.</p><p>Take the parallel of driving a motor car. Individuals can drive safely and carefully or dangerously and recklessly. But they do so within the context of all the safety technologies that have been developed over decades by car manufacturers, and by all the rules and regulations relating to car safety, road safety, road infrastructure, driving tests, etc. Most individuals will do what they can to be safe and responsible. The question is, does the context in which they are operating help them or hinder them in this&nbsp;quest?</p><p>The issues we face with personal data are not limited to “online”. Huge amounts of personal data are held in legacy systems “offline”. We need ways forward that address all collection and use of personal data, both online and “offline”.</p><p>To this end, every individual should be provided with a personal data store where they can aggregate their data about themselves independently of any of the organizations they are currently dealing with. And they should not share information with any party outside of an authenticated relationship. We need systems and processes that routinely, safely, quickly, and cheaply authenticate the identities of the individuals who are asked to share their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Share with us, what’s next for&nbsp;Mydex?</p><p>Over the past 15 years, we have built personal data store infrastructure and supporting services that are now in operation and capable of operating at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Scaling up and out is what is next for Mydex — multiplying the number, type, and range of services, organizations, and people using personal data stores as the infrastructure for data collection and&nbsp;use.</p><p>As a Community Interest Company, we are asset and mission-locked. We are not chasing a trade sale or flotation. Our only focus is the fulfillment of our mission. As we grow our network expands and more and more citizens and service providers will operate under our trust framework and secure network of platform services. These place the citizen at the center, in control, acting as the point of integration and empowered to get things done faster, better, safer, and&nbsp;easier.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/interview-with-mydex-ceo-david-alexander-ed90e8259660">Interview with Mydex CEO David Alexander</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Modern authentication has involved the use of biometric data for years. However, maintaining privacy without sacrificing security has remained a challenge.</p>
<p>What is biometric encryption? Biometric encryption uses biometric data to encrypt and decrypt security keys to maintain user privacy and security.</p>
 How Does Biometric Encryption Work? 
<p>Biometric encryption is the use of a biometric template combined with a key for use as a method of authentication. This approach relies on the uniqueness of biometrics to ensure that hackers cannot reverse-engineer a password or key.</p>
<p>The process of biometric encryption includes:</p>
 
 Key Generation: The system will create a digital key when the user enrolls, distinct from a password or PIN. The user then provides their sample (a fingerprint scan, for example), which is bound to that digital key to creating a new “private template” that represents the key encrypted using the biometric itself but cannot be reversed into either the key or the original biometric. 
 Verification: When users seek verification, they provide their biometric sample. This sample serves as the decryption key that decrypts the original digital key. 
 Application: The released key can now be used as part of an application, either as a password or as an identifier for a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate system. 
 
<p>In this process, biometrics can remain on private, local machines (like a mobile device) without disclosing unwanted private information.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Biometric Encryption? 
<p>The benefits of biometric encryption invoke the strengths of both strong encryption and biometric authentication. Security experts planned the creation of this encryption process to help minimize attack surfaces involved in authentication, namely the storage of biometric information or the use of passwords.</p>
<p>Some of these benefits include:</p>
 
 Privacy: Biometric storage presents a significant ethical and security challenge for organizations, both centered around the undesirable practice of storing large quantities of private biological information in a single place. Biometric authentication helps mitigate that by removing the need to store biometrics in a server. 
 Security: Biometrics is generally considered far more secure than traditional passwords. Biometric authentication adds a layer of protection by foregoing the need to store or transmit a password or biometric template. 
 Speed: Biometrics are simply easier to use. With the proliferation of scanners and cameras, it’s almost impossible not to have some device that can process biometric data. Accordingly, users can have faster and more reliable access to secure authentication without remembering passwords. 
 Compliance: Biometrics, including encrypted biometrics, are typically specified as an acceptable (often necessary) part of most security and compliance frameworks. 
 
 Is Biometric Encryption the Same as Private Biometrics? 
<p>Private biometrics, or encrypted biometrics, uses encryption algorithms to obfuscate biometric information while rendering it searchable. Algorithms using machine-learning-driven transformations involving encrypted feature vectors render the biometric data entirely unintelligible for humans while still useful as an authentication and identity verification tool.</p>
<p>Biometric encryption addresses two challenges with biometrics more broadly:</p>
 
 It’s generally considered unsafe to have biometric information in a database, serving as a honeypot for potential attacks. Stolen biometric data is a massive security concern, not the least, because it would allow hackers to undermine MFA and biometric authentication systems potentially. 
 Stored, centralized databases of personal and biological information present an ethical problem where data privacy and ownership run up against commercial concerns. 
 
<p>The suggested solution is to encrypt biometric data so that it cannot be publicly revealed to organizations managing authentication databases.</p>
<p>However, the challenges come when you consider the biggest application of biometrics–identification.</p>
<p>Private biometric methods ensure that the biometric template remains helpful in that capacity by utilizing an irreversible encryption process to render the template data much more minor and utterly unrelated to the original data. This encrypted information, however, is readily searchable in an authentication database and just as useful for authentication.</p>
<p>The benefit of this practice is that it allows users to continue to use biometric authentication without disclosing their private biological data–a key concern for privacy and human rights activities that worry about growing databases of personal biological data.</p>
 1Kosmos BlockID: Encryption and Biometrics for Modern Authentication 
<p>Biometrics are a staple of modern authentication, but depending on their implementation, they aren’t perfect. They can be spoofed or stolen, risking the security of user accounts and enterprise systems. With 1Kosmos, you can deploy biometrics bound to the user at the time of identity verification. Our biometrics ensure the user is the same user that initially enrolled their account. It can be no other. There is no possibility of compromise – can’t be stolen or spoofed.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you can leverage biometrics and strong, decentralized authentication using the following features:</p>
 
 <a>SIM Binding</a>: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone. 
 <a>Identity-Based Authentication</a>: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 <a>Identity Proofing</a>: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 <a>Private and Permissioned Blockchain</a>: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>In the <a href="https://northernblock.io/converging-towards-a-common-trust-spanning-protocol-with-drummond-reed/">previous podcast episode</a> that Drummond and I recorded together in October, 2022, we touched upon the hourglass design model for digital trust applications, which was just about to be proposed as a new Technology Architecture Specification by the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)</a>.</p>
 <p>Taken from THE TOIP TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATION: https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/</p> 
<p>The hourglass model is perhaps the most widely recognized hallmark of the Internet protocol suite. The single “spanning layer” at the “waist” of the hourglass is the IPv4 protocol. Much of the success of the Internet is attributed to this “hourglass” design in which the spanning layer protocol maximizes interoperability by providing a common way for all the higher level layers to communicate with all the lower levels. For those interested, I discussed how this relates to digital trust in more detail <a href="https://northernblock.io/trust-over-ip-foundation-the-first-public-review-draft-of-the-technology-architecture-v1-0-specification/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since we recorded that last podcast, I’ve spent time carefully reading through Kim Cameron’s 2005 whitepaper entitled “The Laws of Identity” (<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">PDF version</a>). I found it to be one of the most well written, and concise papers about (1) the impacts of not having trusted digital identities on the internet; and (2) seven laws to follow when designing digital identity systems if one wishes for it to be successful on the open internet.</p>
<p>It was interesting to then start visualizing how this ToIP hourglass model could start to embody the seven laws defined in Kim’s paper, which still resonates today, some 17 years after its publishing.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Drummond Reed, we discuss,<br><br></p>
 
 Does the new ToIP Technology Architecture Specification address the questions posed by Kim Cameron in his 2005 whitepaper? 
 If we agree that one identity system cannot rule them all, how then can an identity metasystem solve interoperability across identities, identity systems and contexts? (hint: a trust spanning protocol!) 
 What are the leading contenders for becoming the trust spanning protocol? 
 What are some examples of trust tasks, other than credential exchange, that are possible to unlock? 
 How does a trust spanning protocol x trust tasks lead to advancements in how we manage our relationships, and help us move away from phone numbers and emails as our most valuable identifiers? 
 Where can governments participate within the hourglass model framework to accelerate digital trust on the open internet?

<p>It can be said that in the Web3 space, you’re not truly involved if you haven’t been involved in a DAO. Without having set up a DAO, then Web3 applications seem to be behind the&nbsp;times.</p><p>Are DAOs really that important? 🤔</p><p>DAOs are very much like a blockchain based “company”. They encode management and operating rules on the blockchain in the form of smart contracts, thereby avoiding centralized control or third-party intervention. In today’s Web3, where DAOs are the trend, building a well-established DAO is a key part of many organizations and applications. When forming a company we may need to consider tax, finance, organizational structure, compensation system, etc. In fact, the formation of a DAO will also encounter such&nbsp;issues.</p><p>This article will focus on the construction of a DAO, to introduce the problems you will encounter in setting up a DAO, and the tools and products needed to solve these problems.</p> Establishment of&nbsp;DAO <p>In real life, setting up a company requires registration with a business bureau, and setting up a DAO will probably also require a realistic legal framework. Of course, you can choose to skip this step, but as a DAO that wants to grow in the long term, it will inevitably involve signing legal documents and other issues, and will then need a body to do all of the&nbsp;above.</p><p>Of course not all DAOs have the capacity and funding to put together a legal team, so there are now related projects on the market to help DAOs with the formation problem, such as Syndicate and Upstream Collective. Syndicate, for example, is a protocol that simply creates an organization for the user, adds its members, designs a legal structure for the DAO organization based on the needs of the creator, and creates the legal subject as well as providing a template for the protocol document.</p> DAO’s Communication <p>Since DAO members are located all over the world, participation is mainly online. Therefore, DAOs need a tool for convenient and timely communication among members. At present, there are two main communication tools used within DAOs, Discord and Telegram, and most projects prefer&nbsp;Discord.</p><p>The advantage of Discord is that it can subdivide the channels and classify the DAO members, complete a simple organizational structure, and have a simple bot service to solve some administrative duties and process routine affairs. The disadvantage is that the number of channels is too many, and the “noise” generated by them is easily distracting, so that participants cannot get the news in time. Therefore, some DAOs use Telegram for daily communication. Recently, the security of Discord is now being questioned.</p> Collaboration in&nbsp;DAO <p>Since the epidemic, the “work-from-home” approach is increasingly accepted by companies. In order to ensure the collaboration and efficiency of this way of working, remote collaboration tools are becoming more and more abundant and useful. Therefore, the current DAO collaboration tools mainly rely on traditional office software, such as Notion, Google docs and other tools. Of course, with the development of DAOs, there will definitely be collaboration tools specifically for Web3, such as Dework and Layer3, which have the trend of development in this&nbsp;area.</p> Incentives for&nbsp;DAOs <p>DAO participants are not all “do it just by love” type of people, “salary” is also one of their motivations. Nowadays, the mainstream DAO incentive model is usually to pay participants the “salary” corresponding to their contributions, and the overall logic is like PoW — more work= more pay. Therefore, the acceptance of DAO members’ work results and the corresponding incentive payment are especially important.</p><p>Among the existing products, Utopia labs and Parcel are the tools that can help DAOs to pay contributors and assess their contributions.</p> Conclusion <p>Of course, in addition to the above tools there are also decentralized multi-signature data clients for financial management, decentralized identity-based reputation scoring systems for membership management, and so on. As DAO is accepted in more fields, the application tools dedicated to DAO construction and management will be gradually enriched and refined, helping DAOs to develop&nbsp;better.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/if-there-is-no-suitable-dao-why-not-build-one-yourself-38cebf100b36">Ontology Tech Viewpoint | If There Is No Suitable DAO, Why Not Build One Yourself?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  The public sector is rarely seen as a driver of technological innovation; but when it comes to decentralized identity, some governments have been quick to embrace verifiable credential solutions. In our recent Indicio Meetup, we talked to three officials about why they chose this technology, how they implemented it, and why it created value.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Wherever you are in the world, you’ve probably heard that your government is “behind the curve” in technology, probably from your media and perhaps even from your own political representatives. But this isn’t the case with decentralized identity technology — at least, for some governments. In a recent Meetup, Indicio CEO Heather C. Dahl asked three officials to talk about why they chose the technology, how they implemented it, and what was the result.</p>
<p>The officials were:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancy-norris/">Nancy Norris</a>, Senior Director of ESG &amp; Digital Trust in the Ministry for Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation for the Government of British Columbia</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-m-tanner-esq-95a7546/">Elizabeth M. Tanner, Esq.</a>, Rhode Island Secretary of Commerce</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andin-c-g-bikker-6361739/">Andin C.G. Bikker,</a> Former member of the Parliament of Aruba and Former Minister of Justice and Integration of Aruba.</p>
<p>The Fear of being first</p>
<p>Governments are risk averse, which is unsurprising when it comes to IT; no one wants to be the author of an expensive disaster that could have been avoided with a little research or a more mature solution. But waiting for something to be well-vetted and a safe choice is also a source of inertia, particularly when it comes to technology that is constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With government,” said Tanner, “what we hear is ‘we’re afraid of blockchain.’ They don’t know what it is, they’re afraid of any kind of security glitches, they’re not sure how it works. There is this fear of being first. Often the thinking is along the lines of ‘why don’t we let one of the other states try it out first?’”</p>
<p>Tanner spearheaded a project that used a distributed ledger network to store the records of those who had obtained a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) license. This would make it easier for CPAs to work across state lines and improve their professional standings, particularly when handling matters like tax returns in other states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way they overcame the generalized fear of the new going wrong, she said, was by starting small. They only tackled the CPA license; they ensured the user experience was as simple as possible, only consisting of a few forms; and they kept the old system for obtaining a license, so they had something to fall back on if there was a system failure.</p>
<p>Meeting the needs of business and the economy</p>
<p>In the case of British Columbia, the government was responding to the business community lobbying for the technology. Canadian companies wanted to use verifiable credentials to improve responsible mineral and natural gas sourcing, reduce carbon emissions, and to share that information with the marketplace. Verifiable credentials provided a secure, tamper-proof way of recording and sharing that information. “It’s a good news story for them,” said Norris, “it makes them more competitive. This is an opportunity to showcase the results of their hard work.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Aruba, an island economy entirely almost entirely dependent on tourism, Covid was a disaster. “All of a sudden,” said Bikker, “everybody realized… that we had to reinvent ourselves and that the technology would help us greatly in that aspect.”</p>
<p>Bikker was already investigating using verifiable credentials to make travel more appealing to tourists when the technology handed them a pandemic lifeline — a tamper-proof way to allow <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">tourists prove their health status</a> before arrival without complex integrations or data privacy issues.</p>
<p>What public sector use cases have in common</p>
<p>Uniting these diverse use cases was a common thread: Governments need to create easily verifiable data. That means tamper-proof, privacy-preserving, and securely-transmitted data. That means avoiding complex IT integrations and third party data management. That means data which can be shared and verified across different domains and ecosystems, which means interoperable technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open-source decentralized identity technology provides all this—and in a way that is easy to deploy, meaning that government departments can quickly layer verifiable credentials into their existing systems, start with simple solutions, and then scale as needed. Indeed, Indicio designed <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a> as a complete solution for simplifying the process of building solutions.</p>
<p>We highly encourage you to watch the full conversation, which goes into much more detail on the projects and advice for others interested in starting their journey into decentralized identity. You can find a recording of it on the Indicio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om5eCKV6Jh0&amp;t=4s">YouTube channel.</a></p>

<p>2022 has been an amazing year of growth, with many of our initiatives gaining momentum. Let's review what we accomplished this year and then take a look at what we have planned for 2023. </p> 2022: A Year in Review <p>2022 was an exciting year at Fission. We continued to build out our signature edge app developer toolkit, Webnative SDK, and laid the foundation for our database and virtual machine. We celebrated several research breakthroughs and grew our company's presence and team. </p> Templates Added to Webnative SDK <p>Webnative SDK is Fission's core product suite for edge app developers. It is a true local-first edge computing stack, enabling passwordless accounts and secure, user-owned public and private data.</p><p>This year Fission introduced a few templates to the SDK. The first was <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/enabling-ipfs-encrypted-storage-walletauth/">WalletAuth</a>, which lets users sign into webnative apps using their Ethereum blockchain address. There are two versions of the WalletAuth template - <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/walletauth">Svelte + TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/walletauth-react">React + TypeScript</a>. &nbsp; </p><p>The second is <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/webnative-app-template/">Webnative App Template</a>, which empowers developers to build edge apps in the browser without building all of the infrastructure from scratch. We launched WAT with built-in passwordless login and device-linking (which uses UCANs for authentication), powered by the Web Crypto API. We also included encrypted IPFS storage (by integrating WNFS). There are two versions of the Webnative App Template - <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template">Svelte + TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template-react">React + TypeScript</a>. </p><p>Third, we created a <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/create-webnative-app">CLI-generator</a> for both WalletAuth and WAT. </p><p>Finally, we launched a new website for <a href="https://webnative.dev/">Webnative SDK</a>, packed with resources including these game-changing templates, demos, and developer documentation.</p>Fancy new Webnative branding! Research Accomplishments <p>We were able to make an exciting contribution to distributed systems data management by inventing the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-the-skip-ratchet/">Skip Ratchet</a>. The skip ratchet enables developers to move more efficiently across data in a hash chain. It builds on the idea of deterministic skip lists and has built-in security enhancing features, like the ability to limit read access.</p><p>We also submitted the first IPIP for IPFS that helps improve the protocol itself. <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-redirect-support-for-ipfs/">Redirect Support for IPFS</a> makes it easier to host web applications by telling the Gateway to intercept missing paths and treat them as rewrite rules, letting the single HTML file and the JavaScript it loads handle all of the routing. In other words, no more ugly error messages. Hello, redirected pages! </p> Conferences We Attended <p>2022 was the year of the conference! Now that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic has mercifully subsided, we've been able to travel and present in person at conferences again! This year we went to Portugal, Germany, The United States, Iceland, and France to give talks on our work building Webnative SDK.</p><p>Here is a list of the conferences and their corresponding blog post recaps:</p><p>CoD Summit</p>

 Plans for 2023 <p>Now that we've reviewed 2022, let's look ahead at our plans for 2023. As a leader and contributing member in a robust community, we have many initiatives in the works! Here are a few we're excited about: </p> Webnative SDK Additions <p>IPVM, our VM that brings content addressed computation to IPFS, is coming along nicely! Our CTO Brooklyn Zelenka is working on the spec now. If you'd like to learn more about IPVM, check out this <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-breaking-down-ipvm/">breakdown</a> from Brooklyn's presentation at IPFS Thing earlier this year.</p><p>Dialog, our far edge database for local-first applications and autonomous computing agents, is now RhizomeDB! <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/why-rewrite-it-in-rust/">We are focusing on Rust</a>, however others will certainly be able to create implementations in other languages. The repo will be private initially, but we'll be sure to keep you updated as we hit significant milestones! In the meantime, do check out these posts that provide a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/fission-reactor-dialog-first-look/">first look</a> and <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">explain our approach</a> in more detail. &nbsp;</p> Ecosystem Projects <p>Commons Funding: Fission is a fiscal host and contributor on <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission">Open Collective</a> and is currently spearheading several fundraising initiatives, including one to bring <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission/contribute/ipfs-media-support-for-mastodon-48315">IPFS support to Mastodon</a>. </p><p>CASA: Fission is a member of the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA">Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance</a>, working to make blockchains interoperable. We initiated <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/issues/132">CAIP-25 RPC Methods</a> in response to MetaMask deprecating ETH encrypt/decrypt, and we are working with others in CASA to document a secure way for blockchain key material to be used for encryption and decryption. </p><p>Permissioned Data Working Group: This is a new working group focused on enabling permissioned and private data on Filecoin.</p><p>FIL Accounts Working Group: We will continue our work to integrate UCAN and WalletAuth into FIL Accounts in 2023.</p><p>WhoCAN / NNS: WhoCAN and the Name Name Service introduce a new way to share UCAN permissions with keys without knowing what those keys are.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p>The role of Consumer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is still massively undervalued by many organizations. Both drop-off and churn rates are heavily impacted by cumbersome registration and outdated authentication options. Despite this fact, CIAM still is frequently treated as a side-show by the teams creating digital experiences. This also leads to disparate approaches across digital services, and in consequence to a negative user experience. CIOs must put close collaboration of software engineers and DevOps teams high on their agenda. CTOs need the right tools for rapidly delivering digital services. CISOs request unified security architectures. CDOs and CMOs care for customer experience. Thus, CIAM must become a standard architecture component and service in every organization. This integrated perspective is fundamental for success in the digital age.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thank you for joining this new episode. We often talk about digital transformation in this podcast. Actually one aspect that still needs to become more digital is commercial trade documents, in which there’s still a lot of paper. Today, our guests will tell us more about a game changing piece of legislation. So let’s welcome our guests, we have two guests today.</p>
<p>First of all, Chris Southworth, he is Secretary General at the International Chamber of Commerce, ICC, in the United Kingdom. Prior to joining ICC he was Executive Director for Global Partnerships at the British Chambers of Commerce, BCC, Head of the International Chamber of Commerce unit at the UK Trade and Investment, UKTI, and a Senior Policy Advisor to Lord Heseltine for his independent review of UK Competitiveness. Hello, Chris.</p>
<p>Chris Southworth: Good morning.</p>
<p>Oscar: Good morning. And our second guest is Oswald Kuyler. He’s currently the Global Head of Strategy for MonetaGo, a FinTech focused on global fraud prevention. Oswald is also a Digital Standards Adviser to the International Chamber of Commerce, UK. And he’s also the former Management Director of the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, DSI. He has worked on initiatives covering blockchain, electronic documentation in trade, data and analytics, and automation. Hello, Oswald.</p>
<p>Oswald Kuyler: Hi, how are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good, happy to have you both in this conversation.</p>
<p>Oswald: Thank you for the invite. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Oscar: My pleasure. So, Chris and Oswald, let’s talk about digital identity. I would like to hear first from you, from both of you, tell us about yourself and your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Chris: Sure, I mean, I should say that in the class of this conversation, I’m the co-chair of the Legal Reform Advisory Board and part of the leadership group at the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, and also the ICC representative to the Commonwealth, which is super relevant when we start talking about legislation and English law.</p>
<p>I mean, my background in digital trade really goes back to when I started getting really active around 2016-17, where we helped put together the ICC digital trade roadmap to get a framework in which we could be very clear with the actors of which there are many in the trading system of what needed to be done, by who, by when. And that was the beginning of, I think, a more structured conversation about how we go about the big task of digitalising world trade and ultimately contributed to the creation of the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, amongst other things, but also the Electronic Trade Documents Bill. So, it was quite a seminal piece of work.</p>
<p>And then since then, been very focused on our responsibility in the UK, because every jurisdiction needs to tackle this legal barrier in the document, trade documentation space, which is where national laws stipulate that commercial trade documents, that’s bills of lading, bills of exchange, promissory notes, those sorts of documents, there are eight actually in total, have to be handled on paper. And that’s largely because the laws in which we operate in trade go back a long time. In our case, in English law, it goes back to 1882 in the bills of exchange act.</p>
<p>So, it’s not surprising that that bill, which is a great piece of law, and we’re not proposing changing the law actually. All we’re doing with Electronic Trade Documents Bill is putting digital documentation or documents handled in digital form, I should say, on the same legal footing as paper documents. So, it’s actually quite a minor amendment in that, but there’s a lot more complexity behind that from a legal point of view, which is why it has taken, you know, nearly four or five years to come to fruition. So, we’re absolutely delighted that the bill has come into place.</p>
<p>And then alongside that, really working with the global community in the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, Oswald, and then in the UK case, with the creation of the UK Centre for Digital Trade and Innovation. You know, and the big questions there is how do we help drive a global campaign to every single government now asking them to very clearly to say that we need to remove the legal barrier to the handling of commercial trade documents. And then we need to align our national legal frameworks to what’s called the UNCITRAL Model or Electronic Transferable Records or MLETR in abbreviation terms. That’s really, really important. And unfortunately, you can’t do that at global level. Or, if you do, it have to be through the World Trade Organisation. And in the current political environment, that’s not realistic. So, it is a big task.</p>
<p>What I am really pleased to see now sort of forward tracking, you know, two or three years is we’re seeing real momentum, the G7 are really driving forward, the UK is obviously part of that, but the US have legislation, the Germans have legislation, the Chinese actually outside of the G7, are actively working on legislation. So, we’re starting to see the big economies now, really grasp the issue that we need to not just digitalise customs and trade facilitation where a lot of the focus has been. We need to allow the private sector, which is actually the largest share of trade, of course, because it is ultimately businesses that trade, to digitalise those documents. And that means we can get scale, we can start to really get interoperable systems into place where information can move in standard formats across platforms, systems, and processes across borders.</p>
<p>For anyone who’s not a sort of trade aficionado, it’s very easy to miss the sort of the reality of trade. You know, in our consumer lives, we all operate on mobile phones these days, life is pretty easy, you can tap your phone, you can get your bank details, you can do everything off your phone. And that’s simply because the systems are interoperable. It’s all standardised, doesn’t matter who your provider is, what network you’re on, the hardware and software all connects. Well, in the trade environment, none of it connects. It’s like, you know, the consumer world was 30, 40 years ago. And so, I call it the sort of Apple-Microsoft moment in trade where those two companies, and for anyone old enough to remember what it was like when those two didn’t talk to each other, it was – you had to choose one or the other.</p>
<p>You know, we’re at that moment when those two companies sat down, standardise their systems, and then our Word documents and all these other sort of practical pieces of information could just move across our hardware, software. Well, that’s the cusp we’re at so its super exciting. It’s, you know, effectively, we’re in the biggest transformational stage in world trade that I think we’ve ever seen in terms of the way we go about trade. It’s not just about digitalising eight documents, it’s about fundamentally changing the way we trade so it’s more efficient, you know, it’s click of a button money, goods, services, all move at the same time. And then ultimately, it’ll be about things like atomic settlement, digital currencies, you know, the transactions will happen in real time as the goods ship across the borders, rather than having to wait for two to three months at extraordinary cost and bureaucracy, because we’re all operating on paper.</p>
<p>And then I should just finalise, you know, just say how important this is to sustainability, because that also sometimes gets a bit missed. We can’t deliver a sustainable global economy until we get off paper. Because you can’t get transparent systems into place, you can’t aggregate the data, you can’t get a sense of real time what’s going on, where it’s going on in the trade corridors and supply chains until we get higher volume, accurate data, in digital systems. So, it’s a really important enabler to allow us then to kind of support the shift and transition towards ultimately a net zero economy but certainly more sustainable global value chains.</p>
<p>Oswald: Yeah, and maybe to build off of what Chris has just said, like, if I reflect a little bit on my journey on getting to the point where we are today, I used to work at a really big mining firm. And one of the key things we were actively trying to do is figure out how do we actually digitise whether it is our creative processes, with our customers, or with our suppliers and kind of what’s required to actually get that done. And we realise that if one of the largest miners in the world can’t achieve this, how are smaller companies actually going to enable the digitisation of these processes?</p>
<p>And to Chris’s point, there are many business cases and reasons why you actually want to do that. You know, whether it is for working capital reduction, whether it’s for ESG, and transparency, the list goes on and on and on. And a lot of these things just can’t be done using traditional paper mechanisms. And so, as a part of the journey, one of the things that Chris and I worked on a few months ago, was to try and put a lot of these things in context. And when you think about global trade, you know, 80%, and it sounds like a funny statistic, but I promise you it’s on the internet, 80% percent of global trade is actually supported by what we call trade finance. And if you have a look at trade finance, and it’s super important because it helps the world businesses actually execute business which is again foundational to having societies operate.</p>
<p>Now, when you think about trade finance. So how do banks really enable that? And it really comes down to really two core kind of buckets of things. The first is really, do I trust, or can I trust and identify the company or the companies that are involved in a trade transaction? And so, this is where identity and specifically the evolution of identity towards digital identity will play an absolutely key role.</p>
<p>The reality is that if you don’t solve identity, a lot of the inefficiencies generally won’t go away. And so, it’s fantastic seeing, even after the big global financial crash a few years ago, one of the first things that happened was GLEIF was formed, the LEI was established, you know, a lot of investments went into that. There are some additional standards that have matured and come out on the identity space, things like the W3Cs, DID specification. So, one of the things that motivated me quite a bit is this recognition that it’s not that we, as a society, need to spend another 10 years figuring out how do we solve identity. There’s a lot of great things out there. It’s more how do we actually mobilise people and businesses to actually adopt what’s out there and actually leverage it.</p>
<p>And the second bucket, which is just as important when you think about trade finance is the actual documents that are involved in trade. And Chris hit the nail on the head, the reality is, it’s very difficult to digitise trade documents if you don’t actually have some form of legal foundation, where you can actually transfer the possession of the documents in a way that is safe, a way that you can go into a court of law and dispute it, et cetera, et cetera. So, these two key areas are fundamentally critical. And it’s been a part of the journey that we’ve gone on, at least as a part of trying to figure out how do we contribute into the space.</p>
<p>Now, for your listeners, one of the key things I would highlight that Chris also touched on, because I think it’s so important, is the ICC produced a digital roadmap about four years ago. And I’ll never forget, when I left the mining company and I joined the International Chamber of Commerce, basically, it was such a fantastic foundational piece, because it highlighted all the key areas that required work, that required solving for, that industry, and government, public and private sector can actually focus on and say, “This is what we all need to do to solve the challenges so that not just the big companies can digitise trade but the smaller ones.”</p>
<p>Most importantly, who don’t have big innovation teams, who don’t have huge technology functions, who don’t have millions of dollars that they can allocate towards digital transformation agendas can actually digitise too as a part of this journey. And that’s been refreshed. I’m not sure Chris, if it’s yet released or not, but there’s a new roadmap, that is just brilliant. Again, it helps us all focus our efforts.</p>
<p>So that’s a little bit, at least at the macro level view from my side. You know, we need global trade to work. Businesses need that. Trade finance is foundational to enabling the world to trade. And digital identity and documents are the core pillars that enable global trade globally.</p>
<p>Chris: Yeah, this is touching on some really important points. I mean, and it links to what I was saying as well around antiquated systems. So, the role of the banks here is really important. I don’t think this is fully appreciated, actually, outside of the banking community. But in 9/11, that’s 20 years ago, at 9/11, I mean 2001, in came, you know, a huge wave of anti-terrorist financing regulation and legislation. We all understand why.</p>
<p>And then in 2008, financial crisis, in came another wave, anti-money laundering legislation, amongst other things. And again, capital requirements, you know, market stabilisation mechanisms. Again, we all understand why. But it came at an enormous cost. And ever since then, this particularly the financial crisis, we’ve been running at a 1.5 trillion trade finance gap. And what’s happened is the regulations have effectively tied the banks up in knots, in bureaucracy, having to verify, identify, and that’s all for legitimate reasons. The difference is, is the world’s moved on in terms of technology. All of those processes that the banks have to undertake, which nobody’s arguing with, can just be done so much more intelligently, with smarter use of technology, and it all hinges on identity.</p>
<p>If you can identify a company at the click of a button on a transparent register, you’re saving yourselves days, weeks, hours in time in checking, rechecking, verifications, duplication, every bank, there’s no central registry, outside of – well, I’m sure we’re going to talk about the GLEIF LEI register amongst other things.</p>
<p>So, you have to just – everybody has to check the same company in their own systems. And nobody gets transparency, what the other banks and other financial institutions do. None of that is necessary if we just use the Legal Entity Identifier model, which is digital identities. That’s absolutely crucial. And then it allows you, of course, to then start tackling other wider issues like fraud, VAT gaps, you know, governments are running huge VAT gaps in many areas, even in the UK, it’s 9 billion pounds. You know, in a world where government is short on public finance, like all governments, you’re looking for ways to generate more growth, economic growth and trade growth.</p>
<p>You know, we have a wonderful opportunity here by simply adopting, you know, the digital identity system and getting ourselves fit for purpose for the modern way of working in the trading system. And the digital identity is the absolute foundational core of that system. Without the identity, you can’t tackle the bureaucracy on verifications and anti-money laundering and KYC, all of this kind of stuff. You can’t tackle the fraud question well enough; you can’t tackle the VAT gap issue. It ticks multiple boxes in one go, and it’s not expensive.</p>
<p>The issue actually, that we get most feedback on in the corporate community is companies just don’t know they exist. And so, the first job is really to raise awareness, what is a digital identity? How can it help your business? And then importantly, how can you use it in your global supply chains? How do you work with your suppliers? So, you get total transparency, you can strip out all of that inefficiency, you can still meet all your regulatory requirements, but you’re just doing it in so much more efficient ways. And it’s just about using those technologies, enabling technology to help you run a more efficient, faster, quicker, simpler operation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see definitely a lot of benefits and why we’re talking about this. So, it’s so important. Let’s go to the details. So, what is this bill? What is the Electronic Trade Documents Bill?</p>
<p>Chris: Well, the Electronic Trade Documents Bill is really an amendment of the two pieces of law, the Bills of Exchange Act in 1882, in English law, I should say, and the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act in 1992. Now, clearly, those are out of date in the modern world of using technology.</p>
<p>So, the Electronic Trade Documents Bill is really quite simple. It’s putting commercial trade documents in digital form. And it’s important, it’s not digital documents, we’re not talking about PDFs here. We’re talking about getting the information off the paper and into the IT system. That’s basically what we’re talking about. But what the bill does is it puts commercial trade information in digital form on the same legal footing as paper. So, if there’s a dispute or companies are in a disagreement in a court, if you’re working on a blockchain platform, or a technology platform or system, that will stand up in court. That’s not the case at the moment. It has to be on paper. It has to be written, signed, and so on, and so forth.</p>
<p>And then it also stipulates which is important, the need for secure technology platforms to handle that information. And of course, that’s where solutions like blockchain come in. I don’t think actually blockchain is the only solution. But it is clearly a major part of the solution in the current trading system. But that’s obviously very, very important in terms of data security.</p>
<p>So, the law really doesn’t do much more than that. It’s only a page and a half, actually. People are surprised when they see it, because it looks deceptively small. It looks like really, almost a non-piece of legislation. But, you know, what’s important here is the disproportionate positive impact that will have, because it allows us to digitise the whole transactional space. So, at the moment, you can deal with digital certificates of origin, customs declarations, all of that kind of thing can pretty much be handled in digital form, that you can’t do the commercial trade transaction, which is actually the bigger more important aspect because that’s the actual handling of the goods, the finance, and the ownership when goods are crossing over borders.</p>
<p>So once those that legal barriers removed, it allows industry and government to start to really standardise the whole ecosystem. And that’s where we get paperless borders, frictionless borders. We still have to undergo the processes, you still have to do a transaction but you can do it in a radically shorter periods of time. You can do it without any of the process that you currently have to do. You know, there are 27 documents, 30 documents in total that companies are having to handle. It can take up to two to three months. It can cost in total, easily $80,000 or more plus, when you add it all up. It’s an extremely expensive business. And obviously, it’s hugely bureaucratic.</p>
<p>There was one example in the pandemic that really just highlighted all of this in one situation. And that was when the first wave of the pandemic was hitting the global economy. We were all going into lockdown, but our ships had left the ports. So, in the UK context, you know, our ships have left the southern ports, and we’re heading out to the east, to the Chinese ports through Singapore. And then three weeks later, we all got bombarded across the media with, you know, this huge logjam, traffic jam of ships sitting in Singapore. None of them could dock in, none of the goods could get in to port. And that was because all the documents were sitting in brown envelopes at Heathrow Airport, because all the airplanes had been grounded.</p>
<p>Well, that was completely unnecessary. Really, all of those documents, that information should have been in the system, the digital system, and then the transactions could have actually happened in real time. And that delay, and all the disruption which we’re still feeling today for consumers, businesses, and everybody should really have never happened at that scale. That’s the kind of impact we’re talking about by the Electronic Trade Documents Bill.</p>
<p>And then in the English context, English law context, obviously, this is going to be – have a dramatic effects and positive effects on the UK trading system. But actually, the more exciting aspect of this for me is the Commonwealth. Because we have 53 countries who all share almost word for word the same pieces of English law. And so, the Electronic Trade Documents Bill suddenly opens up the opportunities to accelerate that legal reform process across 53 countries. I think faster than any other global network can achieve it. Because we simply share the same legal basis. That’s one of the huge advantages of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>So, then it starts to get really exciting because it starts to happen at scale across big economies like India, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, obviously, and then actually huge swathes of Africa as well, don’t forget. So that’s the big opportunity come mid next year, once we’ve got the law in place in the UK, certainly my mind is absolutely switching on to that global environment. And by the way, even the Chinese, the Thais, we’re working with the Thai government at the moment on helping them with their legislation. You know, they’re also interested in the Electronic Trade Documents Bill. There are translatable aspects of that bill, that can be not necessarily copied and pasted but certainly the principles can be drawn across into other legal systems.</p>
<p>So, you know, to put this in context of documents, 80% of bills of lading worldwide are all operating on English law. So English law, and that’s a part of our heritage, our history, our legacy in the world. English was a disproportionately larger impact on trade than any other law in the world. So, the English law piece is crucially important. And that’s why we’ve put so much energy into it.</p>
<p>So, it’s really exciting in terms of stage, we’re at the second, what they call, the second reading it’s the second, you know, the sort of series of committees and forums that you have to go through in Parliament. It’s on a fast-track procedure through Parliament, which is good. We don’t have to have a whole year in Parliament discussing it. We’ve had two readings, we’re into the third, but by the middle of next year, we’re expecting it to come into force. And that means no more requirements for paper on any documentation in the UK. The whole UK system can go digital, and then we can really switch on to work with our trading partners.</p>
<p>By the way, the UK Government is wiring all of this into our trade corridors. So, every single trade negotiation at the moment with UK has commitments in the negotiations to go digital to adopt, align our legal systems, I should say to the MLETR framework. So, you know, it’s pushing out digital corridor, just like the Singaporeans have been doing for quite some time. You know, the UK is now starting to do that in the western hemisphere. And then obviously, in due course, the Germans, the US and everyone else will start doing it too. And then the world system will start changing at a rapid, more rapid pace.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s something that clearly, I was thinking of asking you, OK, this is in the UK, it’s going to be in place next year in the UK, thinking first one single country, but now that you explain that already spills to many countries, and with the influence that you mentioned, that has the English law in even more jurisdiction is quite impressive.</p>
<p>Chris: Yeah, it’s not just jurisdictions actually because like, say sort of bills of lading, 80% of those operate in English law. But a lot of international contract law is actually using English law. So, there’s a lot of private sector transactional work in all parts of the world that is actually operating on English law. I mean it’s a bit deceptive in a way because you naturally think English law is England, or even Wales, I should say. It doesn’t operate like that. English law kind of has this enormous global reach into sectors, industries, jurisdictions. That’s the really exciting aspect of this Electronic Trade Documents Bill is the scale, the scale of opportunity that it opens up.</p>
<p>Oswald: And maybe Oscar, to double click on what Chris was just said and to build on that is today, there’s a bunch of form platforms that enables people to try to digitise, you know, trade processes. And fundamentally, what they all are based on are these private law agreements, where the two of us sign a contract and say, sure, you know, if I email you this document, or if my system says you possess it, based on the private contract you have some form of recourse. But the problem with that at the top end, so if you imagine you’re a big multinational companies, you have to go convince your entire ecosystem. So, all your suppliers, all of your banks, all of your customers, everyone to sign up to the exact same legal agreement to say this is how we’re all going to operate. And what we’ve seen is really two or three consequences of that.</p>
<p>Firstly, the banks are sitting in a position where they are almost forced to sign up to every single one, because they fundamentally enable trade, and it’s exceptionally difficult to navigate that complexity. The second challenge is, when you think about it in practical terms, if you have, let’s say, two of the largest mining companies in the world, one deciding to use Platform A and another one deciding to use Platform B. You end up in a situation where suppliers and especially the smaller companies are put in a position where if they wanted to engage with those mining companies, now all of a sudden, they have to be onboarded onto multiple platforms, pay more money, teach a smaller workforce how to deal with more systems, and it just doesn’t scale. And the reality is, if you don’t sign up to all of the agreements, you have no legal recourse. And that’s why we’ve been stuck at about 1-2% of trade digitisation globally for the last two decades.</p>
<p>The second portion, and again, this is where identity really comes in. It blows my mind when you think about it. Every single one is the existing digital trade platforms, whether its internal supplier relationship management systems, customer relationship management systems, ERP, identity is done in completely different ways today. It’s not standards based. And some of these systems were designed 20 years ago. So, a lot of the cases identity was designed by some architect that just went and said, “OK, it’s going to be a string 256 field, and people can type in whatever they want to.”</p>
<p>And so, what ends up happening is as you go through a supply chain, to Chris’s point, every single part of that supply chain has to recheck identity, there’s no sharing of it, because there’s no, you know, there’s no alignment, agreement, governance, et cetera, on how that needs to be done. And by using digital identity and all the promises that it entails, again, you can remove a lot of that inefficiencies. And it’s not just that we want to remove that just purely for the banks, who I firmly believe are desperate for servicing more customers. It’s not like bankers wake up in the morning and saying, “I don’t want to serve more businesses.” But this is important for those SMEs who are just so small that when a bank looks at them, and goes, “I really want to finance this, but if it’s going to cost me that much just to verify the identity of a company, it’s very difficult to extend financing into that space.”</p>
<p>So, my closing thoughts on what Chris also said is, when it comes to English law, let’s also not forget that, and I would argue the vast majority of trade digitisation systems are either UK-based or leveraging English law too, which is another component of this. So [A] for all of those companies who have already invested in trying to digitise trade, once English law moves, they’ll get that benefit because it would be baked in. But then more importantly, those smaller companies who go, “You know what? I don’t necessarily potentially want to use a FinTech to digitise my trade. Maybe I just want to use email, WhatsApp, SharePoint, whatever it might be.” English law will give them the freedom to make those decisions with their supply chains, which I think is desperately needed.</p>
<p>Chris: Yeah, we’re not the only ones of course here. So, there’s a couple of important points here. The France is important. So, France is actively now moving to working on legislation. They’ve already identified the legal barriers. That’s the first stage. The second stage is now to draft a legislation. But of course, you know, surprise, surprise many of the Francophone countries around the world like West Africa, they’re following the same laws as France. So, and then Hispanic, huge parts of Latin America following the same basis in law.</p>
<p>So English law obviously operates in a slightly disproportionate impact beyond just the legal jurisdictions as Oswald has just said. But other parts, other country and other countries and their legal systems playing a crucially important role here. If we’re going to have changed in Latin America at scale, legally, then we really need to kind of have that model like the Electronic Trade Documents Bill equivalent, you could almost replicate or at least use that as a reference point.</p>
<p>It’s a very, very good point that Oswald just referenced. And this is a core, really for corporates so if there’s anyone who’s listening to this, as a corporate, from my perspective, I’m very much looking at this whole digital identity in the UK context, because I think it’s a great case study. And it helps us understand what’s going on and other markets. So, we know every listed company has a digital identity, because the regulation says they have to, in order to trade on the market. So, we know the corporate is gone.</p>
<p>So, the first question is, who registered for that digital identity? That’s a board director. So that’s upstairs, somebody has done the process and put their signature and got an LEI. The person who manages that, is the company secretary, also upstairs in the boardroom environment somewhere. And then we also know, they’re not using it in the supply chain. So, they’re fulfilling a regulatory requirement. Absolutely right. But they’re not utilising it to its full benefit. And that’s because that digital identity hasn’t travelled downstairs to the procurement managers, the supply chain managers, the buyers, and so on, and so forth, who can then deploy this at scale through their global supply chain to Oswald’s point, really. And then really encouraging all that supply chain to adopt an LEI. And then you’ve got full transparency, you know, exactly who is who in that system at the click of a button on one transparent register. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>By the way, it’s 30 pounds a year. Cost, it’s not a cost issue. This is not expensive at all. It’s just understanding what a digital identity is, how you get one, and importantly, how you utilise it. But if you imagine 30% of the major listed companies in the FTSE 100, for instance, big international trading companies all use the digital identity through their global value chain, that would be the equivalent of what half a million up to a million businesses, all using LEIs and digital identities. That’s the sort of transformational impact that we’re talking about. And that’s the kind of strategic thinking that we need to apply in order to really get momentum around the use of these digital identities. And then with all the growth benefits that come with it, which Oswald has already set out.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s really impressive. And thanks a lot for enlightening us about this very influential bill that it’s already almost flying, right? So, I will ask a final question for both of you, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Oswald: So in practical terms, what I would say is, have a look at your five-year plan, one-year plan, whatever your projects are for the next five years that you’re going to do, especially for at a big company, look at them, and recognise that quite a few of the opportunities in front of you are ecosystem-based opportunities where you need to work with whether it’s customers, banks, your carriers, your, you know, governments or whatever. You need to work with a broader group to actually get to that value.</p>
<p>And so, my view would be is go into, tell your teams say, “Hey, there’s an ICC standards toolkit. And this toolkit, it highlights all the standards, whether it’s identity of objects, identity of subjects, whether it’s title documents, whether it’s non-title documents. Build off that. Whatever we’re building because it means that we can engage an ecosystem way more efficiently.”</p>
<p>And then the second item is if I am a smaller company, and I don’t necessarily have these innovation budgets and projects, et cetera, et cetera, to Chris’s earlier point, there is something like an LEI, for example, which is digital identity, leveraging that and baking that into either getting it today, or putting it in your budget for next year so you can get it next year. These things will become increasingly more important for banks because it will help them shorten the amount of time required to do KYC on you so you will get the value benefit. Just make sure you’ve budgeted for it, make sure you understand it, and you’ll get the value from that.</p>
<p>Chris: Yeah, I completely agree with that. You know, in terms of a call to action, you’re a CEO, a CFO, a supply chain manager, in the legal department, General Counsel, you’ve got a massive opportunity here to really improve the way that you’re trading across your supply chain. And that means doing things cheaper, faster, simpler in the main but ultimately also about moving to a more sustainable system where you get more transparency and security through your value chain.</p>
<p>The answer is simply if you’re a listed company, go find your LEI, sit down with your supply chain manager and your bank and finances, and then really talk, have that utilisation conversation. How can I use this number to better effect to drive those sorts of benefits through the business? If you’re not a listed company, go get an LEI, you can do that through the Centre for Digital Trade and Innovation, that’s <a href="https://ubisecure-my.sharepoint.com/personal/chloe_hartup_ubisecure_com/Documents/Documents/Podcast/Episodes/Episode%2082%20-%20Chris%20Southwater%20&amp;%20Oswald%20Kuyler/www.c4dti.co.uk">www.c4dti.co.uk</a>. It’s 30 pounds to register. You can do it through the centre very, very easy. We’ve tried to strip away that ease.</p>
<p>If you’re in another jurisdiction, you can go to the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, GLEIF as it’s called. There’s a global register, there’s a list of all the issuers in the world, there are 35 of those. So, you can find the issuer of digital identities in your jurisdiction or region. About eight of those are global issuers. It’s very, very easy. Go get your LEI. It’s cheap, it drives massive benefit to your system. And most importantly, all trade will require in due course, digital identities. So that is 100% the future, the quicker we start to adopt them and use them, the faster we can get to that end outcome, which I think we all want.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, thank you. And if someone would like to get in touch with you or learn more about the work you’re doing, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Chris: Well, for me, it’s as simple you know, just get in contact, I think in the context of this conversation, the Centre for Digital Trade Innovation, you can do that through <a href="https://ubisecure-my.sharepoint.com/personal/chloe_hartup_ubisecure_com/Documents/Documents/Podcast/Episodes/Episode%2082%20-%20Chris%20Southwater%20&amp;%20Oswald%20Kuyler/info@iccwbo.uk">info@iccwbo.uk</a>. We’re easily findable on the websites, on social media, just get in touch, LinkedIn, happy to help. We’re here to support industry. Ultimately, our job is to try and accelerate that digital transformation over the coming years. Users, we’re set up here to help you, come ask and let’s do it and we’ll help make that happen.</p>
<p>Oswald: So, fully aligned to Chris, the Centre for Future Trade and Innovation, reach out. If you can’t find the website, find us on LinkedIn, both Chris and I are there. We can kind of move you towards that. That should be your go-to.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Again, thank you for this very interesting conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Oswald: Thank you.</p>

				  Proven Works was created to reduce the time consuming and expensive process of employee verification and provide easy-to-use, tamper-proof employee identity. Here’s how Proven Works, works.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Mike Ebert</p>
<p>The benefit of Proven Works is that it allows companies and organizations to issue proof-of-employment credentials to their employees. Why would companies and organizations care? Because by including employee, employer, and employment information in a portable verifiable credential, Proven Works unlocks a host of benefits — including enhanced security, a reduction in wasted time, and lower costs for all of the parties involved in an employment ecosystem.</p>
<p>By storing employee, employer, and employment details in a verifiable credential, you can quickly verify and trust that data. For example, if you have trusted employment data, you could avoid fraud or phishing attempts by using a verifier to prove that an individual is an employee of the company before taking a sensitive action. Some basic authentication and authorization workflows are also included with the solution, such as using an employment credential to open a building door or access a zoom call, further increasing the security of your offices and meetings.</p>
<p>Another major benefit is the reduction in time and money wasted entering and duplicating the same employment details over and over again, such as when applying for benefits, working with a payroll company, or when applying for a loan with a financial institution. This reduction in redundant work also has the additional advantage of lessening the likelihood of human error that can occur when quickly entering great quantities of information.</p>
<p>Legacy systems often rely on papers, human interactions, and purpose-built tools. Paper documents can be forged, human interactions can be gamed, and purpose-built tools can be constrained, meaning they are often not interoperable or useful in other contexts. Proven Works makes forgery nearly impossible, replaces some human interactions and augments others, and opens up employment data for use in a variety of other contexts and systems without the need for direct integrations.</p>
<p>This technology is still new, and one of the challenges many organizations have told us they face when using verifiable credentials is the “chicken or the egg” problem — who goes first in the ecosystem? Proven Works was designed to be deployed with all the parts of the early ecosystem coming into existence at the same time, solving the chicken or the egg problem by providing both.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a company is using Proven Works, other partners can be added to the system&nbsp; — insurance providers, payroll companies, 401ks, banks, etc. — to share the benefits of employment credentials, leading to a growing, vibrant network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proven Works is built on interoperable open source standards and technologies, so as Proven Works ecosystems start to overlap with other Trusted Digital Ecosystems, they will be able to interact and enable even richer experiences and benefits.</p>
<p>But how does it work in practice?</p>
<p>It’s pretty simple — organizations that choose to use this tool would set up an Issuer and a process (whether human or API driven) to collect employment details and then issue them to employees as verifiable credentials. Employees would connect to the Issuer, receive the credentials, and store the credentials in an Aries-compatible agent application such as <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+. </a>Various departments and systems within the company or from its partners would request credentials from the employees, who would review the requests and consent (or decline) to share the data from their agent application.</p>
<p>Proven Works is a quickly expanding solution, and we have two improvements coming soon that I am confident telling you about. The first is secure messaging — employers and employees need to be able to communicate with each other with less risk of impersonation or phishing. The second is that employment credentials will be able to be used as part of a passwordless login system to offer much richer authentication and authorization workflows.</p>

<p>Biometrics have come a long way, but the humble fingerprint scan still provides excellent security for enterprise systems.</p>
<p>What is Fingerprint Authentication? It uses the unique characteristics of the human fingerprint as a form of strong authentication.</p>
 What Is Biometric Authentication? 
<p>Biometric authentication uses factors of inherence (physical features or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/what-is-behavioral-biometrics-authentication/">behavioral traits</a>) as a form of identity verification.</p>
<p>In the earliest days of computing, it was considered sufficient to use a single factor for authenticating users accessing local machine resources. Even with the rise of the early Internet, most <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a> was done through a simple username/password combo.</p>
<p>The combination of advanced security threats, mobile devices, and scanning devices has led the security world (both consumer and business to adopt widespread multi-factor authentication (MFA), specifically using <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-biometric-authentication/">biometric authentication</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/biometric-authentication/biometric-password">Biometrics</a> inherently comes with a few distinct advantages, namely:</p>
 
 Uniqueness: Physical features, especially those tied to human fingerprints and facial features, are unique compared to a large population. As such, using these patterns as an ID is incredibly effective in asserting identity. 
 Liveness: Most biometrics shortcut a weakness of text-only authentication–namely, the user doesn’t have to be present. Instead, a fingerprint or facial scene requires (outside of sophisticated spoofing tactics) that the user be physically present at the point of authentication. 
 Simplicity: No one has to remember biometrics. Unlike passwords, which, in truth, many people shortcut by reusing phrases or using weak phrases, biometrics are readily available and require no engagement, just scan and authenticate. 
 
<p>Some of the most common forms of biometric authentication used today include:</p>

 How Does Fingerprint Authentication Work? 
<p>Fingerprint authentication, also called fingerprint biometrics, uses the unique characteristics of the human fingerprint.</p>
<p>The human fingerprint is composed of ridges and lines that represent a pattern wholly unique to the person when taken as a whole. Fingerprint uniqueness has been a cornerstone of law enforcement and media regarding law enforcement, and even in 2022, forensic science has not come across two identical fingerprints, even across identical twins.</p>
<p>Because of this, fingerprints are a great category of features for biometric identification. Furthermore, because modern fingerprint scanning technology has become both sophisticated and widely available, it’s relatively easy to use, find, and integrate into a security system.</p>
<p>Four basic steps are involved in the fingerprint authentication process:</p>
 Onboarding 
<p>For users to actually benefit from fingerprint authentication, they must onboard. At this stage, the user will typically interact with the device to provide fingerprint information through a fingerprint scanner. The scanner will often require the user to repeatedly scan their finger to get an accurate picture of the patterns contained therein.</p>
<p>On the backend, this fingerprint information will be encoded into a biometric schema or a data representation that can be used as a comparison point during authentication sessions in the future. This template is stored in a database for future reference.</p>
 Scanning 
<p>Users who want to access a system via a fingerprint authentication-enabled device place their finger upon the fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four types of scanners:</p>
 
 Optical: Optical scanners, as the name suggests, use visible light to take the image of a fingerprint placed on a glass plate. It then creates an inverted image that represents the fingerprint. These scanners are fairly accurate and inexpensive, but it’s critical that the surface remains clean or there could be reduced performance. 
 Capacitive: Capacitive scanners use small electrical charges to “charge” the fingerprint and use the capacitive potential of human skin against air gaps between ridges to map the print accurately. A little more sensitive than their optical counterparts, these are much more resistant to fraud due to the inability of hackers to use prosthetics. 
 Thermal: Thermal scanners use heat much the same way as capacitive scanners use electricity. With heat differentials between parts of a fingerprint, the scanner can construct a schema for the fingerprint with solid accuracy. However, it requires the device to generate heat, which may be a no-go for most devices. 
 Ultrasonic: Rather than use light, ultrasonic scanners use sound pulses as a sort of “sonar” reading the surface of the fingerprint. This is a slower authentication method than light-based solutions, but it is highly accurate. 
 
 Comparison and Authentication 
<p>Once the fingerprint is scanned, it is transformed into a biometric schema, encrypted, and sent to the authentication service, where it is compared against the user’s original schema. If there is a match, then authentication is given.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that some flexibility is provided in the comparison process. That is, the authentication mechanism will usually compare and approve fingerprint schemas within a failure rate. This is because changes to the scanner (scratches, dirt) or to the finger (dirt, sweat, cuts) could change the fingerprint enough to throw a false positive, even if the print is mostly visible.</p>
 What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks of Fingerprint Authentication? 
<p>Biometrics are the cornerstone for authentication and MFA, but there are many differences between the different types of biometrics. Accordingly, Fingerprints come with significant benefits and drawbacks, depending on what the enterprise needs.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Fingerprint Authentication? 
 
 Added Security: No biometric is 100% secure, and fingerprints are no different. They are, however, pretty darn secure, and for everyday use, fingerprint scans are more than sufficient for protecting devices. 
 
<p>If your organization needs more security or something more in line with certain compliance standards, then other forms of biometrics might be a better choice.</p>
 
 Simple to Deploy: Devices with fingerprint scanners aren’t hard to find or deploy. While fingerprint authentication is a bit more expensive in terms of initial investment, the overall cost compared to other biometrics is pretty low without sacrificing much. 
 Cost-Effective: Alongside the ease of deployment, the low cost is also a great bonus. Your business won’t break the bank by buying laptops or phones with fingerprint scanners. 
 
 What Are the Drawbacks of Fingerprint Authentication? 
 
 Fingerprint Damage: Fingerprints are unique but also subject to damage and degradation over time. Cuts, burns, or simple aging can transform a fingerprint into an unrecognizable pattern over time. Unfortunately, this can present a problem because once the print is damaged, there’s no reusing it. Most of us come with multiple prints to use. 
 Stolen Patterns and Schemas: Fingerprint scans are typically theft-resistant, but only partially. Hackers can steal schemas from security databases to use as a way to fool authentication systems. 
 
<p>Additionally, while incredibly difficult, it’s also possible for creative hackers to craft synthetic fingerprints to use at the point of scanning. The use of thermal or capacitive scanners mitigates this latter approach.</p>

 Eight Models of Blockchain Value <blockquote>The sector is getting written off as an irredeemable dumpster fire of radioactively toxic proportions</blockquote><p>With the latest round of crypto industry horror stories reverberating around the space and highly leveraged crypto exchanges getting written off as an irredeemable dumpster fire of radioactively toxic proportions, what is happening is a clear out of the grifters and incompetents that rush to any new, potentially lucrative, field to try and grab as much of the cash as they can before they get found out or the roof caves in. That does not mean the field is intrinsically cratered, the underlying structures remain sound, their value is in how they are used, so let’s look at “theories of value” for crypto — why is this industry worth working in, what’s going on and what went&nbsp;wrong.</p><p>There are a variety of theories about how crypto might make you money, some pathological, some reputable</p><p>Let’s start with the primal&nbsp;root:</p><p>There are a variety of theories about the different ways crypto might make you money. Some of those ways are pathological, some reputable.</p><p>1) Bitcoin is a hedge against US dollar inflation — Lots of people have believed that, but it’s not been borne out in practice.</p><p>2) Transactional efficiency — a wire transfer takes four days and goes wrong 5% of the time. It’s simply easier and cheaper to send tokens. This is truer than ever because of&nbsp;L2s.</p><p>3) Speculation — as traders try to out-guess each-other and “the market” (an aggregate of many others traders). Zero sum: every dollar made was lost by somebody else, unfortunately. It is essentially gambling, it needs both skill and luck to work. Tough, risky but&nbsp;legal.</p><blockquote>Bear Stearns and FTX had almost exactly the same business model, and&nbsp;failings</blockquote><p>4) Exchanges, market makers and so on — taking a little slice off the top of crypto-to-crypto transactions and crypto-fiat transactions. This is not new, it is what currency exchanges have been doing since the dawn of time. This is fine if that is actually what the exchange is doing, FTX was not. Basically FTX was not *really* a crypto company. FTX was a tradfi company that was buying and selling crypto assets. <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/too-clever-by-half/">Bear Stearns </a>and FTX had almost exactly the same business model, and failings, at the end of the day, and it took both of them down, flamboyantly torching vast amounts of value on the&nbsp;way.</p><p>5) Collectible digital property (NFTs etc.) — in which inherently valuable new things are created on-chain and sold. Also covers play to earn and similar things. The risk here is that the things don’t necessarily remain inherently valuable.</p><p>6) Lending and particularly flash loan - good old fashioned usury, but for flash loans, a 100% guaranteed return because if the smart contract does not return the capital, the smart contract aborts the transaction and the loan is never made in the first place. Uses old school banking skills, minus all that cumbersome regulation. What could possibly go&nbsp;wrong?</p><p>7) Ponzi schemes — Why take a slice when you could just eat the entire cake? Something that looks like an investment, but is just using the capital from people who think they are investing to steal other people’s capital. Flat out crime — hugely profitable until they get found out, then very&nbsp;bad.</p><p>8) Novel security services - like ENS and using Metamask to log into things. Self Sovereign Digital Identity fits here. And, of course, crypto “itself” — that’s bitcoin mining, Ethereum staking, hardware wallet manufacture, and all the&nbsp;rest.</p><p>I want you to note how much of the action in crypto is things *pretending* to be one kind of value, when in fact they are Ponzi schemes and zero-sum trade&nbsp;games.</p><blockquote>The distinction between Ponzi schemes and regular trading is important</blockquote><p>Take most NFT projects: the NFT has value for three&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>A) It’s art and you’re buying some kind of a right/licence (transferrable proof of patronage +&nbsp;legals)</p><p>B) It’s an object for a Ponzi scheme to attach&nbsp;to.</p><p>C) And there’s also “legitimate” speculation on future&nbsp;value.</p><p>The distinction between Ponzi schemes and regular trading is important. If people are “wash trading” (buying their own NFTs to make it look like they’re selling better than they are) then usually the NFT collection has Ponzi-like characteristics. Wash trading is simply&nbsp;fraud.</p><blockquote>This is where the Perez Cycle comes&nbsp;in</blockquote><p>So, where does that leave us now? Well, this is where the <a href="https://medium.com/invao/blockchain-quo-vadis-applying-the-perez-surge-cycle-c15ba685c831">Perez Cycle</a> comes in. To sum it up, essentially what happens with a new technology is there’s an installation phase where new technologies create new ways of doing business and solving problems, everyone gets very excited, stuff gets hyped, bubbles happen, and grifters and scammers jump on board and exploit the tech to make quick bucks in dubious ways. Everything becomes overinflated and unstable, the bubble eventually bursts, a lot of people lose a lot of money and a few go to jail and everyone else says ‘phew, thank god that’s over, we’ll never go near that stuff again’. Once the dust clears and the madness dies down, rational actors look at what’s left standing and take over the tech to do something unflashy and useful that actually makes money in a sensible way over the long term. We saw it with the dotcom boom, and no doubt we’ll see it again with whatever creates web&nbsp;4.0.</p><blockquote>humungous amounts of value have been torched…the authorities are rounding up the&nbsp;felons</blockquote><p>In the meantime, we’re at the point where the hype has happened, the bubble has burst, truly humungous amounts of value have been torched, all kinds of people are trying to put as much space between themselves and the blockchain as they can, and the authorities are rounding up the&nbsp;felons.</p><blockquote>The ‘Great Disinfection’ is in&nbsp;progress</blockquote><p>The ‘Great Disinfection’ is in progress — this is going to flush out the dubious use cases and leave the legitimate ones standing ready for the grownups to move in (would you really trust your money to someone who dresses like a toddler, even when <a href="https://twitter.com/iainmartin1/status/1591496451884040193?lang=en">interviewing presidents</a>, and apparently can’t tie his<a href="https://twitter.com/sbf_ftx/status/1468688160460877836?lang=en"> shoelaces</a>?).</p><blockquote>The actual architecture of the blockchain is&nbsp;sound</blockquote><p>The actual architecture of the blockchain is sound, it’s just a really good ledger, just as NFTs are just very useful receipts. Even the blockchain’s harshest critics admit that the technology works perfectly.</p> Frances 'Cassandra' Coppola on Twitter: "You may have taken it to mean that, but Casey Newton was clear that he was talking about the collapse of crypto companies, about which crypto sceptics repeatedly warned. No-one, absolutely no-one, ever said the technology didn't work. I'm tired of your straw manning. / Twitter" <p>You may have taken it to mean that, but Casey Newton was clear that he was talking about the collapse of crypto companies, about which crypto sceptics repeatedly warned. No-one, absolutely no-one, ever said the technology didn't work.

Moving forward it has potential to facilitate trade in stable, reputable, long established real world assets like <a href="https://mattereum.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The_Case_for_Gold_on_the_Blockchain.pdf">gold</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/revolutionising-real-estate-with-the-blockchain-a9a90afd7d3d">real estate</a>, and <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> will be there to help make that&nbsp;happen.</p><p>My presentation to the London Blockchain Summit that gives some more context to all&nbsp;this:</p><p>…and the transcript</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/at-the-turning-point-how-crypto-interacts-with-real-world-assets-b4bf3c4b217c">At the Turning Point — How Crypto Interacts with Real World Assets</a></p><p>To contact Mattereum<a href="https://mattereum.com/contact-us/"> https://mattereum.com/contact-us/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/crypto-and-theories-of-value-b505d560c7f2">CRYPTO AND THEORIES OF VALUE</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The tension between interoperability and innovation holds IDtech products hostage. Here’s my take on what to do about&nbsp;it.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/es/@sgoodgame?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Sam Goodgame</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/boulders?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>New technologies need to provide unique value to be adopted. Web5, which I use as shorthand for verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers, and personal data stores, offers “an extra decentralized web platform.” Unfortunately, simply being more decentralized or “self-sovereign” doesn’t generally lead to unique value being realized by end-users. The real end-goal of web5 is a universally-accepted and useful digital ID–a goal only achievable through interoperability. Thus, the unique value of web5 is interoperability, or more precisely, the extreme convenience and high trust interoperability delivers to identity products.</p><p>But herein lies a “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catch-22">Catch-22</a>”: developers won’t adopt new technology unless it adds unique value, but interoperability requires widespread adoption to pay dividends. It’s the classic network effect, or chicken-and-egg, problem. I call it the Catch-22 of Adoption.</p><p>But there is another, highly-related, highly-pernicious, and less-obvious Catch-22 keeping web5 from breaking out and realizing its true potential. I call it the Catch-22 of Interoperability.</p> The Catch-22 of Interoperability <p>The Catch-22 of Interoperability is simple: A direct conflict exists between interoperability and innovation–but both are mandatory for web5 to become a breakaway success and achieve its vision of a self-sovereign future.</p><p>Let’s first clarify: by innovation, I’m referring to a particular technology’s search for “product/market fit” which involves iterating until it solves a unique problem well. By interoperability, I’m referring to the near-universal acceptance of websites, regardless of browser; email, regardless of which client sent it; bluetooth, regardless of headphone manufacturer; or Visa cards, regardless of merchant. (Juxtapose these examples with the silos and inconveniences resulting from the lack of messaging interoperability–a fate nobody wants identity to conclude with–where iMessage can’t communicate with What’sApp or Signal or Line or Telegram or dozens of&nbsp;others.)</p><p>To understand why a conflict exists between interoperability and innovation, it’s helpful to understand that the core tenants of web5 (verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers, and personal data stores) each have numerous incompatible variants competing* for adoption:</p>  verifiable credentials: AnonCreds, W3C VCs, SD-JWT, ACDC, ISO 18013–5,&nbsp;etc.  decentralized identifiers: 100+ DID methods, KERI/ADIs, DNS/x.509-based, etc.  personal data stores: ID wallets, DWNs, Solid Pods, crypto wallet + decentralized storage,&nbsp;etc.  interaction protocols: DIDComm, CHAPI, OIDC4VC, WACI-PeX, CESR, DWN routing,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Theoretically, if the teams working on these divergent approaches agreed to converge on a single standard, we’d quickly reach a critical mass sufficient to realize the value of interoperability. I’ve seen people campaign for such an outcome — but prematurely standardizing is a dangerous prospect for a new technology. Standards move at a snail’s pace, and new technologies need to quickly evolve until a “product/market fit” is reached. Standardizing before adoption puts the cart before the&nbsp;horse.</p><p>On the other hand, unfettered innovation leads to divergence. The free market will adopt technologies based on their merits — and better technical innovations will lead to better products that lead to more adoption. For example, despite several existing options for using selective disclosure in verifiable credentials, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-01.html">SD-JWT</a> has been introduced as an alternative innovating on simplicity and ability to integrate with existing JWT-based authentication systems. But despite divergence being a healthy part of new technologies finding “product/market fit,” its downsides are obvious: confusion in the market, duplication of efforts, and delaying the benefits of interoperability.</p><p>Thus full interoperability leads to minimal innovation, and full innovation leads to no interoperability. So what is the solution? The solution is to strike a balance between these two&nbsp;demands.</p>Adoption will come from the intersection of these competing forces. The key is to strike a&nbsp;balance. Four Approaches to Balance Interoperability and Innovation <p>We’ve established that innovation and interoperability are both necessary, but in opposition to one another. So where does that leave us? As a relative newbie in the identity space (going on 5 years) I’ve seen 4 approaches taken to balance the trade-offs of innovation and interoperability. I don’t intend to make a value judgment on any of these–each approach has its pros and&nbsp;cons.</p>  The innovate-by-committee: In this model, interoperability is consistently maintained by suggesting new features &amp; improvements in a committee of other companies, likely in a working group, community group, or through an RFC process. While great for interoperability, it’s tragic for innovation. It’s infeasible to expect even the most brilliant people to be able to effectively build the “right” thing sitting in a boardroom. Does Feature A need to support Capability X? A Zoom-call debate with like-minded individuals is no match for customer evidence. The only way to truly innovate is to iterate, with real-world usage, which requires&nbsp;speed.  The fit-and-start: In this model, interoperability is achieved periodically while minimizing the need to slow innovation. Implementers race forward with innovation and contribute the things that are working well back into the community. Usually vendors need to support older (interoperable) versions and newer (more innovative) versions of their products, which is a costly trade-off of this model. Success with this model is challenging in practice — the interoperability devil is in the details which can confuse the&nbsp;market.  The interop-as-feature: This is where interoperability is viewed as a means to unlocking product value as opposed to an end in and of itself. In this model products are usually not interoperable until a specific reason arises, like a partnership or customer demand. Other times, products are built using interoperable standards because those standards unlock features out of the box — but not because of interoperability itself.  The “de-facto” maximalism: This approach cares only about innovation, believing that the best mousetrap will become the de-facto standard that the marketplace adopts regardless of most other factors. While great for innovation, there is a graveyard of failed identity companies who’ve attempted this strategy. Builders&nbsp;beware.   Web5 has a Bright and Interoperable Future <p>The Catch-22 of Interoperability is surely an obstacle to widespread adoption of web5 — but I believe it’s surmountable. I hope that by getting more specific and nuanced in our discussion of interoperability, we’ll better navigate the trade-offs and requirements we all&nbsp;face.</p><p>I have a short list of suggestions that I believe will help the community press forward on this complex&nbsp;topic.</p>  Above all, focus on building products people love. I can’t stress enough that the most elegant, interoperable technology on earth will be meaningless without end-user adoption. People adopt products, not technologies. Luckily, we’re seeing IDtech companies launch faster than ever before thanks to&nbsp;web5.  Brand loyalty for standards is silly. Different requirements matter for different use cases. Rational implementers should evaluate technical decisions based on business requirements. But instead, I consistently see people so intoxicated with JSON-LD or Aries or KERI or &lt;insert flavor of the month&gt; that their rhetoric borders on religious fervor. Force-fitting round pegs into square holes is no way to accomplish goal #1 of building great products.  Interop-shaming is short-sighted. I hope I’ve made it clear in this post that interoperability and innovation both matter. Teams delaying interoperability are simply making a different set of trade-offs compared to teams obsessively maintaining interoperability. The market will decide which approach is rewarded. Despite my cautioning builders to beware “de-facto” maximalism, we need a marketplace full of various approaches to maximize our odds of adoption.  Interoperability for demo’s sake can be a good use of time. Despite pockets of compatibility in some ecosystems, little-to-no real-world interoperability has been realized (let me know if I’ve missed something!). That said, demos of interoperability have driven more developers, interest, and investment into the space. Sometimes the best way to visualize the future is to see it in the form of working code — as long as it doesn’t detract too much from point #1 😊. I’m grateful for people at <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/11/14/toip-tech-arch-first-public-review/">ToIP</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-an-intent-to-form-the-openwallet-foundation">OWF</a>, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/blob/master/agenda.md">DIF</a>, <a href="https://aries-interop.info/">Hyperledger</a>, and other places for their efforts to prove and demo interoperability.  <p>As always, these thoughts and learnings continue to evolve. Please <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">tweet</a> at me if you think I’m wrong, or want to add to my points, or add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rileyparkerhughes/">LinkedIn</a> to follow our journey. As always, if you’re building an IDtech product and are curious about how interoperability fits into your roadmap, I’d love to workshop it with you — find me at Riley (at) <a href="http://trinsic.id/">trinsic.id</a>.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>* I’m aware that not all of these standards are necessarily in direct competition. It’d be possible to package a verifiable credential proof inside a mDL container, or serializing DIDComm messages using CESR, for example. But for all practical intents and purposes, these variants are each substitutes for one&nbsp;another.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/the-catch-22-of-interoperability-fea4dc5ef582">The Catch-22 of Interoperability</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic">Trinsic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>On November 7, 2022, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) released a new <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DoD_Zero_Trust_Strategy_v1.0_Final_508-date-cover_20221116.pdf">Zero Trust strategy</a>, clarifying the goals and timeline for modernizing the Department's defense strategy.</p>

<p>In the forward, the report says, "We all must play a role in combating our adversaries by acting quickly and correctly to address security threats wherever and whenever they arise." The report notes that the changes necessary to transform DoD IT resources from a "castle-and-moat" model to a Zero Trust model will require a coordinated, full-department effort. The forward continues, "If we do not do this together, our teammates' vulnerabilities will remain exposed and open to attack, which makes all of us less strong." This statement affirms that global information warfare is an increasing challenge for our service members, compromising mission safety and outcomes.</p>
	
	<blockquote><p>"We all must play a role in combating our adversaries by acting quickly and correctly to address security threats wherever and whenever they arise."</p>
		<p>– DoD Zero Trust Strategy, October 21, 2022</p></blockquote>

<p>The strategy promotes a fully implemented Zero Trust framework that "...will reduce the attack surface, reduce risk, offer opportunities to manage the full range of risks…and enable more effective data-sharing in partnership environments." This new strategy affects all users, Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) networks, and IT infrastructure in the DoD. The DoD has identified an aggressive schedule to get a fully functional framework implemented by the end of FY 2027. This is a monumental task considering the number of users and IT infrastructure that will be impacted, including the legacy systems that will likely need modernization.</p>

<p>Hastened by the need to support a remote workforce and an increase in international partnerships, the DoD is reevaluating its approach to securing intellectual property.</p>
	
<p>There is a department-wide initiative to migrate to cloud-supported software solutions (SaaS) that can meet DoD requirements. At the same time, the Department must support warfighters in low-bandwidth, Denied, Disrupted, Interrupted, and Limited (DDIL) mission scenarios, requiring some of the Zero Trust solutions to run on local infrastructure, which eliminates the effectiveness of SaaS solutions.</p>

<p>DoD Pillars of Zero Trust (source: <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DoD_Zero_Trust_Strategy_v1.0_Final_508-date-cover_20221116.pdf">DoD Zero Trust Strategy report</a>)</p>

<p>Software deployment flexibility is essential for the DoD to meet the unique requirements identified for the DoD Zero Trust Strategy. ForgeRock offers a flexible deployment model by offering feature parity between its deployment offerings: the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> SaaS solution, a fully <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.1/index.html">DevOps- enabled deployment</a>, and a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">traditional software deployment</a>. ForgeRock is currently working in many different mission areas within DoD, from running in the cloud to being deployed in DDIL environments. ForgeRock's deployment models allow our solutions to be deployed in environments from Impact Level (IL) 2 to IL 6.</p>

<p>ForgeRock is a fully featured identity and access management platform that will provide the DoD with deployment choices that meet the full array of use cases in the User pillar of the DoD Zero Trust Strategy. Also included in the platform is <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">user journey orchestration</a> that incorporates knowledge of the users' Devices – looking for signs that the device is registered to the user and checking if a device is jailbroken/rooted. The platform is infused with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>-powered Visibility and Analytics to monitor login requests in real-time, block malicious attempts, and require step-up authentication when anomalous behaviors are detected.</p>

<p>ForgeRock follows emerging and evolving identity standards closely to quickly implement the software changes required to meet their specifications. Our focus is on allowing our customers to have the latest Zero Trust identity features, including those that cover authorization, authentication, lifecycle management, and governance.</p>

<p></p> Building Trust With Verifiable, Fraud-Proof Data <p>From the beginning, Dock’s mission has been to enhance trust by empowering organizations and individuals with verifiable, fraud-proof data.</p><p>This past year, people and organizations around the world have experienced a variety of growing problems:</p>  Our lives are more and more reliant on digital data. But data is increasingly easier to manipulate, change, and corrupt in many industries including supply chain, healthcare, and education, which leads to a loss of trust.  Individuals have less privacy and security as user data is often controlled, misused, and shared by organizations without their knowledge.  Certificate fraud is also a growing global problem and fake diplomas alone are a billion-dollar industry.  <p>These global issues demonstrate the urgent and growing need for Verifiable Credential and decentralized identity technology solutions to bring back trust, transparency, privacy, and security of data across industries.</p><p>To address these issues, during this past year, we’ve developed more partnerships with organizations using our technology, grew our community, added more functionality to our products, and made significant upgrades to the network.

Dock Certs can be used in two ways: one is our no-code, user-friendly platform and the second is the <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#the-dock-certs-api">API for developers</a>.  <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet</a>: Store Verifiable Credentials and control DIDs.   New Partnerships <p>Dock is a B2B company and we’re collaborating with organizations that are using Dock’s solutions to turn their data into Verifiable Credentials to provide privacy, security, and a lifelong record of achievements for their stakeholders. Some of the key partnerships Dock has developed this year include: </p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.dock.io/use-case-burst-iq">BurstIQ Makes Health Data Verifiable, Secure, and Portable With Dock</a></p><p>BurstIQ is a company that provides data solutions powered by blockchain for the healthcare industry. They needed the ability to export data from their system and ensure its security, portability, and integrity so that it can’t be manipulated. That’s why they implemented Dock’s technology in order to turn any health data into a Verifiable Credential. This enables their customers (organizations and individuals) to respect users’ data privacy and data ownership rights. &nbsp;</p><p>“We’ve looked at a lot of the systems that allow you to issue DIDs and VCs and generally what we’ve found is that Dock is far easier to use than many of the existing tools out there. It can deploy very quickly and it will be very easy for our developers to use the tool,” said Amber Hartley, Chief Strategy Officer, BurstIQ.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://blog.dock.io/sevenmile-press-release/">SEVENmile Issues Fraud-Proof Verifiable Certificates to Students</a></p><p>SEVENmile’s entrepreneurial training program in Australia connects high school students with business owners to teach them problem-solving techniques. Paper certificates have less real-world value because they are easy to fake and hard to verify for authenticity. SEVENmile is using Dock Certs to efficiently issue digital fraud-proof graduation certificates which allows students to prove their skills throughout their lives and create immediate trust with employers. </p><p>“At SEVENmile Ltd., we believe that the move to ownership of our personal data is a vital platform that will help transform how the internet functions and how our data will be protected. We’re applying this philosophy by working with Dock Labs to secure the credentials of students we train,” said Greg Twemlow, SEVENmile’s CEO.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-web3-id-now-available-on-auth0-marketplace/">Web3 ID launched on the Auth0 Marketplace</a></p><p>Dock partnered with Auth0 to launch the Web3 ID integration on the Auth0 Marketplace, an exciting step forward for developers easily leverage Dock's decentralized identity technology to enable privacy and security for their users.</p><p>“It has been really exciting to work with Dock on a newly-built partner integration for Auth0 Marketplace. This best-in-class solution adds an integral layer to our platform that provides our customers with greater choice and flexibility,” said Cassio Sampaio, SVP of product at Auth0, a product unit within Okta. “After speaking with many customers, we have identified the types of integrations that matter to them, and we are so thrilled to have Dock’s Web3 ID as a vetted and valuable vendor in Auth0 Marketplace.”</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.dock.io/gravity-case-study">Gravity Eliminates Health &amp; Safety Certificate Fraud With Dock</a><br>Gravity Training is a leading training provider of commercial work-at-height solutions in South Africa. Fake Health &amp; Safety certificates are a growing problem for hiring companies in the country as many people photoshop certifications. That’s why Gravity is using Dock’s certification platform to issue fraud-proof, high-security digital certificates and prevent fraud.</p> Key Technology Milestones <p>We are fortunate to have some of the most <a href="https://www.dock.io/verifiable-credentials-company">experienced and specialized developers</a> in the decentralized digital identity space on our team. We’ve added more features to the Dock Wallet, Certs API, and the network to enable more functionality, security, and privacy for users. </p><p>In order to further strengthen privacy features with anonymous credentials, Dock uses BBS+ signatures. Unlike traditional cryptographic signatures where you must show all of your credential attributes, BBS+ signatures can be used to reveal and prove certain attributes in a credential.</p><p>Here are our key achievements for 2022:</p><p>1) <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs Launch</a> </p><p>Dock Certs was built as a result of repeated requests from organizations with little to no technical resources to have a user-friendly, no-code solution to issue Verifiable Credentials. Our bulk issuance feature allows users to efficiently issue multiple credentials to recipients (e.g. 300 graduates) at the same time by simply importing a spreadsheet. Later in the year, we also <a href="https://blog.dock.io/certificate-designer/">launched our Certificate Designer</a> feature in Dock Certs to allow users to customize the design of their credentials. </p><p>2) <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-wallet-did-management/">Verifiable Credentials and DID Management from the Dock Wallet</a></p><p>Our wallet upgrades enable people to:</p>  Create, export, edit, delete, import, copy, and share their DIDs  Securely store Verifiable Credentials and take them wherever they go   <p>The importance of using a non-custodial wallet</p><p>As a non-custodial wallet, the Dock Wallet enables users to have full ownership and control over their keys (acts like a password to access all of their accounts and information). It’s risky to have data on custodial platforms like centralized wallets. </p><p>Custodial basically means another party holds your private keys and that they have full control over your account. Because of this, they could make transactions on your behalf. As much as possible, it’s best not to use custodial wallets to protect your digital assets.</p><p>3) Anonymous Credential Support for the Dock Wallet</p><p>The Dock Wallet provides the option for anonymous credentials where people can prove something about themselves without revealing the actual information. For example, with anonymous credentials, someone could prove that they are at least 18 years old without revealing their date of birth to enter a gambling site. &nbsp;</p><p>4) <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Web3 ID Launch </a></p><p>Web3 ID is a blockchain-based sign-in system that allows organizations to request private data from users directly from their ID wallet apps in a way that preserves their privacy. By using Web3 ID, organizations prevent user tracking and don’t have to store user data. </p><p>Web3 ID is also available on the Auth0 Marketplace, a platform that offers thousands of customers around the world integration for identity solutions.</p><p>“It has been really exciting to work with Dock on a newly-built partner integration for Auth0 Marketplace. This best-in-class solution adds an integral layer to our platform that provides our customers with greater choice and flexibility,” said Cassio Sampaio, SVP of product at Auth0, a product unit within Okta. </p><p>Web3 ID was also voted the #1 Web3 Product of the Week on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/web3-id">Product Hunt</a>, an important site where tech startups announce new product launches. This has given Dock more visibility as the site gets almost 5 million monthly visits. </p><p>5) White-Labeled Wallet</p><p>Organizations that want to offer their customers an ID Wallet with their own brand can use our white label solution. This way, they can provide a wallet with the same functionalities of the Dock Wallet without spending time, money, and other resources building it themselves. </p><p>6) <a href="https://docs.dock.io/help-center/help-center/wallets-and-account-creation#ledger-nano-s-hardware-wallet">Ledger integration</a><br>People can securely store their Dock tokens on the Ledger Nano S hard wallet.</p> Growth and Adoption <p>A big focus for Dock this year was adoption. What’s the point of all the long days and late-night refinements if no one is using what we build? We want to see as many organizations and individuals in control of their data as possible. </p><p>While decentralized identity is still in its infancy, we’re certainly seeing that growth taking place with the number of partners we have, inquiries we receive, and people trialing our main product, Dock Certs. </p><p>Some numbers for context:</p>  From February to June, we saw over 1,100 sign ups and almost 200 organizations trialing either our no-code solution or using our API  From July to November, we saw over 1,500 sign ups and almost 500 trials. So not only are we seeing more volume, we’re seeing a 250% growth in trials during the past 5 months!  <p>We’re also seeing more of these trials convert into paying customers and we’ve published a few of these through our social channels with more to follow in the near future. </p>  Our community of Dockers continues to grow. Here are the new followers and members we gained this year.   Dock is building for the long term, not for short-term price spikes <p>While the collapse of Luna, Celsius, and FTX have had negative impacts on the entire cryptocurrency market, remember that Dock is committed to building solutions that solve current and future problems to provide more security, privacy, and efficiencies for organizations and individuals. Rather than engaging in activities for the sake of short-term price increases, we are much more focused on consistently engaging with users and getting market feedback to create long term value that will consequently increase the value of the Dock token.</p> What’s Coming Up in 2023? <p>Looking forward to 2023, Dock is well-positioned to get through these turbulent times, continuously upgrading our technology, and growing adoption. Next year we will largely focus on developing more partnerships to increase adoption and complete the decentralized identity lifecycle by enabling users to verify and present credentials with the Dock Wallet.</p> Growth and adoption  <p>Our main strategies to accomplish this goal include:</p>  More &nbsp;marketplace integrations (first up; Rapid API)  Hired a Sales Manager  Producing more valuable online content that educates people about the problems we solve and this has consistently resulted in many of them reaching out to us first  Outbound marketing and more outreach campaigns    Complete the basic workflow for the decentralized identity lifecycle <p>Right now with our products, users can manage DIDs and Verifiable Credentials. Very soon, people will be able to present their credentials to verifiers like companies, websites, or government departments that need to check their authenticity. In 2023, our technology will enable these functionalities for people and organizations.</p> Follow our progress in 2023  <p>Check our <a href="https://www.dock.io/roadmap">roadmap</a> and <a href="https://blog.dock.io/">blog</a> anytime to see our latest news and technology developments. Next year, we’ll be attending more events like the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop in April 2023</a> to connect with more people in the space. We will keep you posted and hope to meet some of you if you’re attending as well. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has followed and supported us this past year! We’re looking forward to providing solutions for more organizations and people in 2023.</p><p>If you have any questions or feedback about our project, reach out to us anytime.</p> About Dock <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently, securely, and at a lower cost.

On the one hand, true believers have insisted that free markets are a cure for all economic diseases, while sceptics have insisted they are not. The two sides have been clashing over this question for decades. Yet strangely, neither side has ever stopped to ask another, related, question: “what are the costs of operating in a&nbsp;market?”</p><p>Markets may (or may not be) an almost magical guarantee of economic efficiency. But how efficient are markets themselves? Do they always operate as efficiently as they&nbsp;could?</p><p>The answer may surprise you. The way markets work in today’s world is extremely inefficient. They cost a huge amount to run. Indeed, sometimes their costs of operation are so cripplingly high that they don’t operate at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The reasons for these immense inefficiencies take us back to the core drivers of data’s value — <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-personal-data-economically-valuable-927e8c7cd51">reliability and surprise</a>. Or in this case, the lack of reliable, surprising data, which means the system has to operate using guesswork instead.</p> Inefficiency in&nbsp;markets <p>Take a typical seller. To sell their product efficiently and effectively they have to know exactly what buyers want to buy, who wants to buy it, and how to reach and engage them. The other side of the coin is the typical buyer. To access what they want or need they need to know what’s available out there, where to get it from, and&nbsp;how.</p><p>But in modern markets, nobody has reliable information on these things, and the result is layer upon layer of extra cost. Guesswork creates risk and waste — investing money, time and effort doing things that don’t&nbsp;work.</p><p>Because sellers don’t know who may be interested in buying their products, and because buyers may not be aware of these products, sellers often invest huge sums in advertising. But traditional broadcast advertising (e.g. TV, print, etc) is hugely wasteful. Advertisers spend £$€billions advertising to people who are not interested in what they are selling and who will never&nbsp;buy.</p><p>In recent years, to reduce these eye-watering levels of waste, marketers have fallen in love with ‘targeting’ — trying to gather ever more information about who might want to buy their stuff. But, it turns out, efficient targeting is very complex and difficult, depending on a huge range of things such as personal preferences and current context, mood, mode and priorities. Stuff that the advertiser doesn’t&nbsp;know.</p><p>So what do advertisers seek to do? The obvious way, which is to gather ever more information. The result? Advertising platforms like Facebook and Google that have become huge ‘surveillance capitalism’ engines that seek to know everything there is to know about people, at massive cost, with toxic levels of privacy invasion&nbsp;… while still failing miserably.</p><p>Buyers, meanwhile, are faced with a constant tidal wave of messaging, most of which is irrelevant, and most of which people don’t trust anyway. Sellers waste huge amounts of time, money and effort generating a tidal wave of noise, and buyers waste equally huge amounts of time, money and effort trying to navigate their way through this&nbsp;noise.</p><p>By the way, this applies just as much to public services, charities and other non-profit service providers as it does to the private sector. For example: If a local council wants to offer free childcare to families wrestling with poverty, they have to identify who is in need and how best to reach them and engage them. Meanwhile, families wrestling with poverty may not know what help is available, where to get it or&nbsp;how.</p><p>The entire system, then, is awash with waste: waste created by people making the wrong guesses; investing additional time, money and effort in trying to find a way to improve their guesses; in making mistakes anyway and in failing to reach their objective. Or (very often) not even trying, given the spectacular levels of cost and waste involved.</p> This is not a trivial&nbsp;problem! <p>You might think that in the context of everything else that’s going on in the economy, these costs are still relatively small. Well, think&nbsp;again.</p><p>Advertising itself accounts for less than 2% of modern economies. But the McKinsey Institute has estimated that 50% of all economic activity now revolves around ‘interaction costs’, defined as “the searching, coordinating and monitoring that people and firms do when they exchange goods, services or ideas” (an estimate that excludes the costs of ‘non-interactive’ information processing). Similarly, economists John Wallis and Douglass North estimate that 45% of all US economic activity is now absorbed by ‘transaction costs’, defined similarly to McKinsey’s interaction costs.</p><p>In other words we’re talking about a situation where a half of all economic activities are NOT devoted to actually producing value. Instead, they are devoted to finding ways to realise the value that has been produced. This is an astonishingly high burden that’s without precedent.</p><p>A hundred years ago, 75% of all economic costs were devoted to ‘making’ with just 25% devoted to matching and connecting. Then, thanks to a productivity revolution in making (such as the breakthroughs made possible by mass production moving assembly lines) processes for ‘making’ became much more efficient while processes for matching and connecting lagged behind, becoming ever more complex. That’s why, today, the relative costs of ‘making’ versus ‘matching and connecting’ have shifted to today’s 50/50&nbsp;split.</p> A simple&nbsp;solution <p>Just imagine the economic benefits that would flow if we could take the balance between ‘making’ and ‘matching and connecting’ back to the 75/25 ratio that it once&nbsp;was!</p><p>All of this waste — and all the opportunities that are missed because of the excessive costs and barriers generated by how the system works — all boil down to one thing: poor data logistics. The inability to get the right information to and from the right people at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>Over the past decade, the big digital platforms, including Facebook and Google in marketing and advertising, Amazon, Uber, AirBnb and elsewhere, looked like they might be able to help. All of them grew rich and powerful thanks to their ability to reduce buyers’ and sellers’ matching and connecting costs. But over the years their promise has faded so that they are now just as much a part of the problem as the solution: a new source of cost and complexity and a new barrier to competition made worse by the multiple toxic unethical practices of surveillance capitalism.</p><p>The strange thing is that empowering individuals with their own data via their own personal stores can break the logjam. How? By helping to get the data logistics right.</p><p>Here is how it’s done — in a safe, ethical and efficient way. The personal data store operator enables individuals to publish anonymised profiles of themselves so that service providers can search these profiles for the characteristics of the people that best fit what they have to offer. They could even publish their needs and requirements this&nbsp;way.</p><p>Services can use the platform to reach out to these individuals, who at this stage remain anonymous, so their data and identity is protected. Individuals only respond if they want to, and if they don’t the service gathers zero data about them. The individual can create specific profiles for specific aspects of their life, further protecting their privacy and ensuring tight focus on their needs and interests.</p><p>Meanwhile, individuals don’t have to go searching. The right offers come to them, and they only respond when they want to, only sharing data and engaging when they want, under their&nbsp;control.</p><p>Both sides send and receive the right, reliable new information as and when it is needed — and all the layers of waste generated by a system founded on guesswork begin to fade away. It’s a truly seismic shift which Mydex CIC is helping to deliver right now with a pioneering new service in Scotland.</p><p>This service is helping the Scottish Government to reach out to people it wants to involve in the co-design of the services they use. As an application of the principle it is highly specific. But the capabilities Mydex has developed have almost universal applicability — tackling a root cause of immense waste across all go-to-market activities.</p> Conclusion <p>This blog series has now identified three, huge productivity and quality breakthroughs made possible by personal information empowerment: <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">inside the day-to-day operations of every activity</a> that uses personal data to provide services to individuals; <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">filling the gaps between these activities</a> to enable properly ‘joined up’ services, and now, transforming processes for ‘matching and connecting’.</p><p>These three breakthroughs — each one transforming a vast swathe of economic activities that affect every citizen and every citizen-serving service — lie at the heart of the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">surprising economics of personal data</a>. Yet in another sense, they are only the beginning. Indeed, there are ways in which what we have described so far only touches the surface. Next step: seeing the ‘dark matter’ that current ways of doing economics simply do not&nbsp;reach.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

 Spherity will build Supply Chain Provenance in EBSI TRACE4EU project together with world-leading partners  Spherity will lead work package on Products &amp; Materials Traceability TRACE4EU consortium partner countries<p><a href="http://www.spherity.com">Spherity</a>, is part of the consortium that won the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home">EBSI</a> project: Traceability Reference Architecture Conformant EBSI for the European Union (TRACE4EU). The project which is funded by the European Union aims to build a common technical ground for the traceability of documents and physical goods using the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI). Within this project, Spherity will lead the work package on Products &amp; Materials Traceability that deals with Seafood, Agrifood, Halloumi, and Battery Traceability. The Products &amp; Materials Traceability addresses the tracking requirements of physical products. This process includes the physical (pre-) products and materials that will be shipped and further processed in factories or manufacturing plants as well as the arrival of products to consumers. TRACE4EU is led by Slovenia with the participation of more than 50 organizations and companies from 15 EU countries with the aim to design and implement holistic solutions for trustworthy products and data traceability. The general objective of this project is to create an “umbrella architecture” based on existing EBSI services. The architecture builds the basis for the implementation of traceability application scenarios.</p><p>TRACE4EU promotes recommendations for developing the EBSI ecosystem through engagement with pan-European stakeholders and has the potential to significantly influence traditional industries, assisting them in becoming more efficient, productive, competitive, and resilient. Upcoming traceability implementations will also improve transparency in the European area for citizens, who will be able to track commodities and documents more effectively and proactively.</p><p>Our objectives for work package 4&nbsp;are:</p>  Testing interoperability by applying the EBSI-umbrella architecture in various EU use&nbsp;cases  Demonstrating the technological interoperability of the developed umbrella architecture between the Product &amp; Materials Traceability pillar and the Document/Data Traceability pillar  Incentives for European public authorities, research institutions, universities, and private sector actors to use&nbsp;EBSI  Showcase best practices definition for the transfer of the EBSI-based umbrella architecture to other EU countries  Defining the cooperation methods with other use case-related and EBSI-related projects, may it be past or future&nbsp;projects  <p>“Spherity is very proud to lead the work package on ‘Products and Materials traceability‘. Our biggest aim is to build an ecosystem with a common technical basis and low barriers for participants to achieve a large industry adoption.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sguth/">Dr. Susanne Guth-Orlowski</a>, Chief Innovation &amp; Solutions Officer of Spherity.</p><p>“With the emergence of digital verifiable credentials, much more impactful compliance technology is possible and digital certificates are starting to be at the core of the policy life cycle from policy endorsement to ecosystem-wide enforcement at scale. Material traceability will be a critical success factor for sustainability-related regulation. This is why the TRACE4EU ecosystem can bring policy enforcement to the next level.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-carsten-st%C3%B6cker-1145871/">Dr. Carsten Stöcker</a>, CEO of Spherity.</p><p>To participate in the ecosystem, actors in the supply chain need to apply for an identity credential from a trusted identity provider such as the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en">Global Legal Entity Identity Foundation (GLEIF)</a>. Identity credentials are stored in the company wallet as verifiable credentials. Audits determine whether various supply chain actors are in compliance. As auditors, they issue certificates as proof of compliance with a regulation or as proof of origin for the end customer. Depending on the product category, these certifications must be preserved for a specific period of&nbsp;time.</p><p>About Spherity</p><p><a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a> is a German decentralized digital identity software provider that brings secure identities to enterprises, machines, products, data, and even algorithms.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p><a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/case-studies/emdt">Energy and Mines Digital Trust (EMDT)</a> was established by the Government of British Columbia (B.C.) to incentivize the formation of a digital trust ecosystem that will result in accuracies and efficiencies when sharing sustainability data, with downstream impacts of contributing towards a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p>Reporting environmental impact data can be a complicated and laborious process. Data is difficult to exchange internationally, and consumers cannot always access, or trust, reported data.</p>
<p>A digital trust ecosystem builds confidence between organizations, businesses, and individuals when interacting online. When information is shared using digital credentials, everyone can trust that the information is current and hasn’t been tampered with, even without pre-existing business relationships. For natural resource companies, this means it is possible to easily share trustworthy data to prove their sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Nancy Norris and Kyle Robinson, we discuss,</p>
 
 What’s happening in climate change legislation globally? 
 What are the sustainability reporting requirements that the mining industry faces today? 
 Where do digital trust and digital identity fit into sustainability reporting? 
 How do you start a digital trust ecosystem? 
 How do you select initial use cases to focus on? 
 What is the role of the government in growing a digital trust ecosystem based on policy? 
 How did EMDT build their digital trust governance frameworks? 
 Why did EMDT publish their governance frameworks to open source repositories? 
 The best ways to educate both technical and non-technical stakeholders about digital credentials and digital trust. 
 Can digital trust technologies alter/influence change in regulatory reporting processes? 
 Can governments who participate in digital trust ecosystems find new ways of creating value/new business models/enhancing standard service offerings?

             December 2022   
	 
		 
			 Towards 2023: the tokenization race is on&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the year comes to an end, we want to take a moment to thank you for being part of our journey. From our family to yours, we wish you a happy and safe holiday season!</p>
<p>2022 has been a great year for our industry, with the tokenization movement on the rise. This month, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated that “the next generation of markets and securities will be tokenization of securities.” Moreover, this sentiment is being echoed by a number of institutions such as State Street and J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>A further indication of this trend is the rapid growing demand from institutional investors for tokenized securities. BNY Mellon’s latest survey reveals that 97% of institutional investors agree that tokenization will revolutionize asset management, with 70% expressing their willingness to pay extra for increased liquidity and faster asset turnover. There is no doubt that financial institutions (FIs) have to place a high priority on tokenizing assets in 2023 in order to meet the demands of investors.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>For years, the main FIs already experimented tokenization on private blockchains. Public blockchains were not seen as mature enough. Now, the majority of innovative FIs are launching tokenization projects on public blockchains, proving that the future of finance will be built on permissionless infrastructures as it meets the needs of security, accessibility, and interoperability. Time to market, costs, and scalability are becoming key decision factors.</p>
<p>If the blockchain network used is not permissioned, the&nbsp;smart contracts must bring control and compliance&nbsp;at token-level through identities, allowing for corporate actions and access to liquidity. While smart contract standards are usually open-source and free (e.g. ERC3643), it would take years for FIs to build a complete tokenization platform managing business workflows, data and smart contracts interactions. This would leave competitors who act quicker to seize market shares as the market is surely transitioning toward this new infrastructure.</p>
<p>A viable option for success is to use&nbsp;no-code/low-code enterprise-grade tokenization platforms&nbsp;that are already proven and interoperable with the ecosystem. Thus allowing you to focus on the core business as well as adjust your business models to better position your corporation in the era of tokenization.</p>
<p>The race is on, and we wish you a successful tokenization year!</p>

 EWC has been selected by the European Commission to participate in EU Digital Identity Wallet Large-Scale Pilots <p>Dortmund, December&nbsp;2022.</p>EWC Country&nbsp;Coverage<p><a href="http://www.spherity.com">Spherity</a> — part of the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EUDI Wallet Consortium (EWC)</a> — is proud to announce that we have been selected by the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/index_en">European Commission</a> to participate in the large-scale pilots to ensure interoperability and adoption of the European Digital Identity Wallet. We will participate in the EUDI Wallet Consortium (EWC) running one of the Large Scale Pilots (LSPs) for the Wallet ecosystem.</p><p>Our pilot is focused on the use of the EU Digital Identity Wallet in the context of travel — such as providing passenger information, buying goods and services, and trusted business-to-business interactions. The pilot will focus on situations that are central to people’s online lives and identify barriers and enablers to the adoption and scaling of the EUDI wallet. Furthermore, by including payments and organizational digital identity (“ODI”), the EWC ensures that the pilot evaluates scenarios that are relevant to citizens, businesses, and governments such as secure e-commerce and business-to-business transactions.</p><p>With over 60 participants, from both the private and public sectors, EWC represents almost every country in the EU and EFTA plus Ukraine and is able to provide pan-European services and further the digital inner single market and beyond. EWC is led by Swedish and Finnish government authorities and supported by relevant industry experts from the travel and payment industry as well as a large number of technology partners with experience in digital identity, trust services, wallet applications, and integration of these technologies into online services.</p><p>EWC will be piloting usage scenarios alongside complete travel journeys from booking flights, hotels, etc. to CheckIns, shopping, and payment all across Europe. The pilot scenarios require the collaboration of a multitude of European partners such as Wallet Providers, Qualified Attestation and other trust services, Personal Identification Data (PID)-/ Organisational Digital Identity (ODI)-Providers, relying on parties such as travel agencies, airlines, ferry operators, as well as international payment providers. The pilot scenarios will be evaluated and tested by a large number of end-users across Europe to optimize the user experience and identify barriers and enablers to the adoption and scaling of the EU Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>The EUDI Wallet is part of the proposed eIDAS2 regulation [1], which will provide all European citizens access to a trusted digital identity provided by their government and accepted in all EU Member States and EFTA. The EUDI Wallet will be able to contain additional information, such as a mobile driving license, educational certificates, and more, which can be shared with full control of the user. The EUDI Wallet will be used for both government services and private sector, payments as well as other trust services like electronic signing. This means that for a wallet to function, it will need to operate within an eco-system of supporting organizations, issuing attributes, and facilitating sharing of credentials. In the end, the EUDI Wallet will ensure trustworthy digital transactions such as identification, sharing attributes, authentication, as well as signing, preservation, and archiving.</p><p>The European Commission set up a program to develop the EUDI Wallet ecosystem through Large Scale Projects Pilots (LSPs). These LSPs will be run by international consortia representing a broad variety of organizations that will set up services in various roles, such as wallet issuers, attribute issuers, trust services, and service providers from many different European Member States. The experiences gained through the LSPs will be shared with the EU member states and the European Commission implementation to create a sustainable ecosystem meeting the needs of European citizens.</p><p>EWC will start running its pilot early next year.

   Among the many approaches to do that, Zero Trust is one where organizations apply the principle of “never trust – always verify”. Since Zero Trust is not a single product or solution, implementing processes that work accordingly can be a challenge to IT teams that want to keep their privileged accounts safe. Modern Privileged Access Management (PAM) platforms can help with these challenges.

  <p>Among the many approaches to do that, Zero Trust is one where organizations apply the principle of “never trust – always verify”. Since Zero Trust is not a single product or solution, implementing processes that work accordingly can be a challenge to IT teams that want to keep their privileged accounts safe. Modern Privileged Access Management (PAM) platforms can help with these challenges.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole will look at why standing privileges are a risk to modern multi-cloud and hybrid architectures and how Zero Trust can help in reducing standing privileges. Moreover, he will explain why advanced PAM platforms can assist with establishing a Zero Trust posture and how to move PAM to decentralized operations.</p>
<p>Joe Burke, Chief Architect, PAM, in the Symantec Identity Security Group, proposes organizations should rethink how to implement Zero Trust security for secrets, privileges, and privileged accounts. He will elaborate on factors that IT decision-makers should look for in Zero Trust-enabling PAM solutions. Among these are the time to implement, low operational overhead, scalability and performance, ecosystem integrability, as well as coarse and fine-grained authorization enforcement.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/implementing-zero-trust-with-pam"></a>

<p>Today we released Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0, which is the first in a series of release candidates leading up to Holochain’s first beta release this coming January. With this release candidate, the Holochain conductor and SDKs are now feature complete for building applications. All devs with Holochain apps can now update their code to the Beta Release Candidate. </p><p>In preparation for Holochain Beta, we’ve been subjecting the codebase to a security audit by Least Authority, the favored security firm of many decentralized projects. Because cryptography is core to all modern decentralized tech projects, Holochain’s cryptographic key store — the program that stores agent keys and other secrets — was audited first. The result: the code auditors identified only one issue, which we corrected. While an audit isn’t a guarantee, there were no further vulnerabilities identified. This means that there are currently no known vulnerabilities or attack vectors for leaking users’ cryptographic secrets. You can <a href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-holochain-lair-keystore/">read more about the keystore audit</a> on Least Authority’s website, and we’ll be sharing each future audit report as it is completed.</p><p>If you're a dev who's new to Holochain, as soon as our scaffolding tool is updated to 0.1.0-beta-rc.0, you will be able to install and build your first app. For devs eager to deliver apps to their end users, hold tight — the Holochain Launcher and DevHub updates are still being finalized and will be released in the next few days.</p><p>Holochain is a full software stack for building scalable and efficient Web3 apps of every kind. You could build a currency, NFT, or DeFi platform with Holochain, but this framework is meant for even more. It’s capable of handling the storage and performance demands of the many practical things we want to do with each other online, most of which we’re familiar with from Web2, but with some new capabilities that don’t necessitate large centralized institutions for basic viability.</p> Some of the Dapps possible with Holochain Beta-RC <p>Here are some of the applications we think Holochain will help bring to life in decentralized form:</p>  Social networks  Chat  Groupware  Knowledge sharing  Real-time collaboration  Project management  Governance and decision-making  Marketplaces  Accounting  Community currencies  Digital rights management of creative works  Supply chain accounting  Renewable energy markets  Adaptive IoT networks and other edge computing applications  <p>As of this Beta Release Candidate, we consider Holochain’s current feature set to be sufficient for building these kinds of apps and more. In the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">near future</a>, additional features will further augment the developer experience, along with components and tools that make it easier and faster to develop complex Holochain applications (hApps). <br><br>The feature set highlights include:</p>  A conductor runtime that hosts user application microservices in a WebAssembly virtual machine and interfaces with UIs  A distributed state and integrity engine consisting of individual source chains that add data to a graph database stored and validated by random peers in a DHT  The networking protocol for maintaining the DHT and sending messages  Countersigning for transactions between users, including additional witnesses for ‘lightweight consensus’  A user-friendly application launcher  A set of SDKs for building microservices that produce, read, and validate user data and send messages between nodes  A testing framework with a multi-machine test orchestrator  A development environment with the tools needed to create, test, and package hApps  Libraries for creating JavaScript and Rust clients  For additional details see our our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/#basic-features-of-holochain-alpha">Beta-RC announcement</a>   The user experience of Web2 meets the freedom of Web3 <p>Holochain occupies a unique place in internet tech. It’s capable of providing fast, zero-cost data storage, processing, and messaging that auto-scales with the size of the user base, without using a centralized server. That means it can deliver on the promises of user empowerment that Web3 makes including.</p>  High throughput: Holochain surpasses the inherent performance limits of universal consensus.  Zero cost: Because there’s no legion of validators to pay, Holochain application data incurs no transaction fees.  Nearly infinite scalability: Each user brings their own compute power and storage, connecting to a subset of peers and holding a subset of data. Additionally, users only store data for the applications they use. These two properties let application infrastructure scale linearly with user adoption.  Low resource consumption: Each participant in an application’s network stores only the data they produce along with a small portion of the shared database, so there is no need for often expensive mining algorithms.  Privacy: Because there’s no central cloud database or global ledger, developers can empower their users to preserve their privacy. Applications can also be run entirely in-house, keeping private records safe and reducing regulatory compliance burdens.  Failure tolerance: In contrast to cloud databases and blockchains, users can read and write data even when they’re isolated in a LAN or completely unconnected to the internet.  Ease of use: There are no crypto wallets or network tokens to deal with — not even login credentials. Applications run on the user’s machine, accessed by nothing but a strong password. (In the future, applications can also be accessed via the web via <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo hosting</a>.)  <p>Blockchain strives to replicate Web2’s safety promises in a transparent way through universal consensus on a single data set. This has important uses, especially for tracking the ownership of scarce resources such as property (e.g., NFTs and land titles) and global naming (e.g., usernames and domains). Holochain is best used in situations where universal consensus isn’t strictly necessary and where ‘lightweight consensus’ is perfectly sufficient. This opens up a tremendous new realm of possibilities for decentralized applications, as listed above.</p> Our request to developers: Update your hApp!  Community Devs <p>As soon as all the tooling is updated to 0.1.0-beta-rc we want your help finding every bug, every crack, every rough spot, every performance bottleneck before we cut an official 0.1.0-beta release in January. So we’re asking for you to run all of your automated tests for your hApp against the release candidates. If you haven’t got automated tests set up yet, download the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a> test framework and learn how to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/develop/README.md">write a test scenario</a>. Then report bugs on the relevant repo — <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues">holochain</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/issues">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/issues">Rust</a> client libraries, or possibly even <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/issues">Tryorama</a> itself.</p><p>If you want extra help writing tests, or want to discuss the nature of a bug, we have a <a href="https://discord.gg/HhhxQkNUsr">Discord server</a> you can join. Make sure you ask one of the moderators for the developer role. We'll see you there – happy testing!</p>

<p>Orbit Enterprise is a No Code Self Sovereign Identity platform that facilitates the storage, issuance, verification and revocation of verifiable credentials that are held and owned by end users in digital wallets.</p>
<p>We recently implemented the ability for holders to create credential requests to issuers they’re connected to. Credential issuance is not a one-way process where the issuer will always initiate it through a credential offer. There are many use cases in which the holder will have a need for a credential, and will need to contact a specific issuer to place a request.</p>
<p>We want to ensure that<a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise/"> Orbit Enterprise</a> provides the flexibility needed for any type of credential exchange use case that you may have. That is why we have also built in the opportunity for negotiations to happen between both parties. Both issuing and receiving parties can go back and forth as many times as they wish until they are satisfied with the data attribute values within a credential.</p>
<p>All this is accomplished by fully operationalizing the Aries credential issuance protocol.</p>
<p>In this example, we demonstrate how Concordia University uses Orbit Enterprise to request for a ‘business licence’ credential from the City of Montréal, and how both parties are able to negotiate the credential attribute values during the process.</p>

<p>Part IV: Deep Dive: Verifiable Credentials &lt;--&nbsp;You are here</p>
<p>Part V:&nbsp;Deep Dive: Decentralized Identifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 General Model – and what is a Holder? 
<p>To understand the world of verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations, you need to understand the ecosystem in which they are expected to be used.&nbsp; The VC Data Model v1.1 defines <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#ecosystem-overview">the roles different entities play in the data format</a>, as well as two processes: credential issuance and credential presentation.&nbsp; You are probably familiar with a concept of issuers or verifiers in the physical world, but the role of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holder</a> could be new to you.&nbsp; The specification defines a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holder</a> as an entity that can “possess a verifiable credential and generate verifiable presentations”.&nbsp; Another way to think about this is the place you store your credentials until you are ready to take them out and use them for a purpose.&nbsp; You might want to jump to the conclusion that a holder and a digital wallet are the same thing - a wallet can play the role of holder, but it has many other characteristics we will discuss some other time.&nbsp; Additionally, a wallet is usually a "user-present" technology, meaning that there is a human performing a ceremony as part of&nbsp;the credential interaction.&nbsp; While wallet interactions are the most talked-about use of VCs there are also machine-to-machine interactions that do not have a user experience at all.</p>
 Credential Issuance 
<p>I have <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/decentralized-identity-the-basics-of-decentralized-identity/ba-p/3071980">previously</a> called a verifiable credential (VC) a letter of introduction – a statement of relationship between an issuer and a subject. &nbsp;A verifiable credential uses cryptographic proofs to bind an issuer statement about a subject to the subject's identifier.&nbsp; The resulting document can contain claims relative to the subject and in some cases proofs of different kinds can be bundled together. &nbsp;Once issued, a verifiable credential can be held for potentially long periods of time and presented for multiple purposes and in multiple ways.</p>
<p>VCs in a wallet wrapped by a VP and sent to verifiers</p>
 Credential Presentation 
<p>In the verifiable credential world, presentation involves the generation of a VP – a verifiable presentation. A VP is generated by a holder - it is a document that wraps a verifiable credential with a new credential that is both fresh and which proves a relationship in the moment between the holder and the original VC subject. Most often the subject/holder relationship is direct - meaning that the entity presenting the credential can prove they are the same entity named in the credential.&nbsp; To check this relationship, the verifier checks that the VC subject is the same as the VP issuer, AND that the signature of the VP is valid.&nbsp;&nbsp;VCs in a wallet wrapped by a VP and sent to verifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this passing around of VC's and VP's is like a big game of hot potato, and different credentials may have different patterns of presentation frequency and breadth of presentation across many verifiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 A visual representation of overall VC/VP travel - VCs travel between Issuers and Holders, then VCs wrapped in VPs travel from holders to verifiers. 
 What is in a Verifiable Credential? 
<p>Now that you know how verifiable credentials move, we can look at what they contain.&nbsp; While the VC Data Model doesn't specify the protocols for travel of credential between actors in the flow, the actors must be part of the data model, because their associated public/private keypairs are used for cryptographic signing operations.&nbsp; At the highest and geekiest level, a verifiable credential bundles claims together into a container called a credential, and imposes standardized rules around how parties interacting with the VC can derive confidence in different characteristics of that bundle - for example the data model shows how to verify that the created credential was made by the entity claiming to be the credential issuer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Canonical Data Format vs. Encoded Representations 
<p>If you take all proofs and interpretation out of a verifiable credential, you have a base data format (the bundle I referenced earlier) that is simply referred to in the spec as “a credential”. &nbsp;This credential data format is referred to as the “canonical form” and the assumption is that you can always get from a given verifiable credential representation to a canonical credential data format and back again, using the encoding &amp; decoding rules laid out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#syntaxes">section 6 of the VC Data Model 1.1</a>. This is why the examples in the specification document have three tabs – one shows the canonical form, and the other two show each of the representations that can be used.&nbsp; While any number of representations could be additionally defined, there are two specified in the core data model:</p>
 
 JSON-encoded verifiable credentials (known as JWT-VCs) are encoded as signed JWTs (<a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=ee1c6e463f61bdcfJmltdHM9MTY2MTIxMzAwMSZpZ3VpZD01OTAzNTM5Mi1lODYyLTQ3ZWYtOTlhMy0yZmJkZDA3OGIwZmEmaW5zaWQ9NTE4MQ&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=ff840252-2276-11ed-a3e6-b5f0fabdaa0b&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmZjLWVkaXRvci5vcmcvcmZjL3JmYzc1MTk&amp;ntb=1">JSON Web Tokens</a>). 
 JSON-LD encoded verifiable credentials (known as LDP-VCs) can use different proof formats, but the most common are <a href="https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>. 
 
<p>Three boxes showing a credential (without verifiability) on top and two credentials (with viability) descending - a JSON encoded credential and a JSON-LD Encoded Credential</p>
<p>&nbsp;A simple way to think about the representations versus the canonical credentials is that the representations are what add the verifiability to a verifiable credential.&nbsp; A canonical credential is the bundle of claims that purports to be from an issuer and purports to be about a subject, and contains a set of additional claims, but anyone can tamper with the content of that bundle.&nbsp; When the canonical credential is encoded into a representation however, the representation dictates what kind of proof structure can be used to evaluate various properties of the credential, with tamper-proofness being a required check (this happens through checking a cryptographic signature).&nbsp; Other checks could potentially happen, for example validating a selective disclosure of information rather than an entire credential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of my examples in this blog article will be JSON-encoded, partly because this is what Microsoft has implemented (and therefore what I’m more experienced in) but also because many of you reading this blog are probably familiar with the JSON Web Tokens already, especially if you have worked with JWT-based implementations like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc">OpenID Connect IDtokens</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/federatedidentitycredentials-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0">Federated Identity Credentials</a>, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-certificate-credentials">JWT bearer client authentication tokens</a>.&nbsp; If you aren’t familiar with what a JSON Web Token is, check out <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-jwt-works-in-depth-604c93ec20a4">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A JWT-VC is (surprise surprise) a mashup of a JSON Web Token and a canonical VC.&nbsp; The JWT supplies verifiability through a cryptographic signature bound to a subject identifier that is labeled as iss (aka the issuer).&nbsp; JWTs have a very familiar structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A visual representation of a JSON-encoded Verifiable Credential - 3 sections - the header contains the alg, typ and kid claims.  The payload contains iss, nbf, exp, jti, sub claims and an object called vc, which contains a @context, type, and the credential subject object. That object contains various claims.  The last of the 3 major sections is the signature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A JWT-VC has three parts, and the payload contains what I would call envelope information: the data needed to know who the credential is is bound to, who made the credential, when it was made and how it can be identified.&nbsp; Additionally, there is a JSON object called “vc”. Claims information is embedded inside the vc object. &nbsp;A JWT-VC uses an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#proofs-signatures">external proof</a>, meaning in this case that signature data is not embedded inline with the credential, the signature is detached from the credential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a JSON-encoded verifiable credential that my university might issue to communicate my relationship and some additional information. Note that this is NOT a real-world Microsoft-issued example, it is a construct meant to highlight characteristics of the specification.&nbsp; If you see ways in which my example is not conformant, please point it out in the comments, for extra street cred!</p>
<p>A valid JSON object formatted as a JWT-VC with a header, payload and Signature section</p>
<p>The JWT-VC payload combines two different kinds of claims:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The three-letter claims (iss, nbf, exp, jti, sub in this example ) come from <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519">RFC 7519</a> (the JWT specification). These claims are required to validate the JWT and would be expected by any conformant JWT library or product.&nbsp; 
 The vc claim at the first level of the JWT comes from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VC Data Model 1.1</a>. The vc claim contains the following standardized claims:
 
 credentialSubject is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject">container for authoritative attribute statements about a subject</a> (for example, the “achieved” object in my example, which is custom to the NorthAmericanUniversityGraduationRecord credential type and shows the type of accreditation earned). 
 @context contains <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#contexts">a set of URIs</a> that point to machine-readable definitions conforming to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context">W3C JSON-LD</a> @context definition. In this version of the spec, even if you aren’t using JSON-LD, you need to respect this format and ensure that the values set in @context additionally contain a reference to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#base-context">VC Data Model v1.1 base context</a> so that JWT-VC credentials won’t break JSON-LD parsers. In our example, we included the base context but also a reference to “global-diplomas.org/accreditation”, which is where the credential schema for the credential in the type attribute would be found. 
 type is another property that should be constructed according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#specifying-the-type">JSON-LD conventions</a>. According to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#differences-between-contexts-types-and-credentialschemas">Section B.2 of the VC Data Model 1.1</a>, &nbsp;@type is used to “indicate which set of claims the verifiable credential contains”.&nbsp; Unlike the @context property, which is always a set of URIs, @type can be a single string or an unordered set. &nbsp;Our NorthAmericanUniversityGraduationRecord type helps verifiers to reliably ask for a credential with predictable contents. 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to know how a canonical credential corresponds to a JWT-VC, you need to spend quality time in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token">section 6.3.1 of the VC data model</a>. &nbsp;Here’s an example of how our JWT-VC would look decoded into the canonical data format:</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>Diagram mapping our example JWT-VC object to a canonical credential</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that in the JWT-VC, both the jti and the sub properties map to a property called “id” in the credential data model, one property applies to the parent credential object and the other applies to a credentialSubject object.</p>
 Distinctions, Differences and Gotchas 
<p>The JWT-VC representation imposes rules on how a VC can be constructed, and in some cases the choice of representation has important consequences.</p>
<p>Single Signature/Issuer</p>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515.html">Signed JWTs</a> are structured to have only one signature, and that single signature is affiliated to one issuer. This is an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#proofs-signatures">external proof</a> (in VC terms) and it wraps the entire assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single Subject</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519">RFC 7519</a> defines a JWT sub claim as containing a single value, which maps to the id value of a credentialSubject object.&nbsp; There can only be one JWT sub claim, which means that a JWT-VC can’t have more than one credentialSubject object within it. Other encodings do not have this limitation, allowing multiple credentialSubject objects within a single verifiable credential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nbf, not iat</p>
<p>In the VC data model, issuance date is defined as “the date and time when a credential becomes valid”.&nbsp; In JWT-land, there is a difference between the moment the token was issued (iat), and the earliest moment that any verifier should consider the token as valid (nbf). The JWT authors defined two separate values to help account for clock skew, because if the system clocks aren't perfectly aligned, the token could arrive before it was even issued. The VC data model JSON encoding maps the issuanceDate claim in the abstract credential to the JWT “not before” claim rather than the JWT “issued at” claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Remember, the Verifiable Credential is just half of the Story! 
<p>A subject might have a signed JWT-VC stored with a holder, but to present it to a verifier, the holder needs to also construct a JWT-VP to show that the subject &amp; holder have a legitimate relationship to this particular verifiable credential, and that the subject wants this particular VC to be presented to this particular verifier, at this particular time. &nbsp;Our JWT-VC claims that a globally unique subject (did:ion:pamelarosiedee) has earned a degree, now we need to convince a verifier that did:ion:pamelarosiedee is right here, right now, present in the transaction and is actively passing their credential along. &nbsp;&nbsp;Cryptographically speaking, a JWT-VP represents a proof of possession: a verifiable way to know for sure that the entity presenting the diploma is the same entity that the diploma was issued to in the first place.</p>
<p>Going back to my last blog entry, a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations">verifiable presentation</a> is an endorsement.&nbsp; It wraps our letter of introduction (VC) and adds an extra proof to the mix – a time specific proof that the exact subject listed in the verifiable credential is present and part of a real-time identity transaction.&nbsp; If my employer does all their validation checks properly, they will know that an entity with a globally unique identifier of did:ion:pamelarosiedee (me) is claiming to be the subject of an authoritative educational achievement issued by did:web:ucalgary.ca (my university) in the moment in time when the employer needs that information. &nbsp;The validation checks enable cryptographic trust, meaning that the data hasn’t been tampered with, but don’t be fooled that cryptographic trust is the only trust decision that must be made!&nbsp; What if did:web:ucalgary.ca wasn’t a real university, for example? I could go register the domain “dingleuniversity.com” and create a degree for myself that could be generated and presented with perfect cryptographic trust! &nbsp;The verifier needs to be able not only to know the documents are not tampered with, but that the issuers of the documents are acceptable business partners in a given context.&nbsp; This is where trust federations, trust registries and trust frameworks come in, topics that are out of scope for this article but that we will return to.</p>
<p>Heading back to our example, what would a verifiable presentation look like if I wanted, on the 8th of August 2022, to present my University degree to my employer?</p>
<p>A JWT-VP issued by my decentralized identifier and audienced for microsoft’s decentralized identifier that contains the verifiable credential we’ve already studied</p>
 A Closer look at JWT-VP 
<p>The example above is a JSON-encoded verifiable presentation, or JWT-VP. The “how-to” of JSON-encoding into a JWT-VP is blended into <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token">section 6</a> of the spec, so there is no easy section to refer to, but there are a few significant differences if you read closely:</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>No Subject</p>
<p>The subject property isn’t needed in a VP, because the issuer is asserting a thing about itself, in other words a JWT-VC is self-issued (you will hear this term again).</p>
<p>Wraps a Related Verifiable Credential</p>
<p>Remember, the JWT-VC must prove a relationship between the presented credential and the entity doing the presentation.&nbsp; By far the most common relationship to prove is the “this is my credential” relationship, also called “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#subject-is-the-holder">Subject is the Holder</a>”.&nbsp; If I stole my sister’s diploma and uploaded it to my employer to verify, the burden is on the verifier to detect the fraud and reject my claim to the uploaded credential.&nbsp; If the verifier does a bad job, the fraud could work. In verifiable credentials we use cryptographic proofs to be sure the presenter of the credential is the subject of the credential.&nbsp; If the issuer that signs the JWT-VP is the same entity as the subject listed in the encapsulated JWT-VC, you have a strong proof of legitimate possession.&nbsp; In our JWT-VP world this check is straightforward because both JWT issuers and subject are always single-valued. Validation logic for this use case is currently non-normative, but do not interpret non-normative as not important!</p>
<p>Constrained to an Audience</p>
<p>While verifiable credentials are an open-ended assertion, verifiable presentations are targeted, using a property called aud.&nbsp; This critical security component prevents an attacker from stealing a presentation made to one verifier and reusing it at another verifier. &nbsp;Creating a presentation without an audience is like broadcasting your endorsement – as long as nobody records your broadcast you might be ok, but if anyone does record that broadcast, they can replay it at will! &nbsp;Imagine if you uploaded your diploma to your social network and openly endorsed it as yours to get a pretty badge, but somebody recorded you endorsing your diploma and used that recording to apply for 3 different jobs in your name! &nbsp;Not only is it imperative to use an audience in all presentations, but it is imperative not to accept broadcasts, that is verifiers should not accept an un-audienced presentation, because it could be a replay.&nbsp; This does not mean that audience needs to be a strict match in the way that a subject/holder match is performed – it could be that the presentation is legitimately audienced to a group of verifiers rather than a single verifier, but every degree of freedom allowed in the audience introduces replay risk.</p>
<p>Time-Limited and Single-Use</p>
<p>The momentary nature of a verifiable presentation is what makes it safe to hold and store verifiable credentials. &nbsp;A JWT-VP represents the exact moment where a subject intends to share a credential.&nbsp; These VPs are only valuable if they can reliably represent the true intention and only the true intention of the subject in the moment they intended it and no other. &nbsp;Once a JWT-VP is signed and represents that intention, the token itself becomes extremely powerful. To keep abuse to a minimum, the JWT-VP exp property together with nbf creates a short window of validity. &nbsp;Verifiers need to track every incoming jti value (the unique token identifier) for as long as it is valid, so that they can detect any token that might fall through the cracks and get replayed.&nbsp; A short JWT-VP validity window reduces the number of active identifiers that have to be tracked by verifiers (helping performance), and also condenses the window of opportunity for an attacker to act, this also means a smaller horizon for risk/fraud tools to look for abuse trends.</p>
<p>Note that many VCs will also have a validity window calculated by the exp property, however that window can be much longer, in part because a stolen JWT-VC has less value by itself without a fresh JWT-VP to wrap it.</p>
 How Does the VC Data Model Compare to Other Assertion Formats? 
<p>If you examine a SAML assertion, an OpenID Connect IDtoken, and a VC/VP pair, all three formats have a lot in common:</p>
 
 They are all secure envelopes for sending set of claims around the internet. 
 They all rely on cryptographic digital signatures to protect issuer’s integrity of the document. 
 They all rely on a trust framework: some external system of trust to know which set of participant identifiers to transact with in the first place. 
 
<p>There are also important differences.</p>
<p>Separation of Issuance from Presentation </p>
<p>SAML assertions and IDtokens are messages that carry claims bundled in the moment for one single audience &amp; transaction. &nbsp;This differs from verifiable credentials, which are bundles of claims with longer lifetimes that can be held, stored, and presented to multiple audiences as a separate transaction. &nbsp;This separation between the bundling of claims and the use of the bundles is really what makes the VC data model unique. Advantages that may be unlocked because of this separation include:</p>
 
 Usage blinding – Issuers don’t necessarily know which verifiers their credential goes to. 
 User-centric analytics – trends of credential use can be evaluated by the user across issuers &amp; verifiers. 
 Historical presentation - expired statements can still be evaluated. 
 Selective disclosure - the subject chooses how much of the credential is revealed to the verifier. 
 
<p>Subject Autonomy</p>
<p>The VC data model requires credential subjects to be cryptographic participants. That is huge! IDtokens and SAML assertions communicate their assertion subject using an identifier that is only unique within the identity provider’s namespace.&nbsp; Verifiable credentials require a globally unique identifier for all cryptographic participants, and while the spec does not prescribe a mechanism for resolving identifiers to signature validation keys, the current commonly-accepted format for a globally unique identifier that can “resolve” into a public key for the purpose of digital signature validation is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier</a>, or DID. &nbsp;We are going to cover the DID specification in detail in the next blog, so stay tuned for why that specification is so important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Thrilling Conclusion 
<p>As you can see, VC and VP data formats work hard to make it possible for credentials to be issued, held, and presented at the discretion of individuals.&nbsp; A VC gives structure to the data and binds the data to a given globally unique subject identifer.&nbsp; A VP adds a timely endorsement to the credential that acts as a proof of possession for the credential. The great thing about the VC data model compared to other standards that do something similar, is that VCs are a general model, and can describe many different types of credentials.&nbsp; Of course, for the purposes of interoperability, it is better if folks could agree on what credentials look like within a given community, for example we probably don't want 100 different representations of what a university diploma looks like. The fun part of the next few years (in my opinion) will be figuring out what common instantiations of credentials can and should become household names.&nbsp; There are guardrails we will want to place, and it would be lovely if we can figure out where guardrails need to be before vehicles go over the cliff, rather than after. Early adopters of this technology will have a huge part to play in socializing the kinds of credentials that become defacto standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may also have noticed that key management was a topic completely absent from this blog post, despite frequent use of the term "cryptographic signing".&nbsp; That's because the VC data model considers key management only obliquely.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer-0">The spec states</a> for example that "relevant metadata about the issuer property&nbsp;is expected to be available to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifier">verifier</a>".&nbsp; In a world where I might present my credential to verifiers with no pre-existing relationship to my issuer, how can that verifier discover the relevant metadata?&nbsp; This is where decentralized identifiers (or DIDs) come in.&nbsp; DIDs are not a required part of a verifiable credential, but they have properties that are very attractive.&nbsp; &nbsp;And you will never guess it but the next blog in the series will be a deep dive on decentralized identifiers!&nbsp; They are a workhorse of a decentralized identity architecture, and an important reason why there is a chance that verifiable credential ecosystems can scale to represent individual people, not just organizations.&nbsp; DIDs are also the bridge between many different decentralized paradigms, between unanchored and static key encoding mechanisms, and between centralized services, through the use of methods like did:web.&nbsp; We will dig into how the mechanism works, and why different did methods might be useful at different times.</p>

<p><a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> recently brought the PL network together in Lisbon for a distributed conference. Here's our recap of the event.</p> PL Summit <p>LabWeek22 kicked off with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6tnt24cIIw">PL Summit</a>. Juan Benet, founder and CEO of Protocol Labs, gave the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lDwBnQ9Wuc">opening address</a> on his vision for the future. During the five-day speaker series, attendees heard from CEOs, CTOs, and engineers in the Protocol Labs network as they shared their successes, product innovations, and more. </p><p>Research &amp; Development took center stage during the Impact talk, demonstrating how innovation in the PLN helps grow many early research projects into fully fledged production networks. </p><p>Our CEO Boris Mann gave a <a href="https://noti.st/bmann/7b7aWx">brief overview of IPVM</a> and the other projects that Fission is working on. You can watch his presentation, cued up below.</p><p>It was also there that Protocol Labs announced the winners of a $100K prize pool. We were delighted that IPVM was selected as a grant recipient!</p>IPVM and 17 other exciting projects were selected for grant funding! Hacker Base <p>The Fission x Filecoin Foundation x Lightshift Hacker Base opened for co-working, workshops, and demos. Throughout the week we hosted an Open Metaverse Meetup with Mona Galleries, Danny O'Brien's Decentralize All the Things! talk, a Filecoin Accounts Working Group session, web3storage's UCAN Build Apps with IPFS workshop, an FVM Open Hack Day, a Web3 Creators meetup, a Filecoin Private Data co-working event, and demo sessions from CASA, SpruceId, Ceramic, and MetaPals.</p>The beautiful Hacker Base at the Garagem Lisboa Meetups <p>Fission attended a CASA Mini-Gathering and folks from Metamask, WalletConnect, web3.storage, SpruceID, and Ceramic were all in attendance. We continued the discussion on the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/issues/132">CAIP-25 RPC Methods</a> proposal that was initiated at <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/berlin-blockchain-week-recap/">Dappcon</a>. </p><p>Our co-founder and CTO Brooklyn Zelenka enjoyed participating in the <a href="https://lu.ma/8kk9i628">"Move The Bytes" Working Group</a>. This group is focused on making IPFS faster and more reliable by building a protocol that can replace bitswap, and aren't waiting for any specific team to lead the way. They are true go-getters!</p><p>We always try to host community socials whenever we're around for a conference, and this time was no different. We partnered with the lovely folks at <a href="https://web3.storage/">web3storage</a> for a Happy Hour at our favorite rooftop bar. </p>Enjoying the UCAN Have Drinks SocialDemo-ing Webnative App Template at UCAN Have Drinks Gathering IPFS Camp <p>On Day 5 of LabWeek22, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIbZUi7cTX8&amp;list=PLuhRWgmPaHtSEv2DM9J7nSvN7dnVFMM6q&amp;index=3">IPFS Camp 2022</a> kicked off by gathering the IPFS community for talks, workshops, discussion circles, hacking time, and more, all focused on celebrating recent wins and looking ahead to the future of the IPFS protocol. </p><p>Boris gave a <a href="https://noti.st/bmann/Kuk5iE/fission-the-webnative-sdk">presentation on Fission's Webnative SDK</a>, and how we are making far edge app development much easier with identity, data, and compute solutions.</p><p>Boris also <a href="https://twitter.com/bmann/status/1584449607299321857">live-tweeted</a> his experience throughout LabWeek22 and IPFS Camp.</p><p>Our CTO Brooklyn Zelenka participated in a panel on ways to improve the developer experience. She shared how Fission's stack does the heavy lifting on encryption and access control so developers can focus on the features and benefits of the app they want to produce.</p> FIL Lisbon <p>On Day 8 The Filecoin Foundation kicked off the <a href="https://fil-lisbon.io/">FIL Lisbon</a> conference with speakers, panel discussions, and interactive workshops with storage providers, users, and builders from the Filecoin ecosystem. Topics included FVM, NFTs, the Metaverse, and more.</p><p><a href="https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/introducing-the-decentralized-storage-alliance/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">It was announced</a> that Filecoin Foundation, Protocol Labs, AMD, Seagate, and EY are coming together to form the <a href="https://dsalliance.io/">Decentralized Storage Alliance</a>. The Alliance is focused on supporting the adoption of decentralized technologies by helping organizations make the transition to Web3. Through education, advocacy, and sharing and establishing best practices, the goal is to increase the use of Filecoin, IPFS, and libp2p technologies. </p> Conversations &amp; Next Steps <p>UCAN continues to unexpectedly show up in lots of places, which warms our hearts at Fission. Lots of people are building new products, or trying to make their custom tech run on IPFS, and we are delighted that UCANs are becoming the go-to tool when it comes to passwordless authentication. </p><p>We also had some great conversations around identity and capabilities, where the idea for WhoCANs came about. WhoCANs are a way to delegate from a name to a key. This is really useful where we want to share something with someone, but don't know their key in advance, or where we want to be able to rotate our keys without rotating everything. The permissions can be tied to a long term name (like an email address), and you can get new keys if you can prove that you control the address! </p><p>Since the conference, Blaine and other UCAN community collaborators have been working on the early stages of <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/discussions/121">WhoCANs</a>. Be sure to attend the <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan">UCAN community calls</a> to learn more or lend a hand!</p><p>It was so great getting to meet everyone and reconnect with the PL community. We look forward to seeing everyone again next year!</p><p></p>

<p>In this vlog, 1Kosmos CMO, Michael Cichon, is joined by 1Kosmos CSO, Mike Engle, to discuss how digital identity can modernize healthcare. If you are interested in learning more about this topic, please join us at our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/event/digital-identity-in-health-care/">webinar</a> where Mike will be diving deeper into this topic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
All right, well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon. I’m the chief marketing officer at 1Kosmos. I’ve invited our chief strategy officer, Mike Engle here today to talk about healthcare. Mike, welcome to the vlog. I’ve done some poking around, some research around healthcare, and I’ve learned a little bit about this legislation that was passed in 2016, called The Omnibus 21st Century Cures Act. And to my surprise, this got pretty deep into some interoperability requirements. Can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, there’s legislation and industry efforts, that are trying to get, something that should be very obvious, but access to your own data, or to have your data be easily shared with somebody else, specifically in the healthcare world.</p>
<p>So this has been a long time coming. People have been trying to revolutionize healthcare records and healthcare access for 20 years, and I think the big tech companies have all tried many times, but a lot of exciting traction, that’s coming about pretty recently in this front.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So this is interesting, because it recognizes a lot of things that we would like to take for granted. We’ve all experienced this, a new pharmacy, a new insurance company, a new healthcare provider. As a patient, you go in and you start from scratch, provide all your basic information, then if you’ve got an old doctor, old doctor asked to send information to new doctor, and over a lifetime, your information gets spread all over the place, so is this focused on solving that problem?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
It is. It’s taking a pragmatic approach to it in a small steps.</p>
<p>So I’ll give you an example. Today, you go to your doctor for five years and you happen to be in the state next door and you go to the hospital. How does that hospital get access to your health records today? If you were to go to the hospital today, Michael, how do you think that would happen?</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
I expect a phone call, or a fax, or some kind of an email might be sent, and they would get it, right?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right. We’re stuck in the nineties. It’s really, it’s horrifying on many levels, from a technology perspective, from a verification of what it actually is, how do we know we’re getting the right health records? So there’s these efforts to modernize what they call the key, and we’ll talk about this on our webinar coming up, the key is, how do you get in, how do you prove who you are? I am Mike Engle, let’s work on my healthcare together, in a safe way.</p>
<p>And then there’s the doors, that you’re actually going through, which is all of the entities today, that hold our data, the hospitals, the specialty care providers, and they need to be able to exchange your information in a safe way as well. If for that doctor to send it to the hospital or vice versa, your blood work, needs to be federated around to lots of different people. And so, they’re trying to standardize and modernize, how those two interaction points happen.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So, this is starting to hit some familiar points here, because the very first thing is proving who you are, I guess, electronically or in a remote setting, and then there’s the storage of information, so this seems to map pretty strongly into a lot of the themes we’ve been talking about, when we talk about identity proofing and creating this digital wallet. Is that what’s happening behind the scenes?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
It is, yeah. I mean, the terminology may vary, but at the end of the day, I need a wallet or a safe place to keep my health records, that I am in control of.</p>
<p>Much like what we do for identity, is I can allow you, Michael, to create your own identity wallet, and have trusted credentials go into it, everything verified, matched to your true world identity, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the same principles should apply in the healthcare world. I prove who I am. I get access to my data, because I don’t generate that data, the hospital takes the MRI scan or somebody draws my blood work, but they should give it to me, and I should be able to share it with anybody that I want, with the press of a button, but be in control of it at all times, and that’s all in scope of what they’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So in practicality, in real world environment, how would this work? Does a hospital deploy this, or can you step us through how patients, you and I, would experience this in real life?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, so there’s a lot of ways to answer that. Today, the way you get your health record created, is you have to typically go to a provider, I’m going to the doctor’s office or the hospital for the first time, show them a driver’s license, give them some other information, and they will either create a new record, or try to find you in their system. Okay, I’ll match the address, Michael Cichon, lives at 123 Main Street. Got you, and I’m in person with you, it’s all verified, and then I can hand you now a login. And so, it’s very in person, high touch, still error prone, because they could still get the wrong Michael Cichon. Imagine if you’ve had five address changes, since you’ve been to that hospital last.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
How do they find you inside the system? So these are all the things that they’re working on.</p>
<p>Now. The way it could work in the future, if we’re successful in our mission, is you can prove who you are without a doubt, and there’s some way then, to easily match those health records, not just at that point, but even remotely and digitally. I have logins at Quest, Labcorp, around me, there’s three hospitals that I’ve been to over the years, for various non-emergency things, because I’m healthy, and I’m just kidding, but all my data’s spread out and I might have logins to some of them, I don’t even remember, so that’s the scope of the problem we’re dealing with, and now, you can do all that stuff remotely.</p>
<p>So if I’m going to, say, do a Teladoc session, where I need to get medical care over Zoom, or over something like this, now it’s really important that you’re talking to the right person and that you’re talking to a verified doctor.</p>
<p>So we can do all that stuff digitally now.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
That’s great. And we’re not alone in this mission. There’s an organization called CARIN, not the K-A-R-E-N, it’s the C-A-R-I-N, and they’re all around furthering the interoperability standards for the access and sharing of this, correct?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, that’s right. The CARIN Alliance is a nonprofit, and we’re going to talk in depth about this next week, but their mission is to bring payers and providers that serve users, like you and me, together and get some of these standards in place and create some real demonstrations of the art of the possible.</p>
<p>So for example, we’re working with the CARIN Alliance now, to demonstrate how you could prove your identity remotely to, say, one of the federal healthcare services, and then let somebody else rely on that trust.</p>
<p>So imagine you go to social security and you say, “I’m I’m 58, I need my Medicare plan B,” whatever it is, you have to prove who you are. Shouldn’t you be able to reuse that proof to a hospital, or to your doctor, so that they can easily consume your identity? You can share it with them and then they can all go downstream from there, and that’s one of the actual, real-world projects we’re working on, in the CARIN Alliance right now.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So this is pretty cool. So with the proper platform and framework that’s interoperable, me as a patient, I could enroll remotely, all of my information is stored under lock and key that I control, and then as I go to a new provider or a new pharmacy, essentially, I would do something as simple as, for example, scan a QR code and we do a facial recognition and now they get exactly the information I want to give them, at the time I want to give it to them. Right?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Exactly. Yeah, so the art of proving who you are remotely is, there’s a federal standard for that, it’s NIST 800-63-3, it says, here’s how you do all this stuff remotely to prove somebody, match the face to the driver’s license and all that, and these medical organizations and government agencies, are now working to be able to implement that as a trusted way to prove your identity.</p>
<p>And once it’s done in one place, that same identity can be leveraged over and over again, so you don’t have to go to hospital one, prove who you are, go to hospital two, prove who you are. Imagine if you go to the hospital and they ask you a question, do you have a social security account? I say, “by Joe, I do.” All right, great. I just need you to authorize the transfer of that identity information over to us, so that boom, we’re in and I can match the patient records very easily. That’s the vision. Or there’s many ways that it could be implemented, but that’s one example of how it could work, and make things a lot easier.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
This is really fascinating. We’re going from a world, like we discussed earlier, where information is just spread all over the place, to a world where it’s in one place, it’s controlled by the patient, and it’s there when they need it, they share it selectively when they want to, and they get the services they need, so that’s fascinating.</p>
<p>Now, we are doing a webinar on this. If you’re seeing this before the webinar, it’s December 15th, 1<br>
:00 PM Eastern Time, 10:00 AM Pacific Time. Mike, you have some partners in this webinar, correct?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
I do, yeah. I’ll be joined by Ryan Howells, from the CARIN Alliance, so he’ll be talking in depth about some of the topics that I hinted on, and we are also being joined by Adam McBride, who’s the IT director at Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>So these are people that have been doing this for a long time, and we’re working very closely with both of these organizations, to try to make some of these things come to light.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, this is really amazing, not just giving patients like you and I access to the services we need, but we all know that the healthcare records are one of the most sought after records by cyber criminals. So securing that information, especially as we move forward here and the attacks get even more creative and aggressive, it’s really exciting to hear the work that’s being done around this.</p>
<p>Mike, thank you so much for joining me today. I appreciate your time. I’m looking forward to that webinar.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Pleasure. We’ll talk to you soon.</p>

<p>For the past 5 years, Ontology has been building for Web3, through the highs and the lows of the blockchain cycle. Our latest AMA takes a look back at the history of Ontology and the progress made in building identity and data based Web3 infrastructure. With the past to guide us, we look forward to a successful future.</p><p>Here are some of the key points from the&nbsp;AMA.</p><p>Host: It’s been five years since Ontology’s inception. What are your thoughts about&nbsp;it?</p><p>Erick: I think it’s been very interesting to see how this space has evolved since 2017. 2017 was kind of like the last bull market. We’ve gone through a full cycle from bull to bear to bull, and now back to&nbsp;bear.</p><p>I think the trends have changed a bit. Initially, it was a lot of protocols focused on Layer1, thinking about the infrastructure and the very foundational level. But over time, transitioned to a lot more like DeFi and application level. So I was glad to see it move in that direction because I think the most important thing is thinking about the end-user and what kinds of applications they&nbsp;require.</p><p>That was reflected in Ontology as well. When Ontology started out, it was very focused on business to business. But overtime, it transitioned over to the more consumer facing applications. There’s still the business side of things, but I think, you know there’s no denying that the consumer market has dwarfed the enterprise market for blockchain with regards to all the applications, DeFi, NFTs, and now with decentralized identity, with no&nbsp;doubts.</p><p>Host: What is your view on this whole five years of Ontology, working on DID, OScore, constantly innovating as someone who’s a member of the community, as someone who facilitates members of the community? What is your take on&nbsp;that?</p><p>NodeDiggity: I probably have a few different points. The first one is I wish I had been here since the inception or conception of it because watching it grow from 2017 to now would probably give me a better idea of what the following five years could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>I think DID can solve a lot of issues for a lot of people, specifically with regards to mass adoption.</p><p>I think that companies, specifically Ontology, are placed to do this well. They can make the landscape safe, and it seems like a really altruistic effort. Protecting the assets of people and allowing them actual ownership of it and sort of facilitating the future, with the concept of reputation coming&nbsp;through.</p><p>Erick: I just want to reiterate the importance of reputation. I think on both sides, there needs to be ways to reward contributors and make them be able to take their reputation across different platforms.</p><p>Host: What value has Ontology actually added onto the Web3 infrastructure or the Web 3 framework?</p><p>Erick: I think the most important thing or the most important contribution is the decentralized identity infrastructure, because a lot of Web3 projects right now, especially in DeFi, still operate very much on overcollateralization, which limits the use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>So we need the identity layer and the reputation layer. Then we know which projects are trustworthy, which people are trustworthy and to do peer-to-peer loans with, and that’s going to enable a whole lot of a lot of&nbsp;things.</p><p>The core of that is the decentralized identity infrastructure, verifiable credentials to be able to track the history and to be able to read it, transfer it and even analyze it and draw insights from it to assign under a new version of a credit score. Then aside from that, I mean the same goes for the other areas of Web3 like for NFTs or&nbsp;DAOs.</p><p>NodeDiggity:</p><p>My viewpoint on this is exactly the opposite of Erick’s. I look at it from a user standpoint, because that’s who I&nbsp;am.</p><p>So the two things that I’ve thought might be the most valuable to the public&nbsp;are:</p><p>The first one is a multi chain mobile wallet which is user friendly and works as such and actually does what it’s supposed to do. And I think setting up a mobile wallet that is multi chain is paramount to getting cross chain identity to be&nbsp;usable.</p><p>And the 2nd one is coming from the node operator and initial investor&nbsp;side.</p><p>I didn’t mean the one who just saw ontology on a dex and bought it because of the high APY. It’s sustainable because of the tokenomics situation that Ontology has planned out by releasing their governance token incrementally. I think that’s particularly attractive to people like me who want to put their money into something that is not like staking something to make sure you don’t get inflated&nbsp;out.</p><p>For more information and details, please click the link below to get the recording of this&nbsp;Space:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1RDGlapeMnDJL">https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1RDGlapeMnDJL</a></p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/five-years-in-the-making-continuing-to-deliver-web3-7a35a4dc24d7">Five Years in the Making: Continuing to Deliver Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: More than 2000 years ago in Persia, Egypt, ancient China and their contemporary civilisations, the first versions of what we now know as the passport were used to travel from one region to another. As the world became more populated and connected through roads and by the sea, passports became a vital piece of paper for people to enter from one country to another. But only in the late 21st century the passport became as standardised and globally acknowledged as we know it today.</p>
<p>But what has been the ultimate motivation for humans to travel the world? Trade, and it’s still today.</p>
<p>Companies have also existed for centuries. Some of the oldest businesses existing today were established in Japan, like Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan a hot spring hotel founded in 705. However, the need for business registries came much later in history. The United Kingdom’s Companies House was created in 1844. The goal of British lawmakers at that time was that having a list of registered companies publicly available would help reduce fraud.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Atlantic, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a company that was founded in 1841 provided credit reports about businesses through several decades with a similar goal of helping businesspeople know the companies they were planning to trade with. In 1963 Dun &amp; Bradstreet created the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) a unique nine-digit identifier for businesses. A few other similar business identifiers appeared but, as with the passports, the time for a global standardisation was still to come.</p>
<p>Let’s hear now the history of the Legal Entity Identifier, LEI, the 20-digit identifier for businesses and other types of organisations.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Today we have with us Clare Rowley. The head of business operations at the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, the GLEIF.</p>
<p>Clare, what were the reasons why the LEI was created?</p>
<p>Clare Rowley: I will go all the way back to September of 2008. For participants in financial markets, financial institutions, this is a very memorable month because during this time there was what is now referred to as the Lehman weekend.</p>
<p>And of course, that led to a failure of an extremely important market institution, market player and the subsequent impact across the world. So, at this time, there were supervisors within financial markets, financial institutions, asking a very simple question to their regulated entities. That is, what is your exposure to Lehman Brothers? And the scary answer was – that was not really an easy thing to know and to determine, and it will probably take weeks and maybe even months to get that answer.</p>
<p>And the root of the problem was not that there was no data on the positions that were held, etc. Rather, it was the problem in identifying those several thousand legal entities associated with Lehman Brothers. So, at the time there was no design in data systems that made it easy to aggregate information across the entities and then clearly paint the different hierarchies existing, be it in the financial products or in the corporate structure itself. That left a window opening or some motivation for the leaders around the world to come together and to think about how to solve that problem.</p>
<p>So, if we fast forward to today, we’ll see that the Legal Entity Identifier, the LEI and that being part of the global LEI system has solved the problem of identity, largely starting in derivative markets, but bit by bit moving into all financial instruments such as securities, fixed income markets that are around the world. And you’ll see now that the LEI, it is incorporated into different regulatory reporting’s. And based on our, the foundation’s, last analysis, we are able to identify 294 regulations and policy recommendations that are coming from 24 jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p>Oscar: Tell us more about how was the process behind the creation of these LEI standards.</p>
<p>Clare: So, it really was a fabulous international effort that was led by the Financial Stability Board. So, following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, you then had the G20 leaders coming together and making a recommendation. An open public means a system for identifying legal entities. And that recommendation was put to the Financial Stability Board.</p>
<p>So, the very first thing that the Financial Stability Board, an organisation international that is based out of Basel, Switzerland. Put their heads together and said, okay, first we want to look at the governance topic. So, they did a very extensive consultation to public sector entities, the regulatory, central banks, securities regulators, etc., but also an extensive outreach to private sector.</p>
<p>And that private sector was not just organisations like financial institutions, the intermediaries, etc., but also going into, for example, real world like the topic of supply chain, business registries. So not just focusing on the financial markets but looking into, for example, even payments, etc., where we see a lot of activity today. And overall, the Financial Stability Board concluded a governance structure that is that is very robust but inclusive of all different organisations or all different, you could say sectors.</p>
<p>So, let’s start at the top. We have three layers.</p>
<p>At the top we have the Regulatory Oversight Committee, and this is made up of more than 65 authorities from around the globe that are setting the policy and ensuring the policy evolves over time.</p>
<p>Then you have the Global LEI Foundation, the GLEIF, which is the organisation I represent. We are managing the operations. We are a not-for-profit Swiss foundation.</p>
<p>And then at the third level there is organisations called LEI issuers. And this is the most diverse grouping of organisations involved. We have 39 in total, and they are the local experts. So, they know what makes a legal entity, a legal entity, how to validate and verify that information at the local jurisdictional level.</p>
<p>So, this governance structure that was set up is very inclusive as you have the public sector there at the top. Then you have us, the foundation, which you could consider more like a neutral, not for profit organisation and helping to coordinate across the different layers. And then these LEI issuers, the 39 organisations are all different types of entities. You have private sector entities like London Stock Exchange, Bloomberg, you have business registers, etc. So, it’s a very mixed group and also allows the system to get a very wide input into how it should evolve into how it’s applied at the local level.</p>
<p>So, this public private partnership led by the Financial Stability Board, well, it was developed in a very intensive way with great participation coming from different areas. You see a governance structure that has persisted and that has really demonstrated how efficient it is.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, we have the LEI.</p>
<p>So, in parallel to the developments, the governance structure, there is also a desire to ensure that the LEI, the legal entity identifier was non-proprietary, a broad public good and therefore there was the engagement with ISO, the International Standardisation Organisation, to establish the LEI as that kind of standard, one that is open, public, freely accessible. And you will find the LEI is also represented as an ISO standard – 17442.</p>
<p>That standard describes the LEI itself, as well as the reference data such as official name, registered address. And something interesting there as well is the idea that it should evolve over time. So, you see already there have been updates to the standard to include, for example, references to how the LEI could be embedded in digital products like digital certificates. And that is a really fundamental principle of the system that the system in the governance structure, in the actual application of standards should evolve according to market participant needs over time.</p>
<p>Oscar: And when the LEI was – possibly said launch – was made available for organisations.</p>
<p>Clare: So, the foundation itself came into being in June of 2014. But you will find that the earliest LEIs were issued all the way back in 2012 and that gets us a bit to how it has been used since its creation. So, you might think to yourself and a standard for legal entity identity that’s really big and it also gets to the heart of data systems of how businesses interact – identify their partners. And if you think yourself or even, let’s say, as a business entity, how many identifiers you have, you will quickly think about, for example online platforms, logins with governments, logins to health insurance, whatever it is, etc.</p>
<p>And you will realise you have hundreds and hundreds of identifiers, either that you use personally or for businesses as well. So that therefore brings us to well, how do you get by in an interest and utilisation for such a system when it really gets to a very expensive end and difficult change for organisations, how to identify business partners itself and transactions etc. And that is where we see regulators in the first step of using the LEI.</p>
<p>They looked and they said, well, we know we have an area that’s changing rapidly where we have regulation coming into effect and change is occurring in industry and that was derivative markets. So back in 2012 when the first LEIs were being issued, they were being issued to help the financial market participants, both financial institutions, as well as companies that use derivatives for things like currency hedging, natural resource hedging, etc.</p>
<p>Those were the first entities to obtain the LEI and that was to ensure compliance with emerging regulations of the United States such as the Dodd-Frank regulation, and within Europe, the EMIR regulation and then the LEI expanded after that in to, for example, the markets in financial instruments directive in the EU so more broad use across the across the financial instruments markets.</p>
<p>But indeed, that’s why you see a bit of the disconnect between the first LEIs being issued in 2012 to meet the market demand, the regulatory implementations. But the actual full system itself with the GLEIF, there helping managing the operations, the publication of the data, etc. that was not fully in place until June of 2014.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: The early 2010s saw the world becoming more digital and connected. Square, Stripe and later Apple Pay made it so easy to move money from the device that was already in our pockets. OpenID Connect made it so easy to use our digital identities across a seemingly unlimited number of services.</p>
<p>The concept of Identities for organisations was finally starting to take off thanks to the new LEI standard. So, how LEI is used today?</p>
<p>The ignition factor for LEIs came from the financial industry, but it was not the emergence of mobile payments or users’ convenience. It came through an unprecedented avalanche of regulations that mandated its use. These more than 300 global regulations covered most financial activity you could think of – Payments, Capital Markets, Private Banking, Treasury, Cross Border Trade, Letters of Credit, Lending, and the list continues.</p>
<p>In November 2018 the Bank of England became the first central bank with plans to make LEIs mandatory within certain transactions between financial institutions.</p>
<p>“The notes smelled musty, as if they had been stored under the floorboards” was said by the court.&nbsp; This blatant example of NatWest bank shows how cash enters into the financial system in the millions to fund illegal activities when there are insufficient anti-money laundering checks. This case makes it very clear that banks and financial institutions must verify who exactly their customers are. How can bank employees know who are the beneficial owners of a company? Here is how LEIs are already helping.</p>
<p>Who are the job creators? The media often makes us believe that big corporations and billionaires are. But the evidence shows, as we discussed with Amit Sharma earlier in this podcast, that small and medium enterprises, SMEs, are the real job creators in both the richest and poorest countries.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even in richer economies, small businesses find it very hard to get access to credit to secure their next 12 months of operation. Why? The main reason is that a company’s financial reputation is directly based on the owner’s financial score. What if the family, on top of not owning any property, never built up a good credit score to prove that they are reliable for re-payments? A bank would make its due diligence, follow their KnowYourCustomer KYC processes, and as a result deny them credit. How can we change this game and bring financial inclusion? Again, here is how LEIs can help.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that LEIs can make a big positive impact, and innovative companies are already making this happen.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: So now let’s talk about the future of the LEIs. So, with the pandemic and the recent economic instability, what are the new challenges that the LEI has found?</p>
<p>Clare: When we talk about the future, what we see at the GLEIF is a pivot to the private sector, adoption.</p>
<p>And we see there – first, I will focus on trade. And to quote a recent publication that came from ICC UK, “the world’s 333 million companies support a global community of almost 8 billion people, all of whom rely on these companies to earn a living and live in a prosperous and more peaceful world.” So, 330 million companies, well, you can’t have a global economy – interactions between companies, customers cross-border without having a more efficient way of answering that very basic question, who am I doing business with?</p>
<p>So, we see there an emerging dialogue and focus coming from the trade, the supply chain community on the importance of LEI for trade participants. And that is particularly since the COVID pandemic, where we see fraudulent transactions as people, companies ran to go digital. Fraudulent transactions also have been on the rise. And that’s where the private sector becomes engaged, looking at the LEI, the accessing of the LEI via the LEI index as a means to provide real time access to unique identification of legal entities.</p>
<p>It helps the first step in creating an efficient and trust-based relationship to facilitate, for example, trade finance. And then, very importantly, eliminating manual inputs and the difficulties or cost driving exercises that manual management of data causes. So, for example, if you are relying on names and addresses to try to identify business parties, to try to communicate across business partners, you have problems with translation, transliteration, shortening of names, of addresses and all of that requires manual intervention just to get a transaction initiated, just to have and establish that very first trust between two business partners.</p>
<p>So, there you see an emerging interest in the LEI as a solution for KYC, anti-fraud and ensuring appropriate surveillance for anti-money laundering.</p>
<p>Identity also is extremely important for businesses. And access to a global identity can be life changing for small businesses, especially small businesses coming from developing nations where maybe their local business registry is not easily accessible to parties outside the country, etc.</p>
<p>And there we did a pilot project in Zimbabwe working with a financial institution that engaged in something we call the validation agent operating model. That bank was called, NMB bank and they decided to engage, to investigate. Well, how can the global LEI system offer its small business client’s access to this global identifier so as to broaden their ability to interact digitally and also make the small businesses more present and more accessible to business partners around the world.</p>
<p>And through this engagement, there’s a firm called Copper Wares that became one of the first mid-sized African companies to get an LEI. And there we have a finance manager from the company that notes – regarding Copper Wares having the LEI that “once were known out there. We expect life to be much easier, funding terms to be more accessible, credit terms to be more accessible. And overall, that helps us Copper Wares to produce more, employ more people and offer better prices and boost market share.”</p>
<p>So, we really see that driving need the ability opportunity for small businesses to promote themselves, to make themselves more accessible via this global identity as a very important pillar to the future and the growth of the global LEI system.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. And you have mentioned earlier that the LEIs are maintained supported by a series of organisations is an ecosystem including the GLEIF. So how has the GLEIF and this LEI ecosystem evolved to help solve the challenges that you just mentioned?</p>
<p>Clare: So, I already mentioned with the with the COVID pandemic, of course, you had all sorts of business processes, operations that were going digital. And with that movement toward digital, it also highlighted, you could say, one of the shortcomings of the LEI system.</p>
<p>So as a starting point, the global LEI system, it is open public information. We are gathering the data that is validated, verified by these LEI issuers around the world. We gather that data, we run data quality checks, ensure the quality of it, and then ultimately put it together and publish it in a way that enables an easy website search, full file download, or API access for technical programmes.</p>
<p>That’s our role to ensure that the LEI remains an open public good, and we’re upholding the basic principles that were put forward by the Financial Stability Board and are overseen by the Regulatory Oversight Committee. So open public data, fabulous, easily accessible. But if you take that and now apply it to establishing a trust relationship, we have a disconnect.</p>
<p>For example, I, Clare Rowley, I could take any one of these 2.2 million LEIs that are out there. I could just choose it from the open public data. Go to a financial institution and say, “Yep, here I am, Clare Rowley. I represent this organisation. I would like to open a bank account with you”, and that financial institution now has to do the same basic checks, confirming authorised representative, etc. again. To ensure that, I, Clare Rowley actually am an authorised representative of this LEI.</p>
<p>So that has driven us to look more deeply into enhancing the LEI as a digital ID management tool. And we see there is a lot of value to expand the LEI as an organisational identity management tool and the fact that it is this global unique identifier. So, we look to leverage existing technologies such as digital certificates, and we also look into a new model of decentralised business identity, looking into, for example, the principles of self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>So as to evolve the LEI in that it is not just that 20-digit alphanumeric code to identify firms, but also to enable firms to use it as a way to identify themselves. And verify the authenticity of their counterparty organisations without the need for that additional human intervention. So, we look to evolve the system to ensure it can enable instant and automated trust between legal entities and their authorised representatives.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, the importance of connecting the individual’s identity with organisations, identity. Clare, final question how do you see the LEIs in, let’s say ten years from now?</p>
<p>Clare: So absolutely we believe that digital will drive a lot of the LEI growth and that is just the reality of the world we live in. Indeed, we had the COVID pandemic, now it starts two years ago, but we see that business processes and sectors still struggle with digitisation. So, we believe that this movement, these efforts will continue for many years to come.</p>
<p>But ultimately, digital is the future for business transactions. So, we think that that area will drive a lot of growth within the global LEI system. Right now, there is a major international effort ongoing that is led by the Financial Stability Board with the intent to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive.</p>
<p>You will find that the LEI is involved in three of the building blocks of this initiative with our primary building block, our focus being around establishing&nbsp; unique identifiers with proxy registries. So, the initiative it’s very ambitious, but what we really like about it is the visionary approach. So, it is looking very globally at the overall payments ecosystem and what needs to be done to ensure the evolution of the payments ecosystem to achieve those objectives faster, cheaper, more transparent, more inclusive.</p>
<p>And just see, in July of this year, the Financial Stability Board published a recommendation report regarding the LEI in cross-border payments. And you get that same flavour of the broader ecosystem needed to facilitate transactions cross-border in an efficient way. So, some of those recommendations go to international standard setting bodies, such as FATF, the BCBS. And there you will see the focus on using the LEI as a standardised identifier for sanctions list publications, but also as a means of identification of legal entity customers, beneficiaries within payments ecosystems, but also generally for customer due diligence.</p>
<p>So, we see that there will be a growth of the LEI in the cross-border payments. To facilitate that growth we envision a greater participation of financial institutions in the issuance and maintenance of the life. And I bring back this term the validation agent that is referring to financial institutions or other types of organisations that have expertise in identity validation verification where they incorporate LEI issuance into their operating procedures for corporate, for customer due diligence to seamlessly provide the LEI to the customer as a by-product of their validation verifications that they’re doing.</p>
<p>Today we have over ten organisations that are participating as validation agents, but we believe that the LEI will become more and more embedded in customer due diligence protocols as the cross-border payment initiative forwards.</p>
<p>And then the other area I mentioned briefly is sustainability reporting. So of course, this is a very hot topic across all sorts of sectors. Knowing the sustainability profile of suppliers, of merchants, etc. And there you see of course; data is core to addressing the question of sustainability and the current climate crisis. And there’s a lot of focus on, well, what metrics are being reported, the different markets, the different cuts you could say maybe it’s looking into carbon markets, human rights, labour conditions, etc. But a very important piece of that is the fundamental question, well, who is being reported on from a company level? And then how do I connect this information? So, a company, let’s just say a manufacturer, it could be reporting information on its carbon footprint, on its use of its participants, and labour markets, etc.</p>
<p>And those could be going to very different regulators, very different investors, consumers of information. And then, of course, there also publishing the traditional financial information on their investments, on their balance sheets, income statement, etc. All of that needs to be brought together in a way that facilitates analysis, facilitates investors to understand better the profile of the company, supervisory authorities, purchasers, the customers that would be interested in engaging in supplier relationships.</p>
<p>And so, you see identity is a fundamental pillar of helping us to address the data question around sustainability reporting. So, we believe that also as the interest and the as the world around sustainability reporting becomes more standardised, you will find the LEI there growing as a tool to connect. &nbsp;You could say some of that real world information on the sustainability reporting with then also the financial markets information coming from companies.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Great to see how LEIs are going to help us on these challenges in the coming years. Thanks a lot, Clare, for joining us.</p>
<p>Clare: Well, thank you, Oscar. A pleasure again to catch up.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: There is no doubt that innovations will keep coming and will bring us surprises that are hard to imagine today. In the future, when you log into a digital service, not only you will have proved who you are but also which company you belong and if you can legally represent such business, all verified on real time.</p>
<p>These innovations will help fight against “musty” businesses, will help with international trade, will help us empower the real job creators, and more.</p>
<p>Don’t be surprised if a world in which LEIs are more ubiquitous than passports is the world we live tomorrow.</p>
<p>This was a special story episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.</p>
<p>Thank you to our guest Clare Rowley. The story of this episode was edited by myself, Oscar Santolalla with help of Chloe Hartup and Elena Sanz. Want to hear more about LEIs? Next week we have an episode on the Electronic Trade Documents Bill. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>The dedication, skills and indeed genius of the people working in industries and services such as health and care often elicits admiration and awe. So here’s a question. Why are citizens so often frustrated, let down and sometimes angry at their poor experience of using these services? How is that if you put together the expertise and dedication of thousands of different specialists the sum is so much less than the&nbsp;parts?</p><p>The answer is that these services are not ‘joined up’. They are organised around different specialist silos which are often bursting with expertise. But each concentrates on doing their own thing. When it comes to making handovers between these specialisms things fall apart. Information isn’t passed on. Actions fall between stools. There is miscommunication, error and poor coordination.</p> A single cause for a system-wide mess <p>The prime cause of such messes is the organisation-centric database: an approach to using data that keeps data generated by each specialist locked away in their own particular data silo — so that others cannot access and use&nbsp;it.</p><p>It is this that results in frustration, friction, risk, error and cost running through the system from end to end, like a stick of rock. It forces patients to tell the same story over and over again to different people as they make their way through the system. It undermines quality while multiplying costs and causing delays and errors that cascade across the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Take ‘bed blocking’. It’s got many causes, one of them being lack of capacity in the social sector: people have nowhere to go. But another cause is poor data logistics. Once someone has finished treatment in a hospital they need to be handed over to someone. But that involves planning, organisation, coordination. And that in turn requires getting the right data to and from the right people and organisations at the right times. But the traditional organisation-centric database is designed to do the exact opposite: to NOT share&nbsp;data.</p><p>If data isn’t available as to who is going to be discharged where, they can’t be discharged. Which means wards get full and new admissions get blocked. This makes the whole system suffer. Associated admin nightmares are themselves a cause of capacity constraints: the more time people have to spend chasing paper trails (and paper tails), the less time they have available for front line service delivery. Yes, the health and social care system has a funding problem. But whatever the level of funding, it could deliver a much better, higher quality service if it got its data logistics right.</p><p>This isn’t only true of health and social care. Wherever individuals’ needs span more than one, single, isolated intervention you will find the same outcomes, to some degree or other. To provide financial advice for example, you need a rounded picture of the individual’s financial state. This requires data from multiple different sources relating to employment income, pensions, income from benefits or investments, savings, debts, assets and so on. Most of the cost of providing advice isn’t related to the advice itself, but to the costs of amassing and connecting the necessary data.</p><p>When young people who have been in care leave for university or the big wide world, delays in processing and supporting them in the handover process — usually involving many different services — routinely mean that people fall between stools, creating unnecessary stress and&nbsp;misery.</p><p>Bringing together data about daily activity, exercise and diet is key to staying fit and healthy and avoiding obesity, but still impossibly difficult to do. Combining data about educational qualifications, work experiences and personal goals is essential to effective career planning, but remains more an ideal than a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>The really sad thing here is that some policy makers still seem oblivious to both what’s causing the problems they are trying to fix and the fact that they are fixable. Many policy initiatives and data strategies singularly fail to address the exam question they set themselves (such as, ‘how to use personal data to improve quality and outcomes in public services?’). Instead, they veer off at tangents while compounding the underlying problem by seeking increased centralisation and further disempowerment of individuals. It is truly tragic, for example, how often people drive by personal data logistics in their dash for jam-tomorrow claims of investment in big data, research and artificial (fake) intelligence.</p> Fixing the problem at the heart of the&nbsp;system <p>The personal data logistics infrastructure that we’ve been talking about [Link] tackles all of these problems at source. It does this by making individuals the point at which information about themselves is integrated and using their personal data stores as data sharing hubs, thereby enabling the sharing of the right information at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>In this way, it makes seamless handovers between services possible, enabling the delivery of integrated, joined-up services at much lower cost — because all the duplicated effort, delays and errors caused by the organisation-centric data logjam are lifted. It allows a step-change in service quality and outcomes as well as the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">productivity breakthroughs we talked about in our last&nbsp;blog</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>In this blog series we’re trying to make a point. Personal data raises all sorts of fundamental issues relating to human rights and privacy concerns. But it also has immense economic implications. In talking about the economic opportunities of personal data, we’ve used the language of cost, efficiency and productivity.</p><p>But here in particular, the biggest cost is the human cost. Every day millions of hard-working people’s best efforts are being squandered — mocked even — by the poor design of the systems they’re given to work with. And, as a result, every day millions more people experience pain, frustration and hassle because services aren’t working in the joined up way they’re supposed&nbsp;to.</p><p>But if citizens became the point at which data about them is integrated, and the hub by which this data is shared under their control, most of today’s pain, frustration and hassle could be lifted, for staff and patients alike. This is the second crucial way in which citizen-empowering personal data logistics infrastructure can help transform the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Now let’s turn our attention to the third way — transforming the ways in which organisations and individuals go to&nbsp;market.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases. Today’s prevailing theories of personal data are little&nbsp;better.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-personal-data-economically-valuable-927e8c7cd51">Why is personal data so valuable</a>?

				  Our regular review of recent news from around the decentralized identity community. In this edition we look at a potential digital identity bill in Congress, a hackathon focused on spreading digital identity, and a conversation on regulation as we move closer to Web3.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/12/digital-identity-metaverse-why-we-need-to-regulate-it-and-how/">Why We Need to Regulate Digital Identity in the Metaverse</a><br>Marcus Bonner shares his thoughts with the World Economic Forum on how online authentication and identification have been handled historically and why the process can be considered a failure. Bonner laments the lack of control users have when relying on third parties to hold their data, whether on e-commerce or social media sites. Looking to the emerging metaverse and Web3, he draws our attention to the critical questions we need to ask if we are to avoid the pitfalls of tying our our physical lives even closer to our virtual identities:</p>
 
 Where do the boundaries lie between a digital history — such as proof of purchase — and the right to privacy? 
 Would users have the ability or the right to be forgotten? 
 What happens to your data when you die? 
 Who can add to a user’s digital identity — and what can be added or deleted? 
 Can you create multiple identities the way you can create multiple accounts today? 
 
<p>Concrete, commonly-agreed-upon answers to these questions don’t exist today; what you can do varies based on the system you choose to use and the regulations in place in your jurisdiction. But this article does a great job of highlighting what we need to think about before signing up for any system designed to share personal information with anyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcabal.com/2022/12/05/i4ghackfest2022-hackathon-participants-propose-digital-identity-transformation-in-africa/">Hackathon Participants Propose Digital Identity Transformation Solutions for Africa</a></p>
<p>At the recent <a href="https://ingressive.org/hackfest-2022/">Ingressive for Good’s HACKFEST</a> — sponsored by <a href="https://techcabal.com/2022/03/08/verified-africa-launches-easy-id-and-address-verification-checks-for-smes-in-africa/">Verified.Africa</a>, a leading provider of ID verification and KYC in Africa — over 1,000 people signed up for a digital identity focused hackathon. Forty teams were shortlisted to participate in the 72-hour event from which three winners were selected:</p>
<p>3rd place — Internet ID: An auto-generated, secure lifetime ID that uses a secure single account access to prevent bots and fake accounts from being created.</p>
<p>2nd place — Team <a href="https://dev.to/bitbender1010/building-a-one-click-identity-verification-system-23nn">OneSecure</a>: A one-click identity verification system for businesses and portal for individuals. The team were so engrossed in their project that they continued to work on the solution after the hackathon.</p>
<p>1st place — VeriVent: A platform that links investors to potential startups while using Verified.Africa’s API to verify the startup owners’ identity, reducing the likelihood of theft and fraud..</p>
<p>This article is a great reminder of the power of good community events. Some of the best projects can be started based on a real need that has been realized and — with just a few passionate people — continue to be developed, just like OneSecure’s.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nextgov.com/analytics-data/2022/12/tsa-wants-automate-id-verification-checkpoint-security/380494/">TSA Wants to Automate ID Verification at Checkpoint Security</a><br>This article by Kristen Errick, Staff Reporter for Nextgov, takes a look at the recent decision by the TSA to add digital IDs to their pilot program for testing facial recognition. The TSA has begun using Credential Authentication Technology 2 (CAT-2) systems for identity verification at 16 airports. The system will view and compare the information from the digital identity with the passenger’s live photo and flight information — an approach previously tried with physical IDs — and now is in the testing phase to see if this is possible with digital IDs.</p>
<p>According to the article, the data&nbsp; from this pilot program will be held by the Department of Homeland Security For two years for analysis before being deleted.</p>
<p>While the system itself does not claim to be decentralized, personally identifying information that is part of this test is supposed to be almost immediately deleted, with the TSA claiming “passengers’ live photos and personally identifiable information from their digital ID will only last until the next passenger is scanned, when the system overwrites the old passenger’s information with the newest passenger’s information.” The solution is still in early stages, and those that do not wish to share any additional information with the TSA can opt for the standard checkpoint screening for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Natalie Alms, Staff Writer for FCW, reports on the status of the Improving Digital Identity Act, which was originally introduced in 2020 and then recently re-introduced by a joint effort from representatives of both parties. The bill seeks to push the federal government into a bigger role in the digital identity space by providing opt-in identity validation services and creating a task force to evaluate best practices for digital identity credentials. Backers point to a <a href="https://fcw.com/digital-government/2022/09/over-45-billion-unemployment-paid-fraudsters-during-pandemic-watchdog-says/377572/">recent study</a> highlighting a significant increase in identity theft and fraud as the renewed need for this bill. Unfortunately Alms concludes that the bill is unlikely to make it to a vote as Congress’s next session will be tied up in bigger items like the 2023 federal budget.</p>

<p>[Mathieu Glaude] Earlier this year, there were manifestations against the vaccine passports and there was this whole rhetoric that people were using saying that the vaccine passports were a tool that the Government was putting in place to control and put surveillance over its citizens. These types of movements,&nbsp; specifically within the space of Digital Identity, just looking recently into the Quebec national assembly there has been a couple of different petitions with tens of thousands of people signing against Digital ID programs or even against being forced to use a wallet for Digital ID. Anyone familiar with the Canadian Digital ID in the public sector at least knows of the Saskatchewan Government Program following through in early 2022, which further deepened negative public sentiment around these types of programs which perhaps influenced, perhaps didn’t.</p>
<p>Then again, anyone familiar with the Digital Identity space knows the efforts going into preserving privacy principles and making sure they’re put into place, as well as other principles such as control agencies, equity, inclusion, security, transparency, and the list goes on.&nbsp; I think that this is also very well communicated within the digital identity community, but we seem to be having a tough time as a community explaining this more broadly to the public.</p>
<p>I hear many people say Governments need to do a better job at doing so, but I&nbsp; think it’s all of our role to do a better job at doing this. It’s not just the Government, it’s the community overall. If we do this correctly, we’re doing all of this to protect the rights of people through these tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conversation today is meant for us to have a discussion about all this and hopefully through it generate some suggestions that we can share with listeners on how to avoid the big brother rhetoric moving forward. Let’s start the conversation with the concept of misinformation, as a growing societal topic, which I think is blurring messaging and I do think in fact that misinformation is a big cyber security risk that gets in the way of protecting the rights of individuals and societies. If we’re not able to express our choice without being manipulated, it’s a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be interesting just to start with misinformation, because it’s one of the things blurring Digital ID communication.</p>
<p>How is your thinking on this misinformation, and how it has evolved over the past few years, maybe even more recently with Covid?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be interesting to start the conversation there.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] I would say it’s not just a Digital ID problem, I think this is a societal problem that transcends any kind of subject matter, we see it with elections, with Public Health and Covid was a great example. In my opinion, a lot of it just comes down to trust or trusted sources.</p>
<p>When I was growing up,&nbsp; the only way to get your news was through outlets such as CBC News, delivered by Peter Mansbridge, who was the ‘trusted source’.&nbsp; Now, we’re facing an information overload problem, which can be good in some ways – information is awesome – and the internet and social media have come out in the last 20-odd years, which is good for our collective knowledge of humanity. But with information overload comes a lot of other stuff that isn’t necessarily accurate, we have bots that are putting out some automated things and I think the challenge we have now is that there is so much content now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I look at my own Twitter or LinkedIn feeds, the algorithms are starting to dictate what bubbles up because you can’t possibly see it all so what you get is a snippet of some of the things that are going on. Guess what snippets you’re getting? You’re getting the ones with the most reaction, interaction or the most hate or love or whatever the case may be but the extreme reactions are the ones that will bubble up.</p>
<p>I think as humans, when I see misinformation on the internet, my first instinct is to want to correct it, I want to say ‘no, that’s not true’ but the way social media works the sheer interaction with that misinformation is what allows it to bubble up to the top that others see. So it almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, stuff gets out there and we naturally want to correct it, it gives it more visibility and so on. That’s kind of my general view of why it’s out there.</p>
<p>In terms of Digital ID specifically, I won’t go into Covid much. You know, maybe I will a little bit, without picking a side on the whole vaccine thing, I don’t want to, that’s another podcast by itself. I would say the mRNA vaccine, just the principle of it all is a perfect example of something that has been – the mRNA was not just invented you know, last year – it has been in the works for many years and there is a science behind it and so on so forth, but it became more well-known people put those four letters together for the first time in the general public since Covid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID is no different in that this has been researched, especially in Canada. I know going back decades on things like the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> and privacy respecting principles but the general public, just as with the vaccines, doesn’t know those little ins-and-outs, nuances, and all the minutiae that all of us have you know probably laboured through analysis paralysis for years and they have snippets of information. What happens with snippets, is that people tend to fill in their blanks and start drawing parallels to other things they may have read or heard about. The one that comes to mind in Digital Identity for me is the social credit system in China. This parallel opens up a whole can of worms and yes, that is one way to implement it. Is it the way that Canada is going to implement it? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>That is why we spent the last 10 or 15 years developing the principles to prevent that type of thing from happening. I think the rise of misinformation starts with the fact that we have so much of it, that some of the subject matter is so complex and our attention spans are so short that everything needs to be explained in 140 or 280 characters. The topics alone need way more time than that. It’s like the perfect storm of a whole bunch of things that come together to lead to this current state that we’re in.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I think it’s just simple for people and I guess based on what you’re talking about the algorithms that push things either one way or another but people I think more and more have found it easier to take sides you know good or bad when in reality no subject in the world is one thing or the other. People have been taken away from actually having discussions about topics so just saying that the Government is trying to control you with Digital Identity, it’s such an easy thing to say and to get behind and people have these existing thoughts about this whether it’s Covid or they thought that this was the case or whether it’s with the central bank and digital currencies, whatever the subject is. The simple messaging I think just sticks a lot more and pushes people to one side or another and you get like these conspiracy theories. It’s easy to say the government wants to control you and it’s easy to say that your telephone is listening to you and tracking data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think there is a misunderstanding of how the architecture of the internet works today and what the economic incentives are for different people today as well. It’s easy to say this without understanding the structure of it underneath. The challenge is how you explain the structure underneath without it getting too complicated for people to listen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] As humans, it’s easier to process simple (mis)information&nbsp; ‘your phone is spying on you without going further and understanding the role of the microphone, video, GPS, etc.</p>
<p>When you apply the analytical side to the logic side, obviously there’s a bit more that comes through, and I think that’s the other reason. There are two different personality types in the sense that there are people with intuitive reasoning and others with analytical type reasoning. Like me – and maybe it’s because of the field I’m in, cybersecurity – I just don’t trust anything by default so when I read something I don’t even feel comfortable re-tweeting or liking it or resharing until I know it’s legit. I need to debunk any information I consume before taking a stand, which is more my personality type.</p>
<p>Others will read and intuitively make some of these logical or not-so-logical intuitive leaps in the sort of ‘my phone is spying on me’ which I mean, it makes sense, and then take it from there. I think that the other thing is that we need to teach our society a bit more on the critical thinking side, I know it’s something I try to instill in my kid as well. If it looks or sounds funny, just ask a question or double-check.</p>
<p>A lot of the beauty of the information overload I referenced earlier, is that there is good information that you can go search for if you desire the truth. I think that’s the bigger challenge, which is how we interpret information and whether we take enough time to vet it to our satisfaction or not.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] Back to the Digital ID topic, having spent enough time in public sector Digital ID programs, there is a massive movement to protect the privacy of their citizens and the Government is committed to creating digital ideas of public good to protect the democratic rights of citizens. In the same way that the Government takes action to protect its sovereignty, it’s also taking action to ensure that citizens have more sovereignty over their lives, whether it’s just the day-to-day physical world or the digital world.</p>
<p>It is what it is, and we know why these conversations are happening, however, there are these massive movements that are happening throughout the world to protect the privacy and the democratic rights of people and in my opinion, the way they are being communicated is not as efficient as it should be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] Also, I think openness and transparency is always the solution when there is some sort of mistrust for whatever reason. Let’s be more open or overly open and transparent about what it is we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and what we’re not doing, which I think is just as equally important as what we’re doing. In these types of messaging, there is certainly an area for improvement and I think that where people have a mistrust – and not that I’m taking the side of the conspiracy theorist – but I do understand why people have a mistrust when an institution or&nbsp; Government has an attitude of ‘trust us, we’re looking at it’ rather than talking down, and ‘trust us we’ll do it’ a bit more of the let’s talk about what we’re doing. Let’s have a conversation about what we’re doing, this goes beyond identity, this goes with vaccines and other things as well. I heard this concept during Covid because of what happened with all of the misinformation about vaccines and such, that there was a psychology behind some of the stuff that gets announced; you’ve never heard terms like mRNA before and Digital Identity cases, SSI, or all these other things that get thrown around and by human nature, you’re standoffish bit but terms you don’t understand are terms you don’t know so you’re already defensive about it. If someone gives you a reason to be more defensive about it like ‘oh there’s a microchip associated with the vaccine’ it’s easier to believe because you’ve already got your backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term I heard during Covid – I forgot what article I read this in – but some doctor said something along the lines of what they called ‘pre-bunking’, meaning anticipating what type of false messaging might come out against the thing you’re trying to release. Almost pre-inoculate people to ‘here’s what it is, here’s what you might hear about this thing in the coming months or years, here’s what our answer to that is, and here is where we can ask more questions’. So then you set a tone with people who may be originally defensive, okay now I know what to look out for, and you give them little trigger warnings that may help. Now I don’t know if that’ll have worked with Covid, I’m sure there’s still going to be a subset of the population that believes a certain thing but I do always enjoy the concept of proactive communication.</p>
<p>Bringing it back to identity now, in terms of what we all can do better or what Government can do better, I think some of this pre-bunking of information of ‘what it is the country trying to do and what the country will not be doing’ because of ABC being privacy and consent and all these other principles that we just discussed to me you’re right, I think communication is a big part of it. The sooner the better in my opinion, but I’m that with all facets of life too so the more information the better, and give people a chance to understand it versus throwing it or making it seem it’s forced upon them.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I feel sometimes coming from the space, we’re so caught up on the standards and the tech and just the lingo that we use in our day-to-day lives that mean absolutely nothing to regular people, maybe focusing just on the end-user experience that you’re looking for perhaps is a better approach than talking about zero-knowledge proof or concepts that or even talking about what could go wrong in these programs is a good conversation to have. Just to say ‘this is what we think could go wrong and this is what we’re doing to combat that and I like your idea, the pre-bunking almost made me think of different open-source software projects. They’ll just do open calls to the dev communities every week, the type of thing that would be a nice thing to see with that approach of pre-bunking rather than just talking about how to scan a QR code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] That’s right because I think a lot of us in the field can already anticipate the types of questions or the types of concerns that might arise. There is no rocket science and we can see from implementations across the globe that there are some pros and cons to a lot of different countries’ implementations but we know this already. We should do this proactively and go out there and talk to people about our beliefs in Canada, and why it’s different. There are going to be some similarities and there will be some differences,&nbsp; the social credit thing is not happening in this country. For me to say that is one thing, but for us to all prove it collectively and demonstrate openly why that won’t be the thing is the other, and that’s what I think we’re lacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I wonder if we could draw parallels to the whole misinformation topic; it’s very difficult to establish what is more and more, so what is a fact versus what is an opinion and I think, our news channels have been bombarded with just opinionated things rather than facts. Different tech companies have taken it upon themselves to create a fact versus fiction thing and you’ll even see them start putting messages on their Tweets or on their podcasts or just to say, warning go check this other source if you want information about something. It feels at least in the information technology or the social media companies, there is perhaps a lack of I don’t know if regulation is the right word, or an oversight committee, or there’s a lack of governance where all of these siloed platforms are taking it upon themselves to say what’s true, what’s not true.</p>
<p>Is there a role for Government in there as well, and then is it a mix between Government and private sector?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I start to think about if that’s missing in the digital world today then what we’re talking about, of having these pre-bunking forums, it could be a similar type of impartial governance organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] That’s a really interesting question, I think there’s certainly a role for Government to help set some expectations on what we want in our country and I think our country needs to get rid of misinformation as well. The challenge with having the Government involved in it though is that the mistrust is sometimes with Government, so if a Government entity, let’s say hypothetically, was created to debunk and demystify some of the things that are out there, I still think there is going to be that inherent mistrust with a subset of the population anyway. So, to fully answer your question, I do think there’s a role for all entities to play because there’s mistrust everywhere in general. Some people don’t trust their banks, some people don’t trust their Government, some people don’t trust whatever insert name of a corner store here and I think the more people that are in the conversation, the better it is. I don’t think it’s just one’s role, but I do think everyone plays a part in it. It wouldn’t be out of the realm of the possible to have some entity at least, even a non-profit for argument’s sake, come in there and start debunking some stuff.</p>
<p>But it will be collective and don’t forget that only a certain percentage of the population is on Twitter, is on Facebook is on whatever, so the number of mediums that need to be either regulated or overseen are exponential almost. It seems to be that way, that there’s a new platform for everything so I think we have to be careful about how broad we go and what the perception would be if Government were to step in and regulate or set some rules around what can be communicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we start talking about free speech infringement and other things that go down a spiral as well so I think it’s a collective, rather than make it feel more ‘big brothery’ or even more perceived as ‘big brothery’ than it is now, to focus it more on a community conversation, including more people in the conversations as they happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] If I give a conspiracy, that’s the reason why a lot of this negative stuff is coming out in Digital Identity. </p>
<p>Is there are a lot of the big players that are influencing fake news and is that something you could buy into?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] Oh, interesting! So what do you mean by some of the big identity players?&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] Yeah identity players and big tech players that have silos, they manage a lot of identity data. Anyways is that something you could get behind?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir]&nbsp; I’m an optimist by nature man I think. I would also think everyone wants to do what’s best for, you know there’s a way for all these people who are currently managing these systems, to interoperate in a bigger ecosystem that will give them, and so from a capitalistic perspective, allow them to maintain whatever market share they have and now participate in something bigger. So I see more opportunity for them if there were to be an integrated ecosystem here versus the standalone business that they’re in now. If they were involved I’d say that’s pretty short-sighted because strategically if I were running these businesses, you’d want a bigger piece of the pie right, so I think the more participatory it can be, the more inclusion there is from these people that are in the field. The better it is for them, the better it is for us as citizens that we have a bit more direct knowledge of and access to and consent to the sharing of our information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] Switching gears a bit for anyone getting into the Digital Identity space, there’s a whole slew of standard bodies and different standards that get used and it’s just sometimes tough too, I guess it creates a barrier of understanding to certain people because there are so many different standards. They’re not always technically based on these standards, but there are so many different organizations, there are some that have support from different levels of Government and for example, seeing this a lot in European nation-states and also in the various provinces in Canada, where there is a big movement towards some of the W3C and Hyperledger standards,&nbsp; and obviously on the other side with the governance of the Pan Canadian Trust Framework being there as well. Then you also look at – just talking about Canada specifically- we have multiple levels of Government, say the federal, the provincial and the municipal, picking a non-international standard is not acceptable for a federal Government due to specific reasons.&nbsp; For example barring international trade, which you could get sued for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we make it easier for people to understand all of the different standards that are out there, and why they’re important?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe you could talk a bit about some of the leading ones which you think are mature enough and need to be better understood.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] That’s a really good question, so I think we have to start maybe at the beginning of why we even need standards in the first place and think what the role of standards is and how deep standards need to go because I think there’s a certain sweet spot there. I think standards are meant to ensure number one, consistency, reliability and interoperability, that we’re all holding everyone at the same level, whether that be technology, or the electrical outlets in your wall. I mean there’s a certain safety requirement in these, some of these other things. So from an identity perspective, I think the challenge is that it’s still early days even though I said we work on it for a few decades, it’s early days in the sense that technology is now catching up with some of those preliminary conversations. Also, I feel – and I’m going to age myself here – that we’re in a beta VHS&nbsp; moment or Blackberry/ iPhone if I want to be a bit more recent or whatever the case may be, but this goes back historically. There’s always these moments in time where you – there’s a way we are going fork in the road type of thing – in identity I think the key part right now is to find the standards that give us that common baseline that allow those things I said for before. I just don’t honestly care about technology right now, I care about whatever technology that jurisdictions will use in Canada, and let’s be honest it’s going to be multiple. Will they work well together number one, and will they have the same level of security reliability and keep our information private etc.? So I think that’s the key level we have to get to in terms of analogies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My analogy in the payments industry is that I don’t care if I have an Amex or a Mastercard or a Visa in my wallet. The thing always works when I go to restaurants unless they don’t accept one of them. What I mean is that machines tend to accept all of them. I can tap a debit, and I can tap a credit as a user of it all. I don’t need to understand the ecosystems and I trust that there is a standard that they’re all following that keeps my data and me protected to the same degree. If we can draw from that analogy in identity, I think we need to be at the same level there. I think the example I give of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> is perfect. Not on the standards front, but at least on the framework, principles and things that matter in the ecosystem. The <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/">CIO Strategy Council</a>’s Digital Trust and Identity standards as well is one of the ones that take it to that higher level, the principal level that’s in this country. Those are two that I’m well versed in for sure, just on past involvement. Then there are others in the technology side of things, W3C and others that are still evolving and I’m not saying any of those are perfect. The challenge we have right now is, do we wait for the standards to figure themselves out and we sit and do nothing, or do we experiment in a way right now where we’re seeing what works best with a willingness to pivot if something were to change downstream.</p>
<p>I think that’s the eternal debate that seems to live on in at least the public sector where it feels wasteful for sure to spend taxpayer dollars on experimentation that the principle seems backwards, but when you think about it, you need some of the experimentation to understand where you need to go next as well. I think we have to get past some of those humps, it does not have to be a 10-year 100 million dollar project, it could be a one or two-year pilot with a small investment and then a quick pivot at the end of a couple of years. I think it’s a mentality around it, where we may be waiting for perfection before starting anything but there is a danger too that our citizens aren’t getting any more patient and I don’t like the in-person stuff I want to go online and digital as fast as I can and I know the next generation is that as well, so it’s an interesting balancing act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I think at the end of the day the most successful capital allocators in the world, in the capitalist world, and it’s easy to name some of them, but it’s just they’ve been able to best place their dollars or their money into a mix of R&amp;D and growth things so you always need to have this R&amp;D going on so it feels if you’re looking to grow the economy and the prosperity of a nation you need to have good placement into R&amp;D. You named a couple, <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">PCTF</a> and <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/">CIO Strategy Council</a>. I tend to look more at these from at least one version of the PCTF than from a federal perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why should a citizen care about the PCTF and the work that’s happening within the CIO Strategy Council?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] It’s a good question. Do citizens care about the fact that the security or whatever, the electrical alliance has approved my plugs in the wall? Probably not. I think what’s important for them to care about is that these conversations are happening. Some of those principles we talked about earlier and the fact that this is not a social credit system. Well, how do you prove it? Look at some of the stuff that we’re putting out there in publishing on consent and privacy principles being first and top of mind, I think these types of things they don’t have to read or memorize any of these frameworks. I think they just have to be aware that these conversations are happening and it’s not just as I said earlier ‘trust us we’re good’ it’s a no, show and tell, here’s what we’re doing and here’s what the principles are that’s what’s the important part of those discussions. Is my mom going to be a part of any of the consultations? Probably not, but I think it’s important for them just to know that they’re happening rather than just again, that hiding behind a veil of ‘believe me, we know that’s good for you’, which is where I think the mistrust stems from.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] What would you say, Canada is doing good or better, or where other countries could take learnings from versus the other side as well?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there certain areas in the world under Digital ID programs, it could be standards, could be anything that you think Canada could learn from or perhaps do better, so maybe both sides.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] It’s a good question, so when I&nbsp; was, when I spent some time in Government, we were part of what was called the Digital nations of countries, a series of European and Asian countries in there and South American as well. Just leaders in the digital space and the feedback we got when was they were impressed with the work we were doing on the framework-type things, on the standard-type things, on making sure that these principles were well thought out before we dove too deeply and the challenge with our country too – and I won’t sugar coat it – is that we, our Government system is more complex than some other companies. We are countries, we have three levels of Government, it’s a Westminster model. Accountabilities are different, there are some countries in this Digital nations group everything is centralized and there’s authority. I’m not saying Digital ID is easy, but it’s certainly easier when you have the data in one authority or one jurisdictional control versus what we have is a bit more federated and that’s not an excuse as to why we’re late. It’s just more considerations of what we have to come up with, so I think, to answer the first brother question, a lot of good feedback on our willingness to try to break down some of these jurisdictional boundaries with some of these cross-jurisdictional frameworks, and the willingness to interoperate in the country for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The privacy respecting principles, the consent, the revocation of consent, all the things that we have been baking are well respected. I think the difference on the other side is that we are slower on implementation. Let’s just call a spade a spade, we have a couple of provinces that have got out to good head starts on the West there, and since then, I feel it’s a bit stagnant for the reasons we talked about, misinformation being one. Investment is another, if it’s important we dedicate the resources to it, if it’s not we don’t, and I feel we’re still on the fence as to how much investment this thing needs across the country. You know in terms of models to follow, the one I look to the most is the European Union itself and I bring them up because they have an interoperability challenge, they have whatever number of countries is in there that work together in an interoperable scheme that I guarantee you does not use the same technology in each country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can, if we can just take that model and just consider ourselves a mini well, union, in which we are provinces and territories, there’s no reason why we couldn’t do something similar. So I think there are a lot of good lessons to learn from those</p>
<p>implementations. Other countries are world-renowned for their regimes; Estonia I’m sure comes up a lot. Different circumstances led to why they had to come together after an incident back in 2007. Evolving from there and building it up from the ground up, I have done a fantastic job there and have set some really good principles for us to follow, including the notion of transparency by the way. So I think there’s a lot to learn from around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some mistakes have been made around the world as well, and we alluded to that earlier in terms of whether it be over a collection of biometric data or central storage of some of this biometric information that personally, as a cyber guy, makes me cringe. So I think learning the good and bad from around the world, there is no such thing as bad news. That’s a good approach, and I think it’s just a matter of balancing our willingness to innovate and drive a bit rather than getting stuck into a bit too much of the analysis paralysis at the beginning. That’s my assessment of where we’re at.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] There have been some brutal stories about biometrics and facial recognition that continue to happen as well and I think what’s scary about that is it’s one thing if our passwords get breached, we could just change our passwords and hopefully we could recoup our assets if our credit card number gets breached, you could cancel your card and there is a liability protection there, but you can’t change your biometric information, like your facial characteristics and I think it’s just a very touchy subject. What makes me uncomfortable, is that it’s hard to avoid them, you go into certain places, maybe not in your day-to-day but throughout life. The first time I was at an airport in the US and I was forced to do a facial scan and whatever, I felt a little uneasy about it. So I think this is one aspect that is used, authentication or security a lot of the time, but there are so many examples of frauds and data breaches and data being wrong here. That’s a bit of a tough area,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree and you talk about roles for the Government, there’s a role for Government right there which is to regulate how and when this information can be collected, used, stored etc. because that is a – I agree with you. We all know that pictures have been taken of us over the last number of years in various contexts whether it’s in a mall walking by or whatever, the airport or where the case may be and I think the lack of regulation or rules around what can be done with that information certainly one of the reasons why I’m not a big proponent of using biometrics as the ‘be all end all’. The issue is that the role of biometrics maybe needs to be discussed a bit in what role it plays like unlocking your phone for example, without storing the image as a one-time transaction. That’s one thing to store it and keep it for later and upload it to a number of different places for various usages, it’s another thing – and I certainly don’t have clarity when, where and how my biometrics are used in all these instances. So I agree with you, and think that is one of the areas that is going to be – there’s a lot of learning too that happens from around the world, either from breaches or whatever the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that goes back to our other comment there about information and how we can proactively communicate. The words facial verification and facial recognition are two very different things, and I think one-to-one or one-to-many are concepts that people openly talk about enough or fully understand. Even in our own space, how do we expect the average Canadian to understand that as well, so as part of what I said earlier about the pre-bunking, I feel this really a good topic to dive in on and explain what is, what could be used, for what you have to watch out for, what can still be done by other players in the country etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] It feels one of those that just people get impacted by the most because it’s just so personal, it’s not using a fingerprint to get onto my phone. It’s really my picture being taken, I have no clue what’s happening to it. A few years ago, we were working with a customer that was building a product aimed at folks in the firearms industry in the US, and you could imagine the type – not all – but there’s a big movement there, of just privacy, right, and these types of people whether they’re hunters or gun collectors. It was incredible to see the second that we did some user testing with facial verification software just the backlash that came from that. So it’s a bit of an interesting one. I think there’s been a lot of backlash even then, you said there’s been a lack of capital perhaps invested in some of the ID programs in Canada, but there are other areas in the world – the ID Me project in the US – there’s so much money that was thrown in there but then there was an incredible amount of backlash over their facial recognition technology.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] Absolutely and we’re not even touching – well that’s just the privacy concerns – we’re not even touching on some of the inclusion and diversity concerns that come along with some of these things as well, which I don’t want to downplay either. I think the challenge with the identity space – not in this country but around the world – is that you are dealing with the security and privacy information which obviously has to be inclusive and equitable for all to use. However, here we are creating almost a bunch of mini divides within a subject matter that has already divided enough. I think there are a whole bunch of anecdotes from around the world about darker skin colour, facial coverings or other things that would impact someone’s ability to use it. So I agree, that topic alone can be broken down into several different subtopics, all of which require going back to proactive messaging and good understanding around the world for sure.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I think facial recognition technology has proven to have a lot of biases and therefore, it’s often wrong and it takes away from equal opportunities for people in here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] That’s right, again going back to the word trust, all things that undermine trust and confidence in a system – and that’s what ultimately comes down to – if trust is undermined whether it be from information or lack thereof or whatever the case, or bias or whatever is the reason for it, you don’t get adoption. If you don’t get adoption, then what is this all for right? So we don’t just do this for the sake of doing this, it’s to provide a benefit and so for me, that adoption piece is really critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to get down to the nitty-gritty of what will prevent people from adopting, and how we can address that aspect of it because delivering it and having zero users, no one wins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I do think though, at the same time, the word trust is overused by a lot of technology solution providers, the trusted platform for this rather. I feel that the concept of trust is maybe misunderstood as well and self-claims about being trusted about something is maybe not going to help create trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] Agreed, and that’s a really good point actually because you can’t just self-assess or self-attest your trusted worthiness. It has to be proven. Same in real life, I can’t just tell you I’m honest and just lie to you all the time, you build that over time so I think that the building of that trust is important and I think you’re right, the word is overused by people that claim to be and then as we find out later, are not. Going back to the standards conversation, having standards to help attest to that trust or having third parties verify that trust, are all things that help build that confidence in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] The usage of zero trust is an abused term nowadays as well, and for yourself, the cybersecurity expert, I’m sure you see it getting abused as well.</p>
<p>What are some misconceptions about zero trust, or how does it get overused wrongly?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] I want to be honest, I love the concept of zero trust. It’s really great, I think the word or the title is the worst title because it’s so negative. There are so many negative connotations from zero trust again, almost makes you think well, I should trust no one and it makes you think you don’t trust your users or you don’t trust this and that. I meant that’s the fundamental principle it’s based on, but not the right message to send. It’s that we want to make sure that you’re doing what you should be doing and nothing more, nothing less. Number one, I wish there was a more positive spin on the name but it starts with the principle itself. Let’s be honest, it’s nothing new, it’s applying the oldest principle; security is the principle of least privilege. You get access to the things you should have access to, nothing more, nothing less. That’s in the CISSP book item, number one. This is the first principle you learn. Now what we’ve done over time is different buzzwords and different implementations and network access control with NAQ was a big thing when I was coming up the ranks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just an evolution of that, now it’s more based on knowing who you are making, knowing what identity or sorry, what device you’re coming from and having the right access and monitoring. There are a lot of things that came with it, so the principle I think is sound. I think some of the misconceptions around it, is that it isn’t something you just buy and implement and be done with. It’s not a product and you may see some product labels out there that say zero trust on it. To me, it’s more of a philosophy that’s how I would characterize it. It’s a philosophy, an operating model or whatever you want to call it, but have this principle that we want to make sure the right people have the right access to the right data, at the right time. Then the technology enables that so I think that people trying to treat it as a project or something you can buy, that’s not what it is, it’s something you have to buy into and then work towards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the second part of that is it sounds – and this is typical security stuff – as if we make it sound so shiny like it’s a silver bullet that is going to solve all the problems but that makes it sound really hard and expensive and enterprise and multi-year. I wish that was all gone as well because I don’t think it needs to be as complicated as we make it to be. I think yes, it’s a multi-year program but there are incremental things you can do to step towards it as well. You could start with individual identity, you could start with MFA, you could start with device. I think you can move very slowly as you go along the chain here characterizing it as the giant behemoth that some people do, does it a disservice as well. It makes it sound more intimidating. Or whatever the case may be. Those are a couple of things that came to mind other than the term itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing I’ve heard is that this can just be more secure and it’s going to be harder for me as a user. Personally, I actually think it’s going to be easier as a user to know that I am ‘going to be bothered’ I use air quotes here sorry for those who can’t see, ‘by additional authentication prompts all the time’. The truth is you’ll be bothered when you need to be, when the risk level is nil, you won’t be bothered by all the stuff you’re being bothered with right now. Our problem with security right now is we have this very one-size-fits-all approach to identity; this your thing and if you’re enabling MFA it’s for all, if you’re making something it’s for everything and all things. Data doesn’t work that way, data works in a way that some stuff is open, some stuff is not, and some stuff is classified. I think identity rules need to be commensurate with the type of data you’re accessing now that the data resides in multiple locations like cloud, on prem or other. A data-centric approach to accessing the data is much more productive than a network-centric approach to it. I think it’s more in the way you look at the field versus what I think gets sold. Sometimes it’s the word gets overused and this is typical industry behaviour to be honest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I was at a large cyber security conference in France a few weeks ago and it’s just incredible the number of companies that are providing zero trust or cyber security solutions. The industry is growing like crazy, there’s a lot of money to be made in cybersecurity with these technology solution providers. I wonder at a certain point if it’s just without fundamentally changing the architecture, and you alluded to data-driven rather than network-driven, but if you’re just trying to add more and more solutions on top of bad architecture, how much better is it actually going to get? So when we talk about self-sovereign identity, we talk about it from more of a data-driven approach. For me, the fact that your data resides with you is zero trust. Really, I have control over what I’m doing with it there’s nothing without my knowledge that is happening with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think categorizing the self-sovereign architecture as zero trust is the right categorization?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] Interesting, I never thought of it that way. I wouldn’t characterize anything as zero trust, to be honest with you, but I do think ‘zero trust enabled’ or ‘enabling a zero trust experience’ or something along those lines, where it’s a part of a bigger series of components that lead to that zero trust ecosystem. So if we all did a better job of saying what our role is in the zero-trust paradigm, that might make it resonate a bit better. The more we go on the lens of this thing that is zero trust part, the more we drive that problem of over-extending the word. What it is, is rather a philosophy or philosophical view that I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] You also mentioned they are often big implementations but you could have logical steps or milestones you’re hitting throughout this process. We could be talking about the public or private sector here, but in any Digital ID conversation it seems there’s way too much conversation around the technical track and it differs, I guess, between the public and private sector and how you would go about it. Maybe you could discuss that a little bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q1: What are some of the different tracks that you need to get in place to ensure that all of these principles that we’re talking about, and ensuring that we’re doing this the right way to not impact privacy?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q2: And if these other principles are being done correctly, what are some of these different tracks beyond the technical track that need to simultaneously run in either the public or private or both?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] &nbsp;I would over-simplify my answer here to people, process, and technology. I think all three are equally important, but you’re right in that you can have the best tech in the world but if your process, your entry and exit process in your organization is garbage and your identities stay enabled for x number of years after someone leaves, then your technology is useless because the process is the weakest link in that chain. Similarly, if your people aren’t trained properly on how to conduct and implement some of the processes that I just mentioned, you’re in the same boat as well so I always look at these things as a triangle of all three that need to work together for any technology implementation to work properly. To me, that is the bigger risk, the technology pieces. The vendors will tell you, there are a lot of people that will sell you something tomorrow that’ll enable zero trust, but all of it is useless unless those other two legs of the stool so to speak that are adequately addressed as well. That’s my bigger concern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I say start incrementally, it has nothing to do with technology to be honest with you. It’s more about ‘let’s figure out just what is your current lay of the land’&nbsp; even if you had the best tech in the world, would it do what you want?&nbsp; Are you making sure that people have the right and how do you assign access today, how do you track when people are leaving or arriving or changing groups?&nbsp; The longer you stay in an organization, the more rights you accumulate, that’s just the nature of the beast. How are you making sure that doesn’t happen before you start diving into some of the technological concerns? I’m a technology guy and what I hate the most about technology is that it’s always sold as the thing that solves all the problems when really it’s – and I’m going to generalize here and I hate generalizing – but it’s almost the easiest part all the time because you can buy the thing and implement the thing, the other things that the people the change management and the procedural updating, the business process transformation stuff that’s the sticky stuff that usually creates havoc in the technology implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] So I guess going into a Government and trying to build a Digital Identity strategy you’re looking at the legislation track and you’re looking at a regulatory track. These things are significantly more important to any of these programs being successful and significantly more important than the technology side of things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where is the current state of things? Maybe we could use provincial Governments in Canada as an example with legislation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think they’re all on different playing fields, but what are some of the conversations that are being had about these processes and the people?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] I think there are a few provincial ones, and again, going back to our Westminster model of Government, we have some federal ones. In fact, I think it was just last week if I’m not mistaken, some announcements around bill C-27 that include some more privacy implications in there as well.&nbsp; I don’t want to profess to be an expert at it, I just saw the news release but I know that the feds are working on things that will enhance at least some of our outdated national legislation that hasn’t been touched in several years. I know some of the problems have done some work, with Quebec being the most recent with what is it, bill 64 I believe, that is more in line with I think what we’re seeing with let’s call it the ‘godfather of legislation and privacy’ of the GDPR in Europe. The challenge I think we’ll see in our country is that we have provinces and federal Governments on different timelines, different maybe levels of ambition on some of these bills. So we may inherently be creating some disparity amongst – and it sucks on the vendor side of things – where you now have four five six different pieces with different requirements that you have to align to, and what ends up happening here for being honest, is we just align to the highest watermark because we know if it hits the high water mark it’s good enough for everyone else.</p>
<p>I think the landscape right now is just that, it’s finding out what the ambition is from each of these different jurisdictions and if arguably – I’m going to make this up here – but the bill 64 to Quebec is the higher watermark we work toward and we know that we’re going to be good for the rest of the country as well. On the federal side, we do have to respect the jurisdictional boundaries and what the mandates of the federal Government is and provincial and such, but I do think what the federal legislation can do is set at least a low – not a low bar but a baseline – it’s a better way to say a baseline level, for what we need to expect from all implementations from privacy and security.</p>
<p>I saw I think bill C-27 also includes algorithmic bias if I’m not mistaken, but these very important things that need to be addressed just to keep those conversations going I think. The other thing historically is, legislation is not easy, you don’t just change that overnight this stuff takes time as well and it’s really important that we&nbsp; – and it’s easier said than done i will say – that it’s future-proof, that it’s not as prescriptive that locks us into something that doesn’t work in five years time it needs to be more</p>
<p>principle-based and future-proof so that as technology evolves rapidly we’re not shooting ourselves in the foot and preventing something else from happening. That’s the challenge in being a regulator and legislator, they know it full well but I think the right minds are thinking about it certainly and we just have to make sure that we drive up collective consistency across the country.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] To comment about shooting yourself in the foot. I feel often there is a trend where it’s easier to pass regulations than to remove regulations and so you pass regulations and that at a certain point you’re starting to create so much red tape all over the place because it’s tough to navigate and actually innovate and create value because there’s so much in there. So it’s a tricky balancing act to for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] There was a funny anecdote when I was in the Government and I&nbsp; misquoted – so don’t don’t take this exactly – but it was something along the lines of the number of times the word facts is mentioned in legislation. When the thing was written sure it made sense to fax things, but in 2022 I don’t know when the last time I saw a fax machine or if the people that are younger than me will even know what a fax machine is. That type of codification is what you have to avoid because it then limits you down the road. I think finding out the right principles you want to follow, the outcomes you want to generate and the behaviours you want to influence or encourage is what the legislation needs to set out to do and nothing more, to allow&nbsp; innovation to happen within those guard rails.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] If I could use another trifecta or triangle, I think one of the challenges is how do you prioritize privacy control but then also convenience. That’s something that you don’t want to get in the way of convenience or innovation in legislation either but it’s tricky. This is why it’s interesting to look at some of the programs that are happening elsewhere in the world to see where the learnings or where the good learnings and bad learnings could come from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] With any legislation comes, and with any honesty statement, comes unintended consequences as well and that reaction you mentioned earlier that we do have to become – and I hate this word – but more agile when it comes to legislative reform and that we cannot wait 20 years if we see something that’s going well, so there is an opportunity to nip these things in the bud sooner than later and I think that there needs to be a stance our regulators take as well and being willing to pivot when the pivot happens. Technology moves way too quickly for us to modernize these things and as regularly as we want to. Just leaving that room to pivot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I think is equally important and one of my – as I was preparing for this, one of the things I felt we could probably do better as a community is lower the use of buzzwords such as agile and zero trust and all these things just make me laugh.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] That’s true that’s why I prefaced it with I hate this word but I get you.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] When we talk about that we’re spending a lot of time designing these programs and making sure that it’s not impacting the freedoms and rights of citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are some things that we’re ensuring or that we’re doing and or not putting into place that citizens perhaps should know so that they don’t feel they’re getting pushed into something that they necessarily don’t want to do?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] I think the word mandatory comes up a lot and we heard it with vaccines when things get mandatory people get a little antsy about it and the one thing I can say with 100 certainty in Canada and Digital Identity, is that it will not be mandatory in the sense that you will have options. We are not in a position where we’re trying – and again – to debunk some of the myths around tracking or whatever.</p>
<p>This is about empowering citizens, so if you want to use it, if you want better, faster and more secure, easier and more efficient access to services you are welcome to use it. If you wish to go wait in line for an hour at Service Canada or wherever the case is, fill your boots.&nbsp;It’s the same as the banking industry, I think my parents still do telephone banking. All the more power to them. Personally, I do not want to do telephone banking, I’m more than happy to do it from the comfort of my desktop or phone, but I appreciate the optionality. That I think is a really good principle in all walks of life to be honest with you. Specifically, in Digital Identity, this is for options and this is to empower you, and if you don’t feel empowered by it, don’t use it. To me, what I think will eventually happen – just my own opinion – is that it will be eventually framed in a way just as credit cards were, as other things that have evolved from paper to plastic to online and have been in that when your life becomes easier, when you feel more in control when you feel you have the transparency you need to trust it you will use it. That’s human behavior, is to circumvent inefficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now a lot of our inefficiency is based on us waiting in line and Covid certainly spoiled me, to try to avoid human contact. It sounds really bad, I mean human contact waiting in lines. I want things delivered to me for the rest of my life and delivered to me when I want it. I get a movie when I want it, get my food when I want it, get my Uber when I want. I do think services will go down that route but in the way that people want them to be delivered. Freedom is really important to maintain so that people have peace of mind and they can go at their own pace because when they do, I just find there’s a lot more comfort and acceptance and willingness to want to adopt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing that I want to add as well, this goes back to the principle of inclusion, is that whatever is built or will be built in this country has to be inclusive, not just gender or race or anything else but I mean inclusive in general. We have a digital divide in the country as it is, we take internet access for granted and we still don’t have drinking water for our entire country much less internet access. So I think, we have some foundational infrastructure type of things that we need to address as a nation to make sure that everyone feels included. The last thing I want is for the haves to have Digital Identity for example and the have-nots to feel more have-nots and then creating a bigger divide. For me, a successful Digital Identity implementation allows some of the more underprivileged or underrepresented groups to get better, faster and more efficient access to things they may not have had before. Maybe they can apply for a job faster, maybe they can get a loan faster or a rental property and without maybe being subject to as much discrimination. I think those principles of optionality and inclusion are non-negotiable in any sort of implementation in this country.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] That’s a tremendous point and even just yesterday, I saw – and we’re recording this on June 30th 2022 – so just yesterday on the 29th, I saw an article come out on CBC Saskatchewan, where the Saskatchewan privacy commissioner was calling out for the development of an optional Digital ID. I think the word option and optionality has now been inserted into the conversation and I think that is something that needs to be in there because it is not being pushed on people, it’s being put into place to make people’s lives better with all of these privacy-preserving principles that we’ve been talking about. However, if you don’t want to use it, then don’t use it. If I want to keep receiving my statements in the mail for my credit card I could still do it.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] You bet and I think that’s a very Canadian principle as well and that’s one where I think going back to the other question about what other countries are in respect to where we’re going, I think that’s a big one as well, and I think we do that part right. It will be one of those things that will gather a snowball moment over time, and that’s okay that none of this stuff happens overnight. I have no problem if we start off with hypothetically age verification, and nothing more. That will be great and then for those of us who are still fortunate to get carted at the liquor store, you go and do your age verification and you don’t have to show your piece of plastic that has your name and your address and your height and your weight and whether you wear glasses and all these other attributes that drive me nuts that we share so freely</p>
<p>right now because that is the way our ecosystem is built. So starting off with something small, or a small win, and just getting a little bit of adoption I think is the right way to go and again keeping that principle of optionality so you can come on board when you want to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I also think just focusing on those interactions that you’ve described;&nbsp; if you’re purchasing alcohol at a liquor store, just talking about that interaction rather than talking about credentials and security, it’s an easier place to start and it’s where the value for people is. When they need to prove something about themselves, that is an endpoint right there. Where there’s someone that needs to verify or there’s a reliant party. Just focusing on what that improved experience is going to look like is a better way to start, than trying to explain Digital Identity or credentials to people.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] &nbsp;Agreed. I think it’s that old-fashioned what’s in it for me’ message and if you explain what’s in it for them, if it’s more convenient for them they’ll use it. If it’s not, they won’t. Humans are very straightforward creatures that way and I never thought I’d see the day where my parents are using smartphones and using their fingerprints or whatever to log in but what it came down to is, would you rather type a complex&nbsp; password with your thumbs or would you like to use your fingerprint which will work and gets to the thing faster? And I think you’re right, is explaining what’s in it for them is a great way to start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s digital world we are surrounded by identifiers around us — our email id, phone number, twitter handle, youtube handle etc. These are the identifiers we “rent” from the parties providing the services rather than “own”. This debate on where the ownership of identifiers lies is where decentralized identifiers come in&nbsp;picture.</p> What is a Decentralized Identifier? <p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are created, owned, and controlled by the same entity, giving individuals more control over their identity and businesses more control over their data. This ownership of the DID can be proved using cryptography. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs allow entities to control the privacy of their information, including minimal, selective, and progressive disclosure of attributes or other&nbsp;data.</a></p><p>Decentralized Identifiers have 4 properties that make them indispensable:</p>  It is a persistent identifier — You can keep it as long as you need&nbsp;it  It is resolvable — You can look it up to discover&nbsp;metadata  It is cryptographically verifiable — You can prove control over it using cryptography  It is decentralized — No centralized registry or organization controls&nbsp;it   Decentralized vs. Centralized Identifiers <p>The truth is, depending on the situation you might not care if an identifier is decentralized!</p><p><a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes">GS1 provides a valuable service managing and distributing barcodes for products</a>. Barcodes are all the same type of centralized identifier, which makes them easy to understand and use broadly. It’s not a problem if a barcode on a loaf of bread is a centralized identifier.</p><p>The problem with centralized identifiers is that they offer little privacy or control, which matters for both personal information and business information that needs to be authentic and traceable.</p> Centralized identifiers:   Rely on a single body to validate your information. If Google goes bankrupt or stops working, I lose access to every website where I validate my identity using my Google username and password.  Needlessly expose information. When I use my driver’s license to verify my age, I don’t need the verifier to also know my height or&nbsp;address.  <p>As we think of scenarios to evaluate the need for centralized identifiers vs. decentralized identifiers we must ask ourselves these questions:</p>  How much control do we want on the digital life of the person and thing to which an identifier is&nbsp;given?  What privacy trade-offs are we ready to&nbsp;make?  How much security is good enough for the situation in consideration?  How is this related to the identity of the person or thing to which an identifier is&nbsp;given?   Benefits of Decentralized Identifiers <p>By gaining the ownership of the identifiers that we control and own, we&nbsp;can:</p>  Create persistent communication across informational transactions in a human readable&nbsp;format.  Prove ownership on assets and exercise the power to authorize or delegate actions to other parties in a verifiable manner.  Digitally sign transactions or documents rooted in a trusted data source, with an identity you&nbsp;control.  Port the identity from one service to&nbsp;another.  <p>As we build the new trust layer of the internet, I strongly believe that the choice of who controls the identity should be with the individual or the organization in focus rather than in the hands of platforms and services that are today playing the role of the Identity Issuers or Identity Verifiers. Decentralized Identifiers are a critical piece in enabling this&nbsp;vision.</p> DIDs in Supply&nbsp;Chain <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#abstract">Transmute team is proud to be one of the editors of the Editor and Author of the Decentralized Identifiers 1.0 standard at&nbsp;W3C.</a></p><p>We have been working with large enterprises and regulators, especially<a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/ace/whats-new-innovation"> US DHS-CBP to enable transparency and authenticity in cross border trade and supply chain logistics</a> transactions through the use of <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-tech-101-verifiable-credentials-use-cryptography-to-secure-digitization-5bfc74cf0a1b">Verifiable Credentials</a> and Decentralized Identifiers.</p><p>The advantage of DIDs in supply chain comes into focus with questions regarding supply chain transparency and visibility, especially when many commodities are created from a wide array of raw materials, components, and parts. What is the origin of each of the multiple components in a single good, such as a cell phone? Who manufactured them? Who assembled them? DIDs can answer these questions authentically when multiple controllers inherit control over the DID throughout the supply chain. If DIDs are assigned to individual parts, and actors along the supply chain gain control over these identifiers, an aggregate picture of who created what can be constructed.</p><p>Assigning DIDs to commodities and each individual component within finished goods would provide unprecedented visibility into how things are made, allowing key stakeholders and end-users confidence to assert and assess the quality, origins, and marketing truthfulness of goods. Imagine being able to resolve a DID for a diamond in a ring and seeing exactly where the diamond was mined and if it was ethically sourced.</p><p>Sapan Narang, Director of Product, pushes the boundaries of what is possible with a rich blend of experiences across industries and a deep understanding of exponential technologies.

				<p>The convenience, optionality and accessibility that fintech brought to money is happening to the archaic, paper-based world of personal identity. Identity today is where financial services were 15 years ago—and, therefore, represents one of the largest opportunities of this generation.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Like fintech before it, IDtech is making brand new product experiences possible for the first time. And building IDtech products is easier now than it’s ever been. The surge of IDtech products being developed will bring the identity and finance ecosystems back into sync and lead to scores of incredible new startups. Finally, IDtech will enable any company to become an identity company by layering identity capabilities into existing products.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>As our lives become increasingly digital, bringing identity off of paper and into the 21st century is important—but it’s critical it’s done in the right way: by using user-centric, portable, private and interoperable technology. The future of digital identity will be driven by the growth of IDtech products.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Intro to IDtech: How Decentralized Identity Will Be Adopted 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb">Link to the article on Medium</a><br><br>The second piece examines four potential paths that identity technology could take to be adopted and settles on what we believe to be the most viable: innovators building great products.<br><br>Here are some highlights from this post:</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>

				<p>If decentralized identity technologies are developed without achieving widespread end-user adoption, did it actually accomplish anything?</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>The way to achieve adoption is simple (albeit challenging to execute): the key is&nbsp;lots of well-executing teams building useful products. “IDtech” is a term to talk about that very thing.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>While well-intentioned, all the academic analysis, decentralized governance, value chain mapping, or market sizing in the world won’t get us any closer to SSI adoption. Solid product work is what will get us there—researching low-friction UIs, building sustainable business models, baking interoperability in, and iterating quickly are all examples of good product work. And this needs to be done by lots of people in lots of industries and lots of use cases. 1,000 nimble teams taking products to market will teach us so much more than 10 “queen bee” companies ever would.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>IDtech is the name we’ve begun using to describe the organization-driven, bottom-up adoption motion. It gives us a term to describe&nbsp;products&nbsp;instead of philosophies, initiatives, concepts, or technologies. If a fintech product helps you manage your money, an IDtech product helps you manage your identity and data.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Self-sovereign identity will be adopted as thousands of innovators launch IDtech products that solve real problems for users.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Has SSI’s Identity Problem Been Solved? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/has-ssis-identity-problem-been-solved-2d33490315ae">Link to the article on Medium</a><br><br>The third piece clarifies how all of these terms relate, and when to use terms like SSI, Web5, IDtech, Reusable Identity, and Authentic Data.<br><br>Here is a summary of quotes from the post:</p>

					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>SSI stands for “self-sovereign identity” — a new kind of standardized, user-controlled digital identity. But a host of other terms are used to describe the same thing — like “decentralized identity” and “self-managed identity,” and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rileyparkerhughes_a-year-ago-i-wrote-a-blog-post-link-in-activity-6864046138027331584-i5rE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">none have emerged victorious</a>. </p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>IDtech refers to&nbsp;products that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they need.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Web5 is a new term — but much has been said about it already. On the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/">homepage</a> of TBD, they describe it as “an extra decentralized web that puts you in control of your data and identity.”</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Reusable identity refers to people holding “interoperable identity credentials” (<a href="https://liminal.co/reports/market-opportunity-for-reusable-identity/">source</a>) that are broadly accepted and authenticate-able in real time, reducing the need to re-verify people and resulting in easier-to-access and lower-cost services.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Authentic or Verifiable Data: SSI produces data that is&nbsp;authentic (meaning “of undisputed origin; genuine”) which is slightly more accurate than&nbsp;verifiable (meaning “able to be checked or demonstrated to be true, accurate, or justified”).</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Our goal at Trinsic is to make the world more accessible by empowering teams to build amazing identity products. IDtech is the term to describe the product/application layer that is emerging on top of the concepts, technologies, and paradigms we’ve spoken about herein.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>When talking about the technology or architecture of a product, I’ll continue to use web5, web3, or web2 as shorthand,&nbsp;despite not loving the “webX” framing. And I’ll use reusable identity, decentralized identity, and self-sovereign identity as high-level terms to describe the ideology driving the change in the identity market, depending on the audience I’m speaking to. And when I’m talking about the end result, or the component parts of an IDtech solution, particularly for relying parties, I’ll speak to authentic/verifiable data.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>As I’ve stated before, IDtech is the new Fintech.

<p>In October 2022, Simon Wood, CEO of Ubisecure, presented our vision for the future of digital identity at the Houlihan Lokey Tech Leadership Summit in New York. The vision, in short:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The future of digital identity: the ability to combine strongly authenticated individual identities with highly assured organisational identities to show who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have to represent them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Simon talked about a world where individuals have complete control over personal data and can easily prove their identity to access services and products and critically, be able to digitally represent their organisations.</p>
<p>This post covers the key points covered in the presentation, and explains how Ubisecure’s recent years of experience as the leader in LEI (Legal Entity Identifier) issuance has set the stage for our future vision.</p>
<p>The vision is broken down into three key points.</p>
<p>1. We must ensure that individuals are authenticated in a secure manner and that their identities are protected from identity fraud.</p>
<p>2. We also need highly assured organisation identity. It is essential to know that the claims made regarding the organisation are valid.</p>
<p>3. We can then join both identity types, to enable users to express who they are, who they represent, and the rights they have when representing their respective organisations. Conversely, organisations can challenge and verify these claims.</p>
<p>For any vision to have a valuable future there has to be a strong return associated with it. The value of this vision has already been proven, albeit at a local, not global level.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ubisecure previously deployed an identity management platform with multi-tier delegation capabilities to the Finnish government. The platform linked individual and organisation identities, allowing individuals to represent their organisations, or delegate that representation to other individuals or other organisations. Public stats show that just over 400,000 organisations were using the platform across 104 different online government services. One of those services was the tax office in Finland, and that tax office was able to show a 99% cost reduction through moving to online service versus having physical points of presence.</p>
<p>Simon explained at the event: “The move to online for the tax office was enabled through the ability for individuals to express who they were, who they represent, and the rights that they had when representing them. Coupled with that, the ability to delegate those rights through a chain, that’s where that value came from. That’s why we see this future vision of digital identity in combining that individual and organisation capability as a highly valuable place to be, to create massive efficiencies and reduce fraud.”</p>
<p>Now, the Finnish example is something that’s already happened. So how does this represent the vision? The limitation with the Finnish solution is that it’s delivered in a closed ecosystem. The strongly authenticated individuals are derived from the Finnish national ID, be that through bank ID or mobile ID. The organisation identity is coming directly from the business registry in Finland, essentially creating the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/state-of-identity-trusting-individuals-digital-right/" title="trust anchor">trust anchor</a>. To scale this concept beyond Finland, we need to establish an open system that utilises global identities.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’re now at a point in Ubisecure’s evolution where we can take our unique combination of capabilities and enable this solution to scale globally. How do we do that? Let’s map back to that vision:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The vision requires globally available, strongly authenticated identities. Fortunately, we’re now at a point in time where reusable identities are prevalent. There are dozens of digital identity schemes throughout Europe, ranging from Government identities to mobile IDs. Where such frameworks do not exist, there are mature real-time identity proofing solutions that bring inclusivity to the growing digital identity ecosystem. We also seeing the rise of “networks of networks” like the European eIDAS 2.0 and on a global scale, schemes like GAIN.</p>
<p>The Ubisecure CIAM platform supports all identity protocols. Our broad capabilities allow us to support “the old, the new, and the strange” both in terms of protocols and applications. Over many years focusing on Europe we have been enabling organisations to connect reusable identities to applications, especially in the Nordics, arguably the most advanced digital identity ecosystem in the world.</p>
<p>Next, the vision requires globally available, highly assured organisation identities. Again, we’re at a point in time where such identities now exist, thanks to the G20 and the Global LEI Foundation launching the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/knowledge-base/what-is-an-lei-code/">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a>. The LEI is the only global, standardised and open-access organisation identifier available.</p>
<p>Because organisation identity is so important to our vision, Ubisecure undertook the accreditation to become an approved LEI Issuer back in 2018. We launched RapidLEI as an LEI issuance service, built from the ground-up on a technology platform focused around automation, ease of use, and data accuracy. We also built a global partner network of Registration Agents and Validation Agents, including several of the world’s largest banks, to make registering LEIs more accessible for legal entities of all sizes and in all regions. As a result we are now the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/stats/">world’s number one issuer of LEIs</a>.</p>
<p>Our leadership position gives us ready access to globally available, highly assured organisation identities.</p>
<p>The broad support for both individual and organisation identity now enables the Ubisecure unique value proposition with a combination of CIAM and LEI that’s delivered without border limits, globally.</p>
<p>This brings us full circle and we come back to the opening part of our vision. We take the front-end identity provisioning from our LEI services, where we can ensure the availability of highly assured open access organisation identities. And the back-end identity management capabilities of the CIAM platform to allow us to understand, connect and mediate strongly authenticated individuals.</p>
<p>As those components come together, we deliver a high value Identity &amp; Access Management service, delivering the ability to express who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have in representing them.</p>
<p>If you are planning to utilise IAM to deliver real business value to your organisation, do <a title="get in touch">get in touch</a>. We’ll be happy to discuss whether Ubisecure is a good solution for your current and future projects.</p>

				  The primary function of a government is to provide services that an individual could not easily provide for themselves; these services typically include infrastructure, safety (firefighters / military / police force), and the focal point of this article, identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Trust is important. I don’t think that will come as a shock to anyone. What might be surprising is how many opportunities there are in a day, or even a single interaction, to break that trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Picture yourself purchasing an age-restricted item at a shop, a multiple-step process that, typically, involves you handing over your ID to prove you are of legal age to purchase the item. The vendor has to trust that you are the legitimate owner of the ID and that the ID itself is not fraudulent. You, as the consumer, have to trust that the vendor is properly licensed and able to sell you the item and that what is inside is the item on the label and safe to consume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This interaction is one that many of us take for granted, particularly in higher income countries where regulations are in place governing these types of transactions. But this is by no means easy or inexpensive for governments to accomplish. As recently as 2017, the World Health Organization reported that as many as <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2017-1-in-10-medical-products-in-developing-countries-is-substandard-or-falsified">one-in-10 medical products in developing countries is substandard or falsified.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The problems Governments are turning to Decentralized Identity to solve&nbsp;</p>
<p>As many aspects of our lives have become more digital, services have moved online, which has created many opportunities to fake identity. According to identitytheft.org, <a href="https://identitytheft.org/statistics/#:~:text=There%20is%20an%20Identity%20Theft%20Case%20Every%2022%20Seconds&amp;text=Experts%20believe%20that%20these%20cases,a%20bigger%20issue%20for%20Americans.">identity fraud has increased over the past two years by 70%.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that the internet evolved without a verification layer for people, and the way we manage identity verification online makes it easy for information to be faked or “phished.” The need to verify who you are online and who you are interacting with is driving governments to look at verifiable credential and digital wallet technology. These verifiable credentials would replace paper documents that people are already using, such as a government-issued driver’s license or passport, with a couple key factors that make them more appealing than their paper counterparts.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are privacy preserving by design and cryptographically secure. Privacy- preserving means that with a verifiable credential driver’s license you would be able to choose to share only a portion of the data stored on the credential — such as sharing just your age or name without sharing your driver’s license number, address, or any other personal details you would rather keep to yourself. Being cryptographically secure refers to verifiable credentials being nearly impossible to fake, with the verifiers being able to automatically check every document.</p>
<p>Let’s return to our example of purchasing an age-restricted item. With a customer presenting a verifiable credential to prove their age, the store owner would have the assurance that the credential has been issued by a recognized authority, hasn’t been tampered with, and belongs only to the bearer. All of these are instantly verifiable — and in ways that protect the customer’s privacy. Similarly, the item being purchased can be verified with a credential showing its proof of origin and its journey across a supply chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driving Factors<br>Change on this scale takes a great deal of coordination, time, and money; so, it is important to be clear about the benefits from switching to decentralized identity solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Library of Congress, as of 2018 “<a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USPTO-Counterfeit.pdf">counterfeiting is the largest criminal enterprise in the world</a>, with domestic and international sales of counterfeit and pirated goods totaling between an estimated $1.7 trillion and $4.5 trillion a year — a higher amount than either drugs or human trafficking.” By implementing verifiable credentials, governments can reduce the presence of counterfeit goods in the marketplace. This will do two things: One, keep the public safer as counterfeit goods can <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bootleg-alcohol-poisoning-deaths-istanbul-turkey/#:~:text=Deaths%20from%20illegally%20brewed%20alcohol,separate%20incidents%20in%20India%27s%20northeast.">lead to sickness or death</a>; and two, improve tax collection, as with fewer illicit products being an option governments can start to claw back some of that $1.7 to $4.5 trillion as customers return to the legitimate market place to spend their money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are scalable. Unlike your passport or driver’s license, which is renewed at fixed intervals, a verifiable credential can be updated whenever more data or an additional service needs to be added. An example of this is the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">Aruba Travel Credential</a>, which was implemented to give travelers an easy way to prove their health status to the government so they could travel to the island in the height of the pandemic. The credential could be quickly updated to account for changes in testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity blockchains are sustainable. As <a href="https://indicio.tech/identity-blockchains-and-energy-consumption/">Indicio has noted</a>, blockchains for identity are different to those for cryptocurrencies. Identity blockchains use signatures rather than mathematical computations to generate proof, and as a consequence use only a fraction of the energy that is associated with cryptocurrencies. To put it in perspective, one write to the ledger can be the basis for millions of identity credentials and it requires no more energy than browsing a web page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments are already leading the way on verifiable credentials. British Columbia is working on providing digital identities for its citizens through the <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/">BC Digital Trust</a> initiative and, as previously mentioned, Aruba has been <a href="https://www.noticiacla.com/news/26573">hard at work</a> implementing new ways to make it easier for travelers to visit their island, including passing legislation to require more adoption and acceptance among businesses and spearheading efforts to adapt the credentials for more uses in traveling — getting through security at the airport, checking into your hotel, proving your health status to local businesses, etc.</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about how some governments are currently putting this technology to use we encourage you to attend the upcoming <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/290011345/">Indicio Meetup</a> on December 13.</p>

 The Importance of Digital Identity and Wallets in Healthcare 
<p>Traditional processes in today’s <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/healthcare-solutions/">healthcare</a> landscape have left sensitive personal information scattered across a lifetime of providers. This makes it difficult for individuals to access their health information and make informed decisions about their care. However, the future of healthcare is moving towards a model where individuals can create and control their own digital identity to access benefits and coverage. This would give patients more control over their health data and allow them to make more informed decisions about their care. This blog post will explore the importance of digital identity in healthcare and how it can benefit both patients and providers.</p>
 What are Digital Identity and Digital Wallets? 
<p>Digital identity is an electronic and portable representation of an individual’s real-world identity. When a digital identity is controlled by the user (or “holder”), it is referred to as a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-wallets/">digital wallet</a>. Identity information can include name, date of birth, gender, address, and other contact information. A wallet can also include sensitive personal information like medical records, insurance coverage, and financial history. In the healthcare context, when done properly, a digital wallet will allow a patient to control which information is shared with which providers. For example, a patient could share their medical records with their primary care physician but not another.</p>
<p>When implemented properly, a digital identity replaces the current identity construct of a username and password with a verified identity. Verified identities ensure that users are who they say they are, where biometrics are matched with government-certified credentials to verify the identity holder. The biometric can then secure authentication into the user’s account. The user’s digital identity and PII data will be stored in a portable digital identity wallet under the owner’s complete control.</p>
 Why Is a Digital Wallet Important in Healthcare? 
<p>There are several reasons why a digital wallet is important in healthcare. First, it gives patients more control over their health data and privacy. With traditional healthcare processes, patients’ sensitive personal information is scattered across many providers with no central repository. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for patients to access their records and make informed decisions about their care and doctors may need access to see a full patient history. With a digital wallet, patients can choose which providers can access their selected information. This control will implicitly improve the privacy controls the patient has over their data.</p>
<p>Second, digital wallets will allow patients to receive better care by making it easier for providers to access their records. Today, it can be difficult for providers to get a complete picture of a patient’s health history if they have seen multiple specialists or received care at different facilities over the years.</p>
<p>Third, digital wallets will help reduce errors and improve safety in healthcare. According to the Institute of Medicine, medical errors cost the US healthcare system billions of dollars each year and cause harm to hundreds of thousands of patients. A major contributing factor to these errors is the difficulty accessing complete and accurate patient medical records. If all of a patient’s records could be easily accessed by authorized providers, it would be easier to avoid mistakes and ensure that everyone was working with the most up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Fourth, digital wallets will assist with fraud prevention in healthcare. There are many instances of fraud in healthcare, from people pretending to be someone they’re not to receive care to billing for services that were never provided. When every patient has a unique digital identity verified by providers, it will be much harder for criminals to commit fraud.</p>
<p>Digital wallets are an important part of the future of healthcare. They give patients more control over their health data, allow them to receive better care, reduce errors, improve safety and privacy, and reduce fraud. Providers and payers should adopt requirements to accelerate an individual’s ability to create and manage their unique digital identity. Patients must create and manage their unique digital identities to easily identify themselves, schedule appointments, and receive benefits and coverage.</p>

<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>There’s an old joke told by economists that if you see a £€$100 note on the ground, ignore it because it must be a scam. If it wasn’t a scam, someone else would have picked it up&nbsp;already.</p><p>It’s a joke about the supposed infallibility of markets, which are supposed to discover and fill every new opportunity as soon as it arises. But in this blog series we’re arguing the exact opposite.</p><p>There’s some wisdom in the old economists’ joke. When somebody says “Look! There’s an opportunity here that’s just waiting to be had!”, it’s a healthy instinct to think “Hang on a minute! If the opportunity is so great, why hasn’t someone else picked it up before?” It’s one of the reasons people are so sceptical about productivity, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-vital-issue-people-avoid-talking-about-ed4c36a7de93">the ‘P’ word that no-one wants to talk&nbsp;about</a>.</p><p>But in this case, this healthy instinct is wrong. There are millions of such £€$100 notes hanging around, just waiting to be picked up. Why? Because there is so much waste (friction, effort, risks and costs) built into how organisations currently operate — waste that is just waiting to be eliminated. The purpose of this blog is to persuade you how and&nbsp;why.</p> A structural logjam <p>Opportunities for improvement start mounting when, for one reason or another, a system gets stuck in a mode that’s no longer fit for purpose. That is what has happened with data. Especially personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>For decades the best, most efficient, most productive way of getting value from data was for the organisation wanting to use that data to collect it, store it and process it for itself. Who else was there to do&nbsp;it?</p><p>But the more data-driven our economy has become, the more restrictive and suffocating this old approach becomes. One, unique characteristic of data is that it doesn’t get used up when used, which means the same piece of data can be used many times over by many different people for many different purposes. But for that to happen, the data needs to be shared. And the siloed, proprietary organisation-centric database, upon which our entire economic system is currently based, is designed NOT to share&nbsp;data.</p><p>What was once the best possible way of collecting and using data has turned into its opposite: an all-pervading, deeply embedded source of waste: of unnecessary friction, effort, risk and&nbsp;cost.</p> An untapped opportunity <p>But seen from the opposite angle, it is a huge untapped opportunity. Like that £€$100 note lying on the ground in front of you. If the right sort of data sharing was enabled — where citizens can collect, store, use and share their own data under their own control using their own personal data store — we are saying it is now possible to reduce the costs of providing services by between 45% and 90%, especially and initially in the public&nbsp;sector.</p><p>To see how, let’s take a topical example. Right now, lots of people can’t afford to heat their homes. There are schemes, such as the warm home discount, that are supposed to help those who need it most. But often they do the opposite, punishing them for being poor by embroiling them in a frustrating, humiliating, anxiety producing administrative nightmare — and operating as a modern waste creation&nbsp;scheme.</p><p>To prove you are eligible for a warm home discount you have to present your energy provider with a huge amount of information: information about any earnings you have from employment, or from benefits or carers allowances, from pensions or savings, and any other sources of income. You also have to provide information about your housing costs — and when we say ‘provide information’, that means provide documentary proof, in the form that the energy company requires, for every&nbsp;item.</p><p>This is a mountain of work in its own right. But having completed it, you are then in for a shock, because if you have a partner you also have to find, present and prove all the same information for them&nbsp;too.</p><p>Then, once the energy provider receives this information, they have to check every piece of information to make sure you are not a fraudster. The whole process, from application form to final decision, can take months to complete, with processing costs of between £150 and £200 per application (and that’s ignoring all the costs incurred by the individuals themselves). In short, the warm home discount is a waste&nbsp;factory.</p><p>Yet in a high proportion of cases, virtually all this work could be avoided by one simple thing: a verified attribute. A verified attribute is a piece of information about an individual that has been checked to accepted levels of reliability by a competent, responsible organisation such as a government department or bank. It is cryptographically secure so it cannot be tampered with. Examples of verified attributes include confirmation that the individual has passed an exam or test, that they have this blood type of that vaccination, or that they have an income of X and a credit score of&nbsp;Y.</p><p>In this case, if the individual could get hold of a verified attribute confirming that they are eligible for universal credit, their ability to share this one piece of information could short-circuit all the above work, turning months into minutes and hundreds of pounds into pennies. It would eliminate mountains of friction, effort, risk and cost for both the individual and the service provider.</p> The enormous scale of the opportunity <p>The warm home discount is just one tiny example of something that is happening every day, millions of times over. The savings that could be made by changing the way we do warm home discounts could apply millions of times over, to some degree or other. Like covering the ground with £€$100 notes which are just waiting to be picked&nbsp;up.</p><p>Figure 1 below highlights the endless layers of waste currently created by poor data logistics. In doing so it highlights where the cost saving opportunities lie.</p>Figure 1: Layers of waste created by poor data logistics<p>Official Government figures provide one way of seeing just how big the problem Research by the UK Government Digital Service (GDS) back in 2103 identified 1.54 billion transactions dealing with individuals a year, covering 772 services. For example, there were 1.8 million applications for job seekers allowance with each application costing £71 to process, creating total costs of £219 million, and 870,000 applications for employment and support allowances. These cost £223 per application to process, creating total costs of&nbsp;£194m.</p><p>GDS’s commentary on these processes highlight the friction, effort, risk and cost that is endemic within them. On employment and support allowances, it&nbsp;says:</p><p>“New claims involve several interactions with the applicant and third parties,such as medical professionals, to, for example, arrange and undertake medicals, assemble evidence to validate identity and eligibility in line with benefit regulations and fraud avoidance strategies, issue NI numbers if the applicant does not have one, and deal with any appeals against the decisions made.”</p><p>Maintaining a service can be as expensive as delivering a new one. The GDS comment on job seekers’ allowance says:</p><p>“Maintaining claims involves many interactions, including contacts about changes of circumstances or compliance checks that could affect eligibility, the investigation of potential fraud and error, and appeals against decisions made. It also includes the making of payments and any queries about non-receipt.”</p><p>GDS estimated that the total costs of completing these transactions was £6.7bn. It also knew this was a massive underestimate given that it could only obtain cost data on one-fifth of transactions (so the real costs could have been five times higher than this). Its figures also ignore all costs incurred by citizens when making applications (as almost every cost measring exercise&nbsp;does).</p><p>And remember, GDS was only talking about central government. The same costs are being generated across every other sector including local government, health and social care, the third sector, financial services including banking and insurance, education, retail, transport, media and entertainment, and&nbsp;leisure.</p> Millions of £€$100 notes just waiting to be picked&nbsp;up <p>By enabling the sharing of the right information at the right times, personal data logistics infrastructure like that built by Mydex enables warm home discount-style levels of waste to be eliminated from thousands of different services serving tens of millions of different people. It reveals millions of £€$100 notes just waiting to be picked&nbsp;up.</p><p>Yet so far Governments have taken the economists’ joke seriously and ignored them, spending years and billions chasing the rainbows of ‘Big Data’ and artificial (i.e. fake) intelligence instead.</p><p>Elimination of waste and FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost) reduction via better data logistics is now a system-wide productivity revolution that’s just waiting to be unleashed. But this revolution is just the beginning of the economic opportunities opened up by the humble personal data store. It does something else too: transform the way service delivery is organised&nbsp;. That’s the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

<p>A digital technology infrastructure depends on orchestrating information and processes from multiple components, each with unique security, database, and processing methods. Moreover, as a user navigates your platform or application, it’s crucial to ensure their identity has been verified and validated without adding friction to their experience. <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/capabilities/identity-orchestration/pingone-davinci">PingOne DaVinci</a> addresses this need, providing you with an identity orchestration toolkit with a no-code configuration process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, this type of identity orchestration was a complex process that required manual coding of each third-party integration. This problem often meant that changing vendors required more than just installing new software — you had to invest in the orchestration code. As a result, you might have been reluctant to switch to a new vendor, even if they offered improved services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, identity orchestration is made easier through the use of connectors. Connectors are architectural models that transfer (and control the transfer of) data between different components within your architecture. They can also provide additional services, including messaging and transitions—all of which occur independently of the components. With connectors, you can seamlessly connect to proprietary and third-party orchestration tools and integrate these tools into your workflow.</p>

We live in an Internet environment where we lack trust due to the lack of true identities.<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-3-digital-trust/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-257644" title="We lightly define trust in the Preface to these Chapters.">1</a> This results in dealing with billions of anonymous people who can come into your sphere and expect something of you.</p>
<p>Individuals and organizations come into your sphere to challenge you, or to want you to do something. Then the question in your mind comes down to how confident are you that the entity that’s approaching you is who they claim to be, and that their intent can be trusted.</p>
<p>The cost of establishing trust with entities on the internet is too high today. We want to do more things on the internet but we lack the ability to trust the authenticity of the interactions, resulting in lost opportunities to conduct certain valuable transactions.</p>
<p>The founding generation of the internet purposely excluded certain encryption, which would have made the network resistant to eavesdropping and easier to know who sent a particular communication, choosing to focus instead on the technical challenges of moving information quickly and reliably. There were pros and cons associated with this decision. The biggest pro being the fast adoption of the internet – and the biggest con being the lack of provable authenticity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was still possible to encrypt traffic using hardware or software designed for that purpose, but the Internet developed into a communication system that operated mostly in the clear — meaning anyone with access to the network could monitor transmissions. With encryption rare, it also was difficult for anyone online to be sure who he or she was communicating with.”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-3-digital-trust/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-257644" title="</span><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;><a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/30/net-of-insecurity-part-1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/30/net-of-insecurity-part-1/</a>">2</a></p></blockquote>
<p>We wrote <a href="https://northernblock.io/introduction-to-digital-trust/">An Introduction to Digital Trust</a> in 2021 so that we could send it as a resource to people looking for a simple explainer. It’s proved helpful so far.</p>
<p>What does it mean to ensure trust is baked into our digital interactions? It starts with being able to trust the claims being made by any entity interacting with you. In a user controlled system, this comes down to trusting the proofs of credentials that your peer is sharing with you. We often refer to the ‘Trust Triangle Model’ to describe the sharing of claims. But as we will describe shortly, this trust model is not addressing all aspects of trust.</p>
<p>When we talk about the Trust Triangle, we use this jargon called “Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers,” and that exactly maps to the world that we have today. We often play those roles at different times and in various interactions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Verifiable Credential Trust Triangle, based on the model shown in the “Introduction to Trust Over IP” whitepaper.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 An Issuer sends a credential offer to a Holder; 
 The Holder can accept or decline the credential offer; 
 The Holder can then present any credential, or combination of credentials as Proofs to a Verifier. 
 
<p></p>
<p>But within these interactions, there are further questions that could be asked, as Trust needs to be built for all types of interactions.<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-3-digital-trust/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-257644" title="The below doesn’t cover the complete list of questions that should be asked, as we can imagine wanting to know other details such as credentials types, credential schemas, wallets used, etc.">3</a></p>



Role
Questions


Issuer
Am I issuing the credential to the right holder?


Issuer
Is the holder authorized to receive this?


Holder
Is the Issuer who they claim to be?


Holder
Is the Issuer authorized to issue it?


Holder
Is the Verifier who they claim to be?


Holder
Is the Verifier authorized to verify it?


Verifier
Did the issuer issue the credential to the right holder?


Verifier
Is the holder authorized to receive this?


Verifier
Is the authentic recipient of the credential presenting the proof or is someone else presenting the proof?


Verifier
Is the Issuer who they claim to be?


Verifier
Is the Issuer authorized to issue it?



<p><br><br>
These above are all governance-related questions, rather than technical questions. However in some of these questions, we see technology as being the solution to solve some governance issues. Therefore showing the trust triangle by itself isn’t the best model, and is perhaps deceptive to think that it’s going to work at any scale without showing a fourth element, or what we call governance.</p>
 <p>An expansion on the Governance Trust Diamond, shown in the “Introduction to Trust Over IP” whitepaper. All entities involved have reasons to consult with one or many governance frameworks.</p> 
<p><br><br>
The purpose of this section was to take that initial introduction on Digital Trust a step further as it comes to claims being made digitally, by answering these three questions:</p>
 
 In Chapter 4, we will discuss: “What infrastructure is needed so that anyone can trust any type of claim made digitally?” (Hint: using cryptographic proofs alone aren’t enough) 
 In Chapter 5, we will then answer: “What ramp is needed to monetize the benefits of this digital trust infrastructure?” 
 In Chapter 6, we close the discussion by addressing: “Who should build, deploy and maintain this infrastructure?”

<p><br><br>
In March 2021, the prime ministers of Estonia, Finland, Denmark and Germany called on the European Union (EU) to speed up “digital sovereignty” and the creation of the “digital single market”.</p>
<p>The four countries wrote in a letter that “digital sovereignty” means increasing Europe’s technological capacity and its ability to establish values ​​and rules in a technology-centered world that is becoming dominated by other countries: “We call for the European Union to get ahead of the curve in the digital transformation.”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-257634" title="<a href=&quot;https://news.err.ee/1608127618/estonia-eu-countries-propose-faster-european-digital-sovereignty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>https://news.err.ee/1608127618/estonia-eu-countries-propose-faster-european-digital-sovereignty</a></span>">1</a></p>
<p>The prime ministers called on the EU to speed up the digital switchover and to emphasize digital policies involving governments, society and the economy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We need to effectively safeguard competition and market access in a data-driven world. Critical infrastructures and technologies need to become resilient and secure. It is time for the digitization of governments in order to build trust and foster digital innovation,” the same letter said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since that announcement, the EU itself<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-257634" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.scytales.com/post/scytales-ab-together-with-netcompany-intrasoft-wins-landmark-eu-digital-wallet-contract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>https://www.scytales.com/post/scytales-ab-together-with-netcompany-intrasoft-wins-landmark-eu-digital-wallet-contract</a>">2</a>, and many EU Nation States have prioritized Digital ID programs/strategies as a first order of action to protect their digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>We defined sovereignty in the previous chapter, so let’s take a stab at defining identity in this one.</p>
<p>Personal Identity is given to you by the Government in a lot of ways; that is, in an administrative sense, and not your philosophical sense of being, and who you are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the physical world, many interactions with entities are governed by regulation. Going to a financial institution or a hospital requires one to identify themselves with one of these Government-issued IDs.</p>
<p>The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-257634" title="<a href=&quot;https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_4/PSP-PCTF-V-1.4-Consolidated-Overview-EN-2021-12-16.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_4/PSP-PCTF-V-1.4-Consolidated-Overview-EN-2021-12-16.pdf</a>">3</a> defines two types of identities: foundational and contextual:</p>
 
 A Foundational Identity is an identity that has been established or changed as a result of a foundational event (e.g., birth, person legal name change, immigration, legal residency, naturalized citizenship, death, organization legal name registration, organization legal name change, or bankruptcy).
 
 Even if foundational identities can undergo changes of state, the chain of provenance of these changes are maintained. For example, on your passport it says where you were born, even though it may not be the country that you’re a citizen of. 
 Your foundational identity attributes are rarely changed. 
 Your foundational identity is controlled and managed by governments. 
 
 
 A Contextual Identity is an identity that is used for a specific purpose within a specific identity context (e.g., banking, business permits, health services, drivers licensing, or social media).
 
 Contextual identities can<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-257634" title="There is room for identities not rooted in foundational identities. It’s up to the consumer to decide whether or not they want it rooted. There’s nothing stopping you from creating a public-private key pair today to participate in the world of decentralized finance. This freedom brings sovereignty of its own.">4</a> be rooted in foundational identities. Formal recognition can be extended to other sectors where lower assurances can be tolerated and foundational identity is not required. 
 You can have as many contextual identities as you want, and you can get rid of them as you choose. As a citizen, you have much more agency and autonomy over your contextual identities. 
 Since you can have many of these for various contexts, they can help reduce correlation, an important factor to drive personal sovereignty via privacy. 
 Your contextual identities are controlled and managed by you and the entities you enter into contracts with. 
 
 
 
<p>Contextual identities, which we will start referring to as “Trusted Digital Identities”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-257634" title="<em>T</em><i>rust</i> is a loaded term. It’s a human concept, which makes it difficult to categorize as it’s very contextual. In the context of <i>trusted digital identity</i>, we’re saying that just like your physical world interactions often require identity cards that have been rooted in Government-issued foundational IDs (e.g., showing a driver’s license to open a bank account), many digital interactions will require the same.">5</a>, can be established between you and other entities (e.g., lower-level governments, tech companies, financial institutions, hospitals, online services, etc.) based on what you as an individual consent to. To repeat a point mentioned above, we require that concept of ‘foundational’ identity so we can build on the idea of a trusted digital identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As more of us spend most of our time in some digital fashion, Governments must provide the same level of trust online that they do in the physical world (root of trust).</p>
<p>One of the roles of a nation is to provide high assurance identities so that an economy can flourish. In Chapter 4 we look at some needed infrastructure to enhance the digital economy. The key questions to answer are how to establish the identities which can create trust, and how we can monetize those identities in the digital economy (Chapter 5).</p>
<p>If we don’t get digital identity right we’re in deep trouble, which is why a lot of the government initiatives right now globally are doing very similar things. They’re adopting a particular technology stack but aiming towards full interoperability (e.g., cross border digital interactions) that is going to be required to serve their citizens, allowing the country to establish its own digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>There are examples of countries in which the governments have more mature digital ID programs. We often hear of the successes from programs in Estonia, Singapore, etc. These successes have come from smaller countries, with existing high mobile adoption, and a very centralized control/governance of the countries’ ecosystems (e.g., financial, healthcare, etc.). Although they’ve been able to create lots of value for citizens to more easily access services, and cheaper for private sectors to identify/authenticate, this infrastructure doesn’t work on the open Internet.</p>
<p>As Kim Cameron states in his Laws of Identity paper: </p>
<blockquote><p>“A system that does not put users in control will – immediately or over time – be rejected by enough of them that it cannot become and remain a unifying technology.”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-257634" title="</span></i><a href=&quot;https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf</span></a><i><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>">6</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The Open Internet for one cannot adopt the architecture of private ecosystems that countries like Singapore and Estonia have implemented. It won’t work because it’s a centrally managed model and it doesn’t put users in control.</p>
<p>Here are a couple other quotes from Kim Cameron’s paper which feel highly relevant to this topic of discussion:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Digital identity is related to context, and the Internet, while being a single technical framework, is experienced through a thousand kinds of content in at least as many different contexts”</p></blockquote>
<p>&amp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“The emergence of a single simplistic digital identity solution as a universal panacea is not realistic.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So we think we can all agree that creating one identity system for the Internet won’t scale. But using certain governance frameworks can help accelerate the journey to digital trust.</p>
<p>There’s a really good way of managing governance at a really large scale today that a whole bunch of people in different countries in the world have bought into. It’s called governments. So who’s in a stronger position to start issuing highly trustworthy secure privacy preserving digital identities for their citizens, their businesses and for their agencies that they are dealing with? Governments are the root of trust for so many things in life today so just having that root of trust available digitally will accelerate the speed at which digital trust on the internet can be adopted. Governments can provide key inputs and frameworks to empower their citizens to benefit from trusted digital interactions.</p>
<p>We would conclude that it seems like there’s a very critical role to be played by governments in achieving digital trust, which downstream will bring more sovereignty to themselves and to their citizens.</p>
<p>Let’s next expand upon the concept of Digital Trust.</p>

<p><br><br>
In the world of self-sovereign identity (SSI), there are various opinions about using the word sovereignty for describing the ambitions that we are trying to achieve through our principles, values, standards, technologies and governance frameworks. Some people refrain from using it as it causes confusion in discussions amongst various stakeholders. There were similarities in the crypto space in 2018, where the terms crypto and even blockchain became ones to avoid in conversations, and people started referring to them as ledger technologies. But the purpose of this series isn’t to focus on the right naming convention, but instead to focus on what is needed to achieve digital trust, which is a means to achieving more sovereignty for all.</p>
<p>The need for sovereignty is not only for people, but also for Nation States. Let’s define both of these:</p>
 
 National sovereignty: “The formation and protection of sustainable freedom, equality and justice in society depends totally on the exact sense of establishment of national sovereignty. Therefore, the basis of freedom, equality and justice is national sovereignty.”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-1-digital-sovereignty/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-257569" title="</span></span><a href=&quot;https://www.ktb.gov.tr/EN-104179/national-sovereignty-national-government.html#:~:text=The%20formation%20and%20protection%20of,in%20our%20state%20is%20limitless.&quot;>https://www.ktb.gov.tr/EN-104179/national-sovereignty-national-government.html#:~:text=The%20formation%20and%20protection%20of,in%20our%20state%20is%20limitless.</a>">1</a> 
 Personal sovereignty: “The intrinsic authority and power of an individual to determine their own direction and destiny. It means not being controlled or manipulated by any person, group, or institution. It means having agency and autonomy over your life; being able to make your own decisions”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-1-digital-sovereignty/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-257569" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/personal-sovereignty-barbara-fagan-smith/&quot;>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/personal-sovereignty-barbara-fagan-smith/</a>">2</a> 
 
<p>With the basis of freedom, equality and justice being tied to national sovereignty, ensuring democratic nation states can not only maintain, but increase their sovereignty should result in positive downstream implications for the sovereignty of their citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As world economies continue to undergo fundamental shifts, with a rising share of economic growth and prosperity being driven by intangible assets (i.e. investments and assets that do not have a concrete physical existence) (e.g., data, digital services, brand equity, etc.), governments must ensure they exercise leadership within the digital realm. As more of us spend increasing time in digital environments rather than physical, governments must enable the same level of trust in the digital world that they do in the physical world, so that citizens have agency and autonomy over their growing digital lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So the million dollar question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we create an unbiased open playing field driven by infrastructure allowing all to play with sovereignty?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technology companies seem to have sovereignty over their digital ecosystems. They architect the rules, algorithms, data, policies, etc. In contrast to the physical ecosystems where governments are generally the architects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example. </p>
<p>On January 6th, 2021, when a mob attacked the United States Capitol in Washington – the response went to the tech companies, not to governments. Companies such as Twitter were empowered to de-platform the president of the US, and certain platforms like Parler were banned by their infrastructure provider.<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-1-digital-sovereignty/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-257569" title="<a href=&quot;https://time.com/5929888/amazon-parler-aws/&quot;>https://time.com/5929888/amazon-parler-aws/</a>">3</a> However you feel about Twitter, they managed to exercise sovereignty (e.g., once again recently by reinstating previously banned accounts). And whatever opinion you have about these technology companies’ policies, no one has voted for their rules – they continue to exercise sovereignty over important societal matters.</p>
<p>With regard to exerting sovereignty in the digital space, generally speaking, the private sector has moved ahead of governments. Hearings of Facebook at Congress in 2018 were a good example of reactionary measures. When a private sector company generated enough complaints from citizens, the US Congress then prioritized looking into what was happening.</p>
  
<p><br><br>
At the fast pace at which new technology moves, if governments aren’t a party to what is being built, how can they keep up with it? In the physical world, if a mining operation is built on some land, to some extent the land is overseen and governed by a respective government agency. <a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-1-digital-sovereignty/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-257569" title="</span><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>In the physical world, does anything that can have a significant impact on citizens happen without government involvement/oversight?</span><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>">4</a> The Internet on the other hand doesn’t have the same standard of government oversight. So how will they know what is being built and how these things are impacting the sovereignty of their citizens.</p>
<p>Increasing national sovereignty in the digital world remains a pressing topic throughout world governments. And the launch of national digital identity programs by governments has shown great initiative to solve some of these issues.<br>
</p>
<p>We will shift the focus in the next chapter to Digital Identity. If digital trust is a means to sovereignty, then let’s look at how citizen-controlled digital identity can be a means to attaining digital trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Digital Identity → Digital Trust → Digital Sovereignty</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, we will look at how most of the Digital ID solutions which exist in the market today are either driven by private sector or closed government ecosystem solutions. The digital world is broader than the physical borders of a nation. And citizens every day operate digitally outside of the physical boundaries. By not having open ecosystems, it makes it difficult for governments to fully assess the impact these systems have on their citizens.»</p>

We wrote <a href="https://northernblock.io/introduction-to-digital-trust/">An Introduction to Digital Trust</a> in 2021 so that we could send it as a resource to people looking for a simple explainer. It’s proved helpful so far.</p>
<p>Since then however, the market has matured. We’ve seen a steady increase in global self-sovereign identity (SSI) projects, with many projects undertaken, and a rising amount of tenders coming out of the public sector. It’s fair to say that there has been a growing buzz around the space.</p>
<p>We’ve also noticed the SSI adoption conversation recently shifting away from technology and standards towards trust, which we’ve felt is a positive sign for the adoption cycle of digital trust applications, knowing that technologies, protocols and standards alone doesn’t allow for anyone to trust any type of claim, especially in the digital world.</p>
<p>Hence, we decided that we needed a Part 2 to that initial post on digital trust. There wasn’t enough covered in the introduction to give the full spectrum and push forward some ideas on how digital trust can be achieved on the Open Internet.</p>
<p>Trust is a human concept. It’s a perception. Trust is relative to risk – and every human has a different risk tolerance based on contextual elements. Some may take extra steps to “trust” someone or an activity, whereas others may take much less steps for the same. Trust also can vary depending on the value of the transaction that they are involved in. A clutch point around trust is that at some point you gain enough confidence in a context to proceed with a transaction or deepening the relationship.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we reflected on trust, and how there can be more of it on the internet, we felt like it really comes down to having strong trust frameworks (or governance frameworks) to set the rules which we can all operate within specific contexts. In the physical world, there’s a really good way of managing governance at a really large scale today that a whole bunch of people in different countries in the world have bought into. They’re called governments.</p>
<p>We therefore set out to write our thoughts on how governments can inject trust into the open internet so that trust can become portable across contexts where it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we’re aiming at highlighting is that today everyone is unable to trust each other in this modern digital world due to certain steps that were skipped when the Internet was rolled out. Knowing that the open internet is a foundation to so many services that we, the citizens, consume in our daily lives, how can we avoid making the same mistakes as we continue depending on more digital interactions.</p>
<p>As we continue to roll out digital identity programs, we need to really understand the relationship that digital identity has with trust, and in turn look at how that affects both individual and national sovereignty. Chapters 1-3 covers these topics and goes into depth of the problem statement.</p>
<p>Throughout Chapters 4-6, we will look into the needed infrastructure to address the problem statement. The infrastructure needs to cover the foundational building blocks so that we have a framework for digital trust based on different levels of engagements. We will discuss how citizens can engage with others (peers) and thus monetize the infrastructure through trust, while maintaining their sovereignty. Lastly, we cover the most critical question – who should design, build, operate and maintain the proposed digital trust infrastructure?</p>

 Affinidi VS Code Extension and Affinidi CLI for Privacy-Preserving Applications — A Getting Started&nbsp;Guide <p>Affinidi’s vision is to empower communities with control and ownership of their data, creating new business models and greater&nbsp;trust.</p><p>As the customer demand for control and ownership of data continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly important for developers to better manage data privacy and portability within their apps. With our tooling, you can start creating a privacy-preserving app within&nbsp;minutes.</p> What Are Privacy-Preserving Apps? <p>Privacy-preserving apps make it easy to give your customers more control over how their information is used and shared. We enable this data ownership and control through Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">VCs</a>, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602">selective disclosure</a>.</p> What Are the Affinidi VS Code Extension and the Affinidi&nbsp;CLI? <p>The Affinidi VS Code Extension provides access to Affinidi’s developer tools directly within the Visual Studio Code editor’s command palette. This extension is a one-stop place for Affinidi’s developer tools that enables you to build privacy-preserving applications, without having to leave your&nbsp;IDE.</p><p>The Affinidi Command Line Interface (CLI) provides access to Affinidi Developer Tools through your terminal or shell. You can leverage this tool to create a project, manage your API keys, access schemas, and more through commands and&nbsp;scripts.</p><p>You should update both tools regularly to benefit from our continuous additions and latest improvements.</p> Getting Started <p>We assume that you already have VS Code installed (if not, head over <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here</a>). You can either get the Affinidi VS Code extension through VS Code’s sidebar or you can go to the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Affinidi.affinidi">extension page</a> on the VS Code Marketplace.</p><p>First, you need to create an Affinidi account and a&nbsp;project.</p><p>To do that, click on Affinidi logo in sidebar, then click on “Create an account with Affinidi”, enter your email and the OTP code that you received in your&nbsp;inbox.</p><p>When you’re authenticated, just click on “Create project” button and enter a project’s name. That’s&nbsp;it!</p><p>We’ll automatically create a digital identity for you — your personal&nbsp;DID.</p><p>If you want an end-to-end example of an application, that uses Affinidi APIs, you can generate a reference app directly from the extension.</p><p>The reference app includes such features as: issuing a credential, claiming &amp; storing it in your wallet, verifying it.</p><p>This feature requires the <a href="https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-cli">Affinidi CLI</a> to be installed:</p> $ npm i -g @affinidi/cli  The Affinidi Reference App <p>These tools will allow you to generate the Affinidi Reference App with the click of a button. The app is actually three applications in one. It provides three independent user flows for issuing, claiming/holding VCs, and verifying VCs, all housed in the same code base, to facilitate developer experience. In a real world scenario, the three flows would never coincide in the same application but as a developer you may need to build simultaneously for the three corners of the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>: issuer, holder and verifier.</p><p>The Reference App is tailored for a certification and verification use case, but the Holder and Verifier flows can be extended to other use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Find out more about our tools&nbsp;here:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-cli">https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-cli</a>  <a href="https://github.com/affinidi/vscode-extension">https://github.com/affinidi/vscode-extension</a>  <a href="http://xn--%09https-mr3d/github.com/affinidi/elements-reference-app-frontend">https://github.com/affinidi/elements-reference-app-frontend</a>  <p>We hope the above use case encourages you to build your own privacy-preserving applications.

<p>At Spruce, we’re passionate about exploring applications of decentralized identity technology, as we help shepherd a more privacy-centric future where individuals have more control over their identity and data. One such application is through official forms of identification, like those issued by government and official agencies for mobile driver’s licenses (mDL). </p><p>We believe that in the modern, technology-driven world, an ID will become much more composable than a piece of plastic that sits idly in your wallet. That’s why we’re excited to share a new solution we’ve been working on with early partners as a part of our new <a href="https://spruceid.com/credible">Credible Product Suite</a>.</p><a href="https://spruceid.com/credible">  Credible  Credible offers digital versions of identification, like mobile driver’s licenses, that offer more security, privacy protection, and control for individuals across their digital interactions.      </a><p>We’ve put a lot of consideration into how we can best design a Credible mobile drivers license solution in a way that puts privacy and security at the forefront of our decision-making. New technology enabling digital forms of identity requires us to think about the different risks and concerns that may arise, and how we, as a technology company, can foster innovation to help protect the rights of individuals in these decisions. </p> What is an mDL? <p>An mDL is a mobile driver’s license, a digital version of the plastic ID card you carry around in your wallet. Many government agencies and institutions globally are exploring digital versions of official identification to provide expanded functionality to meet the needs of our new digital world. With this, a need for a set of global technical standards has emerged to ensure interoperability between different agencies and jurisdictions.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IEC 18013-5</a> - the technical standard for mobile driver’s license applications, which was unanimously approved in August 2021. This standard for an mDL application covers how we can represent a digital driver’s license on a person’s smartphone (or other device) and the end-to-end process for how it can be presented in-person. Federal agencies in the United States, namely TSA, have already committed to using ISO/IEC 18013-5, which means that state DMVs will need to build mDLs aligned with the same standard in order for their driver’s licenses to be usable for travel at airports. The ISO working groups, which Spruce is a part of, are still actively discussing methods for how an mDL is issued, presented online (ISO/IEC 18013-7), and refreshed. </p><p>With verifiable credentials, mDLs are a secure and trustworthy way to store your driver’s license information and credentials. Verifiable credentials are digital representations of documents, such as a driver’s license, that can be stored securely on a mobile device, using cryptography. These credentials are cryptographically signed by the issuing authority and can be verified by other parties. This ensures that the credentials are authentic and cannot be altered or tampered with in any way and allows individuals to prove their identity for digital interactions in a secure and verifiable way.</p><p>With Credible, we are creating a solution to provision mobile driver’s licenses to a smartphone application using ISO/IEC 18013-5, along with the W3C standards for Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, and OpenID for Verifiable Credentials to create secure, privacy-enhancing, and tamper evident identity solutions. </p> Why should we care about this? <p>Simply put, the world is moving towards digitization. We spend an increasing amount of our time online, with an ever-increasing number of digital interactions. There is still, however, a massive disconnect between the experiences we are familiar with in the physical world and how accessible (or not) those are online. </p><p>There is no straightforward way to verify your identity online right now in order to do basic tasks, such as opening a bank account or applying for an apartment lease, aside from physically typing in a government-issued personal identifier, like an SSN, which comes with major security risks. Online businesses and services have to collect sensitive information from users because, until now, there has been no way to securely present a digital version of your identity credentials in a way that is cryptographically verifiable.</p><p>Aside from verifying your identity for digital interactions, having a digital ID, such as an mDL, creates new opportunities for people to access benefits afforded to them by both businesses and governments, at the local, state, and federal levels. Individuals will be able to present their mDL online to prove, for example, they are over 55 to qualify for a senior discount while buying movie tickets online at their local movie theater. Similarly, a college student would be able to prove they are a resident of a local city to qualify for a library card in order to check out electronic versions of their textbooks from their local library. In fact, we’re working to let mDL users be able to log into different government websites to access government services, including social security and unemployment benefits, Medicare and Medicaid, and nutrition assistance programs.</p><p>On a grander scale, the ability to prove one’s identity securely and in a tamper-evident way helps to reduce fraud in accessing financial assistance. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment insurance (UI) fraud has grown at an astonishing rate. The <a href="https://www.oig.dol.gov/doloiguioversightwork.htm">U.S. Department of Labor's Inspector General</a> states that of, "the estimated $872.5 billion in pandemic UI funding, at least $163 billion in benefits could have been paid improperly, with a significant portion attributable to fraud." The government can have higher trust that the citizens accessing benefits are, in fact, the people who qualify for those benefits, and citizens can trust that their tax money is being used responsibly.</p><p>From a security perspective, the user of applied cryptography in our Credible mDL solution ensures the identification is tamper-evident with verifiable authorship. This means that when you present your mDL, either online or in person, it will be clear that the ID hasn’t been tampered with in any way and is, in fact, official identification issued by a specific state or other governing body. This solution, when paired with a complementing data policy approach, can help ensure that your information is used only for the exact purpose specified and no further. We further incorporate support for W3C Verifiable Credentials and W3C Decentralized Identifiers in line with the <a href="https://medium.com/@identitywoman-in-business/vc-mdl-project-community-input-session-db016c50a050">community’s inputs</a>, to maximize benefits for end users by supporting different types of popular data formats.</p><p>With this early use case of Credible, we’re unlocking the hugely untapped potential for how we facilitate trusted interactions in a digital world. The technology is deeply complex, but with Credible, the applications are intuitive and easy to use, bringing verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers toward mainstream adoption for daily use. </p><p>If you’re interested in further explorations of mobile driver’s licenses solutions, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@spruceid.com">hello@spruceid.com</a>.</p> <p><br>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p><br></p>

<p>TL;DR</p>  The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) on Dock can read from native modules using precompiles  This makes the communication between EVM and native chain bidirectional.  With this new release, the EVM smart contracts can now read data like DIDs, revocation statuses, accumulator values, etc.  EVM smart contracts can thus verify signatures from DIDs and verify credentials as well  EVM contracts could also use information like participation in governance or staking in a DAO contract, for example   Background <p>Dock blockchain's features are organized in different modules (called pallets in <a href="https://substrate.io/">Substrate</a>). Eg, the DID module stores all DIDs, their public keys, service endpoints, etc. The revocation module stores revocation registries and statuses. The staking module stores who all have staked for whom and how much. And so on.<br></p><p>To deploy smart contracts on Dock, we have the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) module (<a href="https://blog.dock.io/deploy-your-evm-smart-contracts-on-dock/">announcement</a>) that allows developers to deploy contracts written in Solidity (the most popular smart contract language) for any custom logic in their dApp. However, it wasn't possible for the EVM module to read the data of other modules. E.g. your smart contract couldn't read the public key of a DID or couldn't check the revocation status. The native chain modules could read EVM storage but the opposite wasn't possible. This changes with our new release. With the new release, EVM contracts can read data stored in any module by using our storage-reader precompile.</p> Technical Details <p>The contracts can call the precompile with the module name and storage entry name (in that module) (many variations available) to read the corresponding storage. It is the contract's responsibility to parse that storage data to create a meaningful data structure, thus the contract should be aware of the data structure of the storage its reading. The precompile can read various storage structures like without keys, maps and double maps and allow reading from an offset and limit the amount of data read. </p><p>We are releasing 2 precompiles, one for reading storage as raw bytes and the other which is type-aware and will use defaults. It's recommended to use the latter if you are unsure of which to pick. The raw storage reader precompile is at address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000F and the type-aware is at address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000E. </p><p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm/precompile/storage-reader">code</a> in the blockchain node repo and the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/eth/storage-reader.test.js">tests</a> in the SDK repo.</p> Applications <p>This new feature allows developers to build richer dApps which not only have the flexibility of smart contracts but can also use Dock's native features like DIDs. Say a contract requires a DID's approval and thus requires a signature to verify. The contract on receiving the signature, reads the public key from the DID module and verifies. </p><p>Contracts can also verify credentials by checking the signature and revocation status however care must be taken to do it for only those credentials which don't violate the privacy of the user. So anonymous credentials can be verified by reading the BBS+ public key and accumulator (for revocation) from the chain. Contracts could also use other information like an account's participation in staking or governance like a DAO that only allows accounts that have nominated some validators (by staking tokens) or play a role in governance like they being a council member, etc.</p> About Dock <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials provider that offers Dock Certs, a highly secure and scalable no-code platform, and Certs API to enable organizations to efficiently issue and verify digital credentials using blockchain technology. The credentials are tamper-resistant and instantly verifiable, and the technology is easy to integrate so users can provide Verifiable Credential support quickly. </p>

				  A complete, easy-to-deploy ecosystem for creating, issuing, and verifying tamper-proof employment credentials, using open-source decentralized identity technology delivering secure and reusable verification  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, Dec 8, 2022/Accesswire/ Indicio, the market leader in developing Trusted Digital Ecosystems to verify and exchange high-value information, today announced the availability of <a href="http://Indicio.tech/proven-works">Indicio Proven Works</a>, a complete, off-the-shelf solution enabling&nbsp; continuous, seamless verification of employment status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven Works reduces duplicative and time-consuming verification processes, and provides tamper-proof assurance of employee identity for global companies and external benefit providers. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) <a href="https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2022/?_ga=2.170335648.1054739412.1670440686-1944471192.1670440686">estimates</a> that 5% of businesses’ annual revenue is lost to occupational fraud and payroll abuse. This includes false timesheet entries and paychecks going to employees who don’t actually exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putting this in context, if the 5% loss estimate were applied to the combined total annual revenue of the top 500 grossing companies in the world in 2021, it would result in a projected total fraud loss of almost $1.9 trillion. Indicio Proven helps combat occupational fraud using verifiable credentials and open-source decentralized identity technology that is privacy-preserving, secure, and GDPR compliant.</p>
<p>“Indicio Proven Works is a powerful way to simplify employment verification,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio, “and a simple way to experience the power of verifiable credential technology. Whether entering a facility or a Zoom meeting or enrolling with a benefits partner, a verifiable credential provides fraud-resistant and tamper-proof assurance that the employee presenting the credential is your employee. KYC once, verify continuously and seamlessly, save time, money, effort, and eliminate risk. And once you add a verifiable credential layer to your existing system, you’ll be ready to&nbsp; expand the scope for immediately actionable, verifiable data.”</p>
<p>With its <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a> range of products, Indicio provides all the components to quickly integrate verifiable credentials into existing systems and scale to meet needs, thereby providing a low-cost, low-code way for companies and organizations to build their own Trusted Digital Ecosystem with zero trust architecture. Indicio provides all the support, training, and continuous upgrades needed. Indicio Proven Works is a fully open source product allowing customers to own it and can customize it in whichever way meets their needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key benefits of Indicio Proven Works:</p>
 
 Employees can be quickly verified without having to use either email or multi-factor authentication. 
 Verifiable credentials can be layered onto existing systems quickly—implementations are quickly achievable and do not require replacing current investments. 
 Credentials can be quickly revoked and reissued if they expire, the employee leaves the company, or a security issue is identified. 
 The employee holds the information in a verifiable credential and can share it by consent using encrypted, peer-to-peer communication. 
 Simplifies enrollment with external payroll and benefits providers. 
 As a proof of identity, an employee credential can also be used in a wide variety of contexts where proof of employment is critical, such as insurance policies, mortgage applications, and bank loans 
 Simple, intuitive user interface using QR codes and swiping. 
 The credential verification process makes it easier to manage the continuous verification required by zero trust security architectures. 
 Verifiable credentials can be easily scaled to manage thousands of employees. 
 
<p>“Usually, new technology requires replacing existing systems or complex integrations and lots of development time. Indicio Proven Works is designed to eliminate all these obstacles,” said Ken Ebert, CTO at Indicio. “We’ve removed the learning curve to open source code and built a product that can be layered into your existing systems so that you can start issuing verifiable credentials quickly. You can customize the product to highly specific needs—or we can do it for you. This is the quickest, lowest cost route to digital transformation that delivers privacy and security on top of immediately actionable data.”</p>

				 <p>By Peter Strobel</p>
<p>JSON-LD W3C Verifiable Credentials are a popular credential format in the Decentralized Identity community. They complement the Anonymous Credentials (AnonCreds) credential format; both formats are supported by Aries Cloud Agent – Python (ACA-Py) and can be combined to fulfill a variety of use cases. This credential format was the subject of our Indicio Meetup last monday, and we hope those who attended took away valuable insights into the utility of JSON-LD credentials! During the incredible meetup, the Indicio experts covered five points key to understanding JSON-LD credentials and their use in ACA-Py!</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Five Main Takeaways:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are JSON-LD Credentials?</p>
<p>Starting with the name, JSON-LD stands for <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JavaScript Object Notation with Linked Data.</a> JSON-LD is a method of encoding linked data using JSON. The term “JSON-LD Credential” alone is somewhat ambiguous but the way it is colloquially used, it means a W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model compliant credential signed using Linked Data Proofs. These are more precisely referred to as Linked Data Proof Verifiable Credentials (LDP-VCs).</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why JSON-LD Credentials?</p>
<p>LDP-VCs can be held and presented by anyone, whether they are the subject of the credential or not! This handy feature allows a holder to present authentic data about a party other than ourselves. It may seem counterintuitive from an AnonCreds perspective, where privacy and control are guiding principles. However, in the case where we need credentials from public entities whose claims are about public information, the process of exchanging verifiable information becomes incredibly easy.</p>
<p>Additionally, LDP-VCs cryptography is simpler when compared to AnonCreds’ Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) signatures. CL signatures require Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) keys, which are large and potentially slow in constrained environments like Internet of Things (IoT). While there is specialized crypto hardware for IoT and similar constrained platforms, CL signatures are not widely supported on those modules. LDP-VCs, however, support multiple commonly-supported signature types, such as ED25519, BBS+, and JWS2020 (although for now, ACA-Py only supports ED25519 and BBS+).</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key Components + Features of LDP-VCs:</p>
<p>Type Property: Denotes the type of verifiable credential (passport, driver’s license, etc.). Helps processors determine if the object provided is appropriate for its goal. For example, you wouldn’t provide a driver’s license if you needed to get onto an international flight.</p>
<p>Issuer Property: Denotes the Issuer of a verifiable credential. This will generally be the Issuer’s DID.</p>
<p>Issuance Date: Denotes the date and time at which a credential becomes valid. Must be present and must be in XML dateTime format.</p>
<p>Credential Subject Property: Contains claims about one or more subjects. Must contain one or more objects containing one or more claims. In AnonCreds terms, we would call these “credential attributes.”</p>
<p>Context Property: Must contain all terms used in the credential. In LDP-VCs, you can specify many contexts; if your credential has multiple (and most will, since all must at least contain the core context which doesn’t define any claim terms), all contexts are joined together. If a term used in the credential is not found in these joined contexts, the document is not considered valid. In AnonCreds terms, this could be considered the equivalent of a credential schema</p>
<p>Proof Property: Enables verification of the claims expressed in a LDP-VC. At least one proof mechanism and the details necessary to evaluate the proof must be present.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarities to AnonCreds:</p>
<p>Where Indy AnonCreds uses credential schema’s to define credential attributes, LDP-VCs use what are known as “contexts,” as described above in Take Away #1. While the feature seems odd, these are similar to AnonCreds schemas, but there are some differences worth mentioning.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An LDP-VCs context defines the terms used in the credential, including claim attribute names, type, issuer, issuance date, and other core credential properties. AnonCreds schemas, however, only define two credential terms: attributes and claims.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contexts must contain all terms used in the credential, and in JSON-LD you can specify many contexts! If your credential has multiple contexts, all are joined together Frankenstein style. AnonCreds has a similar requirement that all attributes found in a credential must be found within the schema, but does not permit joining together different schemas.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use in ACA-Py:</p>
<p>While AnonCreds can use issue-credential v1 protocol with either present-proof v1 or v2, LDP-VCs in ACA-Py are only compatible with issue-credential v2 and present-proof v2 protocols, as they are flexible enough and have a sufficiently long list of supported signature types. This means that support for v2 versions of both protocols will need to be added to your agents in addition to LDP-VC support. ACA-Py supports both protocols, but you will need to adjust your controllers to the new v2 endpoints to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>LDP-VCs are still being developed through contribution and discussion within the Hyperledger community, and you can contribute too! Several open source groups are looking for new members, including the DIDComm Users Group (DIDComm UG), ACA-Py Users Group (ACAPUG), and Aries Working Group (AWG). You can find more information on open source projects Indicio contributes to <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-source/">here.</a></p>
<p>The Hyperledger Discord is also an excellent resource for engaging with the community/getting up to date on the latest code pushes. Discussion is always active as newer ACA-Py versions are getting released! Code contributions are also appreciated, though we do encourage people to stay up-to-date with community calls or open a GitHub issue before making major changes, to make sure contributions can be merged.</p>
<p>To learn more about JSON-LDs and ACA-Py we encourage you to watch the latest&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/7k37FdBYX6I">Indicio Insights</a>, or for a deeper dive, you can watch the recording of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i75OIZDmUs">full meetup</a> recently hosted by myself and Daniel Bluhm on the topic.</p>
<p>The next <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/290011345/">Indicio Meetup</a> is scheduled for December 13 and will feature Andin C.G. Bikker of Aruba, Nancy Norris of British Columbia’s Ministry for Energy, and Elizabeth M. Tanner, Esq., Secretary of Commerce, Rhode Island for a conversation on decentralized identity, digital transformation, and government.</p>

				 <p>Thank you to everyone who attended our 2022 Year in Review Webinar. We had a great time reflecting on the past year and discussing what’s to come in 2023. Christine did a great job going over Trust Registries &amp; Interoperability as well as Digital Products Passports. Darrell gave an insightful breakdown of 2023 trends and his perspective on Wallet Interoperability and the Trust Architecture Specification. We also answered some great questions sent in by our participants.</p>

 What is a Verifiable Credential <p>A Verifiable Credential (VC) is a cryptographically secure, tamper-evident digital-twin of paper documents. A Verifiable Credential possesses the same attributes as a paper-based credential — subject, issuing authority, credential type, attributes, evidence, and constraints — but is more trustworthy and secure in a digital&nbsp;format.</p><p>A full list of benefits of VCs&nbsp;include:</p>  Data Quality: Shared credential definitions power automated review at scale with zero ambiguity  Privacy Protection: Only authorized parties can access digital&nbsp;data  Authorization: Authoritative digital signatures can always be traced back to the original&nbsp;signer  Selective Disclosure: Credential holders can selectively share information as&nbsp;desired  Integrity: Tamper-evident data, signatures, and time stamps prove legitimacy and build reputation  Offline Verification: Credentials can be verified from paper or digital copies without internet&nbsp;access  <p>Verifiable Credentials are currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C standard, which means it is formally recommended as a set of technical specifications which developers can use to enable industry specific use cases. </a>This standard is already being adopted by large Fortune 500 companies and regulators across the world to enable trust and transparency in their processes and in developing actionable insights that rely on a trusted data&nbsp;set.</p> How Transmute Uses Verifiable Credentials: Secure Digital&nbsp;Twins <p>Verifiable Credentials are built into the Transmute DNA as a core competency in our business model and in our product, the Verifiable Data Platform (VDP), a platform that allows enterprise teams to secure the exchange of critical transactions in near-real time. Transmute has worked tirelessly, and continues to work, with supply chain organizations and conducting third party research to define the data elements within each Verifiable Credential. We publish each VC defined in the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/#credentials">Traceability Vocabulary, an open source repository </a>that anyone can see, and is particularly useful to developers and businesses. Recent examples of essential global trade Verifiable Credentials that Transmute has defined include: Commercial Invoice, Bill of Lading, Mill Test Report, and Packing&nbsp;List.</p><p>Today, Transmute offers 25+ Verifiable Credentials out-of-the-box and ready to use within Transmute VDP. Transmute VDP enables ecosystems of all sizes and industries to leverage the power of Verifiable Credentials via both our web application and the&nbsp;API.</p> Verifiable Credentials in the Supply Chain Industry: A Steel Industry&nbsp;Example <p>Today, there are several examples of the use of Verifiable Credentials in the supply chain industry. We’ll highlight one example below — Mill Test&nbsp;Reports.</p><p>The Mill Test Report is a critical quality assurance document used to certify the chemical and physical properties in metals. When importing steel into the U.S., the Mill Test Report is required for entry by U.S. CBP, but in its current insecure format, is susceptible to:</p>  Human error that can stall shipments, halt business, and unnecessarily lose money for businesses and the government;  Forgeries to reduce their tariff fees, update the country of origin to a more desirable country, overstate the quality of the steel, and myriad other reasons that provide an unfair advantage over companies adhering to global regulatory standards   My Experience: Verifiable Credentials can Transform Global&nbsp;Trade <p>Prior to Transmute, I worked exclusively deploying proprietary supply chain software and had no exposure to Verifiable Credentials. I found that one of the core reasons why companies would deploy new software was digitalization. Many companies still operate today via spreadsheets which are not scalable, not very reportable, and not efficient. The companies I interacted with leveraged software to enhance their business processes and facilitate their day-to-day operations digitally; specifically, they did so by having systems digitally create a Commercial Invoice, PO, BOL, Proof of Delivery, and other critical trade documents. These documents would then be archived or printed then provided to another company as the goods move throughout the supply chain, which is minimal digitization without any security measures.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials have the power to optimize digitization and bring trust and traceability to trade documents, ensuring that data remains accurate and tamper-proof as it moves from company-to-company. Given my hands-on experience in global trade, I am confident that the supply chain industry is on the brink of a major break-through in technology with the implementation of Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Matt Berry, Transmute’s Enterprise Delivery Manager, works with organizations of every size to achieve maximum value using the Transmute SaaS platform.</p><p>Connect with Matt on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-berry-99905646">LinkedIn</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

 Despite being one of the most challenging periods in crypto history, the cryptocurrency exchange giant has doubled down on its growth plans.&nbsp; 



 



<p>American crypto exchange giant Coinbase has announced plans to appoint new executives to its top team to boost its European expansion efforts. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision for Coinbase to focus on the European market seems like a natural step to take, considering the region’s recent efforts to bring stability and consistency to the market via the creation of the world’s most substantial crypto regulatory framework, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> and the complimentary <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer in Funds</a> (TFR) Act. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase, which counts over 73 million global users with operations in over one hundred countries, has promoted several of its long-serving employees to capitalize on the growing, yet still unstable market. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The new executive appointments come at a time when the industry is still reeling from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/23/ftx-binance-crypto-market">failure of FTX</a>, which collapsed during a liquidity crisis in November, triggering widespread anxiety and igniting calls for stricter regulatory supervision of the crypto sector. Like other prominent crypto service providers, Coinbase is also suffering from the impact of the downturn in the crypto industry, which has only been exacerbated by FTX’s collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The turmoil of the last few weeks has certainly impacted the reputation of the crypto market, with the full extent of the consequences of the crypto winter only to be revealed in the months to come. The “drip by drip” release of information regarding the FTX downfall makes long-term predictions more difficult. It also interferes with the ideal strategy of being able to move quickly in order to identify and address causes of&nbsp;mishaps, devise safeguards, and move on. In this unique case, however, new information continues to come to light on an almost daily basis, which would appear to be clear warning signs to industry insiders. </p>



<p>In the short term, Coinbase’s move will likely be seen as a positive, and lead to a renewed incentive by policymakers and regulators to ensure Europe can offer a safe and secure regulatory environment. It is also probable that with the arrival of such a large player, a benchmark of performance and conduct will be set. This will undoubtedly increase competition among the smaller, European crypto exchange platforms, and ultimately be a positive for the crypto consumer.&nbsp;</p>



 Breaking down and building up.&nbsp; 



<p>Despite Coinbase’s planned European expansion, in June 2022, it dismissed 1,100 employees, and a further 60 employees were laid off from its recruitment team in early November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of its new appointments include the promotion of its long-serving employees. Patrick Elyas, formerly the Market Director of Expansion at Coinbase EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and the African region), will now assume a role mainly focusing on European expansion. Elke Karksens will take over the position of Coinbase’s country director in the UK. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael Schroeder, previously working as Chief Compliance and Risk Officer at Bittrex, has been appointed as the director of controls for Germany. Corman Dinan, formerly serving as General Manager at Crypto.com in Ireland, will assume the role of director of Ireland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the new executives’ supervision, Coinbase plans to broaden its customer base, introduce new digital financial products, expand into new markets, and join forces with regulators, policymakers, and financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new appointments are in keeping with Coinbase’s belief that Europe, the Middle East, and Africa were taking the initiative in creating a secure and suitable regulatory environment for crypto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nana Murugesan, Coinbase’s Vice President of International and Business Development, and Daniel Seifert, Regional Vice President and Managing Director, see the regions as standard setters, and an example of what can be achieved when the “political will” is present. According to Murugesan and Seifert, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">repercussions and dangers</a> for investors and clients of an offshore, unregulated entity have never been more evident than in the past few weeks.</p>

 Coinbase ceases support for 4 digital coins.&nbsp; 



<p>If any further evidence was needed to attest to how notoriously unpredictable the crypto market could be, on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-coinbase-wallet-removes-xrp-support-whats-going-on.htm">November 29,</a> Coinbase announced that its Coinbase Wallet would no longer be supporting four digital coins: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Ripple (XRP) as of January 2023. &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the exchange, the decision to delist these four leading digital coins is part of its regular evaluation to introduce new structures that will improve accessibility on Web3. Consequently, the exchange cited “low use” as its reason for ceasing its support for these crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exchange has assured customers that their balances from any of the now-delisted assets are still linked to their addresses, meaning they can access them via the Coinbase Wallet recovery process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It is also worth mentioning that the announcement refers to the Coinbase Wallet and app discontinuing support for the digital coins. You can still buy the coins on Coinbase and Coinbase pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The abrupt delisting of XRP surprised many, considering it ranks as the seventh-largest crypto asset by market cap. Furthermore, XRP has been subject to a lot of speculation due to its ongoing litigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC). With the summary judgment date nearing, it is a surprise that Coinbase decided not to wait to hear the results of the verdict.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The platform stopped the trading of XRP in January 2021 after a lawsuit between the issuer, Ripple, and the US SEC. Moreover, the crypto exchange backed investors initiating proceedings against the Department of Treasury against Tornado Cash over the sanction. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of this, the exchange revealed its transaction volume decreased by 44% from $655 million (second quarter of 2022) to $366 million in the third fiscal quarter (Q3 2022).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to delist these crypto assets could be considered a risky move for Coinbase. Each coin possesses a great deal of support from the crypto community and could therefore discourage people from purchasing other digital currencies on their site in fear that they may also be delisted sooner than one would expect. That said, this perhaps further highlights the risk profile – or intelligence –&nbsp;of Coinbase. Despite “headwinds” they are making investment in growth, and are not alone, as just a week later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/goldman-sachs-hunt-bargain-crypto-firms-after-ftx-fiasco-2022-12-06/">Goldman Sachs</a> announced it was preparing to make significant investment in crypto ecosystem assets.&nbsp;</p>



 Role of the regulators.&nbsp; 



<p>The chief priority for regulators and policymakers is to find the right balance between promoting financial stability and consumer protection and fostering innovation and accessibility in the financial markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upcoming crypto regulations, such as MiCA and TFR, whose main objective is to facilitate the safe and responsible use of cryptocurrencies across the EU region, have clearly played a crucial role in Coinbase’s decision to enter the market. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These legal frameworks will improve the playing field for service providers and enable them to maintain high industry standards, provide greater protection, and build trust. At the same time, a legal framework and stricter verification requirements for crypto asset transfers to and from self-hosted wallets will enable service providers and customers a clearer path for further investment and growth within this ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Leading by example.&nbsp; 



<p>Coinbase offers more than 170 crypto assets on its platform and is considered one of the most secure crypto exchanges. Many newcomers use the exchange to purchase their first ever crypto assets. The brand recognition as a trusted entry point cannot be underestimated as we enter a new phase of this crypto advancement in the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are, however, more than 500 other global crypto exchanges. While the smaller exchanges may tend to focus solely on the domestic or regional market, the larger ones attract customers from around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision for a crypto company as large and influential as Coinbase to enter Europe should be welcomed by big and small crypto exchanges alike. Recent events have caused a lot of apprehension, and affected trust in the market, but this move shows that Coinbase maintains confidence in the industry and is demonstrating it while belts are being tightened globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although 2022 has not been as successful a year for crypto as 2021, 2023 looks like it could well be the making for the crypto industry as service providers prepare for the final implementation of MiCA in 2024. Increased attention and awareness of crypto has led to a surge of interest from everyday users to multinational investment banks, as referenced above. With wider adoption, especially from global corporation <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">comes more opportunities</a> for registered crypto exchanges and traditional banks that may be looking to enter the space for the first time.&nbsp;</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can expand, even amid an evolving crypto regulatory landscape. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;</p>

 Harness the Security of Enterprise-Grade MPC and Democratize it for Mainstream Users <p>As the leading non-custodial authentication infrastructure provider with over 8M monthly users, Web3Auth has launched the MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallet SDK. We are aiming to bring seamless logins and enterprise-grade security from the institutional level to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>To date, more than 20% of all mined Bitcoin is lost due to mismanaged or stolen seed phrases. To remove this main friction of web3 onboarding and key management issue, it’s time to say bye to the seed&nbsp;phrase.</p><p>On a mission to provide the most seamless login experience for users, wallets, and dapps, recently we integrated our MPC via @Metamask snaps. Take a sneak peek at a Web3 world without seed&nbsp;phrases</p><p>Other than Metamask, we are onboarding key Web2 gaming players like <a href="https://www.neowizglobal.com/">NEOWIZ</a> and <a href="https://glip.gg/">Glip</a> <a href="https://www.nafeza.gov.eg/en">NAFEZA</a>. Egypt’s newly launched customs platform for importing and exporting also leverages Web3Auth’s MPC technology to seamlessly and securely onboard its users to the blockchain.</p><p>A lot of exciting partners in the pipeline, but first let’s review some&nbsp;basics…</p> What is&nbsp;MPC? <p>MPC, or Multi-Party Computation, is Web3’s version of multi-factor authentication (MFA). It allows users to manage their keys intuitively by using multiple factors to protect their keys, instead of just relying on a single seed phrase to remove it in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This makes it possible to design crypto wallets that rely on multiple factors to access a user’s funds. It is currently the gold standard for enterprise-grade crypto custody solutions and is used widely by exchanges and financial institutions for managing&nbsp;crypto.</p> Why use MPC technology?   MPC is currently the golden standard for enterprise key management which Bitgo and Fireblocks currently offer.  Coinbase introduced an MPC alpha/beta into their wallet earlier in the year, and now we’re unveiling our MPC SDK that enables any wallet or app to do the same for their&nbsp;users.  Being able to build on the latest and greatest, we’ve optimized the infrastructure to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for globally-distributed low-latency signing.  Our MPC SDK leverages existing and familiar UI/UX flows, including simple one-click logins and others, check out the flow&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1022785836284129320/1034363507157782538/One_Click_flow.gif">here</a>   How is our SDK different from other MPC solutions?   Our MPC is the perfect Externally Owned Account (EOA) and can be paired with Gnosis Safe and other Smart Contract Wallet infrastructure (more on this coming&nbsp;soon).  The existing MPC solutions offered today are all targeted at large enterprises. These MPC solutions are expensive, require a long setup process, or are just too slow to run on consumer&nbsp;devices.  <p>We think that MPC is too important and too crucial of a technology to be kept out of reach of the average user. MPC security should be the standard for all web3 wallets today. As a wallet infrastructure provider, we have optimized our MPC SDKs to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for geo-distributed low-latency signing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a game, an app, a Chrome extension, or even a web wallet running in a mobile browser — our SDKs support&nbsp;that.</p> Our MPC technology key feature&nbsp;includes   1.2-second transaction speed (challenge it if you don’t believe&nbsp;us).  We are chain agnostic (secp256k1, ed25519, BLS and more&nbsp;support)  Our SDK can be embedded into any web, mobile, and native application.  The MPC SDK is geo-distributed and horizontally scaled for global distribution.  <p>For those of you that are already familiar with the multi-factor keys security model at Web3Auth, this blog is just another incremental step towards improving private key security.</p><p>For those of you who aren’t familiar, here’s how multi-factor keys&nbsp;work:</p> Leveraging our MPC SDK, you can expect the following benefits   Reduces account loss from misplaced seed&nbsp;phrases  <p>There is no seed phrase to manage — shares are managed by intuitive MFA flows that users are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>2. Prevent compromised device vulnerabilities</p><p>User accounts are not subjected to frontend vulnerabilities as MPC’s joint computation allows for keyless&nbsp;usage.</p><p>3. Avoid losing funds from dubious transactions</p><p>Safeguard your users’ accounts with a flexible policy engine to set rules — daily transaction limits and blacklist scams.</p><p>4. Expect fluid experiences</p><p>Expect a low latency of less than 1.5s for both login and transaction signing. Allow your users to focus on engaging with your&nbsp;product.</p><p>5. You own the UX, we can be a white-label service&nbsp;provider</p><p>Our MPC can be embedded into any dapp and/or wallet — you own the experience.</p><p>6.

<p>Learn how Fission models its work and communication style on the distributed systems we help build and support.</p> <p>Fission is a Canadian company but has been fully remote since its inception. Our team of talented Fissioneers is distributed across 7 countries and 5 continents. While remote work arrangements have been popular amongst tech companies for a long time, it goes deeper than that for Fission. We are not only a distributed company, we are a distributed systems company! Our work focuses on building tools for IPFS, a protocol and peer to peer network. <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/diving-deeper-webnative-file-system/">WNFS</a> and eventually <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">Dialog</a> and <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-breaking-down-ipvm/">IPVM</a> would not be possible without distributed systems.</p><p>It's interesting how our company structure mirrors the work we do. In fact, computer programmer Melvin Conway remarked on this very phenomenon:</p><blockquote>"Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure." - Melvin Conway</blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway's Law</a>, as it has come to be known, basically says that a company's complex products will inevitably end up being shaped like the system they are designed within or for. </p> The Benefits of Async Communication <p>As a company that hires colleagues across time zones and countries, async communication is vitally important to us. It wouldn't be sustainable if we asked a colleague in Asia to join a meeting or be available mid-day U.S. Eastern time. And we'd much rather hire the right person for the job than the person that was fine but available. And there are so many other benefits to async communication, including an <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#six-major-benefits-of-asynchronous-working">increasing employee agency, alleviating stress and supporting mental health, and boosting efficiency</a>. &nbsp;</p> Discord <p>There are several methods and tools that we use to work efficiently in a fully remote/distributed company. A forum is an excellent tool for async communication, and we'll share more on how we utilize Discourse for our <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/">Talk forum</a> in a future post in this series. </p><p>So why then, are we talking about Discord today? Discord offers many benefits, and we've developed some unique techniques for using it in a more asynchronous way. For those unfamiliar, Discord is a text, voice, and video communication platform. It started out as a popular place for gamers to connect and stream their adventures, and today it has become a popular place for building and nurturing communities with <a href="https://discord.com/company">150 million monthly active users</a>. </p><p>Fission's Discord server has two main functions - to serve our developer community, and to serve our internal community. We love being able to flex between chats with colleagues to adding to discussions or answering questions from our developer community while using one tool! We have channels for "start-here" and "server-guidelines" to help give all members their footing, and then it expands from there, with channel topics ranging from distributed systems to identity and auth to owning your data.</p><p>Today we'll put the spotlight on how we're leveraging Discord and the ways we've made it a powerful async tool for our team.</p> #Stand-Up-Down Channel <p>Discord uses channels to organize topics, and categories to organize those channels. One channel we use every day is #stand-up-down. This is where we share what we're working on that day. Most of us track our to-do lists using our own methods, but the purpose of sharing our daily tasks here comes down to transparency and accountability. </p><p>Transparently sharing what we're working on gives other Fissioneers some insight into what we have on our plates. It also often sparks helpful comments from other team members. For example, if I post that I'm going to do outreach for a particular project, a team member might comment that they can introduce me to a specific person directly. </p><p>Accountability to ourselves and to our team members is also very important. It removes the need to ask team members for updates because we share them directly in the channel. Managers can see at a glance what their whole team is working on that day, which can help them plan projects accordingly.</p><p>We also like to share how we're feeling by using a traffic light system - a green emoji means you're doing great, yellow means you're not quite feeling like yourself, and red is a heads-up that you're struggling and may need some additional patience or understanding from others. </p><p>For example, if a colleague just travelled 12 hours and changed multiple planes, cars, trains, and time zones to get to where they were going, they'll likely be feeling jetlagged and exhausted the next day. When this is the case, a colleague can post a yellow or red emoji. This usually signals they need extra time to rest/recover, so perhaps expect some delays in responses or changes to their work schedule in the meantime. </p>An example of a "stand up" post<p>Throughout the day colleagues will check off tasks they've completed or note which to-do's are getting pushed. We may also share a "stand down" message where we give an update on what was completed or provide additional notes if we feel it would be helpful to add more context. </p> Monologue Channels <p>One Fission Discord invention people outside the company love to learn more about is our monologue channels. Every person who is part of the team gets their own channel. These channels act like our virtual desks. Colleagues can swing by and have a chat, or drop a note if the owner is away. This is particularly useful in bringing something to a person’s attention without pushing a notification, which is really important in an asynchronous environment when we are being mindful of our colleague's timezones.</p><p>Monologue channels are a space for people to think out loud, let others know if they are AFK for an appointment, etc. (A note on AFK - At Fission we encourage breaks and don't require colleagues to signal when they're going for lunch, back from lunch, taking a walk to reset, etc. We like to give everyone the space to complete their work without feeling pressured to give constant updates.)</p><p>Since they are visible to all team members, sometimes one person will see a link or note that someone else has shared in a person's monologue channel, and join in on the conversation (similar to any other channel in the server). We call these "monologue parties". 🥳 This can turn out to be very helpful, because sometimes others have additional insight that you didn't know to ask for! </p>A snippet of our monologue channels. We also choose emojis to represent us.<p>If you want to ask your co-worker a question that is a bit more time-sensitive, you can mention them by typing @ followed by their handle. We've found this much more helpful than back and forth emails.</p> Department Categories <p>We have loosely defined departments characterized by the different projects our talented Fissioneers are working on. Organizing these channels under department categories makes them easier to find when we are searching for certain info or want to pose a question to several team members at once/whoever sees it first without notifying them all individually. </p><p>For example, we have a category that houses our marketing, operations, design, and events channels all in one place. Since marketing helps with events and operations helps with marketing and so on, it acts as a mini home base for team members within the larger server.</p><p>We have many channels in our server, and we never want a colleague to feel like they need to keep up with every conversation. Department categories allow us to introduce hierarchy into the server. This, combined with a special "internal" channel, helps alleviate information overload. </p> <p>These are a few strategies we've used to help us work more intuitively in a decentralized and distributed company.

     Intro 
                   <p>Our award-winning management book ‘Everything Transaction’ is now also available in German. (‘Alles Transaktion’).</p>

<p>In an increasingly digital world, every interaction is becoming a transaction. These transactions go beyond the exchange of money in return for a product or service. In fact, exchanges based on data are rapidly becoming the norm in the digital world. These data-driven transactions are becoming relevant across industries, and especially in the financial services industry in the shape of ‘Open Finance’. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Financial institutions have reached a strategic crossroads and need to answer several fundamental questions, including: How will transactions evolve in the context of financial services? What role should entities like financial institutions and service providers play? And which commercial opportunities and risks are involved?</p>

<p>These and many more questions are answered in the award-winning book called ‘Everything Transaction’, which has now also been published in German (‘Alles Transaktion’). The book offers numerous up-to-date insights and concepts for players operating in an increasingly data-driven economy, and helps executives better navigate the digital world from the unique perspective of data-driven transactions.</p>

  Tap to ID leverages SSI and NFC for identity and smart access control by 
the tap of a mobile phone or NFC smart card. It revolutionises smart access 
control to digital services or physical environments. This work has been 
partly funded by NGI eSSIF-lab and was presented at the essif-lab final 
event.

 At the Turning Point — How Crypto Interacts with Real World&nbsp;Assets  Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta’s Presentation to the London Blockchain Summit on 17th November&nbsp;2022 <p>What I’m here to talk about is literally where’s the money. Here we are, we’re now 15 years into crypto, seven or eight years into Ethereum… There’s been an enormous amount of high fortunes made, fortunes lost, made, lost, made, lost, made, lost, made, lost, made, lost, made,&nbsp;lost…</p><p>And we could do a lot better, right? Getting out of this cycle of hype and destruction and hype and destruction and hype and destruction, and another bunch of awful, hideous, nonsense happens and a whole bunch of people go… We’ve seen this, and it seems to be never-ending, because it just turns out that deregulated finance is not really safe at any speed. It doesn’t mean it couldn’t be made to work, but we don’t have mechanisms, and as a result we’re stuck in this hell of cyclical boom and blowout. And that hell of cyclical boom and blowout, we have to escape that, if we’re going to turn this into a real industry, rather than something which is going to be like the butt TV show jokes in 20 years, like&nbsp;Friends.</p><blockquote>We have an amazing transactional machinery, we can buy and sell anything on the blockchain</blockquote><p>To escape this cyclical boom-bust cycle, we have to put fundamentally valuable assets in. We have an amazing transactional machinery, we can buy and sell anything on the blockchain, as long as it can be defined using some kind of digital record, and I mean anything. Things that you didn’t even think were property became property: pictures of imaginary moneys, publicly-tradable essentially stock in companies that only just began to exist, like you do an IPO off your original deck. Lots and lots and lots of things have been tried, where we’ve invented new classes of property, and then we’ve sold those new classes of property on&nbsp;chain.</p><p>What I want to suggest is that the flaws of the blockchain industry are the flaws of the new classes of property that we’re trading, not flaws of the technology for trade. We have exchange infrastructure which is powerful enough to do anything, you can imagine a new asset class, you can turn it into a token, you can sell the tokens and the exchange infrastructure can carry it, but the problem is that most of these newly-invented kinds of property are crap. And as a result, you get a wave of enthusiasm where everybody is like “Oh, this new kind of property is amazing!” and then the new kind of property just implodes.</p><blockquote>Separate out the fantastic technology we have for doing trade from the crappy assets which turn out to&nbsp;explode</blockquote><p>What I’m suggesting is that at a strategic level we can separate out the fantastic technology we have for doing trade from the crappy assets which turn out to explode every time we look at them wrong. And hard assets like gold, real estate, other kinds of commercial assets loaded into the blockchain, with the existing transaction architectures that we have, I believe this is the future of the crypto industry, it’s the everything exchange. And <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-mattereum-universal-bridge-e86bca2db220">all of the infrastructure that we’ve built</a>, whether the stuff is non-fungible or fungible, whether it’s physical, atomic things, or whether it’s liquid assets like wheat or corn or whatever it happens to be… We have a global exchange infrastructure that’s capable of handling it, we have ways of minting the things, creating and managing them… We could build extremely transparent representations of value, where you can drill down digitally to see every last detail about something, and if this is what we do in the next round of activity in the crypto industry, that round might be the round that doesn’t bust. Because the collapse in these systems has not been a collapse triggered by the exchange infrastructure failing; it’s a collapse that’s been triggered by the assets&nbsp;failing.</p><p>Now, I note here FTX is kind of an exception to that. But generally speaking, apart from poorly, poorly-managed financial architectures like Bear Stearns… It’s not that the underlying machinery goes wrong and the Bitcoin blockchain falls over and everybody loses their Bitcoin. The machines for moving the value are secure; the actual sources of value are less secure. If we put more secure, harder value on chain, we’re going to get a very different world, we’re going to get a better&nbsp;world.</p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/relevance-of-on-chain-asset-tokenization">report </a>about this stuff that just came out from <a href="https://www.bcg.com/">Boston Consulting Group</a>, and the report is startling — we’re right in the middle of this space, and we’ve found this report remarkably startling! They’re talking about 10% of global GDP, $16 trillion a year of tokenised legal assets by 2030. And they’re not the only people talking in this direction, there’s a whole bunch of other sources that are making noises in this direction. There seems to be a general consensus that hard assets are what comes next, and that consensus is from real-world entities like Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, like actual players in the real world say tokenisation of equity, security tokens, bond markets, equity and real estate… all of these kinds of things are what they see as being the future of this&nbsp;space.</p><blockquote>They’re talking about 10% of global GDP, $16 trillion a year of tokenised legal assets by&nbsp;2030</blockquote><p>And these numbers get much larger than the entire crypto industry very, very quickly. Because we’re not creating that value from scratch, as Bitcoin goes from being worth 25 cents to $25,000; what we’re talking about is taking existing value, and just moving how that value is transferred. Instead of it being transferred on Crest, they’re transferring it on Ethereum — simple.</p><p>And this kind of growth, it’s predictable inasmuch as if you have better exchange technology, when people have to sell something or buy something, they will do it using whatever the best available exchange is; if the best available exchange for buying and selling something is a crypto exchange, a crypto exchange is where you’re buying and selling. But at this point, if what you are looking at was a bunch of hard assets — like gold, classic cars, oil paintings, 50 tonnes of wheat, 35 acres of agricultural land — if all of those things are trading in the same exchange as some Bitcoin and some Ether, is that crypto exchange, or is that just the everything exchange?</p><blockquote>He’s going to use the blockchain to handle property rights on&nbsp;Mars</blockquote><p>As long as you can figure out how to tokenise the value, then you can buy and sell in the same exchange infrastructure we have, using the blockchain to keep the systems honest. And that doesn’t have to stay within this tokenised business-as-usual sector. It is possible to go from tokenised business-as-usual, this set of assets here: listed equity, unlisted equity, other equity, investment funds, bonds, all this stuff… Yes, you can tokenise all of that stuff, you can securitise it, you can have securities exchanges and it will work. But also, there’s other tokenisable assets, which we’ve got $4.8 trillion by 2030… That doesn’t have to be existing classes of assets, that can be new kinds of things. Securitisations of revenue streams, there’s a bunch of that stuff happening in crypto, it’s not so much done in the real world — that could become a large sector. Elon Musk expects to have rockets on Mars by that time, you know that he’s going to use the blockchain to handle property rights on Mars in all probability, because if you’re going to take a new planet and carve it up into acres that people could go out and put solar panels on, probably an actual thing to do would be to use a blockchain, in the same way if you did it in the 1990s you’d use an SQL database.</p><p>So, this prospect of taking the existing systems and getting them on chain, and taking the new systems and getting them on chain, you wind up in a position where everything becomes interfungible, rather than having a bunch of separated, balkanised markets, which are very, very loosely connected. This also opens up possibilities for things like smart barter. There’s a company called NeoSwap, they have an algorithm for switching around value between lots of different people, as long as everything is represented as NFTs, without requiring it to be bought and sold at every step — extremely powerful, because it means you can do trade with minimum liquidity.</p><p>And it’s not an unrealistic rate of growth, when they say $16 trillion by 2030. If you look at the influx of stablecoins, $160 billion of hard assets went into the crypto ecosystem in a two-year period, and the rapidity of that transfer was because you didn’t have to make the assets from scratch; the assets were already there, you just move them out of the wire transfer land and you put them back into blockchain land. So, if you were doing this kind of transfer, but it was stocks, it was bonds, it was real estate, it was gold bullion, it was everything else, you could get a very, very rapid movement of trillions of value on chain, without having this weird thing that money is being printed and coming from nowhere — it’s not a fiat economy at this point; it’s actually an asset-backed economy.</p><p>Now, the question then is could this possibly work, is it legally possible to do this? And the answer is yes. My company has done this in custodied assets in five jurisdictions, and transactions in another three, out of the 170 jurisdictions that it’s possible to do this in. So this is not some kind of long-term, long-reach pipedream; buying and selling physical assets as tokens with the correct legal bindings behind them is a thing you can do here and now over almost the entire world. It’s trickier if the things that you’re buying and selling are things like securities, but if you’re selling commodities, or if you’re selling gold bricks or whatever it is, physical artwork, classic cars… The vast majority of the sort of battle rattle of civilisation is saleable right now all over the world, on relatively clear and easily understood deterministic legals. It’s not that we need massive changes in law in every jurisdiction to be able to do this; buying and selling a physical object on eBay and buying and selling a physical object on OpenSea look very similar to the&nbsp;law.</p><p>And that track record, we’ve literally just gone in the last year and a half, asset class by asset class by asset class by asset class, starting with the infamous William Shatner toy collection — I say “toys”, but I think that’s a bad word for that stuff; memorabilia [laughter] Yeah, because one does not want to invoke the wrath of Shatner — just look what he did to Jeff Bezos! That landscape, we’ve just gone asset class by asset class by asset class by asset class, making sure that it works… And in the course of a year and a half, we literally went from Shatner’s memorabilia collection to a two-million-dollar plot of land on the south coast of England. And that trajectory is not just stuff inside of the UK; that’s across a whole bunch of different countries.</p><blockquote>We went a little deeper into the legals, we solved it for a whole set of jurisdictions and a whole bunch of different asset&nbsp;classes</blockquote><p>So, that capability, now that it’s here, we can scale assets on this platform very, very fast. And we are not the only people doing this. We took a somewhat different approach from most of the other companies who are in this space. Most of those companies operate inside of one jurisdiction for one asset class; we went a little deeper into the legals, we solved it for a whole set of jurisdictions and a whole bunch of different asset classes. But at the end of the day, it’s not just “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-mattereum-universal-bridge-e86bca2db220">Hey, Mattereum does this amazing thing!”</a> it’s that this amazing thing is the future of the blockchain space, a whole bunch of different people have understood that… And what does this space look like in two years, if you come to conferences like this, and two-thirds of the room are gold industry, real estate industry, airline industry, talking about tokenising and selling the physical things that they’re buying and selling: airline tickets, concert tickets, real estate… I keep coming back to bullion, because given how unstable the financial markets are and how much inflation we have, bullion is a potentially very important asset class, once you can make it appropriately tradable internationally in blockchain-style transactions, rather than the current restrictions which make it hard to make payments in&nbsp;gold.</p><p>The reason that we can do all of this stuff is British law is really, really substantial on these kind of issues. The legal innovation that’s happened in the UK in the last five years, in terms of really getting down to the bones of what the blockchain is, what blockchain transactions are, what tokens are, how all of this stuff really works is absolutely world-class — I mean, this stuff is profound!</p><blockquote>Everything is being seen as a financial instrument. This Law Commission document will change&nbsp;that</blockquote><p>The Law Commission has a <a href="https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lawcom-prod-storage-11jsxou24uy7q/uploads/2022/07/Digital-Assets-Consultation-Paper-Law-Commission-1.pdf">consultation document</a>, it’s a philosophical examination of what digital is. Very sophisticated legal minds looking at digital, and saying, “From first principles, under English common law, what is that really?” And the advantage that it has for us as the industry is that right now the sort of power grab is that everything is being seen as a financial instrument. This Law Commission document will change that. If something is regulated as being a toy, then if it’s a digital toy or a physical toy, it’s still a toy, and English common law says, “This is how you handle toys, and here’s the digital part, and here’s the non-digital part of the&nbsp;law.”</p><p>So, in breaking down this idea that everything on chain is a financial asset, it also hugely reduces the complexity of doing ordinary, everyday things on chain. Because if you’re a corner shop that makes NFTs, you really shouldn’t be regulated in the same way as a bank. You’re an artist, you’re a working artist, you have a loft, you paint things paintings, you take pictures and you sell the pictures… If I sell them on eBay I don’t need any kind of license, and if I sell them as an NFT… You know, it’s just the regulation is kind of out of whack, and the reason the regulation is out of whack is because it wasn’t a regulatory problem, it’s a legislative problem, and the UK Judiciary are going through the process of figuring out the correct legal treatment of these&nbsp;things.</p><p>And if you compare this approach to how primitive the approach is in for example America, this is kind of sort of what Britain does for a living. We’re really good at this kind of deep problem-solving in a lot of different domains, this one happens to be legal, but don’t forget the the AI revolution also started in the UK with DeepMind. So, this is the sort of fundamental bedrock.</p><p>And then in the UK, this guy here, Sir Geoffrey Vos, is the most senior civil judge in the UK, so he’s the boss of all bosses for anything commercial… This is his statement on the blockchain, delivered I think February of this year, and the real payload is this section at the bottom: “My hope is that English common law will prove to be the law of choice for borderless blockchain technology, as its uptake grows exponentially in the months and years to come,” drawing parallels to the €600 trillion of OTC derivatives that currently run under English law. And those derivatives are from all over the world, but because you can transfer the seat of dispute, so you could pick your choice of courts and judges, everybody that can bring their disputes into English common law does, because our system of justice is kind of fantastic. I mean, yes, it’s still lawyers, and yes, it’s still hard, but it’s dramatically less hard, because there’s so much sophistication in the legal system — no offence to our cousins over there; he’s giving me the look, the stern eye… [laughter] “Yeah,&nbsp;yeah.”</p><blockquote>“My hope is that English common law will prove to be the law of choice for borderless blockchain technology, as its uptake grows exponentially in the months and years to come,” — Sir Geoffrey&nbsp;Vos</blockquote><p>Nonetheless, we have high-level support, there’s no doubt at all that this as an approach is credible, and the expectation is that English law is going to become better and better and better at handling digital assets in a way that is not upsetting. As a result, if you bring your digital assets to the UK so they’re all handled under UK law, you don’t wind up with this terrible problem where the local jurisdiction that you’re in doesn’t understand how to handle the assets, and you wind up regulating 120 countries, which is not going to work. We need a uniform framework, and if it’s good enough for the derivatives market, it ought to be good enough for&nbsp;digital.</p><p>Comment: I want to actually add, I was thinking while you were saying that: one of the things you cannot do in the United States is you cannot by contract grant a court jurisdiction, so we can’t enter into a contract where I say courts in Kansas or in New York will adjudicate a dispute, if there’s no nexus to that jurisdiction. That’s actually not a problem here. Anybody, somebody in Singapore can enter into a contract with somebody in Russia, saying that disputes will be adjudicated in London, and English courts will accept that jurisdiction is my understanding — it’s a very different approach, and it’s&nbsp;smart.</p><blockquote>Good law lets you get physical assets on&nbsp;chain.</blockquote><p>Yeah, yeah. And particularly if you’re working with arbitration courts, LCIA arbitration… You get multiple different mechanisms for picking your venue, you get access to good law, and the good law lets you get physical assets on&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Final slide: this is a map of what I think are the eight fundamental sources of value on the blockchain. Just about anybody that is making money on chain is executing one or more of these strategies, and a lot of the confusion and the damage that we’ve seen on chain comes because people believe that somebody is executing one strategy, and they’re actually executing another strategy.</p><p>The big problem that we have on chain is that you’ve got people who you think are selling transactional efficiency, and they are actually Ponzi schemes! And that confusion about what you’re doing for a living, what the business that you’re in, this is the thing that has brought the blockchain into such terrible disrepute, because the system is so powerful that you can turn almost anything into a Ponzi scheme without it being apparent!</p><blockquote>If we’re going to save the industry, we have to get away from the bad sources of value generation, and only be in the good&nbsp;ones.</blockquote><p>So, my recommendation is: for the next phase of the blockchain, make absolutely sure you understand what business your counterparties are in at every single step. And for yourselves, look at this very hard, and make sure that you’re somewhere up here with transactional efficiency, or you’re an exchange, or you’re selling something that you made yourself, and that you’ve not drifted into one of the dead zones on this thing. Because if we’re going to save the industry, we have to get away from the bad sources of value generation, and only be in the good&nbsp;ones.</p> Postscript <a href="https://www.shortform.com/pdf/technological-revolutions-and-financial-capital-pdf-carlota-perez">https://www.shortform.com/pdf/technological-revolutions-and-financial-capital-pdf-carlota-perez</a><p>Crypto’s seven waves of innovation have each mimicked a Perez Surge Cycle (here’s a <a href="https://medium.com/invao/blockchain-quo-vadis-applying-the-perez-surge-cycle-c15ba685c831">highly recommended piece from 2019 on blockchains and the surge cycle</a>).

<p>Neighbourhoods is an answer to the question “who controls my social feed in web3?” </p><p>Their social sensemaking tools allow groups to customize how reactions such as likes, upvotes, and content moderation flags are weighted and used to control the display of users’ feeds or other contexts like the front page of a site — whether its filled with posts, songs, poll proposals, or any other digital resource appropriate to that group. Rather than a blackboxed algorithm and corporate content moderators, communities get to set their own rules, fit to purpose. By customizing generic tools to their specific culture, a community can develop their own unique social space (or neighboorhood). Neighbourhoods is also developing methods to transfer data and reputation between communities, helping them translate meaning between cultures. &nbsp; </p> Neighbourhoods at a glance <p>Description: Neighbourhoods is creating a tool kit for developing groupware with customizable culture and social intelligence. </p><p>Quoting Director of Communications Emaline Friedman from one of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du6gl485zAU">past salons</a>:</p><blockquote>“Neighbourhoods is a framework for online communities who want more control over their group culture.”</blockquote>  GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods">https://github.com/neighbour-hoods</a>  Demo videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM7Oc8aY4FZ6S7U9onj14cQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM7Oc8aY4FZ6S7U9onj14cQ</a>  Website: <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/">https://neighbourhoods.network</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/neighbour_hoods">@Neighbour_hoods</a>  Substack: <a href="https://neighbourhoods.substack.com/">https://neighbourhoods.substack.com/</a>  NHT: <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/nht/">https://neighbourhoods.network/nht/</a>  Discord Invitation: <a href="https://discord.gg/nKSGNaJz9D">https://discord.gg/nKSGNaJz9D</a>   Why is Neighbourhoods being built? <p>Neighbourhoods came out of a weekly discussion series of Holochain and P2P ecosystem members as a response to the extractive practices of social media apps in web2. Inspired by trust networks and inclusive economies which develop out of informal micro networks, they are providing social data for its own sake — a valuable community asset. </p><p>There is a growing awareness, even among older generations and non-technical users that something went wrong with the social media giants. Whether it’s data extraction or information manipulation, the black box of their algorithms create more separation than connection. Neighbourhoods' solution? Their “Community Activation Wizard” lets a group decide what goes into the box, determining how information is processed and privileged. These “generic tools for specific cultures” can help you go from group chat to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">DAO</a>, incubating group experimentation and evolution. </p><p>Social intelligence is an important but sometimes overlooked tool set in the P2P community. Open source social media projects can be hesitant to determine users’ feed content or suggest that they implement methods of rating and assessment, and rightly so. Neither devs, non-profits, nor corporations should have control of how our social networks function. Neighbourhhoods is solving this problem by putting the power to make those decisions back in the hands of communities while giving other developers and projects ready made source code for social sensemaking.</p> Why did they choose Holochain? <p>Holochain is a bedrock for P2P hosting and interoperability. But the internet isn’t interesting because we can link computers together, it’s interesting because of what people do with that network. Thus, Neighbourhoods developed out of deep care for the Holochain ecosystem, laying the first bricks on top of Holochain’s foundation. As a key piece of architecture for a P2P social web, Neighbourhoods is focused on creating a user-friendly experience that preserves the good parts of social media like discoverability and feed ordering. They see these as key affordances for adoption and want to give the control of those capacities back to the broader community.</p><p>On a technical level, Neighbourhoods needed an ultra-scalable distributed ledger which could maintain the dynamism of web2. Hard forks break the continuity of social media and create challenging network effects, so the ease of updating on Holochain allows for a much more fluid experience. Individual users do not all need to run the same version of an app (as long as the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/integrity-and-coordination-part-ways/">integrity</a> remains constant), so updates and forks can happen asynchronously, all while agents securely interact in the same neighborhood. This capability emphasizes agent-centricity and allows for complex, overlapping community dynamics.</p><p>Holochain’s trust but verify model for data integrity, and the agent/group duality is also uniquely suited to Neighbourhoods’ social ontology, as well as their commitment to data protection and persistence. </p> How are they using Holochain? <p>Holochain for Neighbourhoods really comes down to flexibility. Holochain’s uniform data formatting allows for easy translation of reputation metrics between social spaces as well as enabling incredible data portability, both within and between groups. Similarly, Holochain’s graphing DHT and unique <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/5_links_anchors/">linking method</a> make resource location efficient in a distributed system. Neighbourhoods has found this important for bridging across contexts as well as for adding external links. </p> Their experience developing on Holochain? <p>Holochain developers are a tightknit group. Many of the devs working on Neighbourhoods also work on other Holochain projects or Holochain’s core components. This means that they have a deep knowledge of the software and ecosystem which is essential for building on new technology. The downside however is a limited pool of developers which is why <a href="https://press.holo.host/214789-announcing-the-holochain-developer-education-initiative">developer</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/life-imitates-art-imitates-life-cooperation-at-the-first-developer-immersive/">education</a> is so important for bringing new people into the community. Neighborhoods has been hiring consistently in support of their upcoming alpha release and we expect other projects will be doing the same soon.</p><p>There is also a lot of resource sharing and support across the ecosystem. <a href="https://lightningrodlabs.org/">Lightning Rod Labs’</a> <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we">We</a> provides a great framework for groupware which Neighbourhoods is integrating as a sort of ‘lobby’ for its social intelligence kit. In turn, applets can be shared across We and Neighbourhoods with minimal changes, enabling developers’ experimentation and driving innovation across the Holochain ecosystem. Similarly, Holochain’s core tools like the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a> testing framework have been key for preparing Neighbourhoods for beta and has positioned them to take advantage of the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_campaign=holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold&amp;utm_content=primary">Beta-RC release</a> later this month.</p><p>As a team, Neighbourhoods is at that goldilocks scale where every member is able to give input on any aspect of the design, creating a participatory environment. They have done a lot of work to maintain this in their working practices externally as well, running workshops and salons with early adopters to get community feedback as part of a participatory design process. When building a tool that allows for so much customization, it’s important to ensure that groups working through the Community Activation Wizard have a clear understanding of what their choices affect, and so carefully communicating this information is a design challenge that requires (and creates the opportunity for) community input.<br><br>They have also been using the hApp <a href="https://acorn.software/">Acorn</a> for their project management needs. We love to see this!</p> How can I get involved? <p>With Holochain’s beta release candidate dropping, Neighbourhoods is sprinting towards a lot of new milestones. In early 2023 they will release the Neighbourhoods Tool Kit 0.0.1 which includes early versions of new features, including the sensemaker-lite, sensemaker-lite dashboard, community activation wizard, and some sample applets for rating and ordering resources in social contexts. This will enable community organizers to configure a neighbourhood by specifying resource types, social data dimensions, computation methods, and contexts where these emerge. Developers will be able to see Neighbourhoods’ work on Github and use their specifications for building applets that work well with the social sensemaker.</p><p>In the meantime, if you're interested in supporting the team, the best thing to do right now is <a href="https://neighbourhoods.substack.com/">sign up for their Substack</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neighbour_hoods">follow them on Twitter</a>. You can also join their <a href="https://discord.gg/nKSGNaJz9D">Discord</a>, check out their past <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM7Oc8aY4FZ6S7U9onj14cQ">demos and salons</a>, or take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods">codebase on GitHub</a>. And of course, you can go to their <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/">website</a> where they have more information on their ERC-20 token <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/nht/">$NHT</a>.</p>

In this tutorial, we’ll set up an app to keep track of what NASA facilities we’ve visited and which ones we still want to check out.</p>

<p>Our app will be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo">monorepo</a> with Okta authentication, using React for the frontend and Fastify for the backend. <a href="https://www.fastify.io/">Fastify</a> is a highly performant web framework with low overhead that we’ll connect to a PostgreSQL database. We’ll also use <a href="https://lerna.js.org/">Lerna</a> to manage the frontend and backend apps in a monorepo.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>Create React App currently requires Node &gt;= 14.0.0 and npm &gt;= 5.6. The latest required versions can be found at <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html</a>. This tutorial was created using Node v18.8.1 and npm v8.11.0.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker installation</a> is required as well.</p>

 Set up OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>We’ll be using <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa-redirect/react/main/">Okta’s SPA redirect model</a> to authenticate.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3001/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:3001</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3001</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>NOTE: Take note of your client ID and issuer as this will be used in a subsequent step.</p>

 Setup Lerna for monorepo management 

<p><a href="https://lerna.js.org/">Lerna</a> is a tool used to manage multi-package repositories. In this project, it’ll allow us to have a single repository where both our frontend and API packages live.</p>

 
   
    <p>If you don’t already have <code>npx</code> installed, you can run <code>npm i npx</code> to do so.</p>
   
   
    <p>Create a project root directory named <code>okta-react-fastify</code>.</p>
   
   Add Lerna to your project by running the following in your project root directory:
       <code>npx lerna@latest init
</code>       
   
   Create the <code>frontend</code> and <code>api</code> packages:
       <code>cd packages
mkdir frontend api
</code>       
   
 

<p>NOTE: The team behind <a href="https://nx.dev/">Nx</a> now manages Lerna, so if you’d like to integrate Nx’s additional robust, scalable, and faster tooling for managing monorepos, check out their documentation on <a href="https://nx.dev/recipes/adopting-nx/lerna-and-nx">integrating Nx and Lerna</a>.</p>

 Add needed Fastify backend and React frontend dependencies with TypeScript 

 
   In <code>packages/api</code>, run:
       <code>npm init fastify
</code>       
   
   Add the required backend packages:
       <code>npx lerna add @fastify/postgres@5.1.0 packages/api
npx lerna add dotenv@16.0.2 packages/api
npx lerna add @okta/jwt-verifier@2.6.0 packages/api
npx lerna add pg@8.8.0 packages/api
</code>       
   
   Add TypeScript and needed types to the backend repository:
       <code>npx lerna add @types/pg@8.6.5 packages/api --dev
npx lerna add typescript@4.8.3 packages/api --dev
</code>       
   
   Next, let’s create a basic React application using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a>. We’ll use the template for TypeScript with it as well. In the created <code>packages/frontend</code> directory, run:
       <code>npx create-react-app . --template typescript
</code>       
   
   Add the frontend Okta dependencies:
       <code>npx lerna add @okta/okta-auth-js@7.0.1 packages/frontend
npx lerna add @okta/okta-react@6.7.0 packages/frontend
</code>       
   
   You can now run <code>npx lerna bootstrap</code> to install your package dependencies. 
 

<p>NOTE: Our demo repository uses React <code>^18.2.0</code> and React Scripts <code>5.0.1</code>.</p>

 Set up the PostgreSQL Docker instance 

 
   In your project’s root directory, create a file <code>docker-compose.yml</code>: 
 

   <code>services:
  postgres:
    container_name: "nasa-facilities"
    image: "postgres:latest"
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USERNAME: "${POSTGRES_USERNAME}"
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}"
      POSTGRES_DB: "${POSTGRES_DB}"
</code>   

 
   Create a <code>.env</code> file in the same project root directory and add the following:
       <code>POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=nasa-facilities
</code>       
   
   
    <p>To use the Docker configuration we created, run <code>docker compose up</code>.</p>
   
   There is a provided PostgrSQL data dump <code>./nasa-facilities_20200910.sql</code> <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-fastify-postgresql-example/blob/main/nasa-facilities_20200910.sql">in the example repo</a>. You can import it by running the following from the project root directory:
       <code>docker exec -i nasa-facilities psql -U postgres nasa-facilities &lt; ./nasa-facilities_20200910.sql
</code>       
   
 

<p>Your newly created Docker instance is now running a PostgreSQL database with the restored data.</p>

<p>NOTE: The PostgreSQL dump included in the demo repo uses data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/nasa-facilities">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/nasa-facilities</a>.</p>

 Create the API backend app using Fastify 

 
   
    <p>In the command line, go to your backend repository root directory at <code>packages/api</code>.</p>
   
   Update <code>package.json</code> by adding the following to allow the backend application to compile using TypeScript:
       <code>{
  "main": "build/index.js",
  "scripts": {
 "start": "tsc &amp;&amp; node build/index.js"
  }
}
</code>       
   
   Initialize a Typescript config file by running:
       <code>npx tsc --init
</code>       
   
   Add the following to <code>tsconfig.json</code> to output the build files to the proper directory:
       <code>"outDir": "build"
</code>       
   
   Create a <code>.env</code> file with the following and replace the Okta values with the prior output from the CLI:
       <code>CONNECTION_STRING=PostgreSQL://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/nasa-facilities
OKTA_ISSUER=/oauth2/default
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientId}
OKTA_AUDIENCE="api://default"
</code>       
   
   Create an <code>index.ts</code> file and add the backend application Fastify server code: 
 

   <code>import fastifyPostgres from "@fastify/postgres";
import Fastify, { FastifyInstance, FastifyRequest } from "fastify";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const fastify: FastifyInstance = Fastify({
  logger: {
    serializers: {
      res(reply) {
        return {
          statusCode: reply.statusCode,
        };
      },
      req(request) {
        return {
          method: request.method,
          url: request.url,
        };
      },
    },
  },
});

fastify.register(fastifyPostgres, {
  connectionString: process.env.CONNECTION_STRING,
});

const start = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    await fastify.listen({ port: 3000 });
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};
start();

</code>   

 
   Next, let’s create our Fastify API routes along with their appropriate CRUD operations in a new file <code>routes/facilities.ts</code>: 
 

   <code>import { FastifyInstance } from "fastify";
import { FastifyReply, FastifyRequest } from "fastify";

interface IFacility {
  Center: string;
  Facility: string;
  Status: string;
  City: string;
  State: string;
  Visited: boolean;
  id: bigint;
}

async function facilitiesRoutes(fastify: FastifyInstance) {
  const client = await fastify.pg.connect();

  fastify.get(
    "/facilities",
    async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) =&gt; {
      let facilities: IFacility[] = [];

      try {
        const { rows } = await client.query("SELECT * FROM facilities");
        if (rows.length == 0) throw new Error("No facilities found");

        facilities = rows;
        reply
          .code(200)
          .header("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=utf-8")
          .send([...facilities]);
      } catch (error) {
        const errorMessage = (error as Error).message;
        throw new Error(errorMessage);
      }
    }
  );

  fastify.patch(
    "/facilities/:id",
    async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) =&gt; {
      const { id } = request.params as { id: bigint };
      const { visited } = request.body as { visited: boolean };

      const query = {
        text: `UPDATE public.facilities SET 
                "Visited" = COALESCE($1, "Visited")
                WHERE id = $2`,
        values: [visited, id],
      };

      try {
        await client.query(query);
        reply.code(204);
      } catch (error) {
        const errorMessage = (error as Error).message;
        throw new Error(errorMessage);
      }
    }
  );

  fastify.delete(
    "/facilities/:id",
    async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) =&gt; {
      const { id } = request.params as { id: bigint };

      const query = {
        text: `DELETE FROM public.facilities
                  WHERE id = $1 RETURNING *`,
        values: [id],
      };

      try {
        await client.query(query);
        reply.code(204);
      } catch (error) {
        const errorMessage = (error as Error).message;
        throw new Error(errorMessage);
      }
    }
  );
}

export default facilitiesRoutes;

</code>   

 
   To register these routes with our Fastify instance, add the following to <code>index.ts</code>:
       <code>fastify.register(facilitiesRoutes);
</code>       
   
 

<p>NOTE: Don’t forget to also import the <code>facilitiesRoutes</code> after adding the above line.</p>

 
   Then we’ll create a <code>utils/jwt-verifier.ts</code> file that will include logic to verify the access token included in API calls from the frontend: 
 

   <code>import OktaJwtVerifier from "@okta/jwt-verifier";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import { FastifyReply, FastifyRequest } from "fastify";

dotenv.config();

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  issuer: process.env.OKTA_ISSUER || "",
  clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID
});

const audience = process.env.OKTA_AUDIENCE;

export const jwtVerifier = async (
  request: FastifyRequest,
  reply: FastifyReply
) =&gt; {
  const { authorization } = request.headers;

  request.log.info({ authorization });

  const match = authorization?.match(/Bearer (.+)/);

  if (!match) {
    return reply.status(401).send();
  }

  if (!authorization || !match) {
    reply.code(401).send();
  }

  try {
    const accessToken = match[1];
    const { claims } = await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(
      accessToken,
      audience || ""
    );

    request.log.info({ claims });

    if (!claims) {
      reply.code(401).send();
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    reply.code(401).send();
  }
};

</code>   

 
   We’ll then add a <a href="https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Hooks/#prehandler">Fastify Prehandler Hook</a> to <code>index.ts</code> that will run the <code>jwtVerifier</code> logic with each Fastify route: 
 

   <code>fastify.decorate("jwtVerify", (request: FastifyRequest) =&gt; {
  fastify.log.info(`The incoming request is: ${JSON.stringify(request)}`);
});

fastify.addHook("preHandler", async (request, reply, done) =&gt; {
  return jwtVerifier(request, reply);
});
</code>   

<p>NOTE: An import will also need to be added for <code>jwtVerifier</code>.</p>

<p>Your final <code>packages/api/index.ts</code> file should look like this:</p>
   <code>import fastifyPostgres from "@fastify/postgres";
import Fastify, { FastifyInstance, FastifyRequest } from "fastify";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import facilitiesRoutes from "./routes/facilities";
import { jwtVerifier } from "./utils/jwt-verifier";

dotenv.config();

const fastify: FastifyInstance = Fastify({
  logger: {
    serializers: {
      res(reply) {
        return {
          statusCode: reply.statusCode,
        };
      },
      req(request) {
        return {
          method: request.method,
          url: request.url,
        };
      },
    },
  },
});

fastify.register(fastifyPostgres, {
  connectionString: process.env.CONNECTION_STRING,
});

fastify.decorate("jwtVerify", (request: FastifyRequest) =&gt; {
  fastify.log.info(`The incoming request is: ${JSON.stringify(request)}`);
});

fastify.addHook("preHandler", async (request, reply, done) =&gt; {
  return jwtVerifier(request, reply);
});

fastify.register(facilitiesRoutes);

const start = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    await fastify.listen({ port: 3000 });
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};
start();

</code>   

 Configure the React app 

 
   
    <p>Add <code>"proxy": "http://localhost:3000"</code> to <code>packages/frontend/package.json</code> so that React knows what base URL our API calls will need to make.</p>
   
   
    <p>In a <code>.env</code> file in the <code>packages/frontend</code> directory, add the needed environment variables:</p>
       <code>PORT=3001
REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=/oauth2/default
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_BASE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001
</code>       
   
 

<p>NOTE: Make sure to replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> and <code>{yourOktaClientId}</code> with your own Okta domain and client ID.</p>

<p>NOTE: We are switching the default port React will run on because the backend API app will use port <code>3000</code> by default as well.</p>

 Create React components 

<p>Let’s create our React components for render on the frontend.</p>

 
   In a newly created <code>src/components</code> directory, add the following files: 
 

 login.tsx 

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { Navigate, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import "../App.css";

export function Login() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const { authState } = useOktaAuth();

  const handleLoginClick = () =&gt; {
    navigate("/facilities");
  };

  return authState?.isAuthenticated ? (
    &lt;Navigate to="/facilities" replace /&gt;
  ) : (
    &lt;div className="form-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;form onSubmit={handleLoginClick}&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Welcome Back!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Login" /&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

</code>   

<p>NOTE: Our app uses <a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main">React Router v6</a>, which utilizes the new <code>useNavigate</code> to replace <code>useHistory</code> to programmatically navigate.</p>

 facilities.tsx 

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

 secureRoute.tsx 
<p>In this file we’ll create a custom <code>SecureRoute</code> component to work with React Router v6.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

export const RequiredAuth: React.FC = () =&gt; {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (!authState) {
      return;
    }

    if (!authState?.isAuthenticated) {
      const originalUri = toRelativeUrl(
        window.location.href,
        window.location.origin
      );
      oktaAuth.setOriginalUri(originalUri);
      oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
    }
  }, [oktaAuth, authState?.isAuthenticated, authState]);

  if (!authState || !authState?.isAuthenticated) {
    return &lt;p className="loading"&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;
  }

  return &lt;Outlet /&gt;;
};

</code>   

<p>NOTE: The <code>okta/okta-react</code> package includes a <code>SecureRoute</code> component, but it does not support React Router v6 to stay router version agnostic. For more information, please see the issue comment at <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-react/issues/178#issuecomment-1150407182">https://github.com/okta/okta-react/issues/178#issuecomment-1150407182</a>.</p>

 
   We’ll also need to add the <code>SecureRoute</code> component and the following to <code>App.tsx</code>. 
 

   <code>import { useCallback } from "react";
import "./App.css";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";

import { Login } from "./components/login";
import Facilities from "./components/facilities";
import { RequiredAuth } from "./components/secureRoute";

function App() {
  const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
    issuer: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
    clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
    redirectUri:
      process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_BASE_REDIRECT_URI + "/callback",
  });

  const restoreOriginalUri = useCallback(
    async (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth, originalUri: string) =&gt; {
      window.location.replace(
        toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
      );
    },
    []
  );

  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
        &lt;Routes&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/callback" element={&lt;LoginCallback /&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/" element={&lt;Login /&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/facilities" element={&lt;RequiredAuth /&gt;}&gt;
            &lt;Route path="" element={&lt;Facilities /&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;/Route&gt;
        &lt;/Routes&gt;
      &lt;/Security&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;

 Running the app 

<p>You can start the demo app by running <code>npx lerna run start</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If we’re not authenticated, our app will land us at the login page. Here, we click login to go through the Okta login process. Once authenticated, we’re redirected to <code>/facilities</code>. If we’re already authenticated when we land on the root URL, our app will automatically navigate us to <code>/facilities</code>. Once our table loads, we’ll see the following:</p>

<p></p>

<p>To render the facilities table, our app has made a call to our API which includes the access token to fetch the data from the backend <code>/facilities</code> API endpoint.</p>

<p>In <code>packages/frontend/facilities.tsx</code>:</p>
   <code>  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const apiCall = async () =&gt; {
      if (authState?.isAuthenticated &amp;&amp; authState.accessToken?.accessToken) {
        try {
          const response = await fetch("/facilities", {
            headers: {
              Authorization: authState.accessToken.accessToken,
            },
          });
          const data = await response.json();
          setData(data);
        } catch (error: unknown) {
          setErrors(getErrorMessage(error));
        }
      }
    };
    apiCall();
  }, [authState]);
</code>   

<p>The backend verified the access token using the <code>jwtVerifier</code> utility we created.</p>

<p>The backend connects to our PostgreSQL instance and has used the query we specified to fetch the needed data at the <code>/facilities</code> route.</p>

<p>In <code>packages/api/routes/facilities.ts</code>:</p>
   <code>fastify.get(
    "/facilities",
    async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) =&gt; {
      let facilities: IFacility[] = [];

      try {
        const { rows } = await client.query("SELECT * FROM facilities");
        if (rows.length == 0) throw new Error("No facilities found");

        facilities = rows;
        reply
          .code(200)
          .header("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=utf-8")
          .send([...facilities]);
      } catch (error) {
        const errorMessage = (error as Error).message;
        throw new Error(errorMessage);
      }
    }
  );
</code>   

<p>The same process repeats when a user clicks on the <code>Visited</code> checkbox or <code>Delete</code> button for the appropriate API endpoints and PostgreSQL queries.</p>

<p>Covered California just began its 10th open-enrollment period with the admirable and ambitious goal of continuing to reduce the number of uninsured Californians. And this is no easy task. If you've ever attempted to access a healthcare benefit exchange, you know it is a very complex system. These exchanges have so many participants like citizens, healthcare providers, insurers–all of whom need very different types of access to many types of services like dental and vision insurance, prices, access to accounts and more.</p>

<p>Covered California is the state's Affordable Care Act marketplace, which was created and managed by the California Healthcare Eligibility and Enrolment System</p>

<p>(CalHEERS) Project. CalHEERS recently completed an update to the system with ForgeRock, implementing a comprehensive identity platform to better serve its various audiences. According to Toua Her, Information Technology Manager I, at CalHEERS, the organization can now "provide a stable, resilient platform for Californians to consume services from the exchange, enhance the security landscape with modern identity capabilities, protect users' data from unauthorized access, and provide a positive experience to consumers where we can leverage the power of identity."</p>

<p>Today, the plan is working. Covered California provides healthcare insurance to a record 1.7M Californians. According to Covered California and federal data, California's uninsured rate dropped to 7% in 2021 (which was 17.2% in 2013) and this marks the largest percentage drop for any state in the U.S. within the same <a href="https://www.coveredca.com/newsroom/news-releases/2022/11/03/covered-californias-10-years-strong-campaign-visits-sacramento-to-celebrate-a-decade-of-historic-increases-in-coverage/">timeframe</a>.</p>

Our goal is to provide flexibility for product builders to create the best experiences for their users.<br><br></p><p>This post will cover:<br><br></p>  Two types of identity wallets (+ our proposed third option)  Key features of identity wallets in Trinsic Ecosystems  Design decisions we made implementing Trinsic Ecosystems  					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Two Types of Identity Wallets (Plus Our Proposed Third Option)  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>When creating an IDtech product, there is a delicate balance between user experience and user control. Edge wallets often maximize user control while sacrificing user experience, whereas cloud wallets provide better user experience with little user control.<br><br></p><p>We’ll discuss the wallet possibilities and propose a third option, one that we believe merges the usability of a cloud wallet with the user control of an edge-based solution.<br><br></p><p>Note: You may also hear edge vs. cloud wallets described as a custodial solution vs. a non-custodial solution, especially for people familiar with web3. Holding crypto on Coinbase is a custodial solution. Holding crypto in a MetaMask wallet is a non-custodial solution.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 1. Edge Wallet Solutions  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In an edge wallet, all credentials are held locally on the end-user’s device, giving them full control of what information they share and reveal. While great for privacy, edge solutions have significant drawbacks from a user experience perspective and for the developers building them. Asking users to manage a private key or seed phrase also presents a high barrier for mass adoption.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 2. Cloud Wallet Solutions 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Full cloud solutions store all user credentials in the cloud and often require a username and password to access their data that is tied to a specific platform. While cloud solutions are easy to build and provide a familiar user experience, they miss the mark when it comes to user control, choice of data storage, and interoperability.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 3. Trinsic Modular Wallet Solution 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>The Trinsic Ecosystems platform offers a third option, which we believe combines the best of both solutions. IDtech product builders have the ability to decide where credentials are stored and how users access their credentials. Developers can use familiar authentication methods and cloud storage to start, while providing increased user control and decentralization over time.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Key Features of Identity Wallets in Trinsic Ecosystems 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In Trinsic’s platform, identity wallets are secure, partitioned data stores scoped to a single holder, capable of storing and sharing credentials and proofs. Here are a few key features of wallets in our Trinsic Ecosystems platform:</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 One Step Wallet Creation  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In the past, user onboarding to a wallet required downloading an app, then scanning QR codes to accept connections and credentials. Our new platform streamlines the onboarding experience down to a few seconds as wallet creation happens behind the scenes.<br><br></p><p>On the back-end, when an issuer “sends” a credential to an email, a <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/reference/services/account-service/">user account</a> is created and the credential is associated with the email. The user receives a notification email that they’ve received a credential.<br><br></p><p>For an overview in our documentation, see the <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/reference/services/wallet-service/">wallets section</a>.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Flexible User Wallet Authentication  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Trinsic plans to support a variety of authentication methods like email, SMS, sign in with Ethereum and more to allow developers flexibility in how they implement a solution. Currently, the email based authentication flow allows users to enter their email, receive and 6-digit code, and gain access to the credentials in their wallet. Users don’t have to worry about creating usernames and remembering passwords, lowering the barrier to entry for anyone to start using verifiable credentials.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Fast Credential Exchange 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>When a user has access to their wallet, they can share credentials (or selectively share fields from a credential) when they are prompted by an application. Once a credential is shared, Trinsic will check the schema conformance, revocation status, trust registry, and signature to verify the credential in a fraction of a second.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Design Decisions in our Ecosystems Platform 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>For users to adopt a new technology like verifiable credentials, you need to allow for familiar workflows. Every design decision we made keeps user experience at the forefront, while also giving IDtech product developers options for their users to have more control of their identities online.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Cloud Accessible Credential Storage 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>By default, Trinsic Ecosystems uses cloud wallet storage with user-controlled, flexible authentication. This choice allows us to easily support features like account recovery and multi-device credential access.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Modular Platform Design  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>While Trinsic Ecosystems offers comprehensive infrastructure for setting up a trust ecosystem, it’s not a bundled set of technologies. You can use parts of our solution without using the entire stack.<br><br>For example, credentials could be issued and verified using Trinsic’s API, but IDtech companies do not need to utilize Trinsic cloud wallets. We don’t store any user data during credential issuance and a developer could choose to store credentials elsewhere like an edge wallet on a user’s device or in a decentralized storage solution.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Embedded Wallet Experiences 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Trinsic Ecosystems provides the ability to create an identity wallet that is embedded in an existing web or mobile application. It also supports standalone mobile applications or wallet experiences that are completely invisible to the user while still allowing for the interoperability benefits of using verifiable credentials.</p><p><br>In the past, the only way was building a mobile application in a limited number of languages. Now our platform supports a variety of options, increasing how fast developers can go to market with IDtech applications.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Role Flexibility Between Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In Trinsic Ecosystems, we’ve done away with rigid constructs of who can be an issuer, a verifier, and a holder. All wallets in an ecosystem have the same permissions by default, and ecosystem providers can set up a trust registry to establish the governance model of their ecosystem.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Getting Started with Trinsic Ecosystems

<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>Here’s a strange thing. If I told you that the NHS budget could be improved by £19bn (i.e. 10%) without having to raise taxes, most people would be delighted. But if I said that productivity and efficiency savings within the NHS could release £19bn to be spent on better services, what would the response be? A yawn? Shrugged shoulders? A cynical&nbsp;smile?</p><p>It’s £19bn either way. They’re both exactly the same sum of money. But somehow one seems exciting and real while the other seems almost depressingly unreal. Why is this? What is it about words like ‘productivity’ and ‘efficiency’ that generate such negative reactions? Productivity is all about finding ways to achieve more and better with less: less time, less effort, less resources, less energy. What is wrong with&nbsp;that?</p><p>We’ve been pondering this question because it’s vital to our mission. As a social enterprise, our primary purpose is to empower citizens with their data. To help them realise its value in their own lives, to protect it, to use it to improve access to services and to aid inclusion.</p><p>This is all about making it easier for individuals to collect, store and use their own data for their own purposes. But in the process of doing that, we also do something else. By enabling safe, efficient citizen-controlled data sharing we also transform the ways in which services are provided — because personal data lies at the heart of all service provision. In other words, we help both citizens and bona fide service providers to be more productive.</p><p>This is the particular focus of our latest <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">White Paper on The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>. It argues that by fixing a simple but fundamental design flaw at the heart of our economic system — the organisation-centric database that is designed NOT to share data — all manner of benefits can be unleashed, particularly:</p>  unleashing an economy-wide breakthrough in productivity via step-change reductions in services’ baseline operating costs, in the public, private and third&nbsp;sectors  streamlining handovers between services (crucial in sectors like health and&nbsp;care),  slashing organisations’ go-to-market costs,  helping individuals and households save time, make better decisions and manage their lives&nbsp;better,  creating new personal information management services and industries,  turbocharging data-driven research&nbsp;and  accelerating and complementing the drive to net&nbsp;zero.  <p>Yet, very often when we talk about this to people, we are met by a wave of indifference. Or even worse, it’s as if the people we are talking to simply aren’t hearing what we are saying. It sort of bounces off them, somehow inducing them to start talking about something else.</p> Reasons for scepticism <p>Thinking about it, we can see many good reasons why people seem to have an aversion to ‘productivity’, the ‘P’&nbsp;word.</p><p>People have grown cynical after decades of austerity where glib politicians have trotted out tired old slogans, saying that cuts to budgets wouldn’t harm services and outcomes because they would be made up for by ‘efficiency savings’. They never said exactly how these efficiency savings would be made. It was just convenient camouflage, a euphemism for cuts that did harm services and outcomes. So it’s not surprising that with decades of such cynical misuse under our belts, the P word now has a bad smell about&nbsp;it.</p><p>In fact, of course, the ‘efficiency savings’ the politicians talked about were the exact opposite of what productivity is really about, which is about genuinely finding ways to do more with&nbsp;less.</p><p>Suspicions are roused even further by the fact that when organisations pursue what they call productivity drives and efficiency savings, what it boils down to is sweating their staff ever harder, making them do more with less, piling the pressure (and blame) on them. Everyone knows that piling responsibilities on people without providing them with the means to do a good job is a recipe for stress and frustration. This, too, is the exact opposite of what genuine productivity is about: which is helping people do a better job, easier, so that they get real satisfaction from&nbsp;it.</p><p>Then there’s simple fatalism. Learned helplessness. How many times have politicians and managers spouted grand plans for productivity drives and efficiency savings, where everybody rushes around at hectic speed for a while&nbsp;… until it all grinds to a halt without anything having really changed? That, again, is the opposite of what genuine productivity is about, because genuine productivity can be transformational.</p><p>Take one, simple example. When Henry Ford introduced his moving assembly line using standardised parts, he reduced the time and effort needed to make a motor car by more than 90%. That was genuine productivity: achieving a lot more with less. Ford’s productivity breakthrough made the motor car affordable to ordinary people, transforming how they live, work and play. Applied to the manufacture of a million other products, it made these products affordable to ordinary people too, creating what came to be known as the ‘consumer society’.</p><p>Sure, that society generated its own problems which we are having to deal with now. But this productivity revolution itself was transformational. One tiny example: the introduction of the washing machine lifted an average of seven hours a week of back-breaking drudgery off women’s lives (yes, it was women because washing clothes was regarded as women’s work). How many people today want to give up on washing machines?</p><p>But there is further snag in productivity revolutions like this. They require painstaking, disciplined attention to the detail of how work gets done. They can only happen on the front line of where work gets done. Mundane. Day-to-day. Not glamorous. In other words, when push comes to shove, the P word is for ‘the little people’. Not something that the great and good want to demean themselves with. Rather, something for elites to politely sneer at, and hurl over the fence for lesser people to worry&nbsp;about.</p><p>Finally, there is the simple fact that once a productivity revolution has taken place, we naturally begin to take it for granted. Not long ago, mobile phones were so expensive that only the rich could afford one. Today, most of us have access to a smartphone — thanks to stunning advances in productivity.</p> Despite the scepticism, productivity matters <p>For all these reasons we understand why people are wary of the P word, and often dismissive of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>It’s sad but true, but it takes the average British worker five days to produce what the average French worker does in four days and what the average German worker does in three and a half days. According to the Resolution Foundation, if UK wages had continued to grow at the pre-2008 crisis rate they would be £292 a week, or £15,000 a year, higher. That’s linked to productivity.</p><p>Productivity lies at the heart of prosperity. The only reason why people in countries like the UK, Europe and America live longer, healthier lives is because of multiple productivity revolutions that swept across the provision of all the things we depend on today including food, energy, access to water and healthcare, and physical products.</p><p>A continuing revolution in productivity — this time in the delivery of renewable energy — could, one day, literally save our lives. In 1975, it cost $106 to produce a watt of electricity using a solar panel. By 2020, the cost had been brought down to 2 cents, and improvements are still being made. As I said, that 5,300-fold leap in productivity could play a big part in saving the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>So despite all the yawns, the shoulder shrugging and the cynical smiles we at Mydex are going to continue banging the drum of productivity — of genuine productivity, that is; of productivity that genuinely improves peoples’ lives by finding ways to do more, better with&nbsp;less.</p><p>We have already provided a glimpse as to how. Drawing on our front-line experience in projects we think it’s now possible to unleash a productivity revolution in the provision of services dealing with individuals (in the public, private and third sectors) which is as big and as far reaching as what Henry Ford did for the manufacture of physical products. All made possible by enabling the safe, efficient re-use of data that has already been&nbsp;minted.</p><p>Our next blog will get into the details of what and&nbsp;how.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.
