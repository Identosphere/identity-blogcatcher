<p>Paying attention to the latest customer service trends ensures that an organization is prepared to meet changing customer expectations.</p>



<p>Customer loyalty is waning, spurred on by the COVID-19 pandemic, social influences and the ease of switching brands. More than ever, organizations must stay on top of changes in the customer service experience to improve customer satisfaction and meet increased customer needs.</p>



<p>A 2023 Gartner study<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/customer-service-support/insights/service-leaders-priorities"> found that 58% of leaders</a> identified business growth as one of their most important goals. Customer service is a necessary component of this strategy. Good customer service can increase brand loyalty and bad customer service can hurt customer retention. Providing great<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience"> customer experience</a> is the best way to maintain an organization’s competitive advantage.</p>



 Seven new customer service trends that organizations must prioritize 



<p>Great customer service requires organizations to meet customer needs and expectations wherever they occur.</p>



 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The increasing importance of<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/omnichannel-customer-service"> omnichannel support</a> 



<p>Customer engagement continues to occur across multiple channels. As such, customer success requires customer support teams to interact with customers across call centers, text, social media and email. Organizations must dedicate the appropriate resources to each channel as dictated by their customers’ preferences.</p>



 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The move toward self-service 



<p>Organizations have built out their content libraries and knowledge bases, leading to more customers preferring self-service options to communicating with a support agent. While some customers want human interaction by a phone call or messaging, others prefer to solve the issue on their own if feasible.</p>



 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rise of artificial intelligence 



<p>New technologies will drive the<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-future/"> </a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-future/">future of customer service</a>. The use of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) has the potential to remake how every department in an organization operates, but the changes might be most powerful in customer support. For example, organizations are now infusing their<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots"> chatbots</a> (or bots) with generative AI to increase the success rate of interactions.</p>



<p>Organizations can also use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> to better analyze historical data around customer issues to create more valuable FAQs, improve call scripts and identify emerging issues that the organization can solve proactively. Machine learning helps create smarter workflows, so customer service representatives can better-utilize technology to solve customer issues more efficiently.</p>



 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of simple automation 



<p>Many customer service tasks can and should be automated rather than require a customer to talk to a customer service agent. For example, a simple chatbot can often handle straightforward returns of a defective product. Or customers can fill out a form that asks a couple of questions and returns answers such as a price quote or a request for more information. These simple automations answer the customer’s needs while saving their time—they don’t have to call customer support and wait for a human representative.</p>



 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The growth in messaging-based customer service 



<p>In the 2010s, customers flocked to social media to post their questions or issues and communicate with organizations’ customer service reps. The rise of messaging apps such as WhatsApp and SMS-based customer service is the next progression for consumers interested in asynchronous communication with organizations. While some customers will always prefer talking on the phone to a live agent on the customer service team, many more will text or message the support team as the preferred way to interact with that organization.</p>



<p>Most organizations will need to build an infrastructure that enables near real-time responses to texts and messages to meet customer expectations about response times. The use of messaging also enables organizations to find good opportunities to follow up with customers to ensure they remain satisfied with their products.</p>



 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; The desire for a personalized experience 



<p>Organizations can now track their customers, their habits and purchase history better than ever before through <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/crm">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) tools. They’ve built up impressive stores of customer data over time. By using technology such as machine learning, which makes it easier and quicker to parse this data in real time, organizations can build more personalized experiences across the entire customer journey.</p>



<p>For example, a brand can email exclusive offers to customers based on their preferences or send them a free product or discount code on their birthday. Customer service representatives can also access information about a customer they’re helping and use that information to improve the customer relationship.</p>



 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; The need for proactive support 



<p>Organizations can no longer wait for customer feedback if they’re concerned about providing an excellent customer experience. Instead, they must invest in ways they can reach customers before an issue happens to ensure they’re satisfied with a product and are using it correctly. For example, organizations can email tutorials to their customer base to help them understand how to use their products.</p>



 <a></a><a></a>Monitoring and executing key trends as a competitive advantage 



<p>Providing excellent customer service requires organizations to keep up to date on key trends so they meet customer expectations. As more organizations embrace advanced technologies such as generative AI and machine learning, those who fail to do the same will fall behind the competition.</p>



<p>It’s important to remember that customers have interactions with many different companies throughout their lifetimes and can easily differentiate between those that provide good customer service and those who undervalue or under-invest in it.</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.ifs.com/assets/service-management/state-of-service"> </a><a href="https://www.ifs.com/assets/service-management/state-of-service">majority of service professionals (60%)</a> have said that customer expectations have increased since before the pandemic. Therefore, poor customer service is a major impediment to business growth and customer retention. CEOs understand this acutely, which is why they have identified customer service as the number one priority for incorporating generative AI investment, according to an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/customer-service">IBV CEO Guide to Generative AI for Customer Service.<br></a>&nbsp;<br>IBM has been helping enterprises apply trusted AI in this space for more than a decade, and generative AI has further potential to significantly transform customer and field service with the ability to understand complex inquiries and generate more human-like, conversational responses.</p>

<p>Some of the first teachings about improving the planet seem simple: reduce, reuse, recycle. People have since made lifestyle choices and adjustments, such as biking to work and segregating garbage, to bring this rule to life and help save the environment. Now, climate change is affecting businesses as much as individuals. According to the <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/survival-greenest-businesses-must-reduce-their-footprint">United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),</a> both consumers and investors are being turned-off by companies that ignore their environmental impact. Sustainable business practices are an essential part of an organization’s commitment to social and environmental responsibility. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-sustainability">Sustainability in business</a> also provides organizations an opportunity to create more efficient supply chains that have a positive impact on the planet.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/info/guidebook">Read our guide for sustainability leaders</a>



<p>Business activities that contribute to carbon emissions and fossil fuels also forced organizations and policymakers to hold leaders accountable for their actions against environmental impact. Likewise, employees and customers want to work for a company that is actively trying to reverse climate change and take part in environmental protection. There are various examples of sustainable business practices that companies can adopt to improve their business model. One common corporate sustainability strategy is known as the triple bottom line.</p>



 Sustainability trifecta: Triple bottom line 



<p>Profit, people and the planet comprise the trifecta that is known as the triple bottom line. A play on the business term “the bottom line,” otherwise referred to as profit, the triple bottom line adds two more players to the mix of modern-day business strategy. Sustainability is at the core of the triple bottom line, suggesting that companies that adopt sustainable business practices can protect the planet, serve the consumer and ultimately increase revenue.</p>



<p>Recycling programs, renewable energy sources, waste reduction and energy efficiency—all these things in theory can contribute to better environmental footprint. But what are some green business practices that organizations can implement today to achieve their sustainability goals?</p>



 Improving efficiency of energy management  



<p>Organizations can start to build their sustainability efforts through adopting more efficient energy sources. Alternative or clean energy does not harm the environment compared with fossil fuels and can often be used in place the latter.</p>



<p>Moreover, using the earth’s natural resources like sunlight, wind, water and others can create renewable energy. Generating power through natural processes help minimize carbon footprint. Google, for example, takes first place in purchasing the most renewable energy of any company over the past 10 years. The tech giant has matched <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/">100% of electricity consumption with purchases of renewable energy</a>. Sustainable businesses keep track of these metrics to be more proactive with their sustainability efforts.</p>



<p>Through <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/carbon-accounting">carbon accounting</a>, businesses can determine which activities are contributing to their production of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Implementing carbon accounting into a sustainability strategy proves to stakeholders that an organization is working on decarbonization due to environmental, social and governance (ESG) pressure to reach <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/net-zero">net zero</a>.</p>



 Deploying new infrastructure&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decarbonization">Decarbonization</a> can be deployed through activities such as electrifying energy, targeting zero waste production and limiting business travel. Organizations can invest in renewable energy to help combat their carbon footprint. <a href="https://www.ge.com/sustainability">General Electric (GE)</a> has committed to reducing their carbon footprint notably through renewable energy sources. The company offers various off and onshore wind, hydro power, hybrid, grid and service solutions. </p>



<p>Large enterprises are not the only contributors to decarbonization and protecting the environment. <a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/Impact-Up%3A-Entrepreneurs-on-Tech-for-Good-25cc0960/0736d490">On the first episode of the Impact-Up podcast</a>, we interviewed the California startup <a href="https://www.baeboats.com/">BAE Boats</a>, which offers electric boating vehicles for short-term hire. Their electric boats provide customers with a more desirable experience over a traditional combustion engine as there is no noise or gas smell. With sustainability at the core of their brand but also their business value, BAE Boats has been able to grow their operations through the pandemic and beyond.</p>







 Developing dynamic supply chains&nbsp; 



<p>Sustainable supply chains are a foundational way for organizations to remain efficient while implementing sustainability means. Organizations with transparent supply chains show a commitment to social responsibility. Some examples of supply chain sustainability include recycling programs for packaging, exercising fair labor practices and responsibly sourcing materials from the local community.</p>



<p>Patagonia uses eco-friendly materials when creating their products and packaging. The company even reduces waste through recycling returns and other sustainable materials during the manufacturing phase. Patagonia also seeks to communicate their sustainability goals by educating consumers about the responsible consumption of clothing. The company promotes the “<a href="https://www.patagonia.com/buy-less-demand-more/">buy less, demand more</a>” motto throughout their business model.</p>



 Resilient sustainability strategies 



<p>Many sustainability initiatives come from policy and will continue to rise as future generations grow increasingly supportive of environmental sustainability. Resilient businesses will adhere to external regulations on sustainable business practices (e.g., ESG regulations) while simultaneously committing to social responsibility. Companies with successful sustainability programs support both human rights and the environment. To implement resilient sustainable business practices, consider some of these other examples:</p>



 Employee well-being 



<p>Employees are the foundation of a successful organization, and their well-being is crucial to achieving sustainability goals. Businesses can adopt sustainability to create a healthier work environment. Microsoft is doing this through using renewable energy in their facilities. They also encourage employees to practice mindfulness, collaborate with the community, provide work-life flexibility, promote green space accessibility in the workplace and recognize employee achievements.</p>



 Fair trade practices 



<p>Raw materials are crucial to supply and supporting local communities allows for businesses to keep running at a foundational level. Economic stability is just as important as environmental impact for farmers. Companies who fairly compensate their local farmers through market wages and ethical work conditions are representing sustainable development. Starbucks is known for practicing fair trade practices with their local farmers.</p>



 Waste reduction 



<p>Eliminating plastics from our oceans and landfills is a common effort to protect the earth. Unilever is one of the fastest moving consumer goods companies and is also renowned for its goal to <a href="https://www.unilever.com/planet-and-society/waste-free-world/">create a waste-free world</a>. Unilever is not only cutting their plastic usage, but also fighting against food waste in their manufacturing.</p>



 Sustainability in business and IBM 



<p>Sustainable companies start from within. They begin with their local communities and ecosystems through making small changes. However, when larger companies start to exercise sustainability efforts, there is a ripple effect that impacts their stakeholders, employees and consumers.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>As we look towards 2024, the air travel industry is poised for a historic milestone. The latest forecasts suggest that 2024 is set to be the biggest year ever in terms of global passenger traffic volume. This is a remarkable turnaround from the significant downturn experienced in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>For many of us, including myself, this year has been marked by frequent flights. Whether for business or leisure, it seems like we’ve been in the air more often than not.</p>
<p>As air travel volumes continue to soar, the question arises: how can we further improve and streamline travel processes for travelers and various stakeholders? A key component in this evolution is the role of digital identity.</p>
<p>In this latest podcast episode, Dan and I engage in a conversation focusing on the concept of ‘travel credentials’. We delve into how digital identity can revolutionize the travel experience, making it more efficient and seamless for everyone involved.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Daniel and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 Governance of International Air Travel: Inquiry about the organization responsible for developing international standards and specifications for smooth airport experiences across different countries. 
 ICAO’s Role and Dynamics: Exploration of ICAO’s governance and business interactions with countries like the United States and Canada. Discussion on the creation and alignment of passports through ICAO’s collaboration with various countries. 
 Machine Authentication and Passport Digitization: Examination of the trend towards machine authentication at airports and its impact on the digitization of physical passports. 
 Biometrics in International Travel: Inquiry about the alignment of biometric standards and technologies across countries for travel purposes. 
 Photo Accuracy in Travel Documents: Discussion on the accuracy of photos in travel documents and their comparison across different locations. 
 Integrity of Various Travel Documents: Comparison of the integrity and standards of images in passports, visas, and driver’s licenses for biometric assessments. 
 Digital Travel Credential (DTC): Introduction to the concept of the digital travel credential and its relation to current travel processes. Exploration of the benefits of moving towards a digital travel credential. Discussion on the standards and application integration of digital travel credentials. 
 Benefits of DTC for Travelers: Analysis of how DTCs could streamline travel processes and their comparison to existing programs like Clear and Nexus. 
 Future of DTC Adoption: Inquiry into the current state of DTC pilot projects and predictions for future adoption trends. 
 Integration of DTCs in Wallets and Applications: Consideration of the logical placement of DTCs in digital wallets and applications, and their potential impact on travel efficiency.

<p>The Verida Network is a self-sovereign database network for storing private data. The network creates a decentralized and hyper-efficient tokenized data economy for personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Verida is now inviting storage node providers to participate in our foundational release.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.verida.network/storage-node-providers">new website landing page</a> specifically for Storage Node providers.</p> Why run a Verida Storage&nbsp;Node? <p>Verida is the leading privacy focused storage solution for web3. We believe private storage infrastructure is the next growth area for&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Web2 offers abundant storage options, but web3’s unique needs demand specific solutions.</p><p>Existing decentralized storage models such as Filecoin, Sia, and Arweave are robust for public data, but fall short for private personal data. <a href="http://verida.network">Verida</a> fills this gap by addressing speed, authentication, encryption, and regulatory issues in private data&nbsp;storage.</p><p>This is a chance for node operators to gain exposure to emerging, high growth use cases such as compliant DeFi, RWAs, credentials, healthcare and enterprise data management.</p><p>We are working with a growing <a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem">ecosystem</a> of partners such as Polygon ID, Redbelly Network, zkPass, cheqd and others to make this&nbsp;happen.</p> The Verida Storage Node&nbsp;Network <p>The Verida protocol provides an open source <a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node">Storage Node</a> server that provides encrypted, authenticated database storage for Verida accounts on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>The Storage Node network is global with a region-aware design. It empowers users to control their data storage location in accordance with their geographic preference and regulatory needs.</p><p>By default, the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet </a>selects storage nodes in the user’s country or region, ensuring regulatory compliance. Users, however, have the freedom to change these nodes or even host their own, allowing for true data sovereignty.</p><p>The technology also enables the “right to be forgotten.” Users can delete their data from storage nodes or remove their identity and data entirely from the&nbsp;network.</p><p>This level of control over data storage and deletion is unprecedented and vital for the widespread adoption of this technology in mature, regulated industries. For instance, social media and health&nbsp;care.</p> The Storage Node Foundational Release <p>Storage nodes are currently operated across multiple global regions by the Verida Foundation. You can track node statistics on the <a href="https://explorer.verida.network/">Network Explorer</a>.</p><p>This has allowed the Verida team to monitor performance, gather analytics and rapidly improve reliability on the <a href="https://news.verida.io/the-decentralized-verida-acacia-testnet-is-live-81503c119d9f">Acacia Testnet</a>. We are now preparing to open up the network to third party node operators.</p><p>The foundational release will target a mixture of node operators across different data centres, different regions. We aim to accommodate and incorporate both small, medium and large operators to support the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>These foundational members will be rewarded for their participation and are expected to work closely with the Verida team to ensure our documentation, tooling and protocol are meeting our delivery objectives of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Storage nodes will be brought online in staged cohorts as the Verida team learns and receives feedback on deployment processes, availability, security, real world usage, payments and incentives.</p> Apply now to be a Storage Node&nbsp;Operator <p>You can <a href="https://www.verida.network/storage-node-providers">apply here</a> to become a foundational node operator.</p><p>If you have questions or feedback please chat with us in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/664594912460668960/1092274729328574464">#storage-nodes channel</a> in the Verida&nbsp;discord.</p> Learn more about&nbsp;Verida   Website: <a href="https://www.verida.io/">https://www.verida.io</a>  Subscribe: <a href="https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/97344/60309864285472178/share">Verida Newsletter</a>  LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/verida-technology/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/verida-technology/</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/verida_io">https://twitter.com/verida_io</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discord.verida.io/">https://discord.verida.io</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/verida_community">https://t.me/verida_community</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Verida/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Verida/</a>  Medium: <a href="https://news.verida.io/">https://news.verida.io/</a>  YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@verida_io">https://www.youtube.com/@verida_io</a>   <p><a href="https://news.verida.io/decentralizing-the-verida-network-become-a-node-operator-e31a6a31daf1">Decentralizing the Verida Network: Become a Node Operator</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.verida.io">Verida</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of recent discussion around the business value of environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting, and the degree to which it relates to financial performance and other measures of business value. When it comes to focusing on the “environmental” aspect of ESG—often referred to as “sustainability”—there are many ways this area can open up business opportunities.</p>



<p>For example, looking at the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sustainability">IBM Sustainability Software portfolio</a>, you’ll notice that many of these solutions will deliver ROI to your business while also having positive environmental impact. Just take a look at Maximo Application Suite: at its core, the suite enables intelligent management of your assets—whether that’s your <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ibm-gre">real estate</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/riyadh-airports-company">escalators </a>or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/sund-and-baelt">a bridge</a>. In all these cases, by making assets perform more efficiently, the business saves money while cutting back on emissions and resources. There’s the double benefit of cost-efficiency and sustainability.</p>



<p>This doesn’t just relate to big business. <a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/Impact-Up%3A-Entrepreneurs-on-Tech-for-Good-25cc0960">On the first episode of the Impact-Up podcast</a>, we talk to startup <a href="https://www.baeboats.com/">BAE Boats</a> which offers short-term hire electric vehicles for special events. The benefits of these boats over traditional combustion engine boats are in the customer experience: there is no engine noise or gas smell.</p>







<p>In fact, even though sustainability is at the core of the business, BAE Boats advertises the experience over the environmental aspect of the service, and has grown the business even during the tough pandemic period.</p>



<p>What are the key takeaways from this? Looking across all aspects of your business operations (including customer touch points) can lead to benefits for your business, including reduced costs, differentiation of your products and services, and even new market opportunities, all while driving greater environmental outcomes. While this can sometimes require upfront investment, it is worth considering this cost against total lifetime gains, and other material benefits such as improved brand reputation. This is one of the key trends that we have recently covered in our Seven Sustainability Trends report: “Align business objectives with improved environmental outcomes.”</p>

DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF68 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.

What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

With Permissions Management, organizations can assess, manage, and monitor identities and their permissions continuously and right-size them based on past activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re thrilled to unveil the details of our Ignite announcement and introduce new features and APIs for Permissions Management, enhancing your overall permissions management experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Permissions Management app in the ServiceNow app store (Generally Available) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can now request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)) via the ServiceNow portal. This integration will strengthen organizations’ Zero Trust posture by adding permission requests to existing approval workflows in ServiceNow, making it possible to enforce the principle of least privilege in multicloud environments. To learn more about this, please visit <a href="http://aka.ms/ServiceNowPoD">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Public Preview)&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are enhancing our cloud-native application protection program (CNAPP) by delivering basic permissions management insights through Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This integration strengthens the prevention of security breaches that can occur due to excessive permissions or misconfigurations in cloud environments. This enables organizations to implement the principle of least privilege for cloud resources and receive actionable recommendations for resolving permissions risks across Azure, AWS, and GCP. To learn more, please visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/permissions-management/permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Okta and AWS IAM Identity Center support (Public Preview) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permissions Management customers can now detect identities originating from Okta and AWS IAM Identity Center.&nbsp; This will help customers gain a centralized view of all identities and their permissions, regardless of the identity provider solutions they are using. Organizations can easily configure Okta, and AWS IAM Identity Center with just a few clicks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Permissions Analytic Report (Public Preview) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report lists findings across identities and resources in Permissions Management. This report can be directly viewed on the Permissions Management page, downloaded in Excel format, and exported as a PDF. It’s available for all supported cloud environments, which include Microsoft Azure, AWS, and GCP. To learn more, please visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/permissions-management/product-permissions-analytics-reports#download-the-permissions-analytics-report-in-pdf-format">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New APIs&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permissions Management has introduced multiple MS-Graph APIs in public preview, addressing key use cases based on customer feedback. With these new APIs, organizations can retrieve the inventory of onboarded AWS accounts, Azure subscriptions, and GCP projects, incorporate permissions analytics insights into dashboards in SIEM tools, and enable access reviews in existing ticketing systems. In addition, the Permission on Demand API provides flexibility to elevate the permissions of users or workload identities as necessary, either through automation or by integrating with an IT Service Management (ITSM) solution. To learn more, please visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/permissions-management-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta">here</a>.</p>

  Under Singapore’s Payment Services Act, cryptocurrencies are recognized as digital payment tokens, requiring businesses to obtain a license to offer crypto services in the city-state.  In 2020, Singapore’s Monetary Authority introduced a licensing system for crypto exchanges and wallet providers to align with anti-money laundering (AML) and CTF (counter-terrorist financing) regulations.  The crypto Travel Rule threshold in Singapore is SGD 1,500, yet certain information must still be shared for transactions below this&nbsp;value.  <p>As crypto adoption continues to rise, Singapore is seeing growing traction, coming in at 2nd place in the Crypto Hubs 2023 list. The country plays a key role in crypto’s adoption in the Asia-Pacific region, which it strengthens through a focus on digital innovation, raising awareness of crypto usage, the absence of capital gains tax, the government’s close cooperation with industry stakeholders, and most importantly, favorable crypto regulation in Singapore.</p><p><a href="https://www.fortuneindia.com/macro/singapore-emerges-as-top-crypto-hub-switzerland-uae-follow-suit/114010">According to Henley &amp; Partners</a>, Singapore leads as the top crypto hub across the world with a score of 50.2 out of 60, a reflection of its well-established crypto infrastructure and reputation for privacy and security. This standing in the global arena naturally leads to an interest in the specifics of its legal framework, particularly how Singapore applies <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule#:~:text=A%20VASP%20is%20a%20cryptocurrency,lowered%20the%20threshold%20to%20zero.">the FATF Travel Rule</a> in its burgeoning crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>So, let’s take a closer look at Singapore’s crypto law and the application of the FATF travel rule in the&nbsp;country!</p> Overview of Crypto Regulations in Singapore <p>In 2020, the country’s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), introduced a licensing system for crypto exchanges and wallet providers under the Payment Services Act (PSA). With this move, the agency ensured that crypto-related activities within the country adhere to <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations</a>.</p><p>Under this framework, cryptocurrencies are classified as digital payment tokens (DPTs), effectively making approved cryptocurrencies legal assets in Singapore and allowing them to be treated on par with other asset&nbsp;classes.</p><p>The act stipulates that any business offering crypto services must obtain a payment institution license, which means having a registered office in Singapore.</p><p>The country’s financial regulatory body also incorporated cryptocurrencies under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) in the same year. This move essentially categorized certain approved tokens as capital market products.</p><p>Singapore also mandates that cryptocurrency exchanges and other virtual asset service providers secure a capital market services (CMS) license for issuing digital tokens. With this requirement, the country is ensuring that these entities meet specific financial standards and maintain a clear demarcation between firms engaged in market-making activities and those focusing on developing blockchain-based innovations in the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-state-of-global-crypto-regulations">Click here to learn about the current state of global crypto regulations.</a></p> Specifics of the Singapore Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/notices/psn02-aml-cft-notice---digital-payment-token-service">MAS published PSN02</a>, also known as the Crypto Travel Rule Singapore, which came into force in January 2020 to address money laundering and terror financing risks. It is a part of Singapore’s broader cryptocurrency regulation framework, where MAS mandates that crypto service providers comply with the FATF’s Travel Rule to bolster the resilience of the country’s financial system.</p><p>Notably, these rules don’t apply when transactions are between crypto service providers and non-custodial or self-hosted wallets.</p><p>However, according to the stipulations of the Crypto Travel Rule Singapore, VASPs are obligated to collect and share originator and beneficiary information with the beneficiary crypto service providers for all transactions, regardless of the amount involved.</p><p>For transactions below or equal to SGD 1,500, the information required includes:</p>  The name of the value transfer originator  The value transfer originator’s account number or unique transaction reference number  The name of the value transfer beneficiary  The value transfer beneficiary’s account number or unique transaction reference number.  <p>And when the crypto transaction amount exceeds S$1,500, a wider scope of information must be collated and shared. This includes:</p>  Name of the transaction originator and their account number or unique transaction reference number  Originator’s address, date and place of birth, and a unique identification number, which can be a birth certificate number or passport number and an identity card number or the registration number in case it’s a&nbsp;business  Name of the beneficiary and their account number or unique transaction reference number  If it’s a legal entity, then its ultimate beneficiary owner (UBO) must be identified and verified.  <p>Under Crypto Travel Rule Singapore, financial institutions, too, are required to implement a robust risk management system that includes:</p>  Risk assessment and Risk mitigation  Customer due diligence (CDD)  Enhanced due diligence (EDD)  Sanctions list screening  Politically exposed persons (PEP) screening  Ongoing transaction monitoring  Reliance on third&nbsp;parties  Correspondent accounts and wire transfers  Audit, employee training, and internal&nbsp;policies  Record-keeping for at least five&nbsp;years  Compliance reporting, including suspicious transactions to&nbsp;MAS   Is Crypto Legal in Singapore? <p>Yes, crypto is legal in Singapore and open to innovation through the Payment Services Act (PSA), which was passed in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>This Act clarifies the legal status of crypto and governs a wide range of payment service companies, including account issuance, local and international money transfer services, e-money issuers, merchant acquisition, foreign exchange, and Digital Payment Token Services.</p><p>Companies dealing with crypto transmission, exchange, or storage are subject to the MAS regulatory control. Due to Singapore’s strict crypto AML/CFT laws, VASPs need to register for a trading license and adhere to AML/CFT&nbsp;rules.</p> Crypto Taxes in Singapore <p>Singapore is often regarded as a crypto tax haven for both individuals and businesses, primarily because it <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_cit_income-tax-treatment-of-digital-tokens_091020.pdf?sfvrsn=91dbe1f7_17">does not impose a capital gains tax</a> on cryptocurrency investments. This policy facilitates favorable conditions for long-term crypto investments.</p><p>However, the tax scenario differs for those who engage in professional crypto trading. In such cases, profits from trading are treated as income from business activity and are, therefore, subject to income tax. This taxation applies irrespective of whether the trading is short-term or long-term as long as it is conducted in a professional capacity.</p><p>In instances where crypto trading is subject to income tax, losses incurred can be deducted for tax purposes, offering some relief in the event of a downturn in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>For businesses that accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, the value received is treated as income and is subject to income&nbsp;tax.</p><p>It’s important to note that while transactions involving the purchase or sale of goods and services using cryptocurrencies are not subject to the standard 8% Goods and Services Tax (GST), the act of buying, selling, or converting cryptocurrencies is subject to GST on the fees involved in these transactions.</p><p>In terms of accounting for these transactions, Singapore typically employs methods such as FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), and Weighted Average, providing different approaches to calculating profits or losses for tax reporting.</p> Singapore Stablecoin Regulation <p>In Q3 of 2023, Singapore finalized the rules for stablecoins, which are payment tokens that maintain a constant value against one or more fiat currencies, to become one of the first jurisdictions globally to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>These rules aim to “facilitate the use of stablecoins as a credible digital medium of exchange and as a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems.”</p><p>As per Singapore stablecoin regulation, some key requirements to ensure value stability at all times&nbsp;include:</p>  Holding a minimum of 1 million Singapore dollars (SGD) in base&nbsp;capital  Stablecoin reserves must be held in low-risk and highly liquid&nbsp;assets  Reserves backing the stablecoin must be equal to or exceed the value of the stablecoin in circulation at all&nbsp;times  Stablecoin issuers must return the stablecoin’s par value to holders within five business days of a redemption request  Stablecoin issuers must provide “appropriate disclosures,” including value stabilizing mechanisms and reserve audits to&nbsp;users.  <p>These rules will apply to single‑currency stablecoins issued in the country and pegged to the local fiat currency, Singapore dollar (SGD), or any G10 currency, such as the USD. Stablecoins that fulfill these requirements will be recognized by the regulator as “MAS-regulated stablecoins,” distinguishing them from non-regulated tokens.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Singapore is one of the only countries in the world to provide a clear and robust legal framework for crypto assets. And when this regulatory clarity is combined with higher than average cryptocurrency ownership of <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/10584/cryptocurrency-in-singapore/#topicOverview">19%</a>, it makes Singapore a prime location for dealing with cryptocurrencies.</p><p>However, virtual asset service providers need to understand both the FATF Travel Rule and the broader crypto regulatory framework in Singapore in order to take full advantage of Singapore’s crypto adoption, tax benefits, and regulatory support for blockchain and fintech innovation and&nbsp;thrive.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What is the Payment Services Act in Singapore and How Does It Affect Cryptocurrencies? <p>The Payment Services Act, enacted in Singapore in 2019 (often referred to as the PSA Act Singapore or simply the Singapore Payment Act), modernizes the regulatory framework for digital payment services, directly impacting cryptocurrency-related businesses.</p> Q2: How Does Singapore’s Monetary Authority Regulate Crypto Exchanges and Wallet Providers? <p>In 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) mandated a licensing regime under the Payment Services Act specifically for crypto exchanges and wallet providers. This initiative, part of Singapore’s crypto exchange regulation, ensures these entities comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) standards. Consequently, only MAS-approved crypto exchanges and wallet services that adhere to these regulations are permitted to operate in Singapore.</p> Q3: What is the Crypto Travel Rule in Singapore, and What are its Thresholds? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule in Singapore is a regulatory measure for cryptocurrency transactions, in line with FATF Recommendation 16, which mandates the sharing of transaction information to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>When a transaction exceeds SGD 1,500, detailed information about both the sender and recipient must be disclosed. This requirement, part of the broader Singapore Travel Rule Crypto regulations, is also applicable for transactions below this threshold. However, the information required is not that detailed, unlike when the transactions exceed SGD&nbsp;1,500.</p> Q4: How are Cryptocurrencies Classified and Regulated Under Singapore’s Laws? <p>Cryptocurrencies in Singapore are classified as digital payment tokens under the Payment Services Act and are included under the Securities and Futures Act. This classification allows them to be legally treated as assets, requiring businesses to comply with various regulatory requirements, including obtaining relevant licenses.</p> Q5: What Specific Requirements are Imposed on Crypto Transactions in Singapore Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>The MAS mandates the collection and sharing of detailed originator and beneficiary information for all crypto transactions, with more comprehensive data required for transactions exceeding SGD 1,500. This includes personal identification and account&nbsp;details.</p> Q6: Is Cryptocurrency Legal in Singapore, and What are the Regulatory Requirements? <p>Yes, cryptocurrency is legal in Singapore. The Payment Services Act governs crypto transactions, with businesses needing to register for a trading license and adhere to stringent AML/CFT&nbsp;laws.</p> Q7: What is the Singapore Stablecoin Regulation? <p>Singapore stablecoin regulation is established rules for stablecoins in the city-state. Its goal is to ensure that stablecoins maintain consistent value stability. The key requirements for stablecoin issuers include a minimum base capital, liquid asset reserves, and clear disclosures to users, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>It’s been a busy few months at Ubisecure with a number of presentations at various events throughout Europe – some of which are available on-demand on our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/video-resources/" title="<span>Video Resources page</span>">Video Resources page</a>. It is great to be at the events, hearing from other industry experts, meeting new people, and not least getting direct feedback from live audiences as you present. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our core topics we’ve been presenting is getting great interest and engagement, and that is the notion of Identity Context.</p>
 What is Identity Context? 
<p>In business transactions, Identity Context helps to understand the parties involved in a transaction, including their roles, representative rights, responsibilities, and the nature of their engagement in a specific transaction.</p>
<p>Our work at Ubisecure is driven by our shared vision on the future of digital identity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine a highly assured organisation identity with a strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve written in depth about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/true-b2b-iam/" title="highly assured organisation identity">highly assured organisation identity</a>, and how the value of strongly authenticated individual identity is well known. However, it is the act of combining those two identity classes that gives actual context to the potential interaction and defines the rights of the individual. It is this resultant combined identity that defines the Identity Context and enables the presentation of an aggregated/generated set of rights that are appropriate in that context.</p>
 The Value of Context 
<p>We all use the value of Identity Context implicitly, often without realising it, but in those circumstances, it is almost always ‘manually’ or at best with administrative control.</p>
<p>In direct interactions we often add context automatically – consider introducing yourself to a new teacher at your child’s school: ‘Hi I’m X, mother/father of Y’. Adding the parental relationship immediately adds context to the interaction and context to your presented identity. Alternatively, it’s almost certain that the first slide of any presentation you have given has established your Identity Context with the audience by including your name and your job title.</p>
<p>The context allows bounds to be known in the scope of the interaction. Additionally, that context will define rights that the individual can assert because they are acting in that context.</p>
 The Complexity of Context 
<p>Identity Context has value, and we use it already. So, how complex can it be? In short, very complex.</p>
<p>Context is, well, contextual. For a given individual they will operate in many differing contexts at differing times; they may even operate in multiple contexts at the same time. When operating in multiple contexts these can be independent or combined.</p>
<p>Add to this that the rate of change of contexts can be high; either as demanded by external changes, or as demanded by the process itself. A great example of this is privilege application management, where best security practice calls for least privilege by default and shortest possible time of increased privilege. The broader context might not change for several hours, but within that there will be fast-moving point in time contexts (with associated rights) that need to take effect in real time.</p>
<p>The idea of fast-moving context actually meshes very well with the current ‘buzz’ around Zero Trust. Zero Trust is often described as ‘authenticate always, authenticate often’ but in implementation ‘authenticate’ becomes ‘authorise’, noting that you must be known (authenticated) to be authorised.</p>
<p>Authorising often allows for rights to be modified as time and context change.</p>
 The Risks of Context 
<p>Context defines rights, and often responsibilities. In the previous two examples the context was self-declared. Self-declaration is ‘efficient’, but also sits as the root cause for most fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Referring back to our vision, discussed at the start of this blog, for a moment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine a highly assured organisation identity with a strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>We talk about a highly assured organisation identity and a strongly authenticated individual identity – we actually get most value when that individual identity is highly assured as well. But there is a third item that needs to have an assurance level – the ‘combination’.</p>
<p>The combination is the linkage between the two identity types. In the examples above, we have Parent and Employee as the specific linkage.</p>
<p>The linkage can be self-declared, verbally – “I am the parent of” – which is a low assurance declaration and therefore, a low assurance combination. Alternatively, that linkage can be verified, for example through a birth certificate and passports.</p>
<p>The assurance level of the linkage directly affects the value of the Identity Context.</p>
<p>For a given eco-system, the assurance levels of identities and linkage will be defined by a Governance Framework. We see a great example of this in the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/vlei/">vLEI</a> eco-system (based on verifiable credentials), defined by the GLEIF and supported by Ubisecure. The assurance levels of the organisation, individual and the linkage between the two are prescribed along with process definitions that will, when executed, preserve that assurance level.</p>
 In summary… 
<p>Identity Context enables significant value – we have seen and talked about a Northern European Government case study (see below) that realised a 99% saving from establishing a highly assured Identity Context and then allowing that to be delegated.</p>
<p>Knowing ‘who you are’ is not sufficient, we need to know the rights you have for the given ‘interaction’.</p>

 Why you should Regularly Review your Cyber Security 
 
<p>Cyber security is never done – you need to constantly work to improve your organization’s cyber security readiness.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive-wahlefeld-cyber-threat-landscape">Cyber adversaries never sleep</a> and the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80854/cyber-risks-from-china-how-contract-negotiations-can-mitigate-it-risks">geopolitical tensions across the world</a> are raising the cyber security threat levels.</p>
 
 Technology is evolving 
 
<p>The technology landscape is evolving creating new opportunities as well as new threats.&nbsp; Lange Language Models (LLMs) have evolved beyond what was thought practical only a few years ago and conversational Artificial Intelligence engines are now a commodity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations are adopting these to provide improved efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and a better connection with their customers, partners, and suppliers.&nbsp; However, while LLMs provide <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-lichtenthaler-human-and-artificial-intelligence">great opportunities</a>, they also bring <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/artificial-intelligence-cre23">new cyber threats</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI involves a new kind of development pipeline and current system development methodologies and tools are not yet adapted to this.&nbsp; Can you be sure of the provenance of your training data? Can you trust the shared LLM?&nbsp; Can you be sure that the deployed inference engine has not been poisoned?</p>
<p>LLMs represent an entirely new form of cloud workload.&nbsp; Current Cloud Native Application Platforms (CNAPP) and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81219/cloud-security-posture-management">Cloud Security Posture Management&nbsp; (CSPM)</a> do not cover these.</p>
<p>However, LLMs provide powerful capabilities to enhance the identification of cyber risks, the detection of active threats and the response to and recovery from cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations cannot afford to neglect the new opportunities but must prepare for these new threats. &nbsp;They must also exploit these new capabilities to improve their cyber security.</p>
 
 Standards and Regulations are Developing 
 
<p>The standards and best practice frameworks for cyber security are changing to respond to the increasing level of cyber threats and to incorporate the latest industry insights into how to best respond to these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 27001 The widely used information <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/27001">security standard ISO/IEC 27001</a> was updated in 2022. &nbsp;This new standard includes completely new controls covering - Threat intelligence, Information security for use of Cloud services, ICT readiness for business continuity, Physical security monitoring, Configuration management, Information deletion, Data masking, Data leakage prevention, Monitoring activities, Web filtering and Secure coding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your organization complies with ISO 27001 you will be required to update your controls to meet the new standard when next certified.&nbsp; Are your IT service providers and cloud services certified to the new standard?</p>
<p>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) v2.0 &nbsp;- On <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2023/nist-releases-cybersecurity-framework-2-0-draft#:~:text=The%20CSF%202.0%20draft%20reflects,CSF%E2%80%94especially%20for%20creating%20profiles.">August 8, 2023</a>, NIST released a draft of the NIST CSF 2.0, making the most significant revision to the framework since its inception in 2014. The draft includes the CSF itself and a discussion draft of implementation examples. NIST intends to release the final version in early 2024 without issuing another version for public comments.</p>
<p>NIST’s CSF 2.0 version 2.0 introduces significant changes to the cybersecurity landscape to address evolving threats and make the framework more accessible to all types of organizations. The draft reflects community feedback and industry shifts, emphasizes the role of cybersecurity as a key enterprise risk, and expands its scope beyond critical infrastructure. The CSF now includes six core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, recover and the new “govern” function, which focuses on decision making in support of a cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>If your organization bases its approach to cyber security on this framework you need to plan for transition to the updated version.&nbsp; Are you ready for this transition?</p>
<p>EU NIS 2 - In the wake of increased cyber-attacks on national critical infrastructure, authorities around the world are imposing stricter requirements on organizations that their populations rely on for a wide range of essential services, which includes a wide and growing number of private companies that should be preparing now to meet their new obligations.</p>
<p>Notably the EU issued the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj">Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive in 2016</a>&nbsp;and the US saw the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a>&nbsp;on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity in 2021. But European authorities are now seeking to go even further with an update to the NIS Directive, known as NIS2, which is expected to go into force by the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, NIS2 has a much wider scope, going beyond the traditional critical national infrastructure providers to include a range of organizations that are essential for the normal functioning of society, which include both EU and non-EU organizations that will have to ensure their compliance in future.</p>
<p>Is your organization <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-digital-frontier-cre23">ready to comply with its obligations</a> under these new regulations.</p>
 
 Reviewing your cyber security 
 
<p>Business objectives, organizational best practices, and technologies are constantly evolving.&nbsp; It is essential to continuously review your organization’s performance in the light of these changes. To support these reviews, KuppingerCole provides Maturity Level Matrices that are specifically targeted to distinct areas of cyber security.</p>
<p>These are based on the five-point maturity scale formulated using the Carnegie Mellon Maturity Index (CMMI).&nbsp; Note that this is currently <a href="https://cmmiinstitute.com/products/cmmi/content-release">being enhanced</a> to &nbsp;include best practices for measuring capability and improving performance in the areas of people management, data management, and virtual work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessing maturity based on this model is complex and to organizations to accomplish this task for cyber security <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80839/maturity-level-matrix-for-cyber-security">we publish two matrixes</a> that describe the key areas that must be considered when assessing cyber security maturity.&nbsp; There are two matrices one covering cyber security organizational and management maturity and the other technological maturity. These are summarized below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Cyber security organizational and management maturity</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: Cyber Security Technological maturity levels</p>
<p>KuppingerCole provides deep research into all the areas of cyber security.&nbsp; There also are many useful sessions from our cyberevolution event including how the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5421/1">hackers can exploit AI</a>, the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5430/1">regulatory challenges to the financial industry from DORA</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5469/1">practical advice on cloud security.</a></p>

<p>In today’s digital age, the threat landscape continues to evolve and organizations are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks. To combat these ever-growing risks, the concept of cyber resiliency has gained significant importance. Cyber resiliency refers to an organization’s ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyber threats while maintaining the continuity of operations. In this blog, we will explore the concept of cyber resiliency from an IBM® perspective and how our approach can help organizations protect themselves in an ever-changing cybersecurity landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the need for reliable, resilient, recoverable and corruption-free data governance has long been achieved by a backup and recovery routine, more modern techniques have been developed to support proactive measures that protect against threats before they occur. IBM FlashSystem® has bolstered existing tasks like error detection and immutable copies with greater functionality, including error code detection, immutability sections and centralized landscape management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cyber resiliency goes beyond mere cybersecurity measures. It encompasses a holistic approach that focuses on resilience at every level of an organization’s infrastructure, from applications and networks to data and people. It recognizes that breaches are inevitable and places equal emphasis on prevention, detection, response and recovery.&nbsp;</p>



 Our approach to cyber resiliency&nbsp; 



 
 Risk assessment and strategy: IBM emphasizes the importance of conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities and potential threats. By understanding the organization’s unique risk landscape, IBM helps develop a strategic roadmap that aligns cybersecurity investments with business objectives, ensuring optimal protection while optimizing resources.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Prevention and protection: Preventing cyber threats before they can cause damage is a fundamental aspect of cyber resiliency. IBM offers a wide range of solutions and services to protect organizations against evolving threats, including advanced threat detection, encryption, access control and identity management. Their expertise in developing secure systems ensures that proactive defense measures are in place.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Incident response and recovery: Despite robust prevention measures, incidents can occur. IBM recognizes the need for a swift and effective response to minimize damage. We provide organizations with incident response services, including threat hunting, forensics and crisis management to help identify, contain and eradicate threats. Furthermore, IBM’s resilient infrastructure solutions enable efficient data recovery and system restoration to minimize downtime and ensure business continuity.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Continuous monitoring and learning: Cyber threats evolve rapidly, making it essential for organizations to stay ahead of the curve. IBM emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and learning. Our advanced security analytics tools, combined with threat intelligence and machine learning capabilities, enable proactive threat hunting, anomaly detection and pattern analysis. By continuously learning from past incidents, organizations can strengthen their cyber resiliency posture.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Collaborative approach: IBM recognizes that no organization can address cyber threats alone. We advocate for a collaborative approach that involves sharing threat intelligence, best practices and insights with partners and the cybersecurity community. Through initiatives like the IBM X-Force® Exchange, organizations can gain access to actionable intelligence, helping them stay resilient in the face of emerging threats.&nbsp; 
 



<p>One of the key approaches that IBM has adopted stems from the ability of storage to handle some of the most rapid and significant responses to resiliency. Among the most important tenets of IBM’s guidance is adherence to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In an important way, this relies, for quickest recovery, on storage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an era where cyber threats continue to grow in complexity and scale, cyber resiliency is no longer a luxury but a necessity for organizations. IBM’s comprehensive approach to cyber resiliency encompasses risk assessment, prevention, incident response, continuous monitoring and collaboration, empowering organizations to protect their critical assets and maintain business continuity. By adopting IBM’s perspective on cyber resiliency, organizations can stay one step ahead in the battle against cyber threats and safeguard their digital future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested in receiving a free cyber preparedness evaluation? IBM provides a free Cyber Resiliency Assessment, which is conducted through a two-hour virtual workshop with IBM security experts and storage architects. This assessment is confidential, vendor-neutral and non-invasive, and it does not require the installation of anything or the running of scripts. You’ll receive a detailed report of findings, a roadmap of recommended improvements and considerations and a management presentation that connects practical methods to achieve your critical business outcomes.&nbsp;You can also book a meeting on the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/flashsystem?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700068523787054&amp;p5=p&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwy4KqBhD0ARIsAEbCt6h2jPqG79_n6PIcKJnMuaBD7zY6nbZnYFAOHc1fbWEw--CirZbAnKUaAmvZEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM FlashSystem page</a>.</p>

<p>A cybersecurity strategy is not solely about managing risk across a business’ IT infrastructure. The stakes are especially high for organizations in highly regulated industries because they can be exploited through their digital supply chain, giving hackers access to consumers’ valuable and sensitive data. Consequently, these data breaches can rattle customer trust and the confidence of regulators. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When done correctly, cybersecurity can be a strategic initiative that supports product capability, organizational effectiveness and customer relationships. As enterprises scale infrastructure and systems to manage sensitive data and complex workloads, they must rely more on an ecosystem of partners to help them enhance their security and compliance without impacting performance and resiliency. &nbsp;</p>



 Minimizing breaches and vulnerabilities&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>As more enterprises adopt technologies to help solve their data security and privacy concerns, the lifecycle of a security breach becomes more integral to the overall financial impact to the organization. This is especially important for companies in highly regulated industries as they are consistently tasked with protecting the privacy of sensitive consumer data—such as the personal information found in financial and health records—while remaining in adherence to the latest security and compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the 2023 Cost of a Data Breach report <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">conducted by Ponemon Institute and sponsored by IBM</a>, breaches with identification and containment times under 200 days cost organizations USD 3.93 million. However, those with a breach lifecycle of over 200 days cost organizations USD 4.95 million—a 23% difference. Moreover, cloud environments were identified as frequent targets for cyberattacks in 2023. These attackers often gained access to multiple environments, with 39% of breaches spanning multiple environments and incurring a higher-than average cost of USD 4.75 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM is supporting clients across industries in their cybersecurity journey by providing comprehensive security capabilities to help make it easier to simplify their risk management and demonstrate regulatory compliance postures. The data security capabilities that are provided by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/hyper-protect-crypto%22%20/t%20%22_blank%22%20/o%20%22hyper-protect-crypto">IBM Cloud® Hyper Protect Crypto Services</a> help clients on their confidential computing journey by providing complete control of cloud data encryption keys and cloud hardware security modules. It also offers the industry’s only Keep Your Own Key (KYOK) for data encryption at rest. This solution allows clients to retain sole access to their crypto keys, meaning not even IBM has access to clients’ keys.&nbsp;</p>



 Collaborating with the right partners to support security goals&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://fortris.com/">Fortris</a>, based in Spain, provides companies the tools to hold digital assets and utilize them in business operations such as cross-border payments and payroll. Fortris is aiming to improve its <a href="https://fortris.com/crypto-treasury">digital asset treasury operations</a> platform by using confidential computing capabilities available through IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Services. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This collaboration allows Fortris’ clients to address the risk of malicious actors to manipulate or gain access to company workflows, confidential data, and digital assets. The KYOK capability from IBM allows Fortris to protect data end-to-end while at rest. It also&nbsp;allows Fortris’ corporate users to leverage enhanced tools to operate with digital assets while minimizing security risks with full control over their digital asset keys. &nbsp;</p>



 Innovation with a security-first mindset&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>We see fintechs playing a heightened role in helping enterprises securely manage the growing market demand for digital assets. With this shift, fintechs are also looking for cloud services and providers that can help them navigate the regulated world of financial services more seamlessly and support greater levels of security for their cloud infrastructures. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.togg.com.tr/en/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">Togg</a>, a global mobility technologies and ecosystem provider that offers digital asset custody wallets, is working alongside Swiss-based fintech <a href="https://www.metaco.com/press-release/togg-partners-metaco-mobility-ecosystem-blockchain-nfts/">Metaco</a> to help secure the custody and governance of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and tokens. Togg’s primary goal is to build a secure platform based on a newly created token for all their consumers to use. The tokens are linked to different assets such as a certificate of ownership of a car that was purchased or carbon tracking and trading certificates to support sustainability metrics. These assets can be vulnerable to malicious actors that are looking to access these highly valuable assets and confidential data and they require security capabilities to help mitigate these threats. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Togg and Metaco also use KYOK encryption and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/confidential-computing%22%20/t%20%22_blank">confidential computing</a> capabilities to protect data when it is unencrypted and most vulnerable. This protection is achieved by using a hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE) that provides security and isolation to address unauthorized access to applications and data while they are in use. &nbsp;</p>



 Supporting cybersecurity initiatives through collaboration&nbsp; 



<p>The key to driving enterprise innovation and agility at scale is first developing a holistic cloud and security approach to support digital transformation from the onset. Along with making the necessary investments to bolster a well-defined cloud strategy and working with a provider that delivers high levels of resiliency and reliability, enterprises should be leveraging an ecosystem for support to help mitigate various levels of security risks that need to be managed before they become a problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let’s face it, organizations face many barriers to offering privacy products.</p>



<p>For companies that offer consumers pieces of the privacy and security puzzle, innovating and expanding offerings to adjacent – and in-demand – capabilities is often too expensive, takes too long, and falls outside of the core strength of the company offering the solution.</p>



<p>There’s a wide range of solutions that consumers “should” be using, but rarely are they motivated enough to do the hard work necessary to research, select, purchase, implement, and use all those solutions. Consequently, they use what they have been forced to use because of a security incident or they use the tools that come with their mainstream technology purchases or broader offerings.</p>



<p>Organizations playing in the privacy and online safety arena could benefit enormously from expanding their product offerings to cover adjacent areas – creating an easily acquired and easily implemented “one-stop-shop” where consumers get all they need from a brand they already trust.<br><br>Take these examples:</p>



 
 Insurance companies that offer identity theft insurance could package it with the technological solutions customers need to avoid falling victim in the first place. 



 Technology companies that offer cybersecurity capabilities, such as antivirus and malware protection, could add adjacent privacy and security offerings to complete the picture for consumers. 



 Vendors of specific privacy and online security services, such as credit monitoring, could boost customer loyalty and accelerate customer acquisition by also offering services their customers know they need but haven’t yet found an easy way to adopt. 



 Trusted general providers of goods and services, such as big box retailers and popular associations, could conveniently also offer online security products and services under the one roof, significantly increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.<br>

 The challenge is real 



<p><br>Most organizations are not equipped to re-direct development resources to new products that fall outside of their established sweet spot. While they certainly could hire, ramp-up, and build these types of solutions from scratch, the time to a viable and profitable product offering may be too much.</p>



<p>But what if there was a way to add attractive and necessary privacy and online safety capabilities to existing products – or even as new products – quickly, easily, and completely and without the burden of developing them in house?</p>



 The solution is Sudo Platform 



<p>Anonyome Labs’ Sudo Platform is an API-first, developer-focused ecosystem that delivers the tools companies need to quickly and completely deliver to their customers the capabilities they need to protect and control their personal information while navigating the digital world.

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees includes managing which SaaS applications they need access to and which they need to be removed from. Many small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) do this with something lovingly (or not so lovingly) called The SpreadsheetTM.</p>
<p>A new employee joins the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee left the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee changed their name? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, when the annual access review comes along, everyone asks: How accurate is The Spreadsheet? And as your company grows, the more employees you have, the more applications you use, the more digitally connected you are — the more complicated The Spreadsheet gets.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet method had its day, but you can see how it might prevent SMBs from leveling up and even unintentionally add operational, technical, and security debt to take care of later. It is possible to automate granting and revoking access and permissions by using APIs for many applications. But there are some substantial barriers:</p>
<p>It’s nobody’s job (yet). Small companies are often strapped, and maybe you don’t have a dedicated headcount that can own the process of <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">updating employee application access</a>.</p>
<p>The app doesn’t have an API. With some applications, the only way to update permissions is in the app itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">expensive SSO tax</a> gets in the way. Using automation software like Okta, for example, forces you to implement technological protocols you just don’t need yet. It’s expensive and can be disruptive to users.&nbsp;</p>
 A better way to automate IT permissions 
<p>Because it’s so easy to implement, more modern application vendors have adopted “Sign in with Google,” and they don’t charge for it. This means that if you use Google Workspace, the need for SAML-based SSO (like Okta) is nearly obsolete. And get this — 70% of startups and SMBs already operate on Google Workspace to begin with!</p>
<p>YeshID helps Google Super Admins create a streamlined, repeatable, efficient, and compliant way to manage identities and applications. Using templates, you can automate creating a Google user and putting them in the proper organization and groups. This also triggers the creation of a task list of apps they need access to and automatically sends requests for provisioning to the proper admins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, we’re testing an even easier way to do this: If the application offers the ability to read the list of users on lower subscription tiers, we’ll actually keep the list up to date for you. And soon, we’ll have the ability to add the user for you too (if that capability exists in lower subscription tiers).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, we have integrations with Slack, Notion, and Hubspot. Once enabled, syncing users from those applications to YeshID can be done with a click of a button.&nbsp;</p>
 Give it a go 
<p>YeshID is in beta and looking for folks who sit in that sweet spot where you want to ditch The Spreadsheet but don’t want to go all in on Okta. If this is you, <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">learn more</a>! We’re already <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-new-era-of-secure-it-identity-management-yeshid-soc-ii-and-you/">SOC II compliant</a>, we’re in the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/yeshid_onboard/456377342688">Google Workspace Marketplace</a>, and you have a big ol’ DELETE button if you decide it’s not for you. </p>

<p>For generations, teams have <a href="https://doodle.com/en/resources/blog/a-brief-history-of-meetings/?ref=blog.holochain.org">collaborated in physical rooms</a> using materials like whiteboards, sticky notes, and printed documents laid out on tables. While collaboration can be one of those “suitcase words” that is full of different meanings depending on the person you ask, it’s an enduring part of most of our work lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Dedicated spaces enabled the kinds of fluid interaction and embodied cognition which, in turn, drives complex projects forward.</p><p>With today's increasingly distributed digital work environments and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/01/why-labor-economists-say-the-remote-work-revolution-is-here-to-stay.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">work from home</a> setups, can elements of dynamic in-person teamwork successfully be recreated online?</p><p>As video meetings and productivity suites become default remote work tools, teams strive to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/revolutionizing-the-workspace/">recreate collaborative dynamics digitally</a>. However, experts argue purely digital collaboration has inherent limits.</p><p>This article explores: lessons from physical group flow, key aspects to replicate collaboration digitally, remaining gaps, and the potential of immersive and distributed platforms still on the horizon, like Holochain.&nbsp;</p> The Magic of Physical Spaces <p>For Hailey Cooperrider, game designer and co-founder of collaborative consultancy <a href="https://amble.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Amble</a>, physical spaces enable a “magic” that digital platforms struggle to recreate.&nbsp;</p><p>She argues spatial dynamics like rooms allow more holistic group participation than 2D screens, stating, “I think being in a space with the whiteboard and having room to collaborate together isn’t just for the creative piece. It’s about dealing with complexity.”</p><p>Cooperrider also discusses how “literally, we think, with movement, with our hands, and with other parts of our bodies. And that cognition happens throughout the body.”&nbsp;</p><p>While this radiating, embodied cognition isn’t limited virtually, it certainly thrives in environments where teams can gather together physically.</p><p>When complex creativity and collaboration is required (such as in large groups), in-person spaces currently provide a fluidity that digital tools have difficulty replicating. Large meetings require quick back-and-forth communication among a large number of people — which is more time-consuming on the computer.&nbsp;</p> Bridging Physical &amp; Digital Workflows <p>When considering how to translate collaborative dynamics online, Cooperrider discusses the importance of preserving certain familiar artifacts digitally. For example, she notes that her team relies heavily on Trello's digital task boards to mimic physical sticky notes for project management.</p><p>“We love it, because it just smooths out what would normally be sticky notes, and allows us to bring our own meaning to the lists and the columns," she explains. Rather than prescribe complex new workflows, Trello provides flexibility for groups to organize work their own way.</p><p>Cooperrider also discusses how engineers often focus on operational challenges like reducing friction in workflows. However, she argues digital tools actually work best when preserving existing collaborative platforms and workflows that teams are already familiar with.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Google Suite took traditional formats for documents, slides, and spreadsheets, and made them editable in real-time by multiple users online. Rather than adding complicated features to these tools, it kept them simple — and added the utility of collaboration.</p><p>Cooperrider concludes that "the most revolutionary, powerful, and most popular collaboration tool, it’s the Google Suite.”</p><p>While new technologies open new possibilities, they must also integrate the traditional techniques teams have relied on for years, in order to maximize adoption and usage. The future likely involves blending physical “magic” with virtual capabilities.</p> People-First Tools in a Hybrid Future <p>While digital collaboration tools have delivered immense progress, the next horizons explore decentralized and distributed models giving users more control, as with Holochain. Rather than enforce rigid conformity, the ideal future blends customizable peer-to-peer frameworks with thoughtfully designed physical spaces.</p><p>Tools must smooth, not obstruct, the rituals sustaining teams. And digital interactive spaces should spark the embodied cognition inherent to human collaboration. As remote and hybrid work expand, integrating the digital connectivity teams need with the in-person magic they crave is essential.</p><p>The frontier of collaboration technology puts people before platforms, deepening what is uniquely precious about gathering in rooms with resonant virtual capabilities. In the end, innovation emerges from groups in flow — whether particles across cables or shoulder-to-shoulder around whiteboards</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-cloud-solution-tutorials-2022-in-review/">it has become tradition</a>, the team creating the&nbsp;looks back and shares the personal highlights of the year 2023.</p>



<p>Another year has passed—it felt like the whole world was talking about and trying out tools powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence">generative AI</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs). Kids completing homework with ChatGPT, the rest of us generating images, PowerPoint slides, poems, code skeletons and security hacks. IBM introduced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx as the AI and data platform built for business</a>. And just this month, IBM and Meta, together with over 50 founding members and collaborators, launched the <a href="https://thealliance.ai/">AI Alliance</a>. Its goal is to advance open, safe and responsible AI. Quite fascinating.</p>



<p>Now, on to our personal highlights of 2023…</p>



 Frederic 



<p>AI – Last year in December, the buzz surrounding AI was palpable. This year, AI started making big waves in mid-November and its impact has been felt across various aspects of our lives. From photo editing to writing emails, AI has become an indispensable tool in many settings. As I’ve seen it being used with remarkable efficiency in coding, trip planning, meeting preparation, user interface design, job interview question generation and social media posts, it’s clear that this technology will continue to advance and become even more integral to our daily lives.</p>



<p>Platform engineering, internal development platform – Platform engineering is at the forefront of modern software development, driving innovation and collaboration across teams. By capturing best practices in reusable Terraform templates, engineering teams can streamline their workflows, reduce errors and improve productivity leading to better software outcomes for users and faster time to market. This year, IBM Cloud <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/projects-and-cost-estimation">introduced projects and deployable architectures</a>. <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understanding-projects">Projects</a> are a named collection of configurations that are used to manage related resources and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure-as-code">Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</a> deployments. A <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog#reference_architecture">deployable architecture</a> is a cloud automation for deploying a common architectural pattern that combines one or more cloud resources that are designed for easy deployment, scalability and modularity. It is very easy to turn a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/turn-your-terraform-templates-into-deployable-architectures/">terraform template into a deployable architecture</a> and open the door to cost optimization, compliance management, self-service, standardization and repeatability.</p>



<p>KubeCon – KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2023 was in Chicago this year, my hometown. This was my first time at the conference and let me tell you, it was nothing short of mind-blowing! Seeing the Kubernetes ecosystem in action was truly amazing—the sheer scale of what it’s capable of is awe-inspiring. It’s incredible to think about how one technology can support so many companies and create such a vast array of job opportunities! I caught on many of the conference themes and walking through the vendors, I got impressed by many of the technologies. AI and internal development platform were two of the highlights. Now I need to pick a few and try some of the vendor products!</p>



 Powell 



<p>Platform engineering on the Hybrid Cloud – While writing the case study <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ibm-cio-organization-hybrid-cloud">IBM hybrid cloud delivers value for reinvestment and manages compliances</a>, I was astounded by the breadth of applications IBM creates and supports to manage the business. The extension of the CIO office’s dedicated data center to the IBM public cloud allowed for experimentation and growth with zero risk. The platform supports a global footprint for disaster recovery (DR), leveraging Red Hat OpenShift. Application templates with guardrails ensure the day-to-day operations, fixes and security patches are delivered continuously.</p>



<p>Transit VPC using VPN – The hub and spoke model allows communication to pass through a firewall-router using an off the shelf appliance. There is a two-part tutorial (<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-transit1">part1</a>, <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-transit2">part2</a>) that describes the architecture. The Terraform automation and automated regression testing allowed me to reliably change the connection mechanism from direct link to VPN. The blog post “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-to-use-vpn-with-a-vpc-hub-and-spoke-architecture/">How to use VPN with a VPC hub-and-spoke architecture</a>” describes the project. Automated regression tests are a dynamite.</p>







<p>VPC Custom Images – Some workloads are best captured on VPC virtual machines. Baking the application into the virtual machine image is a simple way to roll out software. You can use IBM’s images as a starting point or bring your own cloud-init image into the IBM Cloud. Read <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/vpc-custom-image-creation-and-distribution/">VPC Custom Image Creation and Distribution</a> to get insights into VPC image support in the IBM Cloud.</p>



 Dimitri 



<p>Blog posts – In <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/adding-instance-storage-to-an-existing-vpc-vsi/">Adding Instance Storage to an Existing VPC VSI</a>, I describe the process I took to update an existing virtual server instance (VSI) and add instance storage to it. This was made possible by an enabling feature that allows you to preserve and re-use a boot volume when a VSI is deleted.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/using-event-notifications-in-your-deployed-solutions/">Using Event Notifications in your deployed solutions</a>, I covered how to set up and configure the service using an infrastructure as code template and automatically route service notifications to an SMS, email or object storage destination. The team that develops this offering recently added the ability to customize the e-mail that is sent, this is a great improvement as you can now suggest actions to your recipients based on the event that was captured.</p>



<p>Certifications – I worked with a team of talented subject matter experts to revamp our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/training/path/ibmcloudprofessionaldeveloper2023">IBM Certified Professional Developer</a> learning plan. The courses in the plan are focused on services that are relevant to developers building applications on the IBM Cloud platform and prepare you for the certification exam, which you can now take <a href="https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/ibm-certified-professional-developer-cloud-v6-C9005400">online with Pearson Vue</a>. Check it out if getting certified is still on your to-do list for the year. If you are interested in other roles such as architect, SRE, etc., you can also take a look at the full list of learning plans and certifications on the<a href="https://www.ibm.com/training/"> IBM Training page</a>.</p>



 Henrik 



<p>Db2 and IDUG anniversaries – Happy birthday, Db2! And happy birthday, International Db2 User Group (IDUG)! <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/db2">IBM Db2</a> for z/OS celebrated its 40th anniversary this year. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/celebrating-30-years-of-db2-running-the-worlds-mission-critical-workloads/">IBM Db2 was launched in June 1983</a>. Five years later, <a href="https://www.idug.org">IDUG</a> was born. And another five years later, 30 years ago, IBM Db2 (for Linux, UNIX and Windows, LUW) was made available to the public.</p>



<p>As former user, then developer, manager, technical enabler, lab advocate and since some years <a href="https://www.idug.org/about/idug-committees/emea-cpc">IBM liaison to the IDUG EMEA Conference Planning Committee (CPC)</a>, I was fortunate and happy to celebrate the anniversaries by meeting many Db2 users at the IDUG 2023 EMEA Db2 Tech Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, as well as at some other events.</p>



<p>Cloud security – How would you rate your adoption of security features to protect your cloud account and its managed resources? Have you utilized a service to assess your account’s security posture? I try to follow the cloud and data security news and find it fascinating what security features have been added and at the same time how attacks have changed (nothing new when looking back…).</p>



<p>Over the past year, I started to secure more resources using <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis">context-based restrictions</a>. Access is then limited to configured service instances or specific network zones and addresses. Furthermore, for some resources I even added <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iam-time-based">time-based conditions</a> to restrict access to certain hours or for a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/for-a-short-time-only-time-based-restrictions-for-enhanced-cloud-security/">stretch of days (like workshops or hackathons)</a>. Yet another security feature is a trusted profile. It allows to authenticate without API key or password, but based on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/turn-your-container-into-a-trusted-cloud-identity/">well-defined other criteria like a specific compute resource (virtual machine, Kubernetes cluster and namespace)</a>. A new tutorial, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/new-tutorial-trusted-profiles-for-secure-cloud-environments/">trusted profiles for secure cloud environments</a>, discusses the technical details and walks you through the steps for enhanced security.</p>



<p>Security-wise, there was much more. I wrote two blog posts about account cleanup. The first was on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-cloud-security-how-to-clean-up-unused-access-policies/">how to clean up unused access policies</a>. The other discussed <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-cloud-inactive-identities-ideas-for-automated-processing/">automatic processing of detected inactive identities</a>. In terms of assessing the security posture of your account, the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/security-compliance/">IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC)</a> added several new features. As German and European, I especially like the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-release-notes#security-compliance-nov1423">new support for the BSI C5:2020 security profile</a>.</p>

  <p>At Ignite 2022, we announced the general availability of Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA) as part of Microsoft’s commitment to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a>. Based on our experience working with government customers, PIV/CAC cards are the most common authentication method used within the federal government. While valuable for all customers, the ability to use X.509 certificate for authentication directly against Entra ID is particularly critical for federal government organizations using PIV/CAC cards and looking to easily comply with the Executive Order 14028 requirements as well as customers who want to migrate from a federated server like Active Directory Federated Server to Entra ID for CBA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve added many new features and enhancements, which made CBA available on all platforms, including mobile, with support for certificates on devices as well as external security keys like YubiKeys. Customers now have more control and flexibility to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group and select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multi-factor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vimala Ranganathan, Product Manager on Microsoft Entra, will now talk about how these new features will help in your journey toward phishing-resistant MFA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>--  &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello everyone,   &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m Vimala from the Microsoft Entra PM team, and I’m excited to walk you through all the new features and enhancements to CBA in detail. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA username bindings CBA added support for three remaining username bindings and is now at parity with on-premises Active Directory. The three bindings that are being added are: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 IssuerAndSerialNumber  &nbsp; 
 IssuerAndSubject  &nbsp; 
 Subject Only  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The username binding policy allows admins to customize how Entra ID will match the certificate being presented by the user with their user account in Entra ID. By default, we map Principal Name in the subject Alternative Name (SAN) attribute of the certificate to UserPrincipalName in the user object. An admin can override the default and create a custom mapping. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Authentication policy rules help determine the strength of authentication as either single-factor or multi-factor.&nbsp;Unlike other authentication methods available in Entra ID, which are either always, CBA is capable of being either. We like to refer to this as CBA being a multi-factor capable authentication method, and the authentication policy rules allow the admin to configure protection levels to determine when Entra ID should consider a certificate to be single-factor or multi-factor. Multiple custom authentication binding rules can be created to assign default protection level for certificates based on the certificate attributes (Issuer or Policy OID or by combining the Issuer and OID).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Affinity Binding refers to certificate attributes used for validating a certificate for user authentication. As we introduced earlier, there are several ways a certificate can be bound or matched to a user object. Some methods rely on properties of a user’s certificate that are easily reusable. This reusability characteristic is the key indicator to whether a particular user binding method is High (strong) or Low (weak) affinity. For example, implementing a user binding based on SAN Principal Name would be low affinity, whereas a user binding policy based on Issuer+SerialNumber would be high affinity. Entra ID allows admins to set affinity binding at tenant level, as well as create custom rules to use high affinity or low affinity mapping for covering many potential scenarios our customers have in use today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CBA as second factor will now support CBA as one of the factors to get multifactor authentication (MFA) to access Entra resources. More info at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive#mfa-with-single-factor-certificate-based-authentication">MFA with CBA</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>CBA as Most Recently Used (MRU) method is set once a user authenticates successfully using CBA, and the user's MRU authentication method is set to CBA. Next time, when the user enters their UPN and clicks&nbsp;Next, the user is taken to the CBA method directly and need not select&nbsp;‘Use the certificate or smart card.’ To reset the MRU method, the user needs to cancel the certificate picker, click&nbsp;‘Other ways to sign in,’ and select another method available to the user and authenticate successfully.

<p>The role of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/procurement">procurement</a> extends beyond transactional activities. A procurement strategy allows an organization to navigate an increasingly complex global supply chain, adapt swiftly to market fluctuations, and achieve cost optimization, operational efficiency and growth.</p>



<p>By assessing and proactively managing risks inherent in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-management">supply chain</a>, organizations can shield themselves from disruptions and strengthen the resilience of their operations. In addition, a well-crafted procurement framework fosters innovation and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-sustainability">sustainability</a>. It can nurture collaborative partnerships with suppliers and integrate ethical and environmental (green purchasing) considerations into the sourcing strategy.</p>



<p>A procurement strategy is not merely a series of steps for acquiring goods and services. It should be a strategic roadmap that, when effectively designed and implemented, aligns with the mission of the organization and greatly contributes to its success.</p>



 What is a procurement strategy? 



<p>A procurement strategy is a structured plan that an organization develops to guide its purchasing process in a way that aligns with its business needs. The goal of a procurement strategy is to ensure the efficient, cost-effective and sustainable acquisition of goods or services that are essential for the organization’s operations. The strategy should outline and provide specific guidance for performing the steps of the procurement process, which often include:</p>



 
 Identifying needs of the business 



 Sourcing potential suppliers 



 Negotiating contracts 



 Managing relationships with the suppliers 



 Maintaining records of every step 
 



<p>The strategy used to guide these steps can differ from organization to organization, depending on its industry and needs. Examples of goals that are common to many procurement strategies include eliminating maverick spending, increasing delivery efficiency, minimizing errors and complying with applicable regulations. Building strong supplier relationships to encourage favorable contracts and service is also a common goal.</p>



<p>A balance of talent, technology, compliance, ethics and sustainability is needed to align procurement activities with corporate objectives. An effective procurement strategy should be open to new approaches and encourage ideas that bring value, efficiency and continuous process improvement to the organization. This enables an effective and adaptive approach to sourcing that creates value and minimizes risk.</p>



<p>When implemented with clear objectives, the procurement strategy will provide a roadmap for procurement managers to follow. It will outline their purpose, responsibilities and goals and the critical role they play in the overall success of the organization.</p>



 Steps to a successful procurement strategy 



<p>Key steps to develop an effective procurement strategy include:</p>



 1. Conduct a current state analysis (CSA) 



<p>Assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the current procurement strategy framework (if there is one) and determine if it will meet current and future needs. Do a spend analysis; identify strengths, weaknesses and opportunities. Evaluate and categorize the components of procurement costs, from direct costs—such as the costs of goods and services—to indirect costs—such as administrative expenses and overhead. Examine costs related to specific suppliers, cost variables and trends, and the total cost of the procurement process to clearly understand what is being spent and where.</p>



 2. Determine organizational needs  



<p>Businesses always want to improve the bottom line; but how, specifically? Understand the organization’s needs—whether it’s increased sales, managing cash flow, shorter time-frames, improved forecasting, quality management or sustainability—and how they align with the overall business strategy and long-term plan. A procurement strategy that is integrated with these needs ensures that the procurement process will contribute directly to the organization’s profitability and success.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Engage stakeholders 



<p>Identify and collaborate with internal departments, suppliers and all those who may be impacted by the plan. Some may not agree with the proposed changes. Gather diverse insights, understand needs and manage expectations. Stakeholder engagement is key to ensure the strategy is well-planned and supported throughout the organization.</p>



 4. Determine business objectives 



<p>Define specific measurable, achievable, relevant and timely (SMART) objectives for the procurement function. These objectives should directly support the overarching business goals and provide a clear framework for the procurement strategy. For instance, if cost savings is a goal, a corresponding procurement objective might be achieving a level of cost reductions. Additional goals might be risk management and mitigation, supplier relationship management and sustainability considerations.</p>



 5. Define procurement policies 



<p>Establish and agree on clear procurement policies, procedures and operating models that align with organizational goals. This is a good time to review current processes and adjust them to suit the new approach. Tasks such as vendor selection criteria, contract management and compliance initiatives should be clearly defined. Communicate the opportunities these changes bring and explain their benefits for stakeholders. Be flexible. Policies serve as guidelines for the procurement team, ensuring consistency and adherence to ethical standards.</p>



 6. Integrate new tools 



<p>Explore the tools and technologies that will support the success of the new strategy. Procurement is no longer an analog process; a growing percentage of it takes place online (e-procurement). Procure-to-pay (P2P) software links procurement practices to accounts payable and can streamline steps such as supply management, purchase orders and invoicing. Additional procurement software includes spend analytics tools and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supplier-management">supplier relationship management</a> (SRM) software. These increase accuracy and productivity, track purchases and offers data visibility that informs decision making and reduces risk, inefficiencies and time-consuming delays.</p>



 7. Develop the strategy 



<p>Develop a comprehensive procurement strategy based on the insights gathered in the previous steps. This involves creating a strategy statement, outlining the approach to procurement, including supplier management, risk mitigation and cost optimization. The strategy should be flexible enough to adapt to changing market conditions and organizational needs.</p>



 8. Define success 



<p>Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure the success of the procurement strategy. These metrics should align with the defined business objectives and provide quantifiable benchmarks for evaluating performance. Common success criteria include error reduction, leveraging savings opportunities and improving supplier performance ratings, workflows, procurement cycle times and compliance.</p>



 9. Implement the strategy 



<p>Execute the procurement strategy in a phased and well-coordinated manner, deploying the defined policies, procedures and technologies. Provide necessary training to ensure procurement success.</p>



 10. Measure and refine the strategy 



<p>Regularly measure the performance of the strategy against the established success metrics. Determine if it is fostering change and improving the organization’s overall performance. Utilize data and insights to analyze outcomes, identify areas for improvement and refine the procurement strategy accordingly. Continuously monitor and adapt to ensure that the strategy remains responsive to changing market dynamics, evolving business goals and emerging opportunities or challenges.</p>



 Benefits of a successful procurement strategy 



<p>By implementing strategic sourcing and purchasing opportunities, organizations can achieve substantial cost savings. Moreover, an effective procurement strategy enhances operational efficiency by streamlining processes and introducing automation technologies. This results in reduced administrative tasks and faster procurement cycles.</p>



<p>A successful procurement strategy also mitigates risks inherent in the supply chain. Using risk assessment and management practices, organizations can safeguard against disruptions and ensure agility and continuity. The strategy can also foster improved supplier relationships, collaboration and innovation. Collectively, these advantages empower organizations to navigate the complexities of modern business with resilience, agility and a competitive advantage.</p>

<p>Derived from the Greek words for “hidden writing,” <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cryptography">cryptography</a> is the science of obscuring transmitted information so that it may only be read by the intended recipient. The applications of cryptography are endless. From the quotidian <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end</a> message authentication on WhatsApp to the practical digital signatures on legal forms or even the CPU-draining ciphers used for mining <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/industries/financial-services">cryptocurrency</a>, cryptography has become an essential aspect of our digital world and a critical <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> component for protecting sensitive data from hackers and other cybercriminals.</p>



<p>The practice of cryptology dates back to ancient times, with one of the earliest examples being attributed to Julius Caesar himself. Modern cryptosystems are far more advanced but still function in similar ways. Most cryptosystems begin with an unencrypted message known as plaintext, which is then <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">encrypted</a> into an indecipherable code known as ciphertext using one or more encryption keys. This ciphertext is then transmitted to a recipient. If the ciphertext is intercepted and the encryption algorithm is strong, the ciphertext will be useless to any unauthorized eavesdroppers because they won’t be able to break the code. The intended recipient, however, will easily be able to decipher the text, assuming they have the correct decryption key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before diving deeper, let’s take a look at the core features of strong cryptographic frameworks:</p>



 
 Confidentiality: Encrypted information can only be accessed by the person for whom it is intended and no one else.&nbsp; 



 Integrity: Encrypted information cannot be modified in storage or in transit between the sender and the intended receiver without any alterations being detected. 



 Non-repudiation: The creator/sender of encrypted information cannot deny their intention to send the information. 



 Authentication: The identities of the sender and receiver—as well as the origin and destination of the information—are confirmed. 



 Key management: The keys used in encrypting and decrypting data (and associated tasks like key length, distribution, generation, rotation, etc.) are kept secure. 
 



 Three categories of encryption 



<p>Although hybrid systems do exist (such as the SSL internet protocols), most encryption techniques fall into one of three main categories: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ztpf/2020?topic=concepts-symmetric-cryptography">symmetric cryptography algorithms</a>, asymmetric cryptography algorithms, or hash functions.&nbsp;</p>



 Symmetric key cryptography 



<p>Also known as private key cryptography, secret key cryptography or single key encryption, symmetric key encryption uses only one key for both the encryption process and decryption process. For these types of systems, each user must have access to the same private key. Private keys might be shared either through a previously established secure communication channel like a private courier or secured line or, more practically, a secure key exchange method like the Diffie-Hellman key agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two types of symmetric key algorithms:</p>



 
 Block cipher: In a block cipher, the cipher algorithm works on a fixed-size block of data. For example, if the block size is eight, eight bytes of plaintext are encrypted at a time. Normally, the user’s interface to the encrypt/decrypt operation handles data longer than the block size by repeatedly calling the low-level cipher function. 



 Stream cipher: Stream ciphers do not work on a block basis, but rather convert one bit (or one byte) of data at a time. Basically, a stream cipher generates a keystream based on the provided key. The generated keystream is then XORed with the plaintext data. 
 



<p>Some examples of symmetrical cryptography include the following:</p>



 
 DES: The Data Encryption Standard (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.1.0?topic=encryption-what-is-des-aes">DES</a>) was developed by IBM in the early 1970’s, and while it is now considered to be susceptible to brute force attacks, its architecture remains highly influential in the field of modern cryptography.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Triple DES: While advancements in computing made DES insecure by 1999, the DES cryptosystem built on the original DES foundation adds additional levels of security which cannot be broken by modern machines.&nbsp; 



 Blowfish: A fast, free, publicly available block cipher designed by Bruce Schneer in 1993. 



 AES: The Advanced Encryption Standard (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.1.0?topic=encryption-what-is-des-aes">AES</a>) is the first and only publicly accessible cipher approved by the U.S. National Security Agency for top secret information.&nbsp; 
 



 Asymmetric key cryptography 



<p>In asymmetric encryption, a pair of keys is used: one secret key and one public key. For this reason, these algorithms are also referred to as public key algorithms (PKA). Public key cryptography is generally considered to be more secure than symmetric encryption techniques because even though one key is publicly available, an encrypted message can only be decrypted with the intended recipient’s private key.</p>



<p>Some examples of asymmetrical cryptography include the following:</p>



 
 RSA: Named for its founders—Rivest, Shamier and Adleman—in 1977, the RSA algorithm is one of the oldest widely used public key cryptosystems used for secure data transmission.&nbsp; 



 ECC: Elliptic curve cryptography is an advanced form of asymmetric encryption that uses the algebraic structures of elliptic curves to create extremely strong cryptographic keys.&nbsp; 
 



 One-way hash algorithms 



<p>A cryptographic hash algorithm produces a fixed-length output string (often called a digest) from a variable-length input string. The input serves as the plaintext, and the output hash is the cipher. For all practical purposes, the following statements are true of a good hash function:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Collision resistant: If any portion of the data is modified, a different hash will be generated, ensuring data integrity.&nbsp; 



 One-way: The function is irreversible. That is, given a digest, it is not possible to find the data that produces it, ensuring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">data security</a>. 
 



<p>For these reasons, hash algorithms make for very effective cryptosystems because the hash algorithmencrypts the data directly without the need for different keys. In essence, the plaintext is its own key.</p>



<p>Consider the security vulnerability of a database of stored bank account passwords. Anyone with either authorized or unauthorized access to the bank’s computer systems could potentially read every password. To maintain data security, banks and other businesses will encrypt sensitive information like passwords into a hash value and store only that encrypted value in their database. Without knowing the user’s password, the hash value cannot be broken.&nbsp;</p>



 The future of cryptography 



 Quantum cryptography 



<p>Keeping pace with advancing technology and increasingly more sophisticated <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">cyberattacks</a>, the field of cryptography continues to evolve. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-cryptography">Quantum cryptography</a>, or quantum encryption, refers to the applied science of securely encrypting and transmitting data based on the naturally occurring and immutable laws of quantum mechanics for use in cybersecurity. While still in its early stages, quantum encryption has the potential to be far more secure than previous types of cryptographic algorithms and, theoretically, even unhackable.&nbsp;</p>



 Post-quantum cryptography 



<p>Not to be confused with quantum cryptography, which relies on the natural laws of physics to produce secure cryptosystems, post-quantum cryptographic algorithms use different types of mathematical cryptography to create quantum computer-proof encryption. Although not yet viable, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">quantum computing</a> is a quickly developing field of computer science with the potential to exponentially increase processing power—dwarfing even the fastest super computers operating today. While still theoretical, prototypes have demonstrated that practical quantum computers might be expected to break even the most secure public key cryptographysystems within the next 10 to 50 years.<br><br><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), the goal of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) (also called quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography) is to “develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and [that] can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.”</p>



<p>The six primary areas of quantum-safe cryptography are:</p>



 
 Lattice-based cryptography 



 Multivariate cryptography 



 Hash-based cryptography 



 Code-based cryptography 



 Isogeny-based cryptography 



 Symmetric key quantum resistance

<p>Digital wallets have emerged as a preferred payment method in the Middle East and Africa, and customers are willing to leave their wallets at home rather than their phones. Offering digital payment solutions and pursuing a digital transformation is key for banks to stay competitive.</p>
<p>On November 7, 2023, we hosted a <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/593634?utm_source=Entrust&amp;utm_medium=brighttalk&amp;utm_campaign=593634">webinar</a> with Izabela Morriss, Vice President of Global Channel Sales &amp; Tech Partnerships at CR2, and Andy Cease, Director of Product Marketing Financial Issuance at Entrust. During this engaging thought leadership discussion, we gained valuable insights into the payment preferences of cardholders in the Middle East and Africa, as well as the challenges financial institutions face in offering a digital-first customer experience.</p>
<p>Here is what we heard from them:</p>
 
 Adoption of digital payments in the Middle East and Africa 
 
 
<p>Contactless payments are rapidly gaining popularity in the Middle East and Africa. People love the convenience and speed of making payments with contactless cards and digital wallets.</p>
<p>This drive for convenience is advancing the convergence of speed and simplicity, alongside elevated security measures. Contactless payments, appreciated for their convenience and speed, are quickly gaining popularity in the Middle East and Africa. Globally, demand is also increasing, but it’s particularly flourishing in this region.</p>
<p>In a 2022 McKinsey report, 60% of global respondents said they prefer to leverage mobile wallets for their digital payments. With an 80%-90% smartphone penetration, it’s no wonder customers in the Middle East are seeking out seamless digital payment experiences (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-payments-in-the-middle-east">McKinsey, The future of payments in the Middle East, 2022</a>). Offering digital payment options is a way for banks and credit unions to answer this demand, differentiate themselves, and be perceived as modern and innovative leaders. If they don’t, they’ll be left behind and viewed as archaic and out of touch.</p>
<p>With quick and secure transactions, customers can easily pay anytime, anywhere, without the need for cash or physical cards. Digital cards are especially relevant for in-store use, but near field communication (NFC) payment from the banking app is a way of answering the need for instant and contactless digital payments.</p>
<p>Izabela from CR2 explained that they see a strong demand for customer-centric digital payment solutions. In both the Middle East and Africa, customers are showing an increasing interest in different payment solutions. They want innovative options and are looking at what is being proposed outside of the region. Customers are seeking secure, convenient, seamless digital payment experiences that align with their diverse requirements, be it for e-commerce, mobile apps, or in-store transactions. This shift highlights the urgency for banks to evolve and cater to these changing needs.</p>
<p>We see the rise of financial inclusion in Africa, characterized by its young population, is at the forefront of the continent’s mobile money transformation. This rise is underscored by a high penetration of mobile devices. Eighty four percent of internet users in Kenya used their mobile phones for payments, mirroring a similar trend where 60% of internet users in Nigeria and across Africa did the same. In 2021, East Africa reported 296 million registered mobile money accounts (<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27017/mobile-payment-in-africa/">2021 Statista Global Consumer Survey</a>).</p>
<p>These statistics highlight the profound impact mobile payments have on driving financial inclusion, particularly in Africa where there’s a need to reach the unbanked. This trend also presents a significant marketing opportunity for financial institutions. The push toward digital payments in the Middle East and Africa is largely driven by the intent to support financial inclusion. Facilitating banking services through digital channels allows even the unbanked and underserved populations to actively participate in the financial landscape, paving the way for empowered communities and fostering economic growth. In a world where 1.4 billion individuals remain unbanked (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services">World Bank Global Findex 2021 database</a>), the need for a significant shift is necessary.</p>
<p>In Africa, Izabela observes a market dynamic driven by the goal of reaching the unbanked population. There’s a noticeable trend of transitioning directly from mobile phone operator/money transfer services to mobile wallets, bypassing traditional physical payment cards.</p>
<p>The digital-first transformation in the Middle East stems from a demand for convenience, security, and a desire for financial institutions to provide a seamless customer journey. Mobile banking enables them to do that.</p>
 
 
 Why financial institutions want to offer contactless payments and digital card issuance 
 
 
<p>The innovation of tokenization has made digital card issuance possible. Banks want to innovate, keep their customers, and enhance convenience for their customers, ensuring satisfaction at every turn. Security is top of mind for cardholders as well as banks.</p>
<p>Izabela explains that banks in regions such as Ethiopia or Nigeria are particularly sensitive to questions of sustainability. Using tokenization for digital card issuance allows them to reduce their plastic usage, aligning with their sustainability goals.</p>
<p>The economy in Africa is still very cash-driven: 90% of transactions are made with cash (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-payments-in-africa">McKinsey, The future of payments in Africa, 2022</a>). There is a huge opportunity for banks to shift from cash-based transactions and pave the way for digital transactions. Again, this will also allow them to promote financial inclusion and transparency. Many countries have not fully adopted the physical payment card, and they are expected to skip the issuance of physical cards and directly adopt digital cards. Banks must be ready for this change. Izabela expects that digital wallets will dominate the payment landscape within the next two years. Several African central banks, such as those in Rwanda and Nigeria, are driving a vision of a cashless economy.</p>
<p>Differences in demand can be observed across diverse age groups. However, banks recognize that to stay competitive, they must offer very targeted, personalized customer journeys that cater to the varying demands of all demographics. Offering more capabilities within the mobile banking app ensures that it is at the core of the bank-customer relationship.</p>
<p>Banks can expect increased usage of their card portfolio, earlier activations, and broader outreach to diverse demographics, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction. Additionally, cost-saving incentives serve as an important motivator compelling financial institutions to provide digital payment solutions.</p>
<p>Moreover, traditional banks are increasingly feeling the competitive pressure from emerging players like neobanks, which continue to obtain banking licenses, compelling traditional institutions to remain relevant.</p>
 
 
 Challenges for banks to implement this 
 
 
<p>Answering the very diverse demands of cardholders has been made possible by innovations in the payment space during the last few years.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, security is top of mind, both for financial institutions and cardholders. Tokenized cards offer the highest level of security when it comes to payments. Andy from Entrust explained that tokenization enables the consumer to take control again, as the tokens are device-bound or market-bound, offering cardholders a very convenient experience. Tokenization technology, championed by major schemes like Visa and Mastercard, is a necessary prerequisite for the issuance of digital cards. To give a quick explanation: Tokenization substitutes sensitive card data with unique tokens tied to specific devices and use cases. This ensures secure transactions while enabling banks to minimize the risk of fraud. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/tokenization-enabling-the-intersection-of-data-security-and-exceptional-user-experiences/">This article</a> explains the functioning and value of tokenization more in detail.</p>
<p>And of course, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/entrust-digital-card-solution">digital card issuance</a> allows financial institutions to offer a digital-first user and payment experience.</p>
<p>While banks in the Middle East and Africa now want to take active steps toward a digital transformation, they also realize that it is not as simple as it may seem. They want to be innovative, but do not know where to start. Most banks struggle to combine a seamless, digital-first, innovative payment experience with the highest level of security, while keeping integration and maintenance of such a solution lightweight.</p>
<p>Izabela notes that most banks are starting to have a good understanding of tokenization; current operational discussions are around identifying the correct next steps and implementing technology for the benefit of the cardholder. Addressing legacy technology and infrastructure presents a significant challenge for banks. How can they leverage their existing resources to enable a digital wallet effectively? What role does the card management system play? Which tokenization partner should they choose? How can the digital wallet be embedded within the existing banking application?</p>
 
 
 Technology alliance partnership between CR2 and Entrust 
 
 
<p>We know that the digital revolution is here, and that banks need to transform their service model to meet the expectations for convenient banking that offers anywhere, anytime access.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar: Is this the right time to invest in Identity and Access Management? This week Jesse Kurtto from Ubisecure has joined us to answer this question and discuss the current economic situation. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Today’s guest is Jesse Kurtto. Jesse’s career has gradually arched from the Wild West world of finance, to his current position as a Data Protection Officer and Data Scientist at Ubisecure. Learning Program before learning to read Finnish and visiting 25 countries before 25. He is no stranger to exploring unchartered waters and discovering connections that others might miss. Surrounded by a delicate balance of the latest technology and dozens of carefully tended houseplants, his secret hobby is writing to his beloved snail mail friends across the world. Welcome Jesse.</p>
<p>Jesse: Thank you for the invite, Oscar. Nice to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great having you, Jesse, definitely. We’re going to have a super interesting conversation about the market in Digital Identity and Identity and Access Management.</p>
<p>First of all, we always want to hear more about our guests. So please tell us a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Jesse: All right. So, like many or even most of us in the digital identity field, I actually never really actively sought to be a specialist, IAM specialist, on purpose. And my personal background is actually nothing technology even, but in finance and investing more specifically. So, a chance encounter and I liked the people who interviewed me and decided to stay for a while, and that while has been over seven years now. And I’m still learning something new every day, checking out how we really the world of digital identity like and frankly haven’t ever regretted decision. No two days have really been the same and the field continues to evolve and develop quite a bit every year.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent and definitely hearing at Ubisecure, we definitely appreciate having this – well call it, like a blend of knowledge – the financial market, not lesser than what you bring with the security and digital identity knowledge, very practical knowledge you also had. So, it’s always super interesting having those conversation with you.</p>
<p>And for the first time here on the podcast, we are going to have that, a bit more financial touch on that – What is coming, especially in this well this year, and I think also the years to come. The previous year and the year to come I think, we are already end of 2023 in which – well the financial situation is not good we’re going to talk about. But of course, no matter how the economy is, the companies organisation has to protect their services, have to upgrade the services, maintain them, so they have to invest some money in that.</p>
<p>So, from the perspective of companies who today need to upgrade their digital capabilities, what would you say is the piece of the current macroeconomic situation that they should know well? So that was at least what they should know well, from what is happening now?</p>
<p>Jesse: Well, first of all, we all know the macroeconomic situation hasn’t really been dancing on the roses over the past few years. But first, we had a massive shock with the COVID pandemic starting from spring 2020. Then we got massive economic stimulus to recover from that slump. And right after we were starting to climb up, then the war in Ukraine saw that all kinds of new problems everywhere around the world seemed to emerge just within three or four months.</p>
<p>The energy uncertainty in Europe and the economy went down the drain, and macroeconomic in quite a difficult situation here in Europe. But we would actually want to have some kind of stimulus in order to recover. But at the same time, we are suffering from quite persistently high inflation, which makes any kind of stimulus package basically equal to pouring more gasoline to the flames.</p>
<p>So, the European bank is really between a rock and a hard place here. And I can only look over the Atlantic to the States and be very jealous how they are able to both fight inflation and with high interest rates, five and a half percent this talking and meanwhile still have a blisteringly red-hot labour market all but there.</p>
<p>So, my first point would be that not all markets are equal. And the second important point is that now is actually a really great time to invest in any digital capabilities, including digital identities. Because now, we are in the middle of a small recession in Europe and investing in recession has historically been the very best time to invest in growth.</p>
<p>And if we think for a while, it actually makes perfect sense. After all, the alternative is to invest in the middle of a growth season when everybody else wants to invest in growth as well. Pushing prices even higher and reducing the availability of experts to help with these transformation projects. But now it’s still for a while kind of a buyer’s market.</p>
<p>So best time to invest in future growth is now.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, time to invest is now.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay. So, let’s go into what – because there are many things that the company can invest now and many things that many companies might need. But if you were one of the – chief executive, like CISO, or someone who is top decision makers in companies and there has to be some budget for digital identity. Thinking of – first of all broadly. Broadly but in digital identity, what would be the most important products that today would be the top priority for buying now?</p>
<p>Jesse: Today I would say that the absolute top priority would be – to establish really low friction user journeys from the very beginning account registration to the actual purchase, including solid online self-service. And now this low friction user journey is no way exclusive with security or compliance, but it is actually reaping the benefits of digitalisation. Digitalisation is ongoing, it’s accelerating, it’s unstoppable.</p>
<p>So, the question is for every organisation – should they try to fight this change to the last or embrace it and be among the first to actually reap its benefits. It’s actually interesting because my background in finance, the many finance sector operators were among the first to embrace digital identities, but they kind of stopped it halfway there; “Okay, we can build self-service portals for our users, but for many, many procedures we still require hand signed paper documents being sent via physical mail.” And this is really only reaping a very small part of the benefits of digitalisation. So, there is plenty to go.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Interesting what you say in finance services. That’s correct. For reasons of security had to be always in the latest of technology for security. But some of the process has been, as you say, very old fashioned like the old school, many paper fax I think still use or cheques. So, these kind of.</p>
<p>Jesse: Oh yes, those ones to.</p>
<p>Oscar: Still alive.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And it truly hurts the user experience a lot. It even causes direct missed opportunities. Let’s say new bond is coming to a market and you wish to buy a piece of it and participate. But if it takes three or four days just to do all the paperwork, then the opportunity has simply passed.</p>
<p>Oscar: And indeed, the price changed completely. Okay, so you say that the top is to – the user journey has to be digitalised. So, what is the category of products that address that?</p>
<p>Jesse: Would say a real CIAM system would be the one to go here, and not try to build the user journey from, let’s say 4 to 6-point solutions and then somehow glue them together. I think the best solution would be an IAM solution that’s designed for a whole user journey from the scratch and not something homemade or batched together.</p>
<p>Because when business grows, as it will eventually grow, no recession will last forever. And to user numbers pick up and suddenly there’s a nightmare of issues of having 4 to 6 different vendors and trying to keep their products up and running with ever increasing user numbers. And that again, is doing digitalisation the wrong way, if I may say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. CIAM being – so how, well the evolution of the more broadly speaking, Identity and Access Management. Maybe you can give us an overview of that evolution of the Identity and Access Management, what – how we started and what we have today.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, that’s a very interesting topic. Through the IAM are from big enterprise internal needs at once to employee numbers just grow to a certain level, they can’t be managed with excel sheets or pen and paper before that. But these kind of internal IAM solutions scale and fit really badly for end customer facing journeys. Internal users can always be taught how to use some kind of system, even if it’s not immediately logical or it feels unwieldy.</p>
<p>But for the customers, it’s not realistic to expect that they would spend tens of minutes or even hours to learn how to use some kind of system to log in. And no, they would simply instead put down their laptops, pick up the phone and call your customer service. So, it will actually just cost you more money to have this kind of system.</p>
<p>And now, in the past ten years, there have been massive uptake of different CIAM systems. And lately, let’s say after the pandemic, it’s interesting to see that now the full circle is coming back towards internal users with remote working. Remote working, different kind of partnerships, there are more kind of internal and kind of external users than ever, and trying to keep these as fully separate groups is very challenging.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. So, what about the investment of a company in Identity and Access Management? So what does that imply if the company does not have even, let’s say, a first personal CIAM or open source, something that they started, if they if the company really doesn’t, which actually to me surprise me that, you discover companies don’t have it, don’t have it, almost anything like identity access management and they are looking for some solutions or they are or they know that they need it. Maybe the decision has not come.</p>
<p>So why would you say is important for the buyers to know about the product, the Identity and Access Management product?</p>
<p>Jesse: That’s an interesting detail what you said that there’s still about 20-25% of companies in Europe that do not have any kind of Identity and Access Management system in place. So, one could argue that every IAM’s companies’ worst competitor is doing nothing. But to the question at hand, I’d say scalability is one very important thing, and compliance. If one doesn’t have any kind of identity management system in place, then it’s extremely hard to tell where and by who are the user identities actually stored.</p>
<p>And of course, that is a massive no in the eyes of the GDPR and this kind of adventures just don’t usually end up well. So first job would be to map out how many identities there are in the first place, how it has evolved over the recent quarters and where they are located, how many systems actually are connected, including partners, including systems like let’s say payroll providers, insurance providers, and usually the number is quite surprising. It can often be more than ten individual systems.</p>
<p>And now managing all these identities from a single centralised place is frankly a godsend compared to trying to manage this and plus sprawling network identity some here, some there. And of course, it also brings centralised identity management, also brings massive security benefits. For example, if you wish to revoke the access for, let’s say some external consultants that have already finished their projects, you only have one place to do it or you can even automate it.</p>
<p>But if the identities are in ten systems, 15 systems, then it’s really easy to forget just one. And who knows, maybe five, ten years later, one of those passwords will get breached and now the attacker gets to your system for free.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, what is normally called silos, identity silos. Having so many data repositories and it’s -through the years it’s easy to forget at least couple of those are forgotten but they are still there somewhere in there in some machine, in some server. So, the data is there.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And of course, I’ve heard many times the counterargument that it’s not wise to put all eggs in one basket, but when it comes to information security, we as the defenders must secure every single system that we use. But the attacker only needs to find one weak system to exploit.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, exactly. They can just find the forgotten one, the one that nobody remembers that.</p>
<p>So, what the company – the buyers should ask for a technology vendor? So, for a CIAM vendor? So, what are the most important things that’s should be – has to be asked to the vendors?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would ask them to demonstrate the self-service capabilities first. What exactly the users can and cannot accept less without external help? Meaning customer service assistance. Because that sets quite stringent limits on the benefits of digitalisation. And of course, all the usual user journeys should be handled by the system automatically. So, I would guess that any IAM project touches deeply.</p>
<p>So, I would first describe the challenges we are facing. And then I’d ask vendor to explain, just in plain English, that – how does the solution work and how does it actually solve the challenge that we just presented? And after all, one should never invest in anything that one doesn’t understand.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to address early in any IAM project is to what is actually included in the price and what isn’t. In order to actually accurately measure the TCO and how it would evolve as internal and external user base grows. And for example, there are many vendors out that charge ten to even hundred times for internal users compared to external users, and that’s not usually put on a large print on the front page.</p>
<p>And finally, I would discuss any coming changes in legislation because I would be very interested to know whether any changes will be covered under the current proposal or will it occur additional project and additional costs in the future. Change is, after all, inevitable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think that’s very important. We know in – in the European Union it’s coming the digital wallet that’s going to come in. Well, how many years do you predict at this moment?</p>
<p>Jesse: I’m optimistic and say late ‘24 launch for some countries. ‘25 mass adoption and hopefully organisational identities soon after.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and that’s something that I think very few people would argue that that will be – that will not have some considerable success because there’s a lot of time invested in people preparing all these new standards in this part of the evolution. What we have been seeing before with Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), the wallet itself is something that is already becoming very popular in the commercial side. So that will come in.</p>
<p>Similarly, in other geographies, there will be similar initiatives, there will be new regulations. So that, through all this, the vendor has to offer that, has to tell whether we offer or not. So that’s definitely a good, good aspect you mentioned.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And the commission has made clear goals here to avoid repeating the mistakes of the eIDAS 1.0, that was supposed to bring cross-border digital identities to Europe. Well, we all know that it was a commercial failure, but they have really learned from that, and I have great hopes for the EUDI. Both for personal identities and for organisational identities, and especially for the latter one.</p>
<p>I believe that the market is currently suffering from a kind of chicken and egg problem here, that everybody’s waiting for cross-border organisational identities and not building services because they aren’t here yet. So, we might see the floodgates open in the late 2020s.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. I also believe that as a lot will change in more or less like the, as you say in the next 12-24 months is going to change a lot, in a good way I believe. So definitely exciting to be at this moment. We’ve been talking a lot about Identity and Access Management, other aspects, other type of technology that are also in the minds of the executives who are going to upgrade their technologies. We hear a lot about passwords in the last year. Well, ‘cryptocurrencies’ is getting a bit more quiet. Today we hear a lot about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Would you recognise some technology that is actually underrated, that not many people are talking about? But these business buyers should be aware, because the impact will be even bigger than those buzzwords. So, what would you say?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would say that the coming EUDI and its principle of Self-Sovereign Identities is something that might cause quite big ripples in the identity landscape. The very basic idea that it’s the end user themselves who collect attributes and control to whom and when they release those attributes. That that is very different from the usual data repository centric view that – okay, we have this database, and we control everything here. Everything is set in stone.</p>
<p>But when the end users actually decide which attributes to release and which not. Then one can’t take for granted that, “Okay, we always have every single field in our database field. Every user record looks similar in a structural level.” That is no longer true and that might cause some changes.</p>
<p>As for technology, I have great hopes for machine learning and especially how it can help accomplish not zero trust, no. But zero friction user journeys. And I don’t mean a strong AI that is still decades into future, if ever. But simple things like; is the user using a different device to log in or the same device as before? And so on.</p>
<p>For example, I have a recently having a quick holiday in the US, and I was frankly quite shocked when I logged into some financial services – using a completely different device that I had never used, on completely opposite time of the day. I was even physically located on a different continent. And no MFA prompts, nothing. Just inputting my password, I was in.</p>
<p>And that’s a lot of missed risk management there, for both parties. For me as an end user and for the financial service provider. And I believe this is something that will change sooner or later. And of course, I would like, as an end user, for this to work for the opposite way as well. That if I’m logging in using the same device, about the same time of the day, from same city that I’ve done it for hundreds and hundreds of times – then perhaps I could be spared the MFA fatigue and just get in with my password managers embraced password.</p>
<p>Oscar: The technology doesn’t bother you when you are in the habitual way of interacting with, let’s say, the banks.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, exactly. It should take always the context of the transaction into account. And frankly, what I would like to see many companies to do is; do a more thorough risk analysis at what they are actually trying to defend against. I can give a real-world example.</p>
<p>About a month ago, I drove to a gas station, put my car to charge, decided that I’ll have a coffee there. Opened the app and saw, hey, there’s an offer for a coffee and a doughnut €1 off. Great.</p>
<p>Okay, it seems that first, I needed to update the app to actually buy. Okay, well, I’ll do it.</p>
<p>Then they wanted to add the credit card directly to the app, alright. Got an MFA from that.</p>
<p>Then when I actually wanted to make the purchase, I got yet another prompt and confirmation, this time from my bank. That – ‘Hey, in order to buy this €3.50 product, would you please update our app again, and use it as an MFA to confirm this purchase’. For the third time.</p>
<p>And by that time, I already got notification that, ‘hey, your car has charged’, and my coffee was called by then and left it there.</p>
<p>So that was the opposite of Zero Friction. That was more of a zero trust like game. But the security solution that’s very fitting for, let’s say, authorising nuclear missile launch, is very different than the security that’s needed to confirm a €3 coffee purchased at the gas station.</p>
<p>And as discussed earlier, I believe this problem stems – that solution was built from very small parts and every individual vendor only looked after their own interest, only want to save their back in case of any kind of misuse. But nobody took a step backwards to actually see; What we are trying to defend against here? What is the attack vector here? That okay, somebody misuses this app and clones this coupon and gets two coffees and doughnuts for a €3 each. Okay, so how much is an attacker willing to put time and money into such attack? I guess nobody stop to think about it. And as a result, the whole user journey was just failure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, complete failure indeed. Very good way to bring back the very first thing you said, User Journey. Yeah, that’s a specific example how things can happen. Sounds like a marvellous opportunity, not to get a deal nice and then becomes complete failure.</p>
<p>Jesse, one final question I would like to ask you is – for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would dream that every executive would dedicate one day, one whole day to actually be an end user for a day and go through their company’s entire flow. All the way from account registration to actually purchasing to product or service that they’re selling. And if there’s time trying out things like forgotten password resets. And then the next day repeating the same procedure for the top competitor and even more importantly, their newest competitor, because that is where the threat of digitalisation is coming.</p>
<p>Oscar: Going to be very revealing.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes, and it’s important to go through the entire journey. If one, simply takes it piecemeal. And of course, every piece may look perfectly fine. Okay, this works like this. It has confirmations like this. Great. Next piece. Next piece, Next piece. All right. Everything looks fine. But then actually going through the process, one gets hit by four or five different confirmations, forced updates, all kinds of non-user-friendly things, and that won’t fly.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely a very good experiment, actionable idea. Absolutely. Well, thank you very much, Jesse for telling us all this about the – how the companies and why companies should invest in the digital identity and why today.</p>
<p>Let us know why people would like to get in touch with you or follow you or learn more about what we are doing. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Jesse: All right. Thank you. First, I would ask everybody to check out <a href="http://www.ubisecure.com/" title="ubisecure.com">ubisecure.com</a>, and see how we are approaching these problems on the market. And if needed, I would be very happy to have a chat, over a virtual or real coffee, and I can be contacted at <a href="mailto:jesse.kurtto@ubisecure.com">jesse.kurtto@ubisecure.com</a> at anytime.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>With our first speakers release, we are letting loose four tech experts from the finance industry. Despite some of the industry-specific challenges, IAM and cybersecurity professionals from finance can offer valuable insights and lessons learned that can be translated to other sectors seeking to enhance their identity and access management practices.</p>
<p>The relevance of identity management in finance</p>
<p>Identity management is integral to financial services for various reasons. Robust systems enhance security by verifying and authenticating user identities, employing methods like multi-factor authentication and biometrics to prevent unauthorized access and reduce fraud. Compliance with regulatory requirements, such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), is ensured through effective identity management.</p>
<p>Building customer trust is another crucial aspect, because secure identities foster confidence in engaging with digital financial services. Personalized offerings based on accurate customer data, operational efficiency, and streamlined transactions are facilitated by sound identity management practices. In the context of digital transformation, identity management is foundational for seamless and secure digital experiences, including online banking and mobile payments.</p>
<p>Risk management benefits from effective identity verification, helping to identify and mitigate potential risks. Furthermore, in the globalized financial landscape, proper identity management supports cross-border transactions by ensuring compliance with international regulations and standards, fostering trust in transactions across different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In summary, identity management in financial services is not just about verifying who someone is; it's a fundamental aspect of ensuring security, compliance, and efficiency in an increasingly digital and interconnected financial world.</p>

 COVID-19 Test data leak: Strengthening data security with decentralized identity and verifiable digital credentials <p>Without sensationalizing the recent breach that claims to have leaked the data of millions of citizens, this blog delves into what a perfect future can safeguard from such breaches.</p><p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, concerns over data breaches and identity theft have reached alarming levels, exemplified by the recently claimed leak of COVID-19 test information of approximately 81.5 crore Indian citizens online. This incident underscores the pressing need for robust solutions to safeguard sensitive and personally identifiable information.</p><blockquote>In this blog post, we will explore the technologies currently employed to protect centralized data, the methods hackers use to breach these technologies, and how decentralized identity or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) offer a promising solution to prevent such data breaches.</blockquote><p>The Breach Unveiled:</p><p>The breach, orchestrated by an entity known as ‘pwn001,’ claims to have exposed sensitive data sourced from the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) database. As we get to know from the <a href="https://www.news18.com/india/indias-biggest-data-leak-so-far-covid-19-test-info-of-81-5cr-citizens-with-icmr-up-for-sale-exclusive-8637743.html">News 18 Report</a>, this leaked data included Aadhaar and passport numbers, names, phone numbers, and addresses, highlighting the magnitude of the incident.</p><p>Centralized Data — A Honey&nbsp;Pot?:</p><p>Central agencies such as the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) employ several cutting-edge technologies to protect citizen data. Encryption, multi-factor authentication, access control, and regular security assessments are among the strategies in place. However, all this data is centrally stored. Despite these measures, hackers continue to find ways to breach these defenses, particularly in safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII). Cybercriminals, armed with social engineering tactics and insider information, persistently exploit vulnerabilities in existing security systems. These challenges necessitate innovative solutions to ensure comprehensive data protection.</p><p>How Hackers Breach Current Security Measures:</p><p>In the ever-evolving digital landscape, hackers employ a variety of techniques to breach existing security protocols, posing a significant threat to sensitive data like citizen information. One common method involves Exploiting Vulnerabilities, where cybercriminals target weaknesses in software, networks, or user behavior. Systems left unpatched or outdated software become vulnerable entry points, granting unauthorized access to malicious actors. Another prevalent tactic is Social Engineering, which encompasses phishing attacks and manipulative strategies to deceive individuals into revealing confidential information, including login credentials. By exploiting human psychology and trust, hackers sidestep security measures, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data. Moreover, Insider Threats present an internal challenge, as employees or contractors with access to Aadhaar data may misuse their privileges intentionally, leading to detrimental data breaches from within organizational boundaries.</p><p>Safeguarding COVID Vaccination Data: A Decentralized Identity&nbsp;Approach</p><p>The vulnerabilities inherent in centralized databases that house COVID-19 vaccination information have become increasingly evident. To enhance the security of vaccination certificates and mitigate the risks associated with centralized systems, a decentralized identity solution is imperative. Notably, centralized databases like the one employed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) are susceptible to substantial data breaches, putting the privacy of millions at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Proposed Solution:</p><p>Implement a system wherein unique Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are assigned to individuals, securely anchored on a blockchain. Acting as an issuer, pathology entities provide Verifiable Credentials for COVID vaccinations to individual DIDs. These digital Verifiable Credentials are stored in decentralized identity wallets, containing specific vaccination details. Grant individuals control over their Verifiable Credentials, empowering them to selectively share information. Facilitate selective disclosure through Verifiable Presentations, enabling individuals to share pertinent details as required.</p><p>Leverage blockchain technology to anchor DIDs and store decentralized identity transactions, ensuring data immutability. Incorporate zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, allowing for proof of vaccination without unnecessary data exposure. Distribute data across a decentralized network to effectively mitigate the risk of large-scale breaches. This comprehensive approach aims to establish a robust and secure framework for managing COVID-19 vaccination information, safeguarding individual privacy and data integrity.</p><p>The Promise of Decentralized Identity and SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity):</p><p>Addressing these sophisticated threats requires a proactive approach. Since hackers innovate new ways to exploit vulnerabilities, it is the need of the hour for Data Controllers to also explore new ways and innovative solutions to safeguard such&nbsp;data.</p><p>Exploring innovative security solutions, such as Decentralized Identity and <a href="https://ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, becomes crucial. These advanced technologies empower individuals, enhance control over personal data, and significantly mitigate the risks associated with vulnerabilities, social engineering, and insider threats. These technologies present a paradigm shift in the following ways:</p>  User-Centric Security: Decentralized Identity and SSI prioritize user empowerment, allowing individuals to take control of their own digital identities and personally identifiable information (PII). Users can manage their data, granting or revoking access as needed, thus enhancing privacy and consent management.  Immutable Blockchain Technology: Leveraging blockchain, these solutions ensure data integrity and immutability. By recording transactions in a tamper-proof ledger, the authenticity of user identities is preserved, mitigating the risk of unauthorized alterations and ensuring the credibility of stored information.  Eliminating Centralized Vulnerabilities: Unlike conventional systems reliant on centralized databases, Decentralized Identity and SSI distribute identity information across a decentralized network. This decentralization significantly reduces the appeal of data breaches for malicious actors. Hacking into a single centralized repository becomes virtually futile, enhancing overall security for stored personally identifiable information (PII). Further extending to this, Decentralized Identity or SSI uses state-of-the-art cryptography to encrypt the data at rest and data in flight, resulting in a significant reduction in data breaches.  <p>Conclusion:</p><p>The recent data breach incident highlights the urgent need for advanced solutions in safeguarding data privacy. While current technologies offer robust security measures, they are not foolproof. Incorporating <a href="https://ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Decentralized Identity</a> and SSI solutions into existing security frameworks not only fortifies defenses against cyber threats but also ensures that personally identifiable information (PII) remains secure and under the control of its rightful owners. By embracing these transformative technologies, organizations and individuals can navigate the evolving threat landscape with confidence, safeguarding sensitive data and preserving the privacy and trust of all stakeholders involved.</p><p><a href="https://ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> offers user-friendly solutions to safeguard your digital identity and data.

<p>Conducting the best <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-strategy/">customer service strategy</a> today requires organizations to invest in several customer service types. This way, organizations can ensure their customer base receives answers to their problems in the format they prefer.</p>



<p>Customer service is an integral part of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer experience</a>. It has increasingly become an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/omnichannel-customer-service">omnichannel</a> discipline where every customer prefers to communicate on varying channels. Therefore, meeting customer needs requires an organization to enable different ways customers can receive responses to their issues depending on their preferences. Resolving issues for customers on their preferred channel can increase customer satisfaction, customer retention and brand loyalty.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/transforming-customer-service-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-game/"> Read the blog: How generative AI is transforming customer service </a>



 Customer service types that organizations should prioritize 



<p>By offering different types of customer service and several customer support channels, organizations demonstrate they are investing in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-care">customer care</a>. They also demonstrate they understand the importance of customer engagement and will do what it takes to meet customer expectations. Here are some key types of customer service to prioritize:</p>



 Phone support 



<p>Many customers will still want to pick up a phone and talk to a live customer service agent, no matter how many new ways organizations offer. Maintaining a call center or help desk of customer service representatives who await phone calls can be expensive. But ultimately providing a human touch to those callers who want it is important to provide a great customer service experience.</p>



<p>Organizations are increasingly looking to augment those customer service reps with technology to increase efficiency and reduce costs. One such way is by using Interactive Voice Response (IVR), which utilizes pre-recorded messages and text-to-speech solutions. Used at the beginning of calls, IVR can better route requests, reduce response times and potentially solve issues before requiring a support agent.</p>



 Chatbots 



<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">Chatbots</a> are computer programs where users are asked to either choose from a list of pre-selected questions or type into an open field the question they’re trying to answer. From there, the chatbot uses automation to scan the database of responses and provide the most relevant response. In most scenarios, chatbots offer the option of live chat support with the customer service team if the chatbot responses fail to answer the customer’s question.</p>



<p>With advances in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-future/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> such as <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a>, chatbots can answer more questions more accurately. As such, chatbots are becoming an increasingly important customer service channel for both organizations and customers. Customers like them because they can provide more answers than a human agent and organizations like them because it can decrease staffing costs and reduce errors.</p>



 Email support 



<p>Many customers prefer to address their needs asynchronously by sending an email and awaiting a response. They can send an email to a general support email address where it can be routed to the most appropriate member of the customer support team.</p>



 Frequently asked questions 



<p>Also known as FAQs, many organizations use the same template for these simply written questions and answers. Often featured on an organization’s website, they usually list the questions in a row and allow the user to click on the one that addresses their issue, which will then show the detailed answer below.</p>



 Knowledge base 



<p>Organizations have increasingly invested resources in databases where users can search for articles and forum posts. This form of self-service customer support is increasingly popular for people who prefer being proactive and solving the issue themselves without needing to talk to a human representative or wait for an email response.</p>



<p>Organizations like knowledge bases because they minimize the use of employees, making it a cost-effective way to solve customer problems. It is especially valuable for complex issues that may have multiple causes, which the customers can investigate by reading multiple articles.</p>



 Social media support 



<p>The rise of company profiles on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and others created the need for social media customer service. Customers now either reply to brand posts on these channels or post directly to their followers. This requires organizations to monitor their channels and use tools that create notifications every time their brand is mentioned. </p>



<p>Unlike other communication channels, social media posts are broadcast to the public. That can turn an individual issue into a much larger corporate reputation issue if not immediately addressed. For example, a customer could post on social media that a product is faulty and is at risk of injuring its users. That could lead to many potential customers failing to purchase the product out of fear of the same issue happening to them.</p>



 Technical support and troubleshooting 



<p>Customers who know their specific issues can reach out to the organization for specific help. There, a member of an IT or DevOps team can walk through the problem with an individual and provide real-time instructions for them to fix the problem themselves. When the issue affects a product connected to the internet like a computer, sometimes the tech support staff can remotely take control of the product and try to fix the problem that way. If both approaches fail, the customer may need to send in the product or visit a repair center for a representative to resolve the issue in person.</p>



 Customer service continues to be a technology-driven field 



<p>Providing excellent customer service drives increased customer loyalty and therefore has increasingly become a major competitive advantage for organizations that get it right. Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-the-connected-customer/">poor customer service</a> is the top reason consumers stop purchasing from a company.<br><br>While customer service remains a human agent-intense process, <a href="https://admin01.prod.blogs.cis.ibm.net/blog/customer-service-future/">advances in technology like AI</a> will continue to supplement those workers and begin to provide a much better autonomous response to customer queries.</p>



<p>Customer service has become the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/customer-service">CEO’s number one priority for generative AI investment</a> with the promise of helping organizations meet the dual challenges of rising customer demands and operational costs.<br>&nbsp;<br>IBM has been helping enterprises apply trusted AI in this space for more than a decade. And now generative AI has further potential to significantly transform customer and field service with the ability to understand complex inquiries and generate more human-like, conversational responses. IBM Consulting offers end-to-end consulting capabilities in experience design and service, data and AI transformation. Using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx™</a>, IBM’s enterprise-ready AI and data platform, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant">watsonx™ Assistant</a>, IBM’s market-leading conversational AI solution, we partner with you through the AI value creation process to enhance conversational AI, improve the agent experience and optimize call center operations and data.</p>

<p>Sacramento – The State of California Department of Motor Vehicles Open Source Mobile Wallet for Decentralized Digital Credentials <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">has been awarded</a> by Gartner for the Eye on Innovation Awards in Government in the category of provisional, state, or regional for 2023. Gartner is an American technological research and consulting firm that conducts research on technology.</p><p>Wayne Chang, Co-Founder and CEO of SpruceID, said: “We are thrilled that California’s mDL pilot was recognized by the reputable Gartner, Inc. for the 2023 Innovation Award. Working closely with the state DMV, we brought Californians a reliable digital credential that is privacy-first and open source to maintain the utmost reliability and interoperability. California is leading the way in delivering high-quality digital services to its constituents; we commend the state for taking this approach, and we appreciate their partnership.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Assemblymember Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles), said: “I am thrilled to see the California DMV’s mDL pilot receive Gartner’s award for public sector innovation. Since fighting for digital driver’s licenses back in 2021 with AB 1503, I have been proud to see the program come to life so that any Californian can store their driver’s license on their phone. Congratulations to the DMV and their technology partner SpruceID.”</p><p>SpruceID has been working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to bring mobile driver's licenses to residents of California. Earlier this fall, the State of California expanded the initial pilot program to allow California residents <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">to download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone through the California DMV Wallet mobile app (compatible with iOS and Android devices).</p><p>The mobile driver’s license is powered by SpruceID’s SpruceKit components and Credible product. SpruceKit is an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity that enables secure wallet construction, and Credible provides entire credential life cycle management–from issuance and presentations to updates and revocation. Both are modular solutions that are made to integrate into existing high-assurance environments with security and privacy at the core.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">privacy-first mobile driver's license</a> can be used at participating TSA airport security checkpoints and select retail locations. In the future, the mobile driver’s license can help residents prove their identity online, operate motor vehicles, access health care, secure financial assistance, and verify their age–both in-person and online–while selectively disclosing only the necessary information. <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">Learn more</a>.</p><p><br>NOTE: GovTech to Host Live Webinar this Wednesday, 12/13 on “Getting Started with Digital Identity” Featuring Ajay Gupta, the Chief Digital Transformation Officer for the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">State of California DMV</a>,&nbsp; and Wayne Chang, <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceID</a> CEO.

				  Governing generates an enormous amount of paperwork, so much so, the US employs an <a href="https://www.zippia.com/auditor-jobs/demographics/">estimated 228,000 auditors</a> to keep track of it. Here, we look at how governments can save millions on issuing documents, licenses and permits, while providing a much better experience for citizens.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>A key function of government is issuing permission, either so that citizens are allowed to do certain things — to build, drive, hunt, run a business, travel, or vote — or perform certain jobs according to certain standards, such as food handling. Governments issue a lot of these documents; for example, the US government issued <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/about-us/reports-and-statistics.html">24 million passports</a> in 2023, each of which&nbsp; took an average processing time of seven-to-ten weeks, and cost the person applying $130 dollars.</p>
<p>By issuing these same documents as verifiable digital credentials, governments can not only reduce the cost of creating the passport, and eliminate shipping costs and the waiting time for shipping, it can also simplify the process of renewing and replacing these documents.</p>
<p>The scale of cost reduction rapidly escalates as we move into state-level documents. In the US, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191653/number-of-licensed-drivers-in-the-us-since-1988/#:~:text=Number%20of%20licensed%20drivers%20-%20United%20States%201990-2021&amp;text=Around%20233%20million%20people%20held,female%20licensees%20than%20male%20drivers">223 million people</a> held valid driver’s licenses in 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253615/number-of-hunting-licenses-and-permits-in-the-us/#:~:text=Hunting%20is%20generally%20regulated%20on,amounted%20to%20almost%2039%20million">38.7 million hunting licenses</a> were issued in 2023, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/687993/fishing-license-holders-by-us-state/">over 126 million fishing licenses</a> were issued in California alone in 2023. Each of these documents takes seven-to-ten days to process and ship. Even if the only thing verifiable credentials eliminated was the <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/prices.htm">66-cent cost of mailing the document</a>, they could have saved the government $147 million on driver’s licenses, $25 million on hunting licenses, and California $83 million on fishing licenses. And people would have received their verifiable credential versions instantly.</p>
<p>But verifiable digital credentials offer more benefits than saving on shipping while arriving faster. They can also save time and therefore money when it comes time to audit the holders of these credentials. For example, you need <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/restaurant-licenses-and-permits/">up to 16 permits and licenses to open a restaurant</a>, each of which can be misplaced or lost. Because verifiable credentials are stored securely on a mobile device, they are easy to keep track of and share when they need to be checked. Mobile verification software makes inspection easy, and the tamper-proof way data is stored means that everyone can be sure key documents haven’t been altered or faked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn’t just government inspectors who benefit from this feature. Anyone can easily verify the authenticity and data of someone else’s official documents. This eliminates what is now time-consuming and challenging research and sometimes a fee. For example, it costs <a href="https://washington.licenselookup.org/medical/">$50 and takes five-to-seven business days</a> to verify a Washington state medical license, while verifying a law license requires <a href="https://www.lawyerlegion.com/promote-your-law-practice/directories-by-state-bar#:~:text=Lawyer%20Licensing%20-%20American%20Bar%20Association,practice%20in%20a%20particular%20state">combing the state bar directory yourself.</a></p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase   Sign-In with Ethereum <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  Last month, Discourse bumped the version of FFI, which we had to match in our plugin (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth/pull/25?ref=blog.spruceid.com">discourse-siwe-auth#25</a>)   TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims to describe the structure and semantics of the defined schema comprehensibly. It lies at the intersection between&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a>&nbsp;and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as&nbsp;<a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  A <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2?ref=blog.spruceid.com">new version of TreeLDR</a> is in the making. Last month, we worked on the following components of TreeLDR to make improvements:  We've refined and formalized the definition of <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/blob/v0.2/layouts/README.md?ref=blog.spruceid.com">TreeLDR's layouts</a>, simplifying their definition and how developers can interact with them.  We are working on the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2/layouts/book?ref=blog.spruceid.com">layout book</a>, containing an overview and formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts.  We've extracted the RDF handling part of TreeLDR's layout compiler into a separate project, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/inferdf-rs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">InfeRDF</a>. This "RDF engine" is dedicated to the inference and interpretation of RDF datasets so TreeLDR can fully focus on its main feature: the layouts.    <p>This update introduces a lot of breaking changes for the better. We are still working on reintroducing previous TreeLDR features: the DSL and generators. The Rust code generator will be the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/162?ref=blog.spruceid.com">first reintroduced</a>.</p> DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms, including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  Support deserialization of single termsOfUse in Verifiable Credentials which is allowed by the specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/538?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#538</a>)   <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

The best of both worlds: digital and cryptographically verified — or analog, if that’s your&nbsp;fancy.<p>Global supply chains span millions of different interacting parties. This challenges the adoption of digitization; the industry is largely held back by lowest common denominators. Conscious tooling will allow digital front runners to maintain an advantage without disrupting their&nbsp;network.</p><p>Transmute is happy to announce a new platform feature, enabling users to “switch” between analog and digital interfaces. Transmute’s Verifiable Data Platform is now primed to bridge the gap between links of varying digital maturity along the supply&nbsp;chain.</p> Transitional Digitization <p>It is remarkable how much paper is passed around supply chains. Very often, emailing a PDF is considered “digital”, despite still depending on human consumption. The standard has arrived to change this: the globally recognized W3C internet standard for Verifiable Credentials enables a scalable approach to digitally signed, structured data.</p><p>Our <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/">Verifiable Data Platform</a> is laser-focused on this mission, enabling actors to digitize their processes and establish cryptography-based trust networks.</p><p>But the world will not suddenly flip a switch and go digital overnight. Differences in legislative environments, infrastructure and general digital maturity will make the transition period a long one — years, if not decades. This is the basis of our new platform feature: enabling modern digitization technologies to spread gradually. You can digitize; your network can follow when they are&nbsp;ready.</p> “Going Analog” Switching from digital to analog and back along the supply&nbsp;chain.<p>The diagram above illustrates a simple example of bridging a non-digital link of the supply&nbsp;chain:</p>  A Manufacturer digitally issues a trade document as a Verifiable Credential.  Down the chain, the origin country customs authority only allows for paper filings. So the VC is converted into a PDF, printed and filed manually.  The analog document continues downstream the supply chain to the Trade Finance bank. Digitally savvy, the bank scans the QR code, cryptographically verifies the data and injects the structured data into its operational systems.  For the remainder of the supply chain, the document is exchanged digitally, cryptographically tracing back to the issuing Manufacturer.  <p>This approach was introduced in the UN/CEFACT <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/WhitePaper_VerifiableCredentials-CrossBorderTrade_September2022.pdf">Verifiable Credentials for Cross Border Trade</a> White&nbsp;Paper:</p><blockquote>In a VC based solution to digitising origin claims, certificates and declarations would be issued as VCs but the digital version would also be accessible via a QR on the paper / PDF version so that the same certificate can support different verifier technical maturity. Some verifiers may simply scan the QR with their phone. Others may integrate with their systems and consume the full certificate data.</blockquote><p>The security principle here is that the QR encodes a capability URL: anyone holding the PDF or paper version is also granted access to the Verifiable Credential. A data sharing model well suited to supply chain use&nbsp;cases.</p> Verifiable Trade Documents <p>Below is an example of such an “analog”, printable trade document. You can access it digitally <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:818b95fa-85ef-455d-a8ba-35f8a9697850">here</a> — or go ahead and scan the QR code to verify its&nbsp;data!</p>Commercial Invoice PDF generated from a Verifiable Credential on the Transmute Verifiable Data Platform. Scanning the QR code links back to the digital, verifiable twin.<p>We are very proud at Transmute to take an active role in the practical transition towards scalable, verifiable supply chain digitization!</p><p>Are you ready to digitize, and still respect the pace of your business partners?

Key findings, indicators, and leading metrics are presented below in corresponding order to the <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/15">data challenge</a> hosted November — December&nbsp;2023.</p> Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis&nbsp;(EDA)  MEV <p>Over 25,000 MEV-related transactions have been executed through Curve. This is better said as game players game the game. Curve MEV basic statistics present an alternative indicator of on-chain movement and behavioral finance. This only accounts for transactions made on blockchain, and is a principal in decentralized finance to consider before further&nbsp;signs.</p><a href="https://dune.com/encrypted_soul/mev-activity-on-curve">Link to dashboard</a><p>A key question presented in exploratory data analysis was to find significant changes in trading volume and identify potential causation.</p><p>The analysis in a basket of reports revealed the same three dates with the most significant changes in trading volume on Curve&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>These dates and their corresponding trading volumes are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>• February 14, 2021: A trading volume of approximately 1.2935 ×&nbsp;1019</p><p>• August 14, 2020: A trading volume of approximately 1.116318 ×&nbsp;1019</p><p>• September 11, 2021: A trading volume of approximately 1.02 ×&nbsp;1019</p><p>These dates are significant as they represent the highest spikes in trading activity, indicating either increased user engagement or specific market events that drove&nbsp;many</p><p>transactions. Further investigation into these dates may provide insights into external factors or internal protocol changes influencing trading behavior on the Curve Finance platform.</p> Post/pre veCRV <p>veCRV (vote-escrowed CRV token) in 2020 brought voting power and enhanced community participation to its ecosystem. Quantitatively, it reduced token circulation by locking CRV into veCRV. Effectively reducing circulating supply drives the long-term alignment of CRV holders and the success + longevity of the protocol.</p><p>The plots below show the daily transaction count and volume around the veCRV launch date, highlighted by the red dashed&nbsp;line.</p> Protocol Averages <p>How did veCRV impact daily transactions and gas prices? The most straight-forward answer, plus statistical proof are shown in this&nbsp;snippet:</p> Trading Moving&nbsp;Averages <p>The 30-day moving average shows a smoothing of the daily fluctuations and indicates a sustained increase in veCRV token holders = There’s a steady increase in the amount of CRV being locked up, showing a growing interest in boosted yields incentive to the veCRV holders and also potentially participating in the governance of the protocol through&nbsp;veCRV.</p> Peak Trading&nbsp;Hours <p>The provided data on hourly trading volume demonstrates a distinct pattern of daily fluctuations. Trading activity exhibits a clear upward trend from the early morning hours, reaching its peak between 14:00 and 17:00 GMT. This period, encompassing the European and American afternoon hours, coincides with the overlap of major trading markets and heightened market activity. The peak trading hours, defined as the periods with the highest trading volume,&nbsp;are:</p><p>● 14:00 GMT to 15:00&nbsp;GMT</p><p>● 16:00 GMT to 17:00&nbsp;GMT</p><p>During these peak hours, trading volume consistently exceeds USD 160 billion, indicating a surge in market activity and investor participation.</p> Project Marinara — DeFi at&nbsp;work <p>A bonus question here entertained a thesis made this year for The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Project Mariana using Curve Finance Technology.</p><p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), often referred to as the “central bank of central banks,” is an international organization that fosters cooperation among central banks and other financial institutions. Established in 1930, the BIS plays a crucial role in promoting financial stability and facilitating international monetary cooperation. So why do they want to use Curve AMM and liquidity dynamic structure?</p><a href="https://www.texasblockchain.org/blog/curve-finance-the-future-for-exchanging-wealth">Image source</a><p>The integration of Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, as exemplified by Project Mariana’s innovative use of Curve Finance algorithms, marks a paradigm shift in the landscape of cross-border financial transactions. The application of AMM mitigates long-standing financial risks by ensuring immediate execution and settlement of trades, effectively minimizing credit and settlement risks. This rapid, real-time settlement model reinforces financial trust and stability, revolutionizing how central banks exchange and manage digital currencies.</p><p>Key benefits from the responses post-experiment include:</p><p>• BIS aims to improve the efficiency and transparency of foreign exchange trading and settlement using&nbsp;AMMs.</p><p>• The use of Curve’s unique bonding curve in Project Mariana to minimize slippage in large transactions.</p><p>• The experiment with wCBDC-based foreign exchange trading and the development of bridges for asset transfers between different wCBDC&nbsp;systems.</p><p>• The use of a modified ERC-20 token standard for issuing wCBDCs, emphasizing interoperability between different central banks’&nbsp;systems.</p><p>An example model made by a data challenge participants offers a fair ground for how to exchange architecture can&nbsp;occur:</p><p>This offers some Potential Benefits…</p><p>Efficiency: Integration can lead to faster and more cost-effective cross-border CBDC transactions.</p><p>Liquidity: Enhanced liquidity in CBDC pairs can mitigate price volatility and improve overall market stability.</p><p>Innovation: Incorporating DeFi technology fosters innovation in the central banking&nbsp;sector.</p><p>And a multitude of Macro Challenges…</p><p>Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring compliance with existing financial regulations and adapting them to the open source “decentralized” nature of DeFi is a significant challenge.</p><p>User Education: Users, including central banks, may need education on the intricacies of decentralized technologies and how to navigate them securely.</p> Summary <p>The Curve Finance Data Challenge report offered in-depth analyses from 34 participants on the decentralized finance protocol. It includes exploratory data analysis, the impact of veCRV on governance, analysis of unusual activities, trading strategies, and the relationship between trading volume and liquidity. The report also examined BIS use cases, and the application of predictive analytics through machine learning, highlighting the intersection of data science and finance. Key findings include insights on MEV transactions, significant changes in trading volumes, the influence of veCRV on transactions and gas prices, and trends in peak trading hours. The report also explores Project Mariana’s use of Curve Finance technology, underscoring potential benefits and challenges in integrating DeFi with traditional financial systems.</p><p>What Protocol would you like to see dove into next?

 How IDnow’s latest collaborative research project, MAMMOth, is making the connected world a safer and fairer place for everyone. 



 



<p>While the ability of AI to optimize efficiencies and improve processes is well documented, there are also genuine concerns regarding its susceptibility to human bias and how unfair data processing can lead to the perpetuation of discriminatory practices and social inequality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow leverages AI in its proprietary algorithms to automate three critical tasks:</p>



<p>1. Capturing and parsing identity documents.</p>



<p>2. Ensuring document compliance and authenticity.</p>



<p>3. Verifying the document holder’s identity, including a facial verification step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research conducted by IDnow has revealed demographic biases in facial verification algorithms, primarily linked to underrepresentation of certain ethnic groups several population groups. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Although a manual analysis performed after an automated check can rectify erroneous verdicts, addressing bias in AI-powered services is a priority for IDnow as we want to ensure our clients and their customers have access to reliable and fair tools,” said </p>



<p>While the ability of AI to optimize efficiencies and improve processes is well documented, there are also genuine concerns regarding its susceptibility to human bias and how unfair data processing can lead to the perpetuation of discriminatory practices and social inequality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow leverages AI in its proprietary algorithms to automate three critical tasks: 1) capturing and parsing identity documents, 2) ensuring document compliance and authenticity, and 3) verifying the document holder’s identity, including a face verification step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research conducted by IDnow has revealed demographic biases in facial verification algorithms, primarily linked to underrepresentation of certain ethnic groups several population groups. &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Although a manual analysis performed after an automated check can rectify erroneous verdicts, addressing bias in AI-powered services is a priority for IDnow as we want to ensure our clients and their customers have access to reliable and fair tools.</p>Lara Younes, Engineering Team Lead at&nbsp;IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>In a bid to break down the barriers of bias, IDnow has been collaborating with 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, as part of the MAMMOth project, for about a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency, the goal of the three-year long project is to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so that they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three use cases have been identified:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Assessment of loan applications.&nbsp;  



  Academic evaluation and visibility of academic work. In the academic world, the reputation of a researcher is often tied to the visibility of their scientific papers, and how much they are cited. Studies have shown that on certain search engines, women and authors coming from less prestigious countries/universities tend to be less represented.&nbsp;  



  Face verification applied to identity verification.&nbsp;  



<p>IDnow will predominantly be&nbsp;focusing on the face verification use case, with the aim of implementing methods to mitigate the biases found in algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



 Hearing the voice of the under-represented.&nbsp; 



<p>In an effort to provide a tool that meets the needs of those affected by bias, the project has the support of social science researchers at UNIBO, and three associations working to promote the voice of under-represented groups: <a href="https://www.iasismed.eu/">IASIS</a>, <a href="https://donaactiva.org/">DAF</a>, and <a href="https://www.diversitygroup.lt/en/">DDG</a>. Their involvement in MAMMOth enables IDnow to understand the needs and expectations of under-represented groups. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a series of questionnaires and workshops, the above partners have collected input from underrepresented groups, especially women and ethnic minorities. Gathered information has revealed apprehensions about being discriminated against by identity verification algorithms, emphasizing the necessity of ensuring algorithm reliability before use. These groups also advocated for human oversight of algorithm decisions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Other concerns included possible data leakage, highlighting the need to address privacy-and-security-related issues when systems are developed. It’s also worth noting that some participants highlighted that human input could also be biased and that responsible AI use could reduce this risk.&nbsp;</p>



 AI for a responsible future.&nbsp; 



<p>At IDnow, we believe the importance of innovation lies in finding solutions to problems that do not yet exist but are sure to impact the future. That is why we have invested heavily in research and AI technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are proud to be a part of such an important collaborative research project. These studies underscore the need for trustworthy, unbiased facial verification algorithms. This is the challenge that IDnow and MAMMOth partners aim to overcome during the remaining two years of the project,” said Lara.&nbsp;</p>

 The next generation wants control over their data for a more transparent lending experience 



<p>Having grown up with the internet, smart phones, and social media, young Millennials and Gen-Z borrowers are particularly savvy about using their digital footprints for their own benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They embrace technology to streamline everyday tasks and they want to make informed decisions about transactions. As they increase their presence in the workforce, they are becoming the generations poised to drive the future of lending. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences, young people’s voices came through: They want a more transparent, simpler, digitally-enabled lending process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And open banking can make this a reality. Using secure APIs, advanced data analytics, and machine learning, open banking technology allows consumers to safely share their financial data, giving a more up-to-date and holistic view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit.</p>







<p>Most borrowers are already on board. According to our survey, 77% of those ages 45 to 60 and 68% of those over 60 are willing to grant access to their banking data to secure a credit or loan. Among respondents 18 to 29, the number shoots up to 84%.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of younger customers have already linked their accounts while applying for a loan. And, as digital natives, nine out of ten would prefer a loan option with a digital application or approval process.</p>







<p>The consumer base is changing, opening a window for the industry to evolve in step. Today’s borrowers are calling for a new, digital-first era of lending, giving applicants more control over the information used to determine their creditworthiness.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>By allowing consumers to share access to their financial data, open banking can provides a current view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit for more transparent lending decisions – and a more financially inclusive economy.</p>



 Younger borrowers are embracing digital lending

<p>Welcome to our latest edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap, where we explore recent crypto regulatory shifts from around the world. In this edition, we are analyzing the recent blockchain regulatory moves from Spain, Kenya, Ghana, and the United States. Join us as we examine these changes and their implications for the global digital asset&nbsp;market.</p> Crypto Legislation Continues Gaining&nbsp;Momentum <p>Europe: In Spain, Agencia Tributaria, the country’s tax administration agency, made it compulsory for Spanish residents to declare crypto-assets held on non-Spanish platforms. However, it will only apply to individuals who cross a certain threshold, a balance exceeding US$55,000 in crypto assets. The new regulations will be effective from January 1,&nbsp;2024.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1731732352047386661?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>Africa: Meanwhile, in a similar vein, last week, Kenya witnessed similar potential enforcement of regulations when the country’s National Assembly’s Finance and National Planning Committee approved the publication of the Capital Markets (Amendment) Bill, seeking to bring crypto trading under taxation.</p><p>The bill came as a proposal from a local Kenyan legislator, seeking taxation of crypto exchanges and digital wallets. If effective, the proposed amendment bill will allow the Kenya Revenue Authority to tax Kenyans who hold crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Efforts to regulate the digital assets space could also be seen in Ghana, where Daniel Ogbambey-Tetteh, the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the country, recently announced the commissioning of a task force to look after efforts towards regulating the space and minimizing potential harm to investors.</p><p>The Director-General announced investments in human capital development to meet the needs of the task force and related plans, along with a digitalization program. He also spoke of setting up a risk-based supervision framework to seamlessly migrate from the compliance-based supervision mode.</p><p>North America: Amidst worldwide talks of compliance, regulation, and supervision, the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously passed a blockchain bill titled “Deploying American Blockchain Act of 2023.” And while the Committee has already passed the draft bill 46 votes to 0, it is awaiting a full house&nbsp;vote.</p> Kenya’s Digital Currency Bill: A Detailed&nbsp;Look <p>A primary aspect of Kenya’s Digital Currency Bill is the requirement for digital currency licensees to register with the Capital Markets Authority. If approved, licensees will have to maintain detailed transaction records and pay taxes on capital gains from these transactions, promoting transparency and contributing to the national&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>Another significant measure that the proposed bill will enforce is requiring crypto holders to disclose comprehensive details for taxation purposes, such as the amount and types of cryptocurrencies owned, dates of acquisition and sale, transaction proceeds, and associated costs. While this does promote fiscal responsibility and prevent tax evasion, it also imposes an administrative burden on crypto holders and could be seen as an invasion of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Additionally, the bill proposes a capital gains tax on the increased market value of crypto during transactions, aligning with the existing practice where banks deduct a 20% excise duty on all transaction commissions and fees. This could potentially stabilize revenue from fluctuating market values but may also discourage investment in digital currencies due to increased taxation.</p><p>Overall, while the bill seeks to bring order and accountability to the burgeoning digital currency market in Kenya, it also introduces complexities and potential deterrents for crypto investors and users. Hence, the balance between regulation and innovation will be key to the bill’s success and its impact on Kenya’s digital asset landscape.</p> US Lawmakers Introduce Blockchain Bills: What’s in&nbsp;Store <p>In the United States, Representatives Larry Bucshon and Lisa Blunt Rochester have introduced two key pieces of legislation aimed at enhancing blockchain technology use.</p><p>The first, backed by Rep. Bucshon, focuses on better identifying supply chain risks to keep the US competitive in emerging technologies. This act promises improved national security and economic stability but may require significant resources and increased regulatory oversight.</p><p>The second bill proposes the Secretary of Commerce to be the primary advisor to the President on blockchain and DLT policies, with the authority to form advisory committees. This could centralize and streamline blockchain strategy, fostering innovation. However, it raises concerns about potential bureaucratic inefficiencies and over-regulation.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/RepLarryBucshon/status/1732058642864578574">Image Source</a>)<p>Under the Deploying American Blockchains Act, the Secretary of Commerce would establish best practices for blockchain deployment, assisting both the public and private sectors. Although this initiative could drive technological advancement, it also faces challenges in balancing innovation with regulation and privacy concerns.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/new-european-crypto-transfer-rules-in-2024">New European Crypto Transfer Rules in&nbsp;2024</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the&nbsp;UAE</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>If asked what job role is most associated with Identity and Access Management (IAM), what would you say?</p>
<p>Most of you might think a highly technical specialist, or an “IT person”. However, many CEOs, CFOs, Customer Service team leaders, HR analysts and other professionals across companies are involved in IAM decision making. But why is this? This blog will explore why it is important for companies to invest more time and effort in ensuring that Identity and Access Management is well understood across various job functions.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s understand what Identity and Access Management is.</p>
 What is IAM? 
<blockquote><p>“Identity and Access management is the people, processes and systems used to manage digital identities and their entitlements throughout their life-cycle.” ~ <a href="https://open-measure.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DIC/pages/1409143/Identity+and+Access+Management">Open Measure Dictionary</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Organisations use IAM software to manage and secure the identities of both internal and external users for their services and applications. There are &nbsp;two main styles of IAM systems, that are currently in use:</p>
 Traditional IAM or Internal IAM 
<p>Traditional IAM takes care of the internal identities, mainly employees but also can include other groups of individuals such as subcontractors and representatives from partners and suppliers. Think of an employee, from their user account creation, granting the right access to perform their job, until the account deletion when the person leaves the company.</p>
 Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) 
<p>CIAM forked from IAM when the number of Internet applications in every company’s data environment exploded in numbers. Such growth was clearly reflected in the number of screen icons in our devices. Companies of all kinds expect that their applications will be accessed by thousands or millions of consumers, citizens, remote workers, and other types of users. These “customers” could be B2C or B2B. Particularly with the innovations in the LEI world, B2B IAM is becoming a hot topic that will bring massive benefits to the B2B world.</p>
 Why IAM matters to everyone 
<p>Not long ago, when you started a new job or became a university student, someone from IT would provide you with access to necessary systems, and a username and password that needs to be changed after the first login. All identity and access management processes were semi-manual and done by the IT team. Today, we have modern identity standards, but often IAM is an area that only a small group of people in the organisation are involved in. With companies embarking on digital transformation, a larger percentage of the companies’ staff is now becoming involved in building new web and mobile services. But unless everyone has an adequate understanding of IAM, these projects are doomed to fail. Therefore, knowing IAM is not only for the IT folks as it was at the beginning of the millennium.</p>
 Who normally sees Identity and Access management on their desk? 
<p>Identity and Access Management is not an everyday task for many professionals beyond the IT team (or IAM team if it exists). However, when the time comes for strategic decisions, there are several people who will have a voice and decision power in how IAM is acquired, planned, deployed, maintained and expanded.</p>
<p>Especially for the biggest decisions involving risk and money, several sub-organisations and functions have the responsibility to build consensus with the IAM team in order to get their own business objectives met. The most critical of these stakeholders are:</p>
 
 There is no software that magically makes a company GDPR-compliant. Same with PCI DSS, CCPA and other regulations. Compliance officers use IAM among other tools and processes to fulfil their audits. Undoubtedly the compliance team will have clear requirements about what IAM must offer. 
 With a large portion of employees working from their home offices, the risks of attacks to the companies’ systems have drastically increased. The Chief Information and Security Officer is well aware that IAM has taken a leading role in the organisation’s security. 
 Customer Service. Since the concept of self-service account management appeared, CIAM has made a tremendous impact on customer service, and there are multiple ways that CIAM can help. Even in a utopian passwordless world, users will need account recovery and might end up panickily calling customer service. And customer service will ask CIAM to help. Find out more about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/resources/ciam-customer-experience-marketing/" title="leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here">leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here</a>. 
 Business Development / Umbrella Organisations. New student portals, patient portals, citizen portals, new mobile apps, improved authentication methods for existing applications…; for every new or existing web service, every day a new service is being created or improved, and IAM needs to be in place. That’s why business units must understand IAM very well in order to reach their set goals. 
 Human Resources. Today any HR information system (e.g., SAP SuccessFactors, Workday) is in one way or another connected with the IAM systems, both Traditional IAM and CIAM. There again, several persons in the HR team will have a lot to say about what IAM should do and shouldn’t do. 
 The CFO. We know it well, that IAM is a necessary but also hefty investment for organisations. The Chief Financial Officer will carefully evaluate the financial impact and will ask both the IAM vendor and the aforementioned stakeholders for a clear Return On Investment (ROI). 
 
<p>Most of these people unfortunately only truly care about IAM when an issue arises for them.</p>
 Let’s educate everyone on IAM 
<p>Seeing how relevant IAM is across the functions, shouldn’t we start a crusade to educate more people about it?</p>
<blockquote><p>“30% of the time for an IAM team should be dedicated to education and knowledge transfer to people who are outside of the IAM team, and the rest of the organisation.” ~ <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/iam-uk-public-sector-richard-slater-amido/" title="Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.">Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With my personal experience, spending time on educating around IAM is realistic and crucial. There are commonplace and unconventional ways to make this happen: presentations, pre-recorded demos, mini workshops, discussions on hot topics. The executive who leads IAM in the organisation has to become a persuasive agent and make sure that these activities happen, and that more people will be converted into IAM ambassadors. Everyone in the company will benefit from it. After all, times have changed, and there is no digital transformation without CIAM.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and Credential Locking, or proof of humanity locking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and credential locking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches, or 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers credential locking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and Credential Locking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>Credential Locking, or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, Credential Locking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a Credential&nbsp;that can be locked with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By locking KEY on their Credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's Credential Locking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By locking their credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have locked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, locking credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens&nbsp;as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Credential Locking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By locking their credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD Credential Locking  
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's credential locking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information to ensure the security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD Credential Locking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By locking their credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>In my research for this blog post, I wondered where the proverb about glass houses and throwing stones originated. I'm unsure whether there will ever be a definitive answer, but <a href="https://www.almanac.com/fact/where-did-the-saying-people-who-live">this one</a> appealed to my education as an English major:</p>
<p>The proverb appeared in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, written in 1385. Later, George Herbert modified it this way: “Whose house is of glass, must not throw stones at another.” And in 1736, Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Don’t throw stones at your neighbors, if your own windows are glass.”</p>
<p>Then I decided I’d give DALL-E a go at it. I like that it turned out so dramatically:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This image captures quite well the point I’d like to make about breach revelations—piling on the schadenfreude provides little solace when you become the target. And let’s face it, we are all targets now.</p>
 For whom the bell tolls 
<p>When the closing bell rang at the NASDAQ on November 29, 2023, Okta shares (NASDAQ:OKTA) had been devalued by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/29/okta-hackers-stole-data-on-all-customer-support-users-company-says.html">nearly 7%</a> and received <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/okta-hit-with-6-downgrades-following-q3-earnings-4-big-analyst-cuts-3246837">six downgrades</a> from previous estimates, despite the company’s better-than-expected <a href="https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results">earnings report</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20231130546/oktas-stock-falls-amid-wave-of-downgrades-now-is-not-the-time-for-profit-push">TD Cowen analyst report</a>, OKTA's financial performance is reflecting “the impact of recent high-profile breaches involving the company’s solutions.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>In reaction, part practical, part penance, Okta stated it would <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/okta-s-90-day-delay-on-product-releases-is-a-critical-step-analyst">halt product releases</a> for 90 days (presumably, the time it takes to get one’s security glasshouse in order). Such news may seem like a holiday gift to Okta’s competitors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, continuing to draw on my English major, John Donne had this <a href="https://allpoetry.com/No-man-is-an-island">great poem</a> a while back about a bell tolling and then Hemingway went on to develop the concept into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls">novel</a>. This sentiment rings true today, as we step collectively into an era of hyper-exposure to cyber-attacks: everybody’s going to take their turn. From Donne’s poem:</p>
<p>Any man's death diminishes me,<br>Because I am involved in mankind.<br>And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>It tolls for thee.</p>
<p>Speaking of humanity, it turns out the initial account that was compromised was a non-human—or service—account. These types of accounts can be unruly, and they don’t use multi-factor authentication. In a <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@dangoodin/111348246005935166">discussion</a> on infosec.exhange (with Adam Shostack and friends, no less!) commentors offer various summaries on what had just occurred and who was to shame. This one, I think, summarizes it up best:</p>
<p>Yes, let’s all agree, the one-word technical summary is accurate. But—to paraphrase a security professional I discussed the matter with—as large as the providers are these days, you can never be certain you’ll have your bases covered everyone takes a turn, even open-source providers.</p>
<p>And—talk about the mother of all identity providers—the DNA research company 23andMe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/23andme-confirms-hackers-stole-ancestry-data-on-6-9-million-users/">reported a breach</a> in October, as well—and likewise continues to realize new depths of the severity of the attack. And again, lest we forget, this cautionary tale is at least as old as 2011, when KuppingerCole Analysts reported similar findings from the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/rsa-securid-it-will-never-be-the-same-again">RSA SecurID breach</a>.</p>
 Cyberculture and the culture of silence 
<p>So, what is the proper response to getting our security <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-retired-players-agree-to-concussion-lawsuit-settlement-0ap1000000235501">bell rung</a> (as the NFL calls it)? Well, first and foremost, it’s important to talk about it openly. That’s not an easy topic for discussion with investors, customers, and competitors looking on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BeyondTrust, which <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">reported</a> the breach on October 2nd 2023, was likely the first customer to speak up about it, because the attackers had finally showed up at the company’s door (front door in this case). Still, Okta took more than two weeks to admit to the breach. Oddly, even now, BeyondTrust’s detailed timeline of the breach provides a lot more specifics than you can find on Okta’s security blog.</p>
<p>There’s a reason the mantra of physical security states, “if you see something, say something”—the social alert draws in a community to restore safety. For example, BeyondTrust reveals that the attacker requested a HAR file archive (HTML backup) for the ostensible purpose of troubleshooting the website. Obtaining the file, the hacker then reused a session cookie from that HAR file to attempt a replay attack on a web service, which BeyondTrust easily blocked. Undeterred, the attacker then switched to using API calls instead. According to BeyondTrust:</p>
<p>API actions cannot be protected by policies in the same way as actual admin console access. Using the API, they [the attackers] <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">created a backdoor user account</a> using a naming convention like existing service accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great intel on how the threat actor conducts business and everyone should be put on notice. Still, valuable time was spent in a moment or two of silence. Why?</p>
<p>The culture of silence needs to go. We need to swap notes. Safety is a collaborative effort, because we can’t know in advance where the next threat will originate or where it will propagate.</p>
 Going to production requires oversight 
<p>The interesting thing about this breach is that it started with a service account and then moved to human accounts. One way this happens is by not hardening the system sufficiently when moving from development to production environments. The Okta Developer portal makes it easy for developers to get moving on projects but will need a thorough security review when deploying applications.</p>
<p>Also, the LDAP interface is typically enabled by default even when not in use, heightening the risk level. Access control policies for sensitive apps and admin accounts are often not adequately designed to limit risk exposure to breaches.</p>
<p>Okta is now critical infrastructure and needs a run book that ensures security is maintained. One of the shocking findings in the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/CSRB_Lapsus%24_508c.pdf">report on Lapsus$</a> breaches “organizations did not always consider third parties and BPOs in their risk management programs.” Communication with third parties is necessary preparation for moving to production, as well.</p>
 How to learn from—rather that gloat over—others’ mishaps 
<p>Proposals for avoiding and dealing with breaches were plentiful at our recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">Cyberevolution</a> conference. For example, we <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5434/1">heard from</a> Michiel Stoop of Philips, who spoke on “How to Minimize the Blast Radius of an Attack?” In this case, the approach was to minimize access from privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Jorge Monteiro of Ethiack pointed out that it’s actually a good idea to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5439/2">attack yourself first</a>, in his presentation titled “Autonomous Ethical Hacking for Accurate and Continuous Security Testing.”</p>
<p>Emergency preparedness is often overlooked in cybersecurity, with the majority of the attention going to prevention and detection. But, if we already agree that we are all simply waiting our turn to be attacked, it seems only obvious that we prepare plans for that inevitable moment.</p>
<p>One proposal we covered at Cyberevolution is the practice of developing and training on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5468/3">tabletop exercises</a>, which was covered in a panel titled, “Arresting Disaster: Driving Incident Response in Cyber-Regulated Europe in an Age of AI Threats,” which included participants from ArmorText and the law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring.&nbsp;It’s important to recognize that even your messaging platforms like Teams, Slack, or Zoom become compromised in a breach and so your team will need an out of band “break glass” communication that also meets legal requirements of various governments.</p>
<p>Independent of the measures taken to reduce risk and mitigate cyber disasters, the common thread through all these measures is to communicate openly and quickly with the cyber security community. We’ll all fare much better against attackers as we open channels for honest, detailed, and actionable information.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>With employee identity risk and fraud on the rise — to the point that the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI has issued a public warning</a> — it’s crucial to ensure that employees are who they say they are. Is the person you interviewed the same person you actually hired? Is the person logging in a legitimate employee? Is the person requesting a credential reset in fact the owner of those credentials? Robust identity proofing helps you answer those questions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Understanding Identity Proofing and Why It’s Needed  
<p>What is identity proofing? Identity proofing is the process of verifying and validating the identity of individuals accessing digital systems. It ensures that the identity exists and that the person claiming the identity is the real owner. Employee identity proofing is a fundamental aspect of safeguarding sensitive information, intellectual property and overall organizational integrity. It addresses one of the major security weaknesses in most IAM systems — the fact that authentication only validates that the credentials being used to access systems are valid. It cannot ensure that the person using those credentials is the legitimate holder, and further that the legitimate holder is actually who they claim to be.</p> 
 Workplace Identity Fraud Escalating  
<p>The rise of remote work and the increase in attacks on identity processes underscore the critical need for reliable methods of verifying and validating employee identities. Using credentials obtained by brute force attacks, phishing, AitM attacks, social engineering and other methods,&nbsp; cybercriminals can readily gain unauthorized access to systems and networks. Sometimes the attacks aren’t particularly sophisticated, but exploit gaps in verification processes to perpetrate identity fraud.</p> 
<p>Consider the case of the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">attack on MGM resorts</a>. Armed with publicly available details, attackers impersonated an employee and convinced the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. From there they could wreak havoc, stealing sensitive data and deploying ransomware that shut down operations for over a week.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>MGM Resorts attack flow</p> 
<p>By implementing stringent identity proofing protocols, organizations can ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.</p> 
 Key Components of Identity Proofing for the Workforce  
<p>Worker identity proofing should include multiple verification methods to increase the security of the proofing process. The methods used will depend on the situation and context. Ideally all components are connected both to each other and to your other identity security tools and systems.</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Document verification determines whether a document — such as a passport, driver’s license or other official document — is authentic or not. This can be done either in person or digitally. Your document verification process should include technology that is able to detect forgeries or alterations.</p> 
 Location Detection  
<p>Location detection is an important aspect of online identity proofing. Is the employee in the geolocation you expect them to be? If not, this may require further investigation. It’s important, however, that your location detection adheres to global regulations.</p> 
 Facial Recognition With Liveness Detection  
<p>Facial recognition uses facial biometrics to determine if a person matches the identity they are claiming. Usually the person will take a selfie as part of the identity proofing process. Liveness detection is a critical feature when using facial verification in order to detect spoofing tactics such as a photo, video playback or even a mask.</p> 
 Live Video Verification  
<p>Live video verification adds an additional layer of security to the identity proofing process. It takes place face-to-face over a video conference, between the employee and their supervisor or an authorized agent and includes questions and actions designed to confirm liveness and detect signs of spoofing or coercion.</p> 
 Chat Verification  
<p>In some cases, such as a lower risk scenario, chat verification may be sufficient. It also may be used as part of a more comprehensive identity proofing flow. Effective chat verification combines AI and human interaction.</p> 
 Attestation  
<p>Attestation by a responsible party of the identity proofing results is a critical part of the process. This creates an official trail for audit and compliance purposes. Your identity proofing software should retain the attested results, not the employee’s sensitive data.</p> 
<p>The integration of these diverse methods creates a comprehensive identity proofing ecosystem, enhancing cybersecurity measures and safeguarding organizations from unauthorized access and data breaches.</p> 
 NIST Identity Proofing Guidelines&nbsp;  
<p>Identity proofing holds a critical role in IAM. Under the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital Identity Guidelines, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63a.pdf">NIST SP 800-63-A</a> covers enrollment and identity proofing. It outlines a general identity proofing flow and describes three different security levels based on the strength of the type of evidence gathered as well as the verification processes used.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> Level 1 (IAL1): This level does not require the user to be linked to a known, established real-life identity. It uses self-asserted attributes — in other words, no identity proofing.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2): IAL2 introduces the requirement for strong proof connecting the user to a valid, real-world identity. It supports a wide range of identity proofing methods, allowing for either remote or in-person validation. This includes government-issued documentation as well as biometrics;&nbsp; proofing cannot rely on knowledge-based techniques.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3): IAL3 is the strictest identity proofing level, requiring user presence and biometric verification.</p> 
 Best Practices for Effective Workforce Identity Proofing  
<p>Many companies verify a worker’s identity at the time of hire and stop there. Make sure your identity proofing strategy addresses all key workplace scenarios and times of increased risk of fraud. Below are some of the most critical moments to address.</p> 
 Employee Onboarding  
<p>Before giving any new hire access to corporate systems and data, HR teams need to ensure that the person they are onboarding has a credible identity and is the legitimate owner of the identity they are claiming. They also need to verify that the new employee is in fact the person that was interviewed for the role. This means elements of identity proofing need to come into play before a candidate steps a real or virtual foot into the office. It’s also crucial to securely tie the new employee’s verified identity to IAM systems using non-phishable methods.</p> 
 Credential Resets  
<p>In many organizations, identity proofing stops at HR’s door. The newly minted employee is provisioned with a digital identity and from that point on verification involves validation of that digital identity — there is no process for ensuring it ties back to the real world holder of that identity. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks that target the credential reset process. For example, an attacker with the right information can claim to be an employee with a new phone that needs to enroll in MFA on their new device.</p> 
 Changing Roles  
<p>A change in roles often provides an employee with access to systems previously out of reach. Before granting those elevated privileges, organizations should make sure that the role change is legitimate and the user is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p> 
 Elevated Detected Risk  
<p>When identity monitoring systems detect potential risks, re-proofing may be indicated depending on the risk level and threat type. For example, if a user attempts to log in from a device that is not in proximity to their computer or engages in other suspicious activity, they could be automatically prompted to provide proof that they are the valid credential holder.</p>

   Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a system architecture guiding tech choices, not a software or service. It prioritizes the individual, allowing them to control their own information. Blockchain technology, as a decentralized database with data spread across nodes, seems a fit for SSI as it ensures accuracy and security. However, it has limitations like being computationally expensive and complex.

<p>For many in the identity industry, hearing “self-sovereign identity” (SSI) automatically makes you think “blockchain.” And, if you’re like me, as soon as you hear blockchain, you think it’s too darn early to play the blockchain drinking game and move on. In the early days of SSI, most of the discussion was, in fact, about identity on a blockchain. That association did a disservice to the concept of SSI. SSI is no more dependent on using blockchain technologies than a passport is dependent on a particular type of paper.&nbsp;</p>



 What is SSI? 



<p>SSI is an architecture that guides technological decisions. It is not a piece of software to install or a service you can purchase. In an SSI model, the individual is the single most important entity in a transaction. That individual controls what happens with their information. For people to trust the individual’s information, there needs to be some measure of both technical and societal trust in the veracity of that information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the puzzle the technology has to solve. How do you create a digital identity with information that has been verified (or possibly asserted) by a third party (like the government), that allows an individual to control what information is shared, does NOT allow the third party to know about the transaction, and yet can be verified as accurate by whoever is receiving the data from the individual?</p>



 What is a Blockchain? 



<p>Several features associated with blockchain technology suggest it is a good fit to solve that problem. At its most basic, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a distributed database with data spread across any number of nodes in a network. Enough math is involved to guarantee that the information in those nodes can only be altered with a clear record of who modified it and when.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the right technology, such as a digital identity wallet, an individual can share this cryptographically secure information with any other interested party. Suppose that information was initially issued by a known, trusted entity, and the data cannot be changed (only added to in a visible way). In that case, no one needs to check back with that issuer to see if the information is accurate. The issuer will, in fact, have no idea that this information was shared at all. The individual is in control, and privacy is preserved. Win!</p>



<p>You might find this article interesting if you’d like to read more about how SSI and blockchain can transform society.</p>



 Other Options for SSI 



<p>We have some obvious wins here by using blockchain technology to support SSI. Why isn’t it the One True Way? Because blockchain has some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/04/14/the-5-biggest-problems-with-blockchain-technology-everyone-must-know-about/?sh=5c35504c55d2">significant limitations</a>. For one thing, it is computationally expensive (which means slow and power-hungry). It is also far more complicated than is actually required for most use cases (if you haven’t seen Figure 6 in this&nbsp;<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8202.pdf">NIST publication</a>, it sums this argument up nicely).</p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a fundamental part of the SSI model. There is an entire&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">registry</a>&nbsp;of possible methods to use and support DIDs. Some are blockchain-based, but others rely on the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;specifications. There are options; it is better to understand your current infrastructure, what problem you’re trying to solve, and decide what technology you need to support. Don’t try to make your problem fit the tool, especially when other tools are available.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>SSI’s core principle is about enabling individuals to own and control their digital identities. This architecture can be implemented through various technologies, not limited to blockchain. Blockchain offers a way to decentralize and secure these identities, but it’s not the only method to achieve the principles of SSI.</p>



<p>And if you play the blockchain drinking game, too, I hope you read this late in your day and have a designated driver to get you home.</p>

 A Just Transition Plan for London Borough of&nbsp;Newham Chigwell Road in East London. Photograph: Jack Dredd/Rex/Shutterstock via the&nbsp;Guardian<p>The London Borough of Newham is one of over 300 of the UK’s total 382 local authorities to have declared a climate emergency since 2019. Following these declarations, many local authorities have adopted the Climate Action Plan as a format for translating recognition of risk into action and transformation. From June to October 2023, our team from Dark Matter Labs and colleagues at Arup collaborated with the London Borough of Newham to consider how a new generation of Climate Action Plans might increase the scale and pace of impact, in the face of the climate emergency.</p><p>Newham’s Just Transition Plan, the first outcome of our collaboration, explores innovative approaches to the document’s foundational principles, format, and scope. This article will present the Just Transition Plan as a model for future innovation around local authority climate action, and share what we found in working closely with those seeking to drive systemic change in&nbsp;Newham.</p> Centring justice in Newham’s climate transition <p>Newham, in East London, faces a unique intersection of climate and socioeconomic risks for a UK local authority area. Newham residents currently have the highest rate of death attributable to air pollution in London, and is among the six London boroughs most exposed to flood and overheating risks as temperatures rise. From March to May of 2020, Newham’s Covid-19 mortality rate was more than double England’s average. Today, about one quarter of Newham residents are paid below the London living wage, and one in two children live in poverty, with under-16s making up more than 20% of the population. More than half of residents were born outside of the UK (as of the 2021 census), and Newham is the UK’s most ethnically diverse borough. Newham also has the highest number of households in temporary and non-secure housing in the UK; average rent represents about 65% of wages, compared to the UK average of around 30%. These risks and vulnerabilities situate Newham’s 350,000 residents at the forefront of present and future needs across climate mitigation and adaptation. On the other hand is the sense of opportunity in the borough, on the basis of the youth and diversity of its population. The expansive thinking and leadership within Newham Council enabled a tangible understanding of how the climate emergency is already affecting residents.</p><p>Since 2021, London as a whole and Newham in particular have witnessed increasing evidence of the entanglement of climate risks. Everyday but profound stressors like growing heating bills, and extreme weather such as the July 2021 floods and 2022 heat waves, which resulted in over 3,000 deaths across the UK, have made plain the urgency of systemic action. When we began this work in June 2023, the prospect of another dangerously hot summer was hanging over our work. In each of these scenarios, the intersectionality of the lived experience of climate change was unmissable: people of colour in the UK are four times as likely to live in areas at high risk of extreme heat. The council’s existing Climate Action Plan, as with many others, focuses on a list of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This, however, does not address the reality of Newham residents’ present critical needs and their likely, iminent intensification. A plan for a Just Transition would need to target intersectionality to increase equity in the borough through every single recommendation, while also reducing emissions.</p> Recalibrating our focus in the local authority context <p>With our colleagues in Newham Council, Dark Matter Labs and Arup adopted a cross-disciplinary lens driven by a particular focus on governance and urban climate risks. Early interviews with officers in the council, local leaders and experts from within our organisations outlined one of the defining tensions of this piece of work: local authorities have high and well-informed ambitions, but are working within an extremely challenging context, with limited resources. This dynamic makes system-scale innovation, sustained investment in transition causes, and transformative leadership by councils profoundly difficult. Recent research from <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/promotional-materials/section/youve-made-a-climate-action-plan-what-next-guidance-for-local-governments">Arup</a> outlines an alternative framing: while less than 5% of a borough’s emissions are typically directly attributable to council activities, it can influence as much as 70% of emissions through procurement, policy, jobs, place-shaping, partnerships and community engagement. Local authorities must act, but also influence and convene to affect emissions reduction, and so too the other elements of a Just Transition. In designing the plan, we highlighted ways Newham Council could further grow their influence and work with the borough’s committed community members and other stakeholders.</p><p>A few other shifts in focus were crucial to our efforts. Concepts such as emissions scopes are a poor fit for the scale and interconnectivity of urban boroughs, and can result in a blame game of emissions sources. A reliance on difficult-to-attain emissions data can undermine the ability of local authorities to pinpoint effective levers and enact meaningful climate action. We worked with Newham Council to understand their emissions holistically while they are compiling a nuanced borough-wide picture.</p><p>Estimates suggest that less than 10% of global climate investments go toward adaptation (source: <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/">Climate Policy Initiative</a>), but the case for adaptive measures is stronger than ever. We know that actions which integrate mitigation and adaptation create value, reduce risk and future costs, encourage future investment, and improve quality of living. In Newham, increasing the capacity for adaptation could be incorporated into the more expansive idea of future-readiness: where institutions, infrastructure and individuals are prepared for the volatile futures expected from a world that has warmed on average by 2°C or more. We similarly identified the need for longer-term, recurring, blended and strategic investment to enable whole-place transformation and reduce financial risk for the&nbsp;Council.</p><p>Ultimately, the plan needed to affirm and support Newham’s officers and politicians. We worked with the Council’s Climate Action Working Group and consulted findings from citizens’ meetings to ensure the plan helped to articulate and advocate for their everyday experience and existing programmes, rather than just another thing to do. As a result, we targeted the idea of a next-generation document committing to climate action in Newham: one which was ambitious and informed, reflective of the urgency of this moment, and oriented toward the potential of collective action.</p>Shifts that might define next-generation climate action by local authorities<p>The 3–6–5&nbsp;plan</p><p>Our plan was structured into three parts, each framed by a set of questions:</p> 3 Principles <p>How can a local authority address the entangled targets of a Just Transition: to increase equity, to build future-readiness, and to meaningfully reduce emissions?</p> 6 Futures <p>What specific risks does Newham face, and what levers will enable these to be addressed in order to bring about a Just Transition? What defines the positive place futures we want to bring to fruition?</p> 5 Enablers <p>How can this be accomplished? What action would enable the council and the borough to reach climate targets, support the work that’s already taking place, and maintain momentum in the Transition? How would we need to work differently and collaboratively to make this&nbsp;happen?</p><p>These three components give structure to our more detailed recommendations for Newham, each functioning differently within the context of the plan. While the principles emerged early in our research and guided the formation of the rest of the plan, the futures and enablers were the result of sustained engagement with council data and expertise.</p><p>The 6 Futures, which direct council departments toward visions of the transition in play, takes on some challenging areas, such as Newham’s property and social housing portfolio, which is associated with a majority of emissions in the council’s direct control. Equally important in this section was building on areas where Newham is already a leader, such as in its pioneering work around school meals, and the recent commissioning of micro-forests across the borough. Finally we were very aware that climate action plans can easily turn into lists of hundreds of actions. We sought to focus on the main actions where there would be significant impact across the principles if focused resources were brought to&nbsp;bear.</p><p>Our approach to the Just Transition was to recognise that much of the space for proposition was around capacity, resources, and governance within and between the council, civic society, businesses and institutions that had an interest in the borough. The 5 Enablers give shape to possible forms of governance and finance innovation for Newham, with a view toward capturing the maximum potential of the borough’s leaders across sectors and communities.</p><p>What’s next?</p><p>Since the plan’s launch by the Council on 5 December, it is available to examine more closely <a href="https://www.newham.gov.uk/council/just-transition-plan">here</a>. In <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/promotional-materials/section/youve-made-a-climate-action-plan-what-next-guidance-for-local-governments">“You’ve Made a Climate Action Plan, what next?”</a>, our colleagues at Arup pose the crucial question in the document’s title. For Newham, our collaboration to date represents tracks laid for the longer-term processes and effort which will be required to sustain momentum for the Just Transition. We look forward to continuing our collaboration, and developing future work to support the borough’s important work to increase equity, grow future-readiness, and reduce emissions.</p><p>Work by Emma Pfeiffer &amp; Dan Hill, in partnership with The London Borough of Newham&nbsp;Council</p>

 How open banking paints a more nuanced picture of borrowers  



<p>Even in the best economic circumstances, loans are often a necessity, especially for critical purchases like homes and cars.  &nbsp;</p>



<p> For some insight into the lending landscape, Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The upshot: 89% have been adversely affected by economic pressures, and nearly half are struggling to get the loans and credit they need. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional credit scores do not always reflect an applicant’s ability to make payments. Individuals with thin or no credit history can struggle to qualify for credit. Young adults on their own for the first time, gig workers who deal mostly in cash, new Americans and retirees with a single credit card and no loans can struggle to qualify for leases, credit cards and mobile phone contracts. </p>



<p>To most consumers, change is overdue — 87% believe the decisioning process should make it easier for responsible borrowers to prove their ability to repay. </p>







<p>Open banking could help provide that missing piece. By choosing to share their bank account data, applicants can paint a more complete picture of who they are. Real-time insights into their accounts — such as a thin credit borrower’s biweekly deposits, cash flow or consistent payments for bills like utilities — offer an up to date, more comprehensive view of their financial health. &nbsp;</p>







<p>This shift in consumer mindset opens new horizons for lenders, allowing them to champion more inclusive processes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking has the potential to accommodate millions of thin-credit applicants who have previously had difficulties accessing the benefits of the financial system. Consumers have spoken. They want the next evolution of lending to prioritize transparency, accessibility and empowerment for consumers worldwide to build a more inclusive digital economy where everyone thrives. &nbsp;</p>



 Digital lending is on the rise 



<p>The data revealed in Mastercard’s Lend Report shows global consumer support for a more transparent, digital-first approach to lending. Read more about the future of lending in Mastercard’s Lend Report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finicity.com/future-of-lending-report/">here</a>.</p>

<p>While Identity and Access Management (IAM) long ago gave IT teams tighter controls against unauthorized access to digital services, it hasn’t exactly been bulletproof.</p>
<p>Yes, IAM consolidated the management and storage of user data and enabled login credentials to be associated with user roles and permissions easily. But it also created a single point of failure that hackers have proven painfully adept at exploiting to gain access to all the resources a user is authorized to access.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/journey-through-identity-models-centralized-federated-decentralized">Federated</a> identity management was supposed to fix that by involving a third party in the management of IAM. Instead, it retained all the dangers of centralized identity while extending the potential blast radius of compromised credentials to vast, interconnected networks. Meanwhile, the global cybercrime economy now tops $7.8 trillion a year. The good news: Decentralized digital identity (DID) management has emerged as a superior approach to managing user identity — if you have the right architecture to support it.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Password or a Pretty Face 
<p>In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we shared the contours of the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a>, which employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with up to 99.6% accuracy. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">Part Two</a>, we showcased how we go above and beyond mere logins by binding identity to a biometric stored within a digital wallet. Yet, as solid as these architectural pillars are, we know that decentralized identity models offer a way to keep these and other personal identifiers and information far more secure than traditional user stores — centralized, federated, or otherwise.</p>
<p>To that end, let’s look at why we designed our architecture to support <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">a reusable identity wallet</a> that enables users to securely gain access to corporate systems using identity details that remain under their own control instead of being stored centrally on servers where they can be altered, misapplied, become inaccurate over time—or be swiped, ransomed, or leveraged to commit fraud.</p>
 Decentralized Identity: What’s In Your Wallet? 
<p>In our view, decentralized digital identity isn’t just important to modern IAM. It’s essential because: 1) it replaces platform-specific user stores that are hard to integrate because of proprietary technologies embedded deeply within those very same platforms, and 2) it replaces incomplete user personal identifiable information (PII) scattered across multiple business applications to one version of the truth managed directly by the user.</p>
<p>By leveraging advances in smartphones, cryptography, and blockchain technologies, our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID solution</a> leverages the 1Kosmos architecture to establish high-assurance trust online in a way that balances security, privacy, and convenience. This enables organizations to confidently accelerate user onboarding and activation of digital services, protect digital accounts from unauthorized access (AKA account takeover), prevent transaction fraud, improve the user experience, and more. Specific features include:</p>
<p>A Reusable Identity Wallet</p>
<p>End users gain secure access not just to corporate accounts and systems but also to digital analogs of verified government-issued ID cards, driver licenses, passports, social security cards, and more—anytime, anywhere, from any device. Users also control what personal information they share with digital services in a manner consistent with emerging <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> frameworks.</p>
<p>Portability and Interoperability</p>
<p>1Kosmos offers the only solution certified to the highest FIDO, NIST, UKDAITF standards for interoperability and security and provides an SDK along with off-the-shelf APIs to simplify data sharing and integration.</p>
<p>Verifiable Claims &amp; Credentials</p>
<p>A way to digitally present in real time claims for a virtually limitless number and variety of machine-verified credentials and safely store them so they’re ready to reuse on-demand with user consent.</p>
<p>These features produce enormous benefits for organizations and end users, including the following.</p>
 Rapid Remote User Onboarding 
<p>The 1Kosmos digital identity wallet organizes and stores information gathered, triangulated, and validated during the identity-proofing stage of self-service user onboarding. This includes attributes from multiple, proof-able sources—and enables a wide variety of applications that require identity verification without requiring physical, in-person presence. Think worker and contractor onboarding, applications for government services and documents, and compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) mandates.</p>
 Security Backed by Public Key Cryptography 
<p>Our digital identity wallet consists of a decentralized identifier along with the cryptographic public-private key pair. Personal information about the user and their credentials are stored within the wallet and require the user’s private key and biometrics to read data from it. Because the private key never leaves the Secure Enclave within the device and the biometric can be authenticated with the highest digital standards available, this approach vastly exceeds the security achievable through passwords, traditional forms of multifactor authentication, and unverified device-level biometrics. In turn, this reduces cyber threats related to credentials stolen through phishing attacks, data breaches, and more.</p>
 User Convenience With Just the Right Friction 
<p>When data from the digital wallet needs to be presented—during login or in the event of step-up authentication—the wallet holder must present their biometric and consent to share that data. When approved, the private key is presented as a credential to unlock the wallet and share the data. The private key never leaves the device and hence the risk of compromise is dramatically minimized. Best of all: There are no passwords to remember or clumsy OTPs to enter.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials for a Zero-Trust World 
<p>Verifiable credentials are a standardized means of issuing and presenting claims about one’s identity—driver’s license, passport, college qualifications, gym membership, etc. Other types of information, such as educational certificates and vaccination records, for example, can also be added to the wallet to make the user’s identity-proofing process indisputable in any number of use cases. The identity wallet can make assertions about identity or credentials that are cryptographically verifiable by the receiving party—without the actual data being revealed. The major cryptographic element used by decentralized identities is known as a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/security-glossary/zero-knowledge-proof/">zero knowledge proof (ZKP)</a>. Zero Knowledge proof measures an information request while protecting user privacy.</p>
 Blockchain: This Is Just The Beginning 
<p>In Part Four, we’ll click further into how the 1Kosmos architecture leverages distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to eliminate the centralized PII honeypot while increasing business ability and speed.</p>

Residents in North East London who are part of the <a href="http://www.power.film">POWER</a> — a ‘show &amp; do’ project to kick start a “grassroots Green New Deal”. Photo credit — Hilary Powell and Dan&nbsp;Edelstyn We need to rethink our approach to retrofit. <p>If you know anything about <a href="https://www.cse.org.uk/news/what-is-retrofit/">retrofit</a>, you’ve probably heard this line plenty of times. The UK has one of the oldest and leakiest housing stocks in western Europe, and we need to retrofit 27 million homes by 2050 — approximately 1.5 homes per minute for the next 27&nbsp;years.</p><p>This is necessary not only to reach our legally binding Net Zero targets but to ensure healthy, comfortable and affordable homes in a rapidly changing&nbsp;climate.</p><p>You may also know that progress on retrofit is stalling. Each winter millions of UK residents experience the physical and mental health effects of living in damp, mouldy and expensive homes. Overheating is increasingly becoming an&nbsp;issue.</p><p>There’s a lot of discussion about the multiple barriers to retrofit and why it’s often left in the ‘too hard to do’ pile: it’s expensive, disruptive and even if we can afford it, many of us simply don’t have enough trust in a good outcome to start the journey. It’s also clear that existing government-funded retrofit programmes have under-delivered and under-spent.</p><p>Yet our research with HEAL and London Councils found that people up and down the country aren’t waiting for government action. Building on the existing fabric of community groups, cooperatives, community land trusts, neighbourhood regeneration initiatives and other social infrastructures, people are organising themselves to make their and their neighbours’ homes healthier and more climate resilient.</p><p>Communities are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RetrofitBalsallHeath/">sharing information</a>, <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">organising entire streets and neighbourhoods to retrofit together</a>, <a href="https://edinburghtoollibrary.org.uk/charitable-programmes/tooligan-initiatives/etl-retrofixers/">offering simple DIY retrofit measures for free</a>, <a href="https://www.power.film/about">turning their homes into power stations</a> and <a href="https://locohome.coop/">forming local cooperatives</a> that bring together householders, building professionals and tradespeople to generate retrofit demand and deliver high quality home improvements.</p> Putting residents and communities at the heart of&nbsp;retrofit <p>We believe that neighbourhoods can drive forward a nationwide movement to accelerate the uptake and delivery of retrofit and make our homes, communities and social infrastructure more fit for the future. Empowering people to retrofit together and transform their neighbourhood will provide significant other benefits, including good quality local jobs, better health and wellbeing, stronger local economies and community wealth and resilience.</p><p>A community-powered retrofit approach proposes four fundamental shifts in the way retrofit programmes are designed and delivered:</p><p>Individual customers → collective mobilisation</p><p>Design approaches that bring people&nbsp;together</p><p>Extractive finance and grants → local economic&nbsp;value</p><p>Invest in our local economies and communities</p><p>Standardised process → user centred&nbsp;journey</p><p>Design the retrofit offer around the resident experience, not around a Net Zero policy objective</p><p>Focus on ‘measures’ delivered → focus on&nbsp;outcomes</p><p>Contract for actual objectives — healthier and more comfortable homes and reduced carbon emissions</p><p>The focus of community powered retrofit is to mobilise local residents, communities, and stakeholders to be an integral part of designing and delivering retrofit programmes. At present most retrofit programmes view so called ‘community engagement’ as a cost line to be minimised. However there are significant benefits to investing in a place-based, community-powered approach:</p>  Significantly increased participation and power of collective action  Unlocking latent capacity, developing local skills and supply&nbsp;chains  Achieving replicability and economies of scale through co-location, bulk purchasing or typological approaches and potentially reduced disruption  Developing locally relevant responses that maximise co-benefits  Greater continuity and less dependence on (often inconsistent or shifting) policy  <p>Retrofit Balsall Heath is a partnership of local groups in the inner city neighbourhood in Birmingham. It has been incredibly successful in signing up households to participate in the City Council-led programme of ‘Local Area Development Scheme’ grant-funded retrofit works. The approach has involved mobilising a coalition of local community and faith organisations to galvanise support on a street-by-street basis and seeking to support the process throughout where feasible. Although the constraints of the programme design and funding has created issues, the approach has demonstrated that there is demand from residents for improvements to their homes. Traditional approaches using letter/leaflet drops typically achieve very low response rates and don’t build the trust that is needed for residents to stay the&nbsp;course.</p>A ‘street cake’ made by a resident of Link Rd. in Birmingham as part of a co-creation week around neighbourhood climate transitions hosted by CIVIC&nbsp;SQUARE<p>We propose five key building blocks to growing a community-powered retrofit movement. Each of these can — and should — be adapted to the unique context of each community and neighbourhood and its housing characteristics, history, ownership and local&nbsp;wishes.</p>  Movement building<br>Community members and leaders come together to set the vision and communicate the foundation for neighbourhood transformation and a shared mission for better homes and futures. This builds knowledge and trust, develops neighbourhood-level infrastructure for communication, engagement and action and encourages collective action. In <a href="https://oldhamenergyfutures.carbon.coop/">Oldham</a>, Carbon Coop worked with local people to establish a citizen-led approach to transform their neighbourhood and energy system. Groups also need to learn from each other. We’ve been working with many others in establishing the <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-2023-7aec7fbb992f4a4a97ca7d969a48b216">Retrofit Reimagined Festival</a> as a vehicle to build this movement.  Training and upskilling<br>Every community initiative integrates a plan for professional development of community members and upskilling of existing tradespeople to contribute to delivery of neighbourhood retrofit. This demonstrates that retrofit can support the local economy and provide good jobs, helps people to start on the journey to becoming skilled professionals and amplifies existing and latent talent among community members. Civic Square has initiated a <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Neighbourhood-Trade-School-111b0cf89ad34e35aa7f64da612a03e1">local trade school</a> in Birmingham to develop both the ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ skills needed to support neighbourhood transitions. <a href="https://wecanmake.org/">We Can Make</a> has established a local factory to construct building components and a parallel skills programme. <a href="https://b4box.co.uk/">B4Box </a>is an integrated training provider retrofitting homes in areas affected by fuel poverty, training local people particularly those who face challenges in finding&nbsp;work.  Whole life design and journey planning<br>Residents, builders, planners, architects, building surveyors, placemaking and energy system professionals work together to design individual and collective neighbourhood transformations toward holistic long-term goals rather than quick fixes. There are many technology platforms to support this such as <a href="https://furbnow.com/">Furbnow</a>. For centralised grant-based programmes, successful delivery should be based on outcomes rather than on&nbsp;inputs.  Making finance work for places<br>Community groups can advocate for community wealth building approaches and explore options for local finance, including community energy, solar and other forms of cooperatives, collaborations with credit unions and fair and low-cost financing such as municipal bonds. There are successful <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/power-station">crowdfunding </a>and <a href="https://www.ethex.org.uk/invest/people-powered-retrofit">share&nbsp;offers</a>.  Local transition entities or coalitions<br>Retrofit programmes will take many years to deliver, and existing or new community-based entities should be established to support the area-based approach. These should be governed inclusively to provide access to all parts of the community and help to retain local control and economic benefits. Carbon Coop, Energy Communities Tipperary Coop and Cosy Homes Oxfordshire are demonstrating approaches in this space. Many community-owned energy cooperatives provide retrofit support to their areas, for example SELCE, West Oxford Community Renewables and Low Carbon West Oxford amongst&nbsp;others.  <p>There is no one-size-fits all approach to community-powered retrofit. However there are some concrete actions that can be taken&nbsp;now.</p>  Residents and existing community groups can establish forums to share knowledge and skills, approach their local authority and explore existing funding such as the <a href="https://energyredress.org.uk/">Energy Redress Scheme</a>. There are already over 400 community energy groups in the UK, many of which are involved in retrofit activities.  Local government and philanthropic funders should look to initiate or strengthen street or neighbourhood-scale projects&nbsp;by:    Identifying current community activity in retrofit or parallel domains (e.g. greening and gardening projects)  Working with local organisations and areas with known strong social networks to design, trial or build up existing street-scale schemes  Committing additional resource to support existing communities to build capacity and develop resilience for sustained action  Partnering with a broad range of cross-LA departments and agencies to develop skills, organisational and technical capacity  <p>3. All layers of government can enhance existing programmes by:</p>  Building trust and capacity in community partners and supporting new initiatives so that they are ready for future investment  Developing a spatial focus aligned to community partners  Including community partners in the bidding process from the&nbsp;outset  Understanding where CPR principles could integrate with grant programmes and in-house borough retrofit programmes  Partnering with trusted community-based intermediaries to expand the reach of existing programmes increasing uptake  Encouraging collaboration and co-design to ensure longevity of scheme measures and interventions available  Retrofit Balsall Heat — Neighbours attending a Housing protest march campaigning for retrofitting and better housing standards Working collectively is the only way to&nbsp;work <p>Retrofit is challenging. Acceptance of change accelerates when people see and experience change together, learn from each other and see the benefits that the change is bringing. By building momentum from the ground up across our cities, towns, villages and communities, we are planting the seeds for demand, building trust and shaping an approach to retrofit that will not only improve our homes and reduce carbon emissions but build social resilience and reframe the narrative around the climate transition as a pathway to a better&nbsp;future.</p><p>We are hoping that the next phase of Community Powered Retrofit will work with existing community groups to develop a replicable model and resource to enable and empower community retrofit groups around the country. We are looking for funders and existing groups to help bring this to life. Will you join&nbsp;us?</p><p>For further information on our work on retrofit see our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/">Medium channel</a>. <a href="https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/node/40773">Here </a>is a link to this report.

 Stakers can claim DF66 rewards. DF67 runs Dec 7 — Dec 14,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 66 (DF66) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 100K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Nov 30, 2023 and ended 12:01am Dec 7. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>“<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa">Predictoor Data Farming</a>” is a new Ocean incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via 37.5K OCEAN + 100K ROSE (≈$27K USD) in weekly extra sales to Predictoor data feeds [1]. This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF67 is live today, Dec 7. It concludes on Dec 14. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF67  Section 5: Challenge DF&nbsp;Ends   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF67 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.

What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Challenge DF&nbsp;Ends <p>DF66 was the final round for Challenge DF.</p><p>Starting now in DF67, the 1000 OCEAN/week is redistributed equally to Volume DF and Predictoor DF.</p><p>The Active DF budget is 37.5K / 37.5K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor DF respectively.</p><p>For more information, please read the announcement <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#d8d5">here</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Since the first Townhall in March this year, we have achieved milestones and have been at the forefront of innovation to implement various features on the mainnet. In this Townhall, we will discuss where Aergo is at the moment, and update you on the changes and progress made over the past&nbsp;months.</p><p><a href="https://voting.aergo.io/gov_voting/c051c6fe0a0de95c95a71eee3f3be4d041fb77593126652fbdde0d7310e8b7d3">1. #AIP-16</a></p>  Proposed by one of the community members, #AIP-16 aims to implement a redenomination plan (changing its denomination at a ratio of 10:1). The voting process began on the 1st of December, 2023, and ended on the 3rd of December. In total, 3,062,404 AERGOs participated with 11.497% voting in favor and 88.5%&nbsp;against.  <p>Even though the proposal did not garner enough votes to be implemented, the Aergo team always welcomes ideas and insights from the community as the goal of the Aergo Agora is to build a decentralized decision-making framework.</p><p>2. User Engagement and Voting Experience Enhancement</p><p>To foster better user engagement and make the vote more accessible, the Aergo team will improve the overall decentralized decision-making experience by (1)introducing an in-app native staking and voting feature on Aergo Connect, (2)improving the voting mechanism and user interface to make voting more intuitive and to increase participation.</p><p>By implementing these measures, the Aergo team aims to create an engaging, user-friendly, and secure environment for decentralized decision-making, ensuring that the community plays an active role in shaping the future of the platform.</p><p>More details will be released on the official channels.</p><p>3. Public Ecosystem Expansion Initiative</p><p>Starting with the forthcoming 2.5.0 release, Aergo will shift gears to expand its focus on interoperability with public blockchain ecosystems with incremental support for Web3.js, Metamask Snaps, and of course, the Ethereum Virtual&nbsp;Machine.</p><p>All of the features will allow developers to build decentralized applications that can interact with the various blockchain networks while benefiting from Aergo’s hybrid blockchain architecture.</p><blockquote>Dapp developers are an integral part of a blockchain ecosystem. The importance of the language to compose smart contracts cannot be overstated as it is THE factor determining the success of developer onboarding. By allowing developers to build smart contracts in any language that can be compiled into WebAssembly bytecode via our own WebAssembly (WASM) Virtual Machine (VM), we will broaden the range of developers who can join the ecosystem.</blockquote><p>In summary, Aergo will support multiple programming languages for smart contract development to enhance the inclusivity, flexibility, and overall developer experience within the Aergo ecosystem. This approach will help us attract a broader community of developers, ultimately contributing to the success and vibrancy of the Aergo platform.</p><p>The Aergo team is also in communication with the major crypto exchanges to expand the Aergo mainnet support and Aergo-based assets.</p><p>More details can be found on our <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-2-0-a-decentralized-infrastructure-for-web3-4c1e63b597d">Aergo 2.0 WHITEPAPER</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-2023-24-roadmap-f980a5d935e5">the 2023–24&nbsp;roadmap</a>.</p><p>4.

<p>In a world inhabited by a multiplicity of truths, how may we develop mechanisms to orient positively therein?&nbsp;</p><p>This article explores knowledge graphs as a tool for sensemaking and epistemic pluralism. Data is not neutral. It is contextual — collected under particular conditions, by particular people. And when we gather data together and attempt to make sense of it, we add meaning to it to produce an insight. Insights can then be repackaged as new data points within a layered graph. Rather than seeing these insights and data points as neutral fact, we explore the way that knowledge is a diverse field, with overlapping interpretations. By building tools that let us see these divergences and track their origins, we believe that we can better enable community and society level sensemaking.</p> Making Sense of Contextual Data <p>Raw data points alone are meaningless without interpretation. They exist as inert quantifications exerting only the direct geometries of their measurements and have no further relation to reality. The quantity of lead particulates in public water systems alone is insufficient to derive meaningful action. First, we must also understand that lead particulates are dangerous to humans when consumed and that humans are dependent on public water systems to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>Insights — defined for this post as artefacts of knowledge — are always in relationship to an ontology; they exist within a framework for sensemaking reality. Thus data points and their descendant insights can be divergent across ontological frameworks. The challenge then — for us as a collective species interdependent with the natural world — is to develop a system within which we can make decisions that benefit us as a whole and enable us to cohere towards some common goal, despite our differing opinions, interpretations, agendas, and means of engaging reality. What is more, we must be able to transcend a mono-ontology to truly understand the complexities in the hearts and minds of the entities that inhabit Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>It is the composition of measurements into published, opinionated claims that thread the fabric of a ‘knowledge topology’ upon a distributed library of available data.</p> Gesturing Towards Pluralistic Knowledge&nbsp; <p>Recognizing the pivotal role of cogent insights in informed decision-making, it becomes imperative to establish a system that can both acknowledge and effectively evaluate a diverse array of perspectives, especially when they range from congruent to starkly divergent. This necessity stems from an understanding that our collective perception of the world is inherently pluralistic, encompassing a spectrum of contexts and ontological frameworks where multiple rich contexts and ontologies need to be able to coexist and organise towards a future that is inclusive, yet coherent, interdependent, self-aware, and common enough such that we can avoid undesirable internecine interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>It is here that a set of tooling in support of a healthy, composable and pluralistic Data Commons is described, or more accurately, a set of tooling to enable data commoning! This tooling extends the distributed data storage, query, and analysis modules described in part one of this blog series.&nbsp;</p> Adapting our collective lens for knowledge <p>The authors do not intend to describe a specific implementation. Rather, this post serves as an investigation into praxes of pluralism and knowledge integration. The exact form of these praxes codified into a product are not the focus of this enquiry, and rather we wish to draw attention to the dynamics this tool may embody.&nbsp;</p><p>While modern science boasts remarkable capabilities in accurately measuring various aspects of our world, this informational chapter of the Anthropocene has repeatedly shown that absolute truth is elusive. This observation does not undermine the pursuit of objectivity in our understanding of reality. Instead, it highlights that the perspectives that shape our collective cultural narrative are diverse and often lead to substantial variations in our conceptual models of reality. This diversity underscores the importance of acknowledging and designing an effective lens for the plurality of views when engaging in our collective quest for knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Consider the following diagrams, where two polar (and very generic) ontologies are described. The authors do not intend to provide an argument for either ontology, but rather give them by way of example. The first is a theistic epistemology, the second is an atheistic epistemology. The nodes in both diagrams are shared data points. The highlighted edges represent the structural relationships between the nodes for each epistemology. The semi-opaque edges represent an opposing ontology and have been rendered for the purpose of demonstrating the pluralism that is the thesis of this post.&nbsp;	</p>Figure 1: A subgraph of the global knowledge graph where the highlighted edges defined by the community determine the structure of their theistic ontology.Figure 2: A subgraph of the global knowledge graph where the highlighted edges defined by the community determine the structure of their atheistic ontology.<p>In the above two diagrams, four configurable ‘insights’ are represented by very simplified nouns. Further, the use of simplified concepts such as God, Humans, Big Bang and All Life are intended to represent more complex composable insights and have been selected for their capacity to demonstrate how the epistemological topology of a community can vary despite using the same nodes. Specifically, it is the relationships between the nodes — their relative structure — that determines their framing and ultimately their meaning within a system of knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the above illustrations is to demonstrate that even with some shared understanding of a set of data points (where both ontologies acknowledge the existence of “humans”), it is the relationship of these data points to other data points that define their ontological framing.</p> Epistemic Pluralism and Peer-Based Graph Structures <p>Software can act as a bridge connecting us to — and mediating our interactions with — the physical world. It can also oversimplify and potentially degrade our experience of reality. This dichotomy underlines the importance of our mission: to design technological solutions that enrich, rather than diminish, our engagement with the world. Our aim is to ensure that these technological interventions augment our understanding of reality, maintaining its depth and complexity in a way that unlocks the rich and existing knowledge mappings that percolate in our brains, epigenetics, culture, and shared interpersonal space.&nbsp;</p><p>With the above framing in mind, we can begin to gesture towards a pluralistic knowledge graph of insights; a multiplicity of complex claims with directed links (references) to the datasets upon which the claims are based.&nbsp;</p><p>Enabling pluralism within a tool for knowledge is non-trivial. The challenge is to determine and promote synthesis and coherence across an agent-centric knowledge mapping tool.&nbsp;</p><p>The reader is encouraged to imagine a graph-builder of sorts, where participants provide insights via some medium as nodes in a graph. These publications will bear some epistemic relationship to other publications. They may be direct responses, endorsements, or rebuttals but they may also have less explicit relationships such as semantic similarity or geopolitical proximity. It is this metadata, the edges of the graph or in other words its relational structure, that represent the social relations through which we have collectively archived and evolved our various cultures for millennia.&nbsp;</p> Designing for Protocols &gt; Platforms&nbsp; <p>This blog post does not delve into the specific design or user experience (UX) of the proposed tool. Instead, our focus is to conceptualize its potential functionalities, particularly when implemented as a protocol for safely sharing data and insights across software ecosystems. We envision it as a flexible module or wrapper, designed for integration by other developers, rather than as a standalone platform. This approach considers an inter-platform collaborative model. A key aspect of this model is the 'safe answers' concept as examined in part one of this blog series, which negates the need for centralized server access to raw data. Instead, it enables communities to retain custodianship over their data, allowing external organizations to send localized algorithms to peer networks. These algorithms can then query data, with granular control over the opacity of the data being used for computation. This means that the return of the algorithm can optionally expose the raw data it is using, or provide some ‘insight’ pertaining to the data. For example, a security camera may expose to a querying party the amount of people who walked past the camera, and not the identity/profile of the individuals walking past. This method fosters a decentralized and secure approach to data analysis and sharing.&nbsp;</p> Finding Integration in Pluralism <p>While there is something just and encouraging about an ecosystem aimed at mapping the pluralistic epistemics that percolate throughout the world, there are also risks therein. What is important is that we avoid a set of disintegrated ‘knowledge’ feedback loops, echo chambers, where those embroiled in misguided or harmful informational clusters are never exposed to counter-arguments or differing schools of thought. It is important that we identify mechanisms through which to measure how coherently any given network’s graph of knowledge integrates with the other graphs in the ecosystem. To achieve this, we endeavour to draw from Integrated Information Theory (IIT).&nbsp;</p><p>IIT, initially formulated to describe consciousness, posits that a system possesses consciousness to the degree it possesses 'Phi' (Φ) — a measure of its intrinsic cause-effect power. It is a system's ability to integrate and differentiate information. Adapting this to our knowledge graph setting, we can interpret 'Phi' as a measure of the extent to which knowledge from one epistemological network is both differentiated from and integrated with another. The higher the Φ, the more integrated (and thus potentially coherent) the knowledge graph is with the broader knowledge ecosystem.</p><p>In practice, Φ along with more traditional graph analysis techniques may be used to reveal areas where connectivity can be enhanced, subsequently tuning search and discovery algorithms. This is crucial in a world increasingly fragmented by differing worldviews, as it enables us to identify points of convergence and divergence across knowledge systems. By analogizing Φ in IIT to the integration of knowledge across different epistemic frameworks, we establish a quantitative measure and orienting function to shift the knowledge network toward greater coherence.</p><p>Just as IIT posits that conscious experience arises from the integration of differentiated information within the brain, we posit that a coherent and functional knowledge ecosystem could emerge from the integration of differentiated insights across various epistemological networks. We suggest that a healthy knowledge graph, like a biological mind, is not just a repository of information, but a dynamic, integrated network capable of evolving and adapting to its environment.&nbsp;</p> Embracing the Dynamics of Knowledge Integration <p>The journey through the realms of data, insights, and knowledge graphs has elucidated the intricate and dynamic nature of knowledge itself. We believe that the concept of a pluralistic data commons, as explored in this article, is not just a theoretical framework but a necessary evolution in our approach to understanding and navigating the complex tapestry of global information. The notion of knowledge as a static, singular entity is a relic of the past. Today, we are called upon to recognize the fluidity and multiplicity of knowledge, shaped by diverse perspectives and evolving contexts.</p><p>This blog post describes praxes for knowledge mapping in a manner that aims to embrace epistemic pluralism, and resists the idea that we as a species can arrive at a positive orientation through a homogenised narrative. Rather, we believe that it is in the intersection of a diversity of narratives that we may come to a model of integrated knowledge. These praxes are important when considering the applications that may sit above the distributed storage layer we described in our first blog post. It is insufficient to merely ‘capture’ data. Data requires contextualisation and application, and it is in these later steps that the capacities and implications of the data becomes apparent. Here we must ensure that our endeavours to synthesise and unpack data are done in an inclusive and life-centric manner, and thus it is important that the communities using the distributed storage tool have the means to find the degree of integration in the knowledge artefacts derived from a given set of data.&nbsp;</p><p>The notion of measuring the integration of knowledge, borrowing from Integrated Information Theory, offers a promising path forward. It allows us to quantify and visualize the interplay of different knowledge systems, identifying points of convergence and divergence. This, in turn, can guide efforts to enhance connectivity and coherence within the global knowledge ecosystem. Such an approach recognizes that the health of our collective understanding is not just in the accumulation of data or insights, but in the integration and harmonious interplay of diverse epistemologies.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of this endeavor will depend on our collective willingness to engage with and evolve differing viewpoints, to challenge our own assumptions, and to remain open to the evolving nature of truth. The creation of these knowledge ecosystems is not just a technical endeavour but a cultural and intellectual one, requiring ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and a shared commitment to exploring the multifaceted nature of reality. As we forge ahead, let us embrace this complexity, not as a hindrance, but as a rich tapestry of human experience and wisdom, from which we can all learn and grow.</p>

 The travel and mobility industries have been anything but stationary over the last year. As we move toward 2024, let us look back at 2023 to reflect on changes and predictions that will drive these industries into the future.&nbsp; 



 



<p>Mobility and travel are industries on the move, literally. Individuals from all walks of life have an almost daily need to get from point A to point B. Our needs, our finances,&nbsp;our environments and even our <a href="https://brilliantio.com/how-does-culture-affect-travel-and-tourism/">culture dictate how we move</a> in our lives, and as times change so we must follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People are traveling more frequently than ever, the only difference is how they are traveling. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/features/mckinsey-center-for-future-mobility/our-insights/european-mobility-finance-a-25-billion-euro-growth-opportunity">McKinsey is seeing developments</a> in full-service leasing, new-car subscriptions and financing for used cars as potential core mobility-finance markets by 2030. Furthermore, micromobility will continue to grow and contribute 5% of total revenue in 2030 compared to 1% in 2023. An additional niche area which will see some growth beyond 2030 is electric vehicle charging infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As consumers are delighted about the variety of mobility trends on the horizon, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-mobility-evolves">respondents from a McKinsey survey</a> found that almost one-third plan to up their use of micromobility over the next decade and 46% have already switched to more sustainable modes of travel with an interest in shared autonomous vehicles. But whatever the mode of transport, safety is key, and the increased need for identity verification has become clear along with the desire of growing digital services.&nbsp;</p>



 Wheels of regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The travel and mobility industries have seen some exciting developments and steps forward this year, thanks largely to the increased adoption and implementation of identity verification solutions across the entire user journey. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, 2023 could also be characterized by a series of significant stops-and-starts. The most pivotal event in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility industry</a> occurred in September when, following an overwhelming vote to ban e-scooters in Paris, the French capital was cleared of the vehicles overnight. The main reason for the ban was safety concerns, following a streak of accidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This set the wheel in motion for the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">strengthening of micromobility regulation</a> in different cities around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Right now, the market can be <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/electric-kickscooters-have-come-of-age-regulators-have-taken-notice">split into four types of cities</a> ranging from unregulated, where e-scooters can be implemented without any limitation or regulation, to complete bans, where e-scooters are not allowed, such as in Paris” stated Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility and Travel Sales Director at IDnow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two regulatory archetypes, in-between no regulation and complete ban, carry certain stipulations such as an age verification process, speed limits, restricted numbers of operators and areas in which to park.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ramifications of the Paris ban are likely to be felt for the next few years as each country and city decides its stance on micromobility. Opponents to the ban argue that it was a step back for sustainable transport, and that there are benefits to embracing a clear micromobility strategy that includes faster, more convenient, eco-friendly forms of transport that can help reduce urban congestion, and offer transport options to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other changes likely to affect mobility in 2024 include ongoing digital transformation efforts, across every step of the user journey highlighting this need for progress.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Processes remain old school in car rental agencies who are now facing strong competition from fully digital car rental companies, so digitalization will play a major part in the development of the car rental space.</p>Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility and Travel Sales Director at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Consolidation will also play a role in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/mobility-report/">future of mobility</a>. “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) will become key</a>, as it will provide a new way to plan a full trip [whether bus, train, e-scooter, e-moped, bike, car or taxi] from one platform and one user experience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Traveling digital.&nbsp; 



<p>When reflecting on 2023, it didn’t come as much of a surprise to Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Travel &amp; Mobility at IDnow that, much like mobility, digitalization within the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel industry</a> played such an important role.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Covid acted as a wakeup call that there was an urgent need for digital services in the travel and mobility sectors, and that the travel industry, in general, had been very lax in dealing with these topics for decades.</p>Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Travel &amp; Mobility at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Michael explains that the major challenge facing the sector is that there is “a shortage of skilled workers and increasing customer expectations on the one hand, and low margins, rising inflation and conservative strategies on the other. Digitalization should be driven forward more rapidly, but most travel and hospitality companies still behave hesitantly and adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the digital skepticism of some travel and hospitality companies, Michael has no doubt that digitalization in every area of the tourism value chain, and user journey, will continue to be the driving force for hotels, airlines and other travel businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">Seamless travel, digital check-in processes and digital identities</a> are hot topics that will simplify travel experience in the short and long-term. It is an ongoing process and courageous companies that prioritize digital projects and implement them ASAP will be able to gain a market advantage and be more successful in the future. Plus, IDnow will be there to support them.”&nbsp;</p>

 A side of hospitality.&nbsp; 



<p>Along with mobility and travel comes their partner, hospitality. Where would travel be without hospitality to lend a hand? Due to the increase in travel, hotels and rental companies are back to business but with a few more challenges on their plate. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Many hospitality businesses have seen a surge in fraudulent attacks in recent years. Coming in a variety of different forms, the most significant include loyalty card programs which fraudsters have developed a liking for and is <a href="https://www.cybersource.com/en-us/blog/2020/loyalty-fraud-how-real-is-the-threat.html">projected to reach a market value at over $11 billion by 2025</a>, as well as the ever-present credit card fraud which the airline industry is also heavily impacted&nbsp;by&nbsp;with <a href="https://chargebacks911.com/travel-forecast-2023/">IATA totaling the loss for airlines at $1 billion a year</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraud is everywhere, no matter the industry. Unfortunately, hospitality is feeling the effects due to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-protect-owners-guests-holiday-rental-scams/">lack of protection and high turnover rate compared to other industries</a>. And it isn’t just a loss in revenue but also reputation. Luckily, thanks to identity verification, chargeback and credit card fraud can be minimized, improving security of both the hotel and the guest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/optimizing-the-online-travel-booking-experience/">from reservation</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/leveraging-digital-check-ins-hotel-operations/">check-in</a> to payment. &nbsp;</p>



 



 

 



 To the reusable future.&nbsp; 



<p>As the travel and mobility industries take stock of 2023 and look to the coming year, digitalization will play an ever-increasing role, especially through the use of reusable digital identities. While they can be applied in almost every industry, reusable digital identities are already taking off&nbsp;within the travel sector where airlines and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have already showcased their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/iata-first-integrated-journey-digital-identity/">Proof of Concept – End to End Digital Identity initiative</a> near the end of 2023 in collaboration with IDnow. With such developments arising in travel, digital identities (travel credentials, boarding passes, visas, etc.) will be stored in digital wallets, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a>, ready-to-use within seconds making the future of travel much more pleasant and stress-free. The possibilities of tomorrow are only a [digital] wallet away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It's the night before election day when most of the ballots come in.</p><p>You get a call in the middle of the night, and it's the head of your campaign. There seems to be a fake story about you spreading like wildfire that has come out of nowhere. What's worse is that there’s also a video of you confirming and apologizing for the fake allegations spreading alongside, coming from a verified account with a name spelled in a way that looks visually identical to yours! Your campaign manager has already started damage control. You know that this will be disproven, as the allegations are obviously false. But the election is tomorrow– is there enough time? If only people could see that that apology video is fake and didn't come from your campaign. Your campaign manager asks: how should we move forward?</p><p>Enter a world with content authenticity…</p><p>In a world driven by content authenticity, there is a verifiable way to prove any content's author. In the campaign example, you would have set up a system where you registered digital credentials, including your mobile driver’s license, .gov email, and a state credential that includes your current title to create a verifiable online digital identity.&nbsp;</p><p>Every message, video, and post by the campaign has a small reference with it that can be retrieved and verified by platforms, allowing them to give you a special verification symbol with all of your content. Anyone can check this verification and pull down the original content you posted. Social media platforms would instantly make it clear that the apology video didn't come from your campaign. This fake story is still out there, but its power is diminished.</p> An Introduction to Content Authenticity <p>Throughout time, the ways in which we’ve encountered news and information in the media have shifted dramatically. With the proliferation of AI, social media platforms, and influencers, it’s become a challenge to weed out the truth from misinformation. Not being able to verify the legitimacy of content is problematic, especially when it comes to political news or government information, as portrayed in the example above.</p><p>Multiple organizations are currently working on tech approaches to solve this problem by adding a layer of trust and verification to the content we consume. This layer of trust and verification added to content is called content authenticity. At our core, SpruceID’s mission is to let users control their identity and personal data across the web in a way that facilitates trusted interactions. As a result, contributing to the future of content authenticity, powered by trusted digital identity, is important to us.</p> The Rise of Digital Content, Platforms and Publishers <p>From relying on a few major news providers to the rise of citizen “journalism” on social media platforms—the internet has made it easier than ever for anyone to have a global reach. With this new power, it becomes more challenging for information consumers to differentiate what is real from what is fake.</p><p>To combat this, platforms have traditionally used verification of notable figures. Tools like the Twitter Blue Checkmark or the Verified Badge on Instagram give users a clear way to know who to trust. However, there have proven to be issues with this approach, including platform risk (as seen with Twitter’s recent changes to verification), bias and discrimination (such as a political campaign being unable to make verifiable statements due to their political opinion), and legitimization of harmful entities if someone can game the verification system to post with authority. These platforms also have the power to allow verified posts to look different and appear more frequently. By modifying their platform, they can increase or decrease trust in “verified” content with their audience.</p><p>Currently, these platforms have to design and build their own verification systems, and they are not interoperable with one another. There isn’t a clear way to say that the identity of “The New York Times” on Facebook is the same as that on Twitter (besides the recognition of that entity’s name). These platforms have, in part, understood their responsibility to inform people of what can and cannot be trusted. They have done so with different approaches, including <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/about/introduction?ref=blog.spruceid.com">community notes</a> on Twitter and fact-checking on Facebook.</p> Approaching Solutions&nbsp; <p>Today, we’ve begun to see political figures address the danger of deepfakes and the need for a solution to AI-generated content. On October 30th, 2023, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_JLkU5xF2Y&amp;t=3s&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">President Joe Biden spoke out</a> about signing an executive order on artificial intelligence, which is the first of its kind for the U.S. Government. He stated:</p><p>“With AI, fraudsters can take a 3-second recording of your voice can generate an impersonation good enough to fool you; it’s mindblowing…I said, ‘when the hell did I say that?’”</p><p>With an open <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">executive order</a> calling for technology to solve this problem of verifying who is saying what, this currently remains a pressing issue. We believe that one way to approach this issue is by introducing a way to verify who posted what content by tying said content to the poster’s verifiable identity using digital credentials.</p> SpruceID Proof of Concept <p>In order to demonstrate a potential solution for content authenticity, we created a proof-of-concept using our SpruceKit open-source libraries. We recently presented this proof-of-concept in Washington D.C. at <a href="https://dcfintechweek.org/agenda-2023-2/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">D.C. Fintech Week</a> to show what a solution could hypothetically look like. Here, we’ll break down the technology in our proof-of-concept and describe how these tools can be used to verify content and build trust across all platforms.</p> Key SpruceKit Components for Content Authenticity <p>This proof of concept uses the following technologies we’ve developed as part of SpruceKit, our open-source libraries. We will reference these tools in our walkthrough below:</p><p>SpruceID Libraries used in this demo:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rebase</a> is a tool that allows you to run a credential issuer. Rebase lets you run a witness that can programmatically examine multiple proofs from someone requesting a credential, verify those proofs, and then issue a credential.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Kepler</a> is a data storage system where you permission who has access to this data with your Ethereum keys. You sign in with your Ethereum keys, and that signature permits the app you are using to access and store data.</p><p>Other technologies used:</p><p><a href="https://attest.sh/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Attestation Service</a> is an infrastructure for making attestations on or off of a blockchain about anything. We use it as a place to make attestations.</p><p><a href="https://base.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Base</a> is the blockchain we are using for this demo. It allows for low-cost attestations (100s of attestations per dollar). Someone must pay this fee for a transaction to be posted as a public blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://web3.storage/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">web3.storage</a> are tools we use to store and retrieve data verifiably. IPFS summarizes the file into a Content ID, which can then be used to retrieve that file. It does this in a way so that it’s verifiable that the file you upload is the file you retrieve. We use web3.storage as an easy way to interact with the IPFS network.</p> Content Authenticity in Action <p>In this walkthrough, we’ll break down how to both create and verify Content Authenticity claims in order to make a statement or claim and then “stamp” that claim (with a high assurance credential such as a mobile driver’s license or a .gov email) so that your audience can be confident that it was you who made it.</p> 1) Account Setup and Adding Credentials <p>When you land on the Content Authenticity page, you can either create a Content Authenticity claim or verify one. First, let’s create a claim.</p> <p>To create a Content Authenticity claim, you will first need to sign in. We use Sign-in with Ethereum to connect to Kepler in order to store and retrieve data associated with our account. This data includes the credentials we have and any files we have uploaded.</p> <p>If this is your first time interacting with your account, you’ll need to create a data vault with Kepler (our data storage system). This second signature request creates a place where your data is stored.</p> <p>If you have no credentials, you can easily create them. Our Rebase issuer powers the process of creating credentials. To create a credential, select “issue first credential,” and you’ll be taken to the following page.</p> <p>From here, we'll choose the Email credential.</p> <p>In the process of adding a credential, you prove two things: </p><p>1) you are in control of the keys you want to associate with the email </p><p>2) You control the email you want to associate with the keys. </p><p>If both of these are verified by the witness, then it will issue you a credential. Going through the steps here proves these things to the witness. In step 1, you say what email you’ll be using. Step 2 prompts you to sign a message with the email and Ethereum public key in it. This message and signature are cryptographically verifiable, and the witness checks that. Lastly, you are sent an email with a unique challenge to the email provided. If you have control of this email account, you can respond to the challenge correctly. Providing this proves access to the email. Once proven, the witness will issue you a credential that says your email is the same as your Ethereum public key. This credential is an important pillar in our content authenticity solution, as it anchors the cryptographic signer to other identities.</p> <p>Once they are added, any credentials you have, such as your Twitter handle, email address, etc. will be displayed under the Credential section below.</p><p>In this example, the issuer is the Spruce Rebase Demo Witness, but there can be many other credential issuers, including your organization, your government, or a club you are a part of. These credential issuers may have other requirements besides the simple proofs to issue an email credential. Our demo trusts credentials issued by the Spruce Rebase Demo Witness, but ultimately, a user may have different trust models, such as trusting an issuing key that belongs to the New York Times or the California DMV.</p> 2) Upload Your Content <p>Upload a file to IPFS and get its content identifier to accompany your claim. This identifier is both a cryptographic hash of the content and a way to retrieve the content from the IPFS network. Anything uploaded is public and irreversible.</p> <p>Select the file, and then you can make claims about that content.</p>  3) Make a Claim About Your Content <p>Once you have your credentials and have uploaded the content you want to make a claim about, you can use this tool to make those claims!</p> <p>First, select the credentials you want to use in order to make a claim. I’ll select my GitHub and email accounts.</p> <p>Then, you select the file you want to make a claim about.</p> <p>This flow supports <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Content Credentials</a>, an effort by the <a href="https://c2pa.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</a> to develop technical standards for certifying media content's source and history (or provenance). Some <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/leica-launches-worlds-first-camera-with-content-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">hardware</a> and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/content-credentials.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">software</a> support content credentials, which prove the source and modifications to an image. You can export those and add them as part of this optional step. Depending on the use case, having that cryptographic verification of where an image came from is just as necessary as who is posting it.</p> <p>The uploader can add additional claims you want to make regarding the image. This example demonstrates making a claim about the SpruceID logo.</p> <p>Review and submit the transaction to the blockchain. This page lets you preview the data and submit it to the blockchain. You can go back and fix any errors. Once it’s submitted, it can never be undone. It will be public and permanent.</p><p></p> 4) Verifying a Claim <p>You'll be sent to the verification page once a content authenticity claim has been posted. This page is the public page that others see when examining this content. </p> <p>This page verifies the data and includes cryptographic checks about the credentials, the issuer of those credentials, and the identity of the poster of the claim to ensure they all add up. It also retrieves and displays the content so you can see the content about which a claim was made.</p> Watch a Demo <p>This demo walks you through the same steps above to recap how one would create and verify content authenticity claims.</p> What’s next for Content Authenticity? <p>From the increasing need for solving content trust and verification to our hypothetical example of how this problem could be addressed today, it’s difficult to say exactly how the world will tackle this complex problem. SpruceID has the knowledge and expertise to help tie provable high-assurance identity attributes (such as a mobile driver’s license) into content that is put out to the public in order to elevate the level of trust in the person or entity making the statement. Empowering users to control their identity and personal data across the web is woven into our DNA. We’re excited to share this proof-of-concept to help shape a future with trusted identity and interactions online.</p> <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/digital-identity-now-and-future/digital-identity-today?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More about Digital Identity</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in November 2023, we <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">announced</a> the auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies to automatically protect tenants based on risk signals, licensing, and usage. This is to remind you that Microsoft will begin automatically protecting customers with Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies. These are policies that Microsoft creates and enables in customer tenants. The following policies will be rolled out to all eligible tenants:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Policy&nbsp;</p>


<p>Who it’s for&nbsp;</p>


<p>What it does&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for admin portals&nbsp;</p>


<p>All customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers privileged admin roles and requires multifactor authentication when an admin signs into a Microsoft admin portal.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users&nbsp;</p>


<p>Existing per-user multifactor authentication customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy applies to users with per-user multifactor authentication and requires multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It helps organizations transition to Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for high-risk sign-ins&nbsp;</p>


<p>Microsoft Entra ID Premium Plan 2 customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers all users and requires multifactor authentication and reauthentication during high-risk sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll begin a gradual rollout of these policies to all eligible tenants and notify in advance. Once the policies are visible in your tenant, you’ll have 90 days to review and customize or disable them before we turn them on. For those 90 days, the policies will be in report-only mode, which means Conditional Access will log the policy results without enforcing them. For more information refer to the blog, “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.”  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update on Azure AD Graph Retirement&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June of 2023, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> that described the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will be done with incremental steps. We’re committed to supporting our customers through this retirement and migration to Microsoft Graph, and we’re committed to increased transparency and communication as we work through this change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Retirement: Stage One &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first stage of Azure AD Graph retirement will begin later in 2024. We’ll share a specific date in a subsequent update, with a minimum of three months of advance notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we enter this first stage, applications that are created after a specific date will encounter an error for requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net/">https://graph.windows.net</a>). We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph at this point, and we’ll provide an optional configuration to allow applications created after this point to resume use of Azure AD Graph APIs for an extended period. If you develop or distribute software that requires applications to be created as part of the installation or setup, and these applications will need to access Azure AD Graph APIs, you must begin planning to avoid interruption. This optional configuration can be set on an application after it is created, and the configuration change will be done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll provide more detailed guidance on the timeline for this plan and on configuring the optional configuration in our next update.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I find Applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs? &nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re working to deliver a new experience to help our customers identify applications in their tenant that are using Azure AD Graph APIs. This will be enabled through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-use-recommendations">Microsoft Entra Recommendations</a> experience. We’re expecting to enable this experience in the first months of 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to audit logs behavior for custom security attributes&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning in October 2023, changes were made to custom security attribute audit logs for general availability that might impact your daily operations. If you’ve been using custom security attribute audit logs during the preview, here are the actions you must take before February 2024 to ensure your audit log operations aren't disrupted:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Use new audit logs location.&nbsp; 
 Assign Attribute Log roles to view audit logs. &nbsp; 
 Create new diagnostic settings to export audit logs.&nbsp;

<p>Changing sign-in audience for new applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will change the default value of 'signInAudience' property in app registration from 'AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount' to 'AzureADMyOrg'. Our analysis shows that most new applications do not ever support users outside the application tenant. This will improve latency and security of apps. For more information on application sign-in audience, refer to the documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0#signinaudience-values">application resource type - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling app instance lock by default&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will have “App instance lock” enabled by default. The capability called App instance lock for workload identities was launched in September 2023. This feature allows app developers to protect their multi-tenant apps from attackers tampering with critical properties. Applications created using Entra ID portal already have the setting enabled by default, and going forward, it will be enabled for other app creation surface areas such as MS Graph, PowerShell, and SDKs. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-configure-app-instance-property-locks">How to configure app instance property lock in your applications | Microsoft Learn</a>.  &nbsp;</p>

<p>My Account is replacing legacy profile page&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-new-feature-and-change-announcements/ba-p/3796396">announced</a> the legacy profile page will be replaced with a new, modernized experience.

<p>Last week, we talked about <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">the risks that come with granting OAuth tokens without restraint</a> across your organization and mentioned two ways to manage this process:</p>
 
 You can periodically check your Google admin console to see what permissions are authorized and manually revoke access where needed.&nbsp; 
 Or you can also easily track this information with YeshID.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of access to your Google Workspace, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions granted to third-party applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And today, we’re making it even easier to gather those insights and take immediate action with new data visualization capabilities in YeshID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s explore how data visualization can play a pivotal role in mitigating risks like data exposure and unintentional oversharing of permissions. We’ll introduce you to our new visualization tool along the way.&nbsp;</p>
 Our risk representation of OAuth scopes&nbsp; 
<p>Humans are really good at pattern recognition, and seeing things drawn or color-coded can help us quickly grasp a concept. In this case, we can use data visualization to provide a granular representation of OAuth scopes (the permissions granted to applications), breaking them down into easily digestible components and allowing you to pinpoint areas of high risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This clarity enables informed decision-making when it comes to understanding exposure from connected applications and adjusting permissions to align with organizational security policies. YeshID’s data visualization breaks OAuth scopes into a digestible color-coded graph so you can easily pinpoint areas of risk. We use <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/sensitive-scope-verification">Google’s sensitive/restricted scope classification system</a> to categorize granted scopes on a green, yellow, red basis. Find an anomaly? We also make it easy to revoke or block access.</p>
 Not just a pretty picture 
<p>Once you have an idea of what looks suspicious, YeshID makes it easy to act with options to revoke, block, or manage applications.</p>
 
 Revoking a third-party application’s access essentially invalidates the access that your users have granted to an application. However, this is temporary and your user could grant permissions again. We allow you to mark it as ‘Forbidden,’ and we will highlight it if access has been regranted. 
 Blocking an OAuth token goes a step further by preventing the associated application from requesting access to the user’s Google Workspace data altogether — a cumbersome process <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en">when done through the Admin Console</a>. 
 
<p>Here it is in action.</p>
<p></p>
 Try YeshID now 
<p>Data visualization within YeshID transforms the complexity of app access management into a visual narrative that’s easier to grasp at a glance. By harnessing the power of visualizations, you can navigate the challenges of OAuth tokens, enhance security measures, and foster a culture of awareness and responsibility among users. <a href="https://yeshid.com/visualization/">Learn more</a>.</p>

  FATF Travel Rule in UAE applies to virtual asset transfers above AED&nbsp;3,500.  VASPs must report sender and recipient details, including names and addresses, for each Travel Rule crypto transaction.  UAE’s AML framework requires strict KYC checks, risk management, and regular monitoring.  <p>In the fast-evolving landscape of global finance, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has emerged as a magnet hub, attracting worldwide interest and capital. Particularly in the realm of Web3, where it’s not just participating but leading the charge. The UAE is setting benchmarks with regulatory frameworks for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), DAOs, metaverses, and other entities pivotal to crypto innovation.</p><p>As the adoption of virtual assets escalates in the UAE, the country moves towards more stringent compliance, in line with local regulations and FATF (Financial Action Task Force) Travel Rule and other recommendations.</p><p>To understand the intricacies of the UAE crypto regulatory environment, we start with <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">the FATF Travel Rule</a> and further explore the nuances of KYC and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML compliance</a> in the&nbsp;UAE.</p> The Travel Rule in the&nbsp;UAE <p>Crafted by the FATF — an international body shaping policies to safeguard the financial system from illicit activities — the Travel Rule aims to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. It requires VASPs and financial institutions to collect and report detailed information for virtual asset transfers. The threshold amount at which the FATF Travel Rule kicks in the UAE is AED&nbsp;3,500.</p><p>Key data points for compliance include:</p>  Sender’s and recipient’s names, addresses, and account or wallet&nbsp;details.  Transaction amounts.  <p>The responsibility lies with the originating VASP to share this information with the beneficiary VASP at the start of the transfer. Thus ensuring each virtual asset movement is accompanied by comprehensive originator and beneficiary data.</p> AML Compliance in the UAE: A Broad Perspective <p>To combat financial crimes, the UAE has rolled out a suite of anti money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations supported by detailed guidelines from various supervisory authorities. These encompass banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, VASPs, and Designated Non-financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs) like real estate agents, auditors, and precious metal&nbsp;dealers.</p><p>Essential elements of the UAE’s AML policies&nbsp;include:</p>  Stringent KYC&nbsp;checks.  Risk screening solutions.  Diligent record-keeping and reporting.  Robust compliance governance.  Appointment of an AML compliance officer.   The Central Bank of the UAE at the&nbsp;Helm <p>The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) serves as the primary financial regulator, overseeing AML compliance. In 2020, it established the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism Supervision Department (AMLD), dedicated to AML and CFT matters and previously managed by the Banking Supervision Department.</p><p>The AMLD’s mission is threefold:</p>  Inspect licensed&nbsp;firms.  Ensure compliance with the country’s AML regulations.  Identify emerging AML/CFT&nbsp;threats.  Collaborating with the UAE cabinet and international bodies to play a vital role in developing AML/CFT legislation and issuing compliance guidance.   FATF AML Compliance in the&nbsp;UAE <p>Following its placement on the FATF’s grey list for strategic deficiencies in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts, the UAE has amplified its compliance initiatives. And now, after making marked progress, the UAE is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cc8f3d4f-ccb0-4bca-93e3-bc2955de446d">on course to exit the grey list</a>, as it has no “non-compliant” ratings with FATF recommendations.</p> KYC Requirements and Processes <p>In the UAE’s AML framework, having a proper <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">KYC process</a> is crucial. Businesses implement KYC procedures to authenticate parties, including potential customers and representatives, safeguarding against illicit financial activities. KYC involves thorough customer profiling, identity verification, and continuous transaction monitoring.</p> Complying With the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The UAE is at the forefront of modernizing its AML/CFT regulatory framework, incorporating digital identification and enhanced detection capabilities. Reflecting this commitment, in January 2023, <a href="https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/government-news/cbuae-issues-new-guidance-on-anti-money-laundering-and-combatting-the-financing-of-terrorism-twamugg0">the CBUAE issued new guidance</a> on using digital identification systems in AML/CFT compliance solutions. This guidance advocates the integration of digital tools for customer onboarding and verification and the use of digital data to identify suspicious activities.</p><p>In line with these regulatory enhancements, VASPs in the UAE are required to implement the FATF Travel Rule through a risk-based AML/CFT solution like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Shyft Veriscope</a>. Besides this, VASPs must also adhere to rigorous risk management and due diligence processes.</p> Risk Management and Due Diligence <p>Risk management involves implementing measures for customer identification, risk assessment, and suspicious activity monitoring and reporting, whereas due diligence is a critical process for identifying and mitigating money laundering risks posed by customers.</p> Training and Awareness <p>Ensuring compliance staff is adequately trained to handle Travel Rule transactions is essential, especially with the increasing sophistication of money laundering techniques. The AML compliance officer plays a key role, overseeing a collective effort to train and ensure all employees are equipped to identify and prevent illicit activities.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Through these efforts, the UAE is establishing itself as a trusted crypto hub, playing a significant role in shaping the future infrastructure of the crypto world. This is not only enhancing the country’s global financial standing but also aligns with its vision of leading in digital economy advancements.</p><p>Overall, by aiming to set a global benchmark in crypto industry standards, the UAE is demonstrating its commitment to creating a secure, efficient, and innovative environment for crypto transactions and developments.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>“Social media really, really helps to connect. There are so many places I’ve gone to and they already know me,” Kisakye&nbsp;says.</p><p>Kisakye is a 30-year-old budding musician in Kampala. She juggles a full-time office job with performing at restaurants and bars on the weekends and weekday evenings. She posts videos of her singing on Instagram and YouTube to promote her talent and get gigs. Kisakye’s positive experience of social media’s impact on gaining visibility and earning an income with creative work are echoed by many youths&nbsp;today.</p><p>As Kisakye’s experience highlights, digitalization is transforming the culture and creative industries. Digital platforms, like Instagram, offer young artists new ways to produce their work and reach a broader range of audiences and consumers within and beyond&nbsp;Uganda.</p><p>A shift to online markets gives creatives <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/104121621556036559/pdf/Cities-Culture-Creativity-Leveraging-Culture-and-Creativity-for-Sustainable-Urban-Development-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf">greater independence</a> from traditional intermediaries and middlemen (such as publishers or galleries), making the sector a more viable income source for talented youth. Alice, a young creative who trained as a lawyer but today runs a digital content company, shared how she started by publishing blogs&nbsp;online:</p><p>“I started with a blog on WordPress. Just writing simply for the sake of writing because I enjoyed it. Later, I started to really think about what I could do with the space and community I had created not just to provide information and entertainment but also be able to make a living for&nbsp;myself.”</p><p>As digitalization presents new avenues for income generation, young creatives like Kisaskye and Alice have more agency and confidence to chart new paths. Kisakye plans to leave her office job in the future and says social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube will be a central part of her career as a musician.</p><p>But before she quits her job, Kisakye says she needs skills that will support her music career. She wants to learn how to sing better, how to produce music, and how to use digital platforms to reach even bigger audiences. She needs more knowledge about copyright issues and protections. Kisakye is already trying to learn new skills&nbsp;online:</p><p>“I went to YouTube before I did a show and there was this lady telling us how to sing, how to create more space for your vocals. I did it and realized that I had more space to really let my voice move. And, then I realized, ‘oh my gosh, there’s so much I could&nbsp;learn.’”</p><p>Alice, who has considerable experience as a content creator, wants to learn better financial management practices:</p><p>“I think the management of finances is definitely a hard part because now you are working for yourself and you need to know how to move your money and grow it. Building long-term strategies, specifically financially, is a tool we could all&nbsp;use.”</p><p>Together, the skills Alice and Kisakye refer to are what <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou Digital </a>refers to as <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/skillsforadigitalage/">skills for a digital age,</a> a diverse set of skills that go beyond digital skills (using digital platforms, coding, or e-commerce selling) and include others like financial management, business management, project management, and communication skills. These are some of the technical, digital, and soft skills needed to thrive on digital platforms.</p><p>Kisakye, Alice, and 35 other Ugandan creatives shared their experiences as part of Caribou Digital’s research on how young people in the culture and creative industries are navigating and adapting to digitalization-driven changes, with a focus on skills, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation. They are poets, illustrators, cartoonists, performance artists, writers, podcasters, visual artists, filmmakers, fashion designers, and gamers, all between ages 18 and 35 and based in&nbsp;Kampala.</p><p>Caribou Digital conducted this research in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation under their Young Africa Works initiative, which aims to enable 30 million young Africans, 70% of whom will be women, to access dignified and fulfilling work by 2030. The Foundation views the creative industry in Africa as one of the pathways to employment for young people, particularly if they have the right&nbsp;skills.</p><p>The research includes four&nbsp;outputs:</p>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Skilling-Ugandas-young-creatives-for-a-digital-age-A-way-forward.pdf">Overall Executive summary: Skilling Uganda’s young creatives for a digital age: A way&nbsp;forward</a>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Skills-for-a-digital-age-for-Ugandas-young-creatives.pdf">Findings: Skills for a digital age for Uganda’s young creatives</a>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Skilling-Ugandas-young-creatives-for-a-digital-age-Recommendations.pdf">Skilling Uganda’s young creatives for a digital age: Recommendations</a>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ugandas-culture-and-creative-industries-in-a-digital-age-A-landscape-review.pdf">Uganda’s culture and creative industries in a digital age: A landscape review</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/ugandas-young-creatives-a-case-for-more-skills-for-a-digital-age-da0f331f2b25">Uganda’s young creatives: A case for more skills for a digital age.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Data scientists can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">run a predictoor bot</a> that submits forecasts for these tokens to Predictoor contracts, and earn&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Rewards are financed by sales of the feeds. These are (i) organic purchases by traders and others, (ii) purchases from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor Data Farming</a> OCEAN side, and (iii) rewards from Predictoor DF ROSE side, which are pro-rata to the other&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Rewards are affected&nbsp;by:</p>  Amount of sales. Sales↑ means rewards↑.  Prediction accuracy. Accuracy↑ means rewards↑.  Amount of stake. Stake↑ means potential for more reward, bounded by prediction feed sales; more on this&nbsp;later.  <p>Given all these factors, much should a predictoor stake, to maximize revenue and bound risk? The article provides some answers to that question.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an equation for payout as a function of such factors. Section 3 has formulae for upper-bound stake amounts; the models have assumptions but are helpful in practice. Section 4 provides general tips. Section 5 concludes.</p> 2. Payout&nbsp;Equation <p>For a given predictoor’s prediction: if the prediction is wrong, stake is slashed, i.e. they lose the stake. If the prediction is correct, they receive a&nbsp;payout.</p><p>Under a correct prediction, payout&nbsp;is:</p><p>The initial terms specify that the rewards are distributed only among those who predicted correctly. In order to maximize rewards, participants must not only be accurate in their predictions but also stake an amount reflecting their confidence in these predictions.</p><p>If all participants stake the same amount, rewards are equally divided among those who predicted correctly. However, if a participant makes a correct prediction but stakes less than others, their reward is smaller. Conversely, placing a high stake on an incorrect prediction results in the loss of the entire&nbsp;stake.</p> 3. How Much To&nbsp;Stake? <p>Given these factors, it’s crucial to carefully decide how much to stake. To better understand this, let’s examine some scenarios from simple to&nbsp;complex.</p> 3.1 How Much to Stake: Single Predictoor Scenario <p>The objective is to determine the appropriate amount to&nbsp;stak.</p><p>Let’s start by assuming there is only one predictoor in the system&nbsp;. Therefore we can ignore factors related to other predictoors’ stakes. We only have to consider reward amount and accuracy.</p><p>Let’s assume that their classifier’s accuracy is 50%, i.e. random, making correct predictions half of the&nbsp;time.</p><p>Then, expected payout E[Payout] is:</p><p>And, expected return E[R]&nbsp;is:</p> 3.1 How Much to Stake: Multiple Predictoors Scenario <p>Assume now that other predictoors enter the game. The main modification to the equations is that the % of total rewards for a particular predictor with arbitrary accuracy Acc, is weighted by the amount of&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Then, expected payout&nbsp;is:</p><p>This assumes that amount staked by all the predictoors does not change with time, and the rewards remain constant across time as well. (Making such an assumption makes modeling more tractable, yet still&nbsp;useful.)</p><p>To further simplify the model, we can assume that each of the n predictoors stakes the same amount sₚ.&nbsp;Then:</p><p>The return is&nbsp;then:</p><p>From the equation above, we see that returns are positive as long as the numerator is greater than&nbsp;sₚ:</p><p>Given a particular value of accuracy Acc, under the conditions presented (all predictoors stake the same amount, stakes and rewards are constant) we obtain the following relationship.</p><p>Stake Bounding&nbsp;Formula:</p><p>This suggests that for a specific level of accuracy, the amount staked should not exceed the figures on the right side of the equation to ensure a positive return, according to the assumptions made.</p> 4. Stake Amount Guidelines <p>Here are some general guidelines on how much to&nbsp;stake.</p>  The lower-bound sales for a given week are the Data Farming Rewards in OCEAN and in ROSE, on the order of 37500 OCEAN and 100000 ROSE. You can use this for r_f in the formulae.  Higher accuracy levels lessen the likelihood of negative&nbsp;returns.  When determining the stake amount, consider the stakes of other users. The system allocates rewards based not only on accuracy but also on the stake amount. Hence, in each epoch, users who predict correctly and have a larger stake will receive a larger share of the&nbsp;rewards.  Start with very small stakes, where you definitely aren’t bounded by sales. Get a feel for how everything works end-to-end, and how the variables above relate in practice. Only when you feel more confident should you&nbsp;increase  <p>Finally — hopefully to state the obvious — it’s unwise to stake all your OCEAN into a single prediction even if your model’s accuracy is extremely high. Because if you’re wrong then you lose it all! All the models above assume that amount staked is significantly lower than this. However there is a way to bound this amount too, such that you never risk it all yet maximize profit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>. It’s the original “right-size” approach to making bets in poker and trading, and applies equally&nbsp;here.</p> 4. On Formula&nbsp;Accuracy <p>The two scenarios presented above are relatively simple due to making specific assumptions. Nonetheless, we hope they prove useful in practice.</p><p>For predictoors who want to further maximize their return by improving formula accuracy further, here are some possibilities (at the cost of higher formula complexity).</p>  Fixed predictoors’ stake → stake changing over time → real-time estimates of&nbsp;stake  Fixed prediction model accuracy → real-time estimates of&nbsp;accuracy  Rewards lower bound from Data Farming → add organic sales estimate → real-time estimates of organic&nbsp;sales  Ignore gas fees → add gas fees estimate → real-time estimate of gas&nbsp;fees  (and more)   5. Conclusion <p>This article is for predictoors — people running prediction bots in <a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> ecosystem.</p><p>If you stake more, you can earn more, but only to a point. Earnings are bounded by sales of the feeds. So if you stake too much, you will lose&nbsp;$.</p><p>This article provided equations that bound how much to stake, along with general&nbsp;tips.</p> Final Note <p>⚠️ You will lose money as a predictoor if your $ out exceeds your $ in. If you have low accuracy you’ll have your stake slashed a lot. Do account for gas fees, compute costs, and more. Everything you do is your responsibility, at your discretion.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>For anyone <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/how-can-you-protect-your-gpt/500642">paying attention</a> to the OpenAI DevDay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk">announcements</a> a few weeks ago, Gizmodo’s recent article “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/security-vulnerabilities-openai-chatgpt-custom-gpt-1851057912">Be Careful What You Tell OpenAI’s GPTs</a>” shouldn’t come as news. (To refresh everyone’s memory, “GPTs” were announced as OpenAI’s platform for building custom agents that can be shared as apps with other users.) It was clear from the demos and presentations that the GPT Store will expose to the public your prompts, the “Knowledge” files you upload, the APIs used for “Actions,” and any metadata your GPT employs. YouTube videos like <a href="https://youtu.be/gEf0BPkqQSM">this one</a> even demonstrate in detail how shockingly easy it is to acquire this information with a few simple hacks.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious security concerns, it also invalidates any commercial value promised by the GPT Store because there can essentially be no proprietary intellectual property—the GPT Store will simply become one giant copy machine.</p>
<p>But then, maybe we don’t need the GPT Store to be so much an innovation center as a relationship store (as in “storage” in this case). This is something I proposed at our recent cyberevolution conference in my presentation, “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5437/3">Thanks to AI, the Future of Security is Collaborative</a>.” It’s a concept that bears repeating in this context.</p>
 The App Store was Never Actually About You, Anyway 
<p>Apple is lauded profusely for its human-centric design. But I posit that it merely seems user-friendly—it’s actually a developer-centric design with enough glitz to retain the attention of us normals. As Exhibit A, I offer the home screen of the iPhone. Let’s say you want to send your friend Sam a message; the first problem you’re confronted with is which messaging app to use. In your mind, you have to work through a matrix, which looks something like this:</p>



App
When to use
Why use it now?


Apple Messages
Blue contacts (aka “not green”)
Easy access and group chats


WhatsApp
International
I’m traveling


Facebook Messenger
Friends &amp; family
Reacting to a post


Signal
Privacy
News about his firing—needs to be on the DL


WeChat
China &amp; stickers
I want to send a cute sticker!


Snapchat
Generational
Probably won’t use


Line
AsiaPac &amp; stickers
Want to use a sticker that’s not on WeChat


Slack
Work &amp; workgroups
Group conversation about GPT security


Google Chat&nbsp;
Work &amp; play
We use Google Workspace sometimes


Discord
Gamers
We’re playing a game


Instagram
React to images
I’m a promoter


Skype
General purpose
If nothing else seems appropriate at the time



<p>Table 1: A rubric for deciding which messaging app to use right now (e-mail apps excluded)</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, I prompted Stability.ai’s DreamStudio to generate a phone with only messaging apps on the home screen (no need to reverse-engineer the prompt, I provide it for you). The “message” of the image is of course to satirize the consternation this screen evokes in the human who faces so many nuanced options simply to message a friend. I think DreamStudio got this one exactly right because the text under the weird icons isn’t even intelligible 😀.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, who actually benefits from the App Store approach? It’s clearly not the user. Unsurprisingly, App stores are for the sellers and the apps represent a relationship between you and the developer. If you want to chat with a friend, you’ll first need to figure out which of your developer friends you want to broker that message.</p>
 Not Apps, not GPTs—GPme 
<p>I got an e-mail from OpenAI on December 1st, reiterating the company’s desire to empower “builders” with more tools and announcing the launch of the GPT store “early next year.” (Note: e-mail seems a rather old-fashioned way to communicate information about GPTs; but it’s ubiquitous, so I guess that’s the kind of calculation they made in the marketing department.) In case you didn’t get the message, here it is:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Short and to the point—not even any mention of Sam Altman. Perfect. But the e-mail reinforces the point that OpenAI is courting “builders” (erstwhile developers) rather than the natural inhabitants of AI space: personas.</p>
<p>Whether the economic incentives of OpenAI will prove sustainable for builders remains to be seen; but the platform can already support persona-to-persona relationships on the internet. Let me explain.</p>
<p>In my cyberevolution presentation, I introduced a new species, one that lives natively on the internet: Homo ex machina. I asked ChatGPT for a definition and got a surprisingly well-thought-out response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Homo ex machina" is a Latin phrase that could be translated into English as "Man from the machine." This phrase seems to be a play on the term "deus ex machina," which means "god from the machine" and refers to a plot device where a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected intervention. "Homo ex machina" could imply a human being emerging from or created by a machine, possibly referring to the concept of artificial intelligence or cybernetic organisms in a philosophical or literary context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my view, GPTs shouldn’t be viewed as a kitchen appliance like Talkie Toaster or a sentient being like I, Robot, which are separate from natural persons; rather, they should make natural persons more like an internet-native version of Iron Man. DALL-E seemed to get it right away—on the first prompt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DALL-E prompt: A human with a superhero suit on that bestows god-like powers</p>
<p>A GPme (working title) is a personal power up that combines your humanity with superpowers. Your apparent intelligence will be near genius level; your knowledge will be encyclopedic; your linguistic skills will extend to fluency in dozens of languages; your creativity will be unbounded. You may even become a decent driver.</p>
 How GPme Storage would Foster Trustful Relationships 
<p>What we really want those icons on our home screens to represent is the totality of our relationships—our relationships to other people, other GPme’s, groups, businesses, governments, and even our enemies. Behind each of those social emoticons lies an avatar representing our personal interests in that relationship. The GPme would retain all the history, all the promises, all the aspirations as well as an accounting of the contributions made and the current status of the relationship. In this way, relationships will become more symmetrical, fair, and trustful.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A GPme for All Seasons</p>
 GPme’s also change the game for decentralized identity 
<p>For the decentralized identity crowd out there (including all the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> folks), take notice: by using GPTs (or similar agents such as Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio">CoPilots</a>) as a relationship aggregator rather than an app store, we have the beginnings of a new type of decentralized identity. It’s not a wallet, it’s not a self-sovereign identity (SSI), and it’s not a decentralized identifier (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>). Instead, we have a (for lack of digital term) fully fleshed out GPT relationship store, which provides a way for individuals to maintain the totality of their relationships with the assistance of powerful AIs. And beyond providing mere channels for connectivity (as messaging apps do), these GPT relationships could function as a trust base.</p>
<p>This in turn would form a network of decentralized trust anchors consisting of persona-to-persona relationships. In this context, the identity data and metadata wouldn’t need to be directly tied to the natural persons who own or operate these personas, enhancing privacy tremendously.</p>
<p>Returning to SSI, ledgers have an important role to play in GPT relationship stores. Whereas apps are at risk from information exposure, revealing information about your GPT relationships turns out to be very helpful from a trust perspective. In fact, information about your GPT relationships should be public, and verifiable, like on a ledger. This approach enables reputation and cost signaling, which are proven to foster interparty trust (see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-future-of-security-is-collaborative-cre23">my cyberevolution slides</a> for references as well as my recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti">Advisory Note</a> on distributed identity).</p>
<p>In summary, using swarms of GPme’s, natural persons can empower GPT actors to both protect them in a hostile, foreboding internet while engaging in meaningful and productive relationships.</p>

 We interview experts from the world of financial services, crypto and gambling to discover some of the year’s major regulatory and technological surprises, and the trends awaiting the identity verification sector in 2024. 



 



<p>We click, we scroll, we awkwardly stare at the camera, and we do that ‘press, but don’t actually press, just lightly rest it upon the side button thing’ every single day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we approach 2024, it’s no exaggeration to say we spend most of our lives online; personally, and professionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, we’re probably not too many years away from our digital selves becoming more trusted and, in a way, able to do more than our soft, fleshy human forms. Able to register, transact and be recognized quicker and more effectively online than in person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every industry has gone digital. Fact. It’s not even a controversial and outlandishly sci-fi statement to make anymore. We buy, we sell, we save, we transact, we subscribe and gamble – all online, often without physically interacting with another person, whether in person or online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if we’re spending more time online, then it’s important to be able to prove our identity – that we are who we say we are, and that the people we’re interacting with are who they claim to be. This is where industry regulations, rules and established processes like identity verification data and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> come into play. Laws ensure online users behave in a legally binding and appropriate way.</p>



 Accountability vs anonymity. 



<p>But, what about an internet user’s right to remain anonymous and even more importantly, their right to privacy? &nbsp;</p>



<p>The desire for anonymity may not necessarily be rooted in the wish to engage in illegal activities away from prying eyes, but more as a genuine concern for how their personal identifiable information and other important data could be hacked and tracked or even used for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How to balance accountability with anonymity has been a conundrum since the internet was first invented and is a recurring bone of contention whenever new regulation or frameworks are created. The ongoing, fractious exchanges on the details of the proposed Electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS 2.0) have been testament to that. More on that later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite tech titans’ claims to the contrary, there is no simple one-size fits all answer to the question of how to offer both anonymity and privacy. If there was, organizations would never be fined for internal failings like AML and KYC deficiencies; users would never fall victim to fraud; and the internet would be a wonderland, free from financial crime, scams and hate speech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A potential answer lies in the balancing act between the needs of the corporation and the needs of the consumer, in the open and ongoing dialogue between regulatory decisionmakers and industry insiders for the common purpose of a secure and attractive marketplace, and in the clever deployment of technology that can optimize processes while ensuring a superior digital customer experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this blog, we speak to our Spotlight Interview alumni, as well as IDnow’s own experts to discover the sector developments that have surprised them in 2023, and what trends they predict will have the most impact in 2024.</p>

 Is that the real you, or is that just your identity? 



<p>The global digital identity solution market is projected to grow from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/digital-identity-solutions-market-247527694.html">$34.5 billion in 2023</a> to a staggering $83.2 billion by 2028. The main reasons for the growth are the increasing usage of online services (across an ever-expanding range of sectors and use cases); the introduction of more cost-effective AI/ML-powered services; and the rise in SME adoption of identity management solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of 2024. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are simply staggering.</p>



 Is traditional banking dead? 



<p>Unsurprisingly, considering how important identity checks are in heavily regulated industries like financial services, the banking sector performed the lion’s share of identity verification checks in 2023 (37 billion), which is more than half of the global identification market. The days of visiting branches to verify your identity to open a bank account, or make a transaction payment are nearing the end, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb3f99a2-bd4c-4ba1-8cb9-432ecfbf73ab">closures of approximately one in eight bank branches</a> in the UK in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>In 2023, we’ve seen a lot of interest in FinTechs, including neobanks. The digital-only trend has certainly not gone unnoticed by traditional banks, which are now looking into what technologies and what partners can do to help them improve aspects such as user experience.&nbsp;</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and FinTech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>The use of technology to optimize operational efficiencies, enhance customer experience and ultimately reduce fraud has become pivotal, regardless of the sector, but especially in financial services. Financial services are often at the forefront of technological innovation and leading the charge toward safer and more secure environments for transacting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Little wonder then that the global growth in volume of identity verification checks has been <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">driven largely by banks adopting stronger biometric identity</a> verification methods in a bid to combat fraud, in particular account takeover and card-not-present fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It will come as no surprise that financial services continue to be the industry most exposed to fraudsters,” said Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow. “Fraudsters and the technology at their disposal are becoming increasingly more sophisticated.”</p>



 The never-ending cat and mouse game of fraud prevention. 



<p>The amount of money lost to fraud is staggering. In the UK alone, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">approximately £3 billion is lost every single year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, Lovro said that there were three things that surprised him:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“First was the rapid rise of social engineering, from phone calls to SMS, emails, phishing, everything has increased. The second surprise for me is that physical document fraud has almost completely disappeared – it’s not zero, but it’s a very steep curve down. Unfortunately, the quality of fraudulent documents has improved dramatically, with hologram production at such a high level now that they’re more difficult to detect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third development that surprised Lovro in 2023 was how innovative many fraudsters have become regarding the use of synthetic fraud, synthetic identities and deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I thought it would take another few years before we got to this stage. Up until very recently, synthetic fraud was very rudimentary, but it is getting much better and more sophisticated.</p>Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>As identity verification methods like liveness checks are known to prevent spoofing and other types of fraud, organizations that have not been using biometric verification methods in 2023 should be doing so in 2024 to protect their business, their customers, and their reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the use of the latest forms of identity verification technology can certainly help organizations learn more about their customers, and thereby prevent fraud in the process, there are certain types of social engineering fraud, like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> that take advantage of human emotional frailty, so are harder to safeguard against.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ex-police officer and self-professed fraud nerd, Paul Stratton agrees that the increase in social engineering is a worrying trend that will unfortunately continue into 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Romance and ‘repeat victimization’ fraud (e.g.: a romance fraud victim is steered into investment fraud) will continue to prosper. Breaking the cycle of manipulation and coercion is almost impossible when that person believes it is all legitimate… This is when banks and financial institutions must step in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/"> Jinisha Bhatt, AML and crypto fraud investigator</a>, who also dedicates a lot of her time researching and helping to prevent human trafficking, it’s also important to factor in the link between social engineering fraud, and human trafficking violations.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Today, highly organized scam compounds run rampant in countries like Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar and force ‘workers’ to groom, manipulate and defraud victims of romance and investment scams worldwide.</p>Jinisha Bhatt, AML and crypto fraud investigator.</blockquote>



<p>“The larger the pool of financial fraud victims, the higher the demand for scam factory workers. This is a machine that continues to feed itself at an insurmountable cost to human beings on each end of the cycle. While we focus our efforts on preventing pig butchering scams, we must also continue to enhance international cooperation among law enforcement and strengthen measures to impose human rights-related sanctions against entities and individuals who profit from this crime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever the reason banks or any organization chooses to overhaul their customer onboarding process and internal controls, an identity verification platform that can address the aforementioned three driving forces: optimize operational efficiencies, enhance customer experience, reduce fraud – will further accelerate the mass adoption of digital identity verification services.</p>



<p>As consumers become more wary about sharing their PII data due to privacy concerns or the risk of data breaches and the rise of identity theft, synthetic identity fraud or account takeover there is a need for organizations to switch their focus from frictionless user journeys to optimized user journeys with ‘good friction’ that not only deters fraudsters but also increases consumer confidence and trust in the organizations onboarding process. It is a balance between convenience and security for consumer confidence that needs to be carefully managed.</p>



 Play time’s over: The year that crypto was forced to grow up. 



<p>As a sector that by its very existence questions the limitations of established systems and structures, it is understandable that many crypto firms experiment with new ways of doing business, with some even making the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">risky decision to forgo traditional KYC checks</a> altogether. While 2023 proved an important and somewhat stabilizing year for the evolution of the industry, with both the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulatory framework</a>,( MiCA) and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed regulatory regime,</a> taking significant steps toward completion, it was also a somewhat unsettled year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think what surprised me most about 2023 was the sheer level of turbulence. In fact, there is still ongoing litigation with many major crypto names. Reassuringly however, this hasn’t halted innovation, which is what crypto is all about. We saw the likes of Worldcoin launch, which is a new take on identity and proof of personhood, so it’s these kinds of developments that show that crypto is making significant strides in the right direction,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d153b0-0c28-4946-acbe-2e93329bca52">convict the founder of FTX of money laundering</a> and fraud sent shockwaves through the industry and should act as a warning shot that the upstart industry of crypto needs to play by the established rules of financial services, especially regarding Anti-Money Laundering directives, and KYC processes. Is play time over for crypto? If not, then the days of transacting in complete anonymity, without restrictions, and of celebrities promoting unregulated platforms, certainly are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the digital identity verification industry, and to an extent, the wider technological community is sure to admire the innovative steps taken by crypto to think outside the box in 2023, regulatory bodies are losing patience. And with 2024 likely to be the year that the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer of Funds Regulation</a>,&nbsp; MiCA, and the UK’s equivalent will be implemented, that patience is sure to be tested more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some argue that existing and upcoming crypto requirements are too harsh, prohibitively so, especially the UK’s financial promotions regime for crypto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of crypto firms currently perceive <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-promotions-uk-crypto/">financial promotions</a> as a massive burden and barrier of entry to the UK market. I hope the restrictions are softened somewhat in 2024, otherwise what we may find is a reduction in number of crypto firms in the UK market, which may, in turn push crypto users to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/">either grey market platforms or to offshore operators</a>, which would surely put a dent in the UK’s plans to become an international crypto hub,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, though, Jason remains optimistic about the state of crypto in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re on the cusp of new individuals and new flows entering the crypto space, which will be a very beneficial development and hopefully lead to a more positive crypto environment in 2024. Also, in March of next year, we will see the bitcoin halving, which is an exciting time for the crypto market, because the rate of supply of newly mined bitcoin is halved.”</p>



 



 

 



 



 Regulatory reflection: Betting on an online future. 



<p>Creating regulatory frameworks that not only protect the consumer, but also provide an attractive environment for operators is essentially the role of regulation, and regulatory bodies from around the world have certainly been busy this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the above crypto frameworks to the reassessment of existing gambling regulations in as disparate markets as the UK and Curaçao, 2023 has reminded every industry, especially gambling, of the importance, and opportunity of regularly updated regulation. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“One of the major surprises in the gambling industry for 2023 was that Brazil is now firmly on track to regulate both sports betting and online casinos, it’s the right thing to do because regulating the full portfolio of products will be critical to the success of the Brazilian market, including the ability of the authorities to clamp down on the grey market of operators that choose not to apply for a license,” said Martin Lycka, SVP American Regulatory Affairs and Responsible Gambling at Entain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Elsewhere in LatAm, Peru and Chile have been exploring regulation in 2023, and I do think that North American markets and regulators will also be keeping a close eye on proceedings too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our own gambling expert, Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk agreed with Martin regarding the sunny outlook for the LatAm online gambling market and expressed his pleasant surprise at the pace of gambling regulation in Brazil.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, Roger did admit that not all surprises were of the positive variety.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>One of the major surprises for me was learning of the increasing numbers of German players that were migrating to the grey market, due in part to the high tax rates subjected to regulated platforms, and other player restrictions.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Director of Global Gambling at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Such restrictions include 5 second spin durations, €1 stake limit, and €1000 max deposit per month across all licensed operators. In a bid to cut costs, operators who are compliant and licensed in Germany may decide to either pull out of the market, reduce their sponsorship budget (which will negatively impact grassroots sports), or focus on other markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a lose-lose, and not a great situation for the German economy, but I remain positive that German regulators will take the time to assess the situation and perhaps reevaluate its tax strategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roger also believes that while the UK market is doing the right thing by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">running a series of consultations</a> on revisions to its online gambling regulation, like proposed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">financial risk checks</a>, he did worry about the impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, much like the player exodus in Germany, I fear that 2024 may see UK players start to gravitate to the grey market unless upcoming regulatory changes are attractive to both the market and players.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can regulation ever have a negative impact upon a market’s growth? For Martin, it’s a delicate balancing act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It might be stating the obvious, but if regulations are introduced and it’s required to be implemented, then it’s for good reason in the long run and is money worth spent. But there is a fine line to tread between overly onerous regulation that may not be adding any value, and regulation that is efficient.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the gambling industry can teach us anything, it’s that the pace at which the digital world moves means the need for agile, and regularly updated frameworks and guidelines is paramount to ensure industry players operate in a fair and transparent environment.</p>

 Balancing act: The role of regulation. 



<p>Whatever the industry, there is perhaps no regulation or requirement as important in the digital identification space as KYC. This is why KYC, in some form or another, is mandatory in most industries, including financial services, crypto, gambling, among others. Despite its origins dating way back to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpis-F6rGCAxX8X0EAHTPAAoQQFnoECBAQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dowjones.com%2Fprofessional%2Frisk%2Fglossary%2Fknow-your-customer%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DKYC%2520regulations%2520originated%2520from%2520years%2Cand%25202008%2520global%2520financial%2520crisis.&amp;usg=AOvVaw2o_D_jE3NQ3Ig7i62H2uso&amp;opi=89978449">1970, with the passing of the Bank Secrecy Act</a>, KYC regulations and requirements are regularly updated, with most notable and significant revisions occurring following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 2008 global financial crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Changes to the KYC process can also occur whenever changes to associated regulations like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jinisha has been pleasantly surprised by some of this year’s developments regarding AML and is eagerly awaiting the domino effect of clearer and more consistent legislation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“After hundreds of iterations to AML regimes and endless conversations on beneficial ownership registries, it seems that the global financial crime sector is ready to mobilize support for effective ‘transparency’. As per <a href="https://transparencycanada.ca/news/billc42updatesnovember2-2023">Transparency International</a>, 132 countries have made commitments to beneficial ownership registries. Many G7 and G20 countries have adopted the ‘Open Ownership’s Beneficial Ownership Data Standard’ to ensure their national registries are interoperable with the rest of the world’s. These standards will eventually help us uncover connections between opaque shell corporations, sanctions evaders, and PEPs across the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the concept of AML and KYC has remained the same over the years, the importance and how they are used has changed dramatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Banks are beginning to understand that KYC checks can be seamlessly integrated into the client onboarding process, eliminating the need for customers to feel burdened by them,” said Vivek Mishra, Operations Manager at WNS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital identification solutions are also increasingly being used to enable customers to authenticate their identity online without submitting any physical proof. The focus on the customer experience is a good thing, since it indicates that banks are beginning to prioritize their clients at last. Additionally, it implies that KYC checks are getting more successful and efficient, which is excellent news for banks and their clients,” said Vivek.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increasingly multi-purpose use of KYC, the current and second iteration of eIDAS, and national AML laws are just three regulations and requirements that have greatly improved safeguards in digital transactions for regulated market sectors in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rayissa Armata, Director of Global&nbsp;Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow, said that although many positive steps were taken this year, she stressed the importance of careful route-planning and ongoing collaboration with relevant stakeholders to ensure that the European Union gets important regulation like eIDAS 2.0 right.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>There is still more that needs to be done and the challenge is to support an aligned framework that remains reliable, innovative and secure. IDnow fully supports the call for building a more harmonized framework that addresses interoperability, innovation, and most importantly – security.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director of Global&nbsp;Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Rayissa added that future frameworks should therefore factor in the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Identification that can be reused across borders and sectors (public and private)<br>  Establishing standards for developments in technology with appropriate levels of security<br>  Continued collaboration between the public and private sectors&nbsp;  



<p>For Viky Manaila, President of Cloud Signature Consortium, the next few years will prove crucial for the global digital identity landscape.</p>



<p>“eIDAS 2.0 regulation and its evolution during the trilogue surprised everybody in the identity ecosystem, with positive and less positive amendments. As it comes close to the final destination, the next period will be critical for defining the implementing acts, the standards in support of the new services and certification scheme with cross-border interoperability in mind.”</p>

 2023: The year when digital identity became must-have. 



<p>This year’s growth in popularity of identity verification solutions can partly be attributed to the adoption of additional new use cases, for example in facilitating remote recruitment. In fact, 2023 could be categorized as the year that organizations began to unlock, or at least peek through the peephole into the future of how digital identity verification could potentially be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some EU states have made significant developments in their own digital identity systems, such as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/ukraines-digital-identity-app-growing-and-becoming-an-inspiration-for-other-countries">Ukraine’s digital identity app, Diia,</a> which is used for storing biometric passports, tax IDs and driver licenses, to access private and public services, others are taking a much more considered approach to modernizing their identity landscape. For example, the UK has <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">introduced the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> – a set of rules and standards for identity verification service providers to follow in order to offer certain use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although each country will naturally have its own idea of how it wants its citizens to use their digital identities, the future success of digital identity and the digital wallet will invariably be linked to its interoperability, across sectors (public and private), and across regions. For that to happen, however, a standard and generally agreed-upon course forward needs to be set, which of course requires intensive discussions from all interested parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) published a technical report analysing selective disclosure and zero knowledge proofs for the EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sebastian Elfors, Senior Architect at IDnow, who co-authored the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/119476/01.01.01_60/tr_119476v010101p.pdf">ETSI paper</a>, said: “The report has received tremendous interest from the industry, with constructive feedback from the self-sovereign identity community and experts in W3C, GSMA, and several other standardization organizations. The EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) and ETSI and CEN remain on standby to provide the relevant standards and certification schemes for the EUDI Wallet and Qualified Trust Service Providers under eIDAS 2.0.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remaining cautiously optimistic on the future of digital identity, Viky said: “The new commercial models for services around identity proofing, and verifiable credentials on top of the Wallets have the potential to unleash the missing part of digital transformation. If these services are customer-centric designed, they will take off. Otherwise, they will become just another type of digital platform asking for all sorts of personal information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although 2023 has seen the ongoing development of pivotal regulations like eIDAS 2.0, alongside the introduction of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/world-coin-crypto-iris/">new ways of identifying customers, such as iris scans</a>, the pace of development in the digital identity space hasn’t suited everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m surprised by how many times I still have to enter passwords given that Apple, Google and Microsoft are all implementing the passkeys standard. Only yesterday it took me three guesses to remember my telco password and I had to do a password reset on one of my American bank accounts. Please make it stop!</p>David Birch, global advisor and thought leader in financial services.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>However, David did admit that the upcoming ISO mobile driving licence, which both Google and Apple have added to their wallets is sure to accelerate adoption and put Wallets fairly and squarely in the public discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumers will rapidly become comfortable with this mode of presenting standardized credentials in both face to face and remote environments,” added David.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although it’s difficult to predict the future of digital identity verification with any kind of certainty, it is highly likely that it will continue to be used for ever-increasing and multi-purpose use cases, and that any changes that do occur will be precipitated by a combination of technological advancement, regulatory input, fraud trends, and, of course, consumer preference.</p>



 Risks vs rewards: AI and the modern workplace.&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a reason why <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67271252">Collins Dictionary named AI</a> the word of the year in 2023. Artificial intelligence was on the lips of every organization (and unfortunately every fraudster) this year, and with good reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The potential of generative AI, in particular, has many organizations salivating over their budget sheets due to AI’s ability to automate, augment and accelerate working processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a safe bet, therefore, that industries will continue to experiment with AI-powered processes in 2024. In fact, many industries are already reaping the benefits of AI to increase automation, reduce costs and offer more accurate and streamlined identity verification methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vivek certainly recognizes the value in doing so: “I anticipate that as banks and other financial institutions strive to increase their efficiency and security in 2024, AI-powered KYC and banking solutions will become even more widely adopted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s important to not delegate all tasks to AI. Yes, AI and technology in general, can be used as a competitive advantage, but success in 2024 and beyond will almost certainly come from the clever combination of humans and technology, and recognizing the relative merits of both. In identity verification, this may mean AI is reserved for simpler data-scouring tasks, freeing up resources and enabling staff to concentrate on more difficult jobs, like performing manual identity verification checks on high assurance use cases, or delivering more personalized, superior customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, AI has also been weaponized by fraudsters. While in the past, cybercriminals needed a certain base level of technical skills to produce fake documents or websites, AI-augmented fraudsters can utilize generative AI to create authentic-looking documents, videos, images and audio. A trend that will continue in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I expect to see an increase in the use of AI for fraudulent purposes, which makes the innovative use of AI to combat it, and fingerprint scanning and biometric analysis all the more important, alongside human input,” added Lovro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is your organization prepared for the future?</p>



 Inclusivity and accessibility: Making the connected world a safer, fairer place. 



<p>As our digital identities become more established and entrenched in regulations and legal frameworks, it’s important to remember the importance of collaboration on the common goal of making a safer, more secure online world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, IDnow made significant strides toward making the connected world a safer place, becoming the only European identity verification provider to be awarded two certifications for the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/pvid-certification-idcheck-io-and-videoident/">French remote identity verification standard known as PVID</a> (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) at ‘substantial’ level. We also became certified by the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/diatf-certified-framework-identity-verirification-provider/">UK’s Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework.</a> </p>



<p>IDnow prides itself as being at the very forefront of innovation in identity verification, and believes that believes that with a layered, holistic approach to identity, businesses can elevate trust and empower experience across the customer journey – no matter the region, industry, or required regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Research and Developments teams have been hard at work throughout 2023; contributing on projects as far ranging as a toolkit to identify and mitigate biases in AI algorithms to the verification of optical variable device (holograms). Our Product team has also been working tirelessly to update, improve and optimize our digital identity verification services, making them the most complete IDV solutions on the market. Such updates include IDnow’s&nbsp;360 Signals, which detects attempts of repeat fraud, by collecting risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources to detect single and serial fraud attempts in real time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have some exciting upcoming developments, including paper photocopy detection, automatic bank account ownership verification and plans to implement WCAG Level AA to ensure our services can be used by people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inclusiveness and accessibility will continue to be an important topic in 2024 and beyond, and <a href="https://www.bundesfachstelle-barrierefreiheit.de/DE/Fachwissen/Produkte-und-Dienstleistungen/Barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz/barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz_node.html">organizations will soon be legally required</a> to provide a certain level of accessabilty in their solutions or face legal reprecusssions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many factors that lead to inequality in identity verification. Age, disability, neurodiversity, lack of docs for proof or identity or lack of photo are all problems that identity verification providers must improve to provide access to digital services for all. Bridging these gaps requires inclusive design, technological adaptations, and policies addressing diverse accessibility needs, to ensure equitable digital service access for all. IDnow’s video verification enables organizations to improve inclusivity, accessibility, safety, and convenience for all their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have valued and trusted relationships with various international police and counter fraud organizations, including INTERPOL, and the French Scientific Police (the forensics arm of the police) with whom we exchange knowledge and share best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is these relationships and these industry insights that allow us to move quickly and keep abreast of industry trends and developments to offer a comprehensive&nbsp;multi-jurisdictionally compliant identity verification solution. For example, in preparation for the opening of the Brazilian online gambling market, we integrated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/automated-cpf-database-checks-brazilian-gambling/">CPF database checks</a>. Our market-leading identity verification services enable our clients from a variety of sectors to benefit from our proprietary fraud prevention technology and regulatory expertise to provide peace of mind that wherever they operate, and in whatever industry, they can do so compliantly.</p>



 



 

 



 



 The sky is the limit? 



<p>Another major milestone for IDnow in 2023 included the launch of ShopIdent in gas stations throughout Germany. The on-site identification solution enables customers to activate pre-paid SIM cards, open bank accounts, or verify driver’s licenses directly from their local gas station.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, perhaps the most exciting project that we were involved with in 2023 was assisting the International Air Transport Association (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/iata-first-integrated-journey-digital-identity/">IATA) in creating the first ever integrated digital identity travel experience</a>, streamlining the process from flight shopping to arrival. In the Proof-of-Concept trial, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a> was used to store and present digital travel credentials, such as boarding passes and digital visas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We look forward to 2024 with optimism and excitement for what the future holds. While the future of digital identity verification may be uncertain, one thing’s for sure, the sky is no longer the limit.</p>

<p>I am very excited to announce that 1Kosmos is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/integrating-amazon-cognito-with-1kosmos-blockid-for-enhanced-security-and-user-experience/">official AWS Cognito Passwordless MFA partner.</a></p>
<p>Amazon Cognito places the utmost importance on online account security. To bolster the protection of account holders, starting in 2024, Amazon Cognito made it a goal to expand its multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements, ultimately partnering with 1Kosmos to help the Amazon Cognito team reach its customer security initiatives.</p>
 A Better MFA 
<p>It’s no secret that MFA significantly augments the security of web and mobile applications by necessitating additional identification methods beyond just a password. By implementing various forms of MFA organizations can effectively mitigate the risks associated with user account takeovers, phishing attacks, and password breaches.</p>
<p>To take things a step further, users can elevate their account security through biometric authentication features like TouchID (fingerprint), FaceID and LiveID (a 1Kosmos architectural advantage). Additionally, it offers one-time passwords (OTP) through SMS and email, time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) via a linked mobile authenticator, and push notifications. This flexibility empowers Amazon customers to select the MFA methods that best align with the requirements of their application ecosystem.</p>
 User Experience is Important 
<p>The team at Amazon Cognito places delivering a seamless user experience high on its list of requirements, and that is why partnering with 1Kosmos was a perfect fit. The 1Kosmos MFA capabilities provide a diverse array of authentication choices to accommodate a broad spectrum of users and devices, all with a similar user experience. The 1Kosmos BlockID and Amazon Cognito partnership strikes the right balance between security and usability when developing customer-facing applications.</p>
 Easy Access to Passwordless 
<p>1Kosmos is a trusted AWS Partner and AWS Marketplace Seller offering BlockID and passwordless MFA solutions to elevate online account security. The platform boasts FIDO2 and NIST 800-63-3 certifications, further affirming its reliability. Amazon Cognito customers can easily deploy and directly acquire BlockID through the AWS Marketplace, enabling the implementation of a phishing-resistant passwordless MFA solution.</p>
 Identity Verification 
<p>An optional capability of the 1Kosmos platform, 1Kosmos BlockID provides organizations an automated and cryptographically secure way to verify a virtually unlimited array of identity details including government issued ID, education qualifications, healthcare data, financial account details, and other third-party machine-readable personal information while respecting an individual’s privacy. This provides progressively higher levels of identity assurance for authentication and digitally transforms a broad range of business processes such as worker or contractor onboarding, new customer account origination, and provisioning of digital services.</p>
 Combination of Verification and Authentication 
<p>This capability of the BlockID cloud service has been meticulously crafted to combat identity impersonation, thwart account takeovers, and prevent fraudulent activities, all while offering a user-friendly and frictionless login experience.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID leverages identity-based verification to transparently authenticate users, effectively shielding against account compromises and fraudulent activities. The result of implementing BlockID identity verification with the integration of Amazon Cognito enables organizations to have a higher level of assurance for the users they have under management.</p>
 Privacy by Design 
<p>The 1Kosmos decentralized private blockchain technology empowers individuals with exclusive access and full control over their personally identifiable information, ensuring a privacy-centric design. This approach allows end users to review and authorize or decline the sharing of their data with online services they want to utilize. All personally identifiable information (PII) undergoes end-to-end encryption, guaranteeing that it remains shielded from exposure. Users can directly grant or deny sharing requests to the applications they connect with, without any involvement of third-party intermediaries, such as external public key servers or messaging hosts, ensuring that their data, keys, and plain text messages remain inaccessible to these entities.</p>

<p>Effective collaboration is essential for organizations to innovate, make decisions, and drive progress. Over the past few decades, digital technologies have dramatically expanded how we are able to collaborate remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>The introduction of tools like email, instant messaging, wikis, and video conferencing enabled new ways for distributed teams to communicate and work together.</p><p>More recently, all-in-one SaaS collaboration suites from vendors like Slack, Microsoft, and Google have been widely adopted by companies looking to centralize their key business applications.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as remote and hybrid work environments become more prevalent, teams are finding that centralized legacy models for digital collaboration have limitations. This is driving the exploration of distributed and decentralized frameworks that offer greater <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/walkaway-or-why-forking-matters/">control, transparency, and flexibility</a>.</p> The Rise of Centralized Collaboration Suites <p>In the early 2000s, the rise of software as a service (SaaS) paved the way for full-fledged collaboration suites delivered through the cloud. Vendors like Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce began providing bundled productivity and communication applications all under one platform.</p><p>According to Ian Tien, CEO of Mattermost, “When I started, I was at Microsoft, right? And collaboration was easy. It was all through the intranet on a centralized server.”&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last decade, this market has continued rapidly expanding. Tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Workspace have become essential platforms that consolidate messaging, video meetings, file sharing, knowledge management, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>While early digital tools enabled discrete modes of teamwork, these centralized suites aim to be comprehensive one-stop shops.&nbsp;</p><p>In the interview, Tien notes that customers are looking to “integrate [tools] with all your different infrastructure, your compliance, and your tools.” For many organizations, adopting an integrated SaaS platform became the obvious path forward as remote and hybrid work began accelerating.</p><p>However, concerns and limitations around relying solely on centralized providers have started to emerge.</p> The Emergence of Distributed Collaboration <p>While centralized systems have become popular, some organizations are exploring alternative distributed frameworks for collaboration. According to Ian Tien, CEO of Mattermost, "The biggest one is, and I'm sure you see it all over the place is this: How do I take these new sorts of LLM AI models and use them to accelerate my work?"&nbsp;</p><p>Tien also states that "the core of it is that when you take the information, let's say, and just like your workplace communications, right, it's not that valuable."&nbsp;</p><p>However, he notes that aggregated data from collaboration tools can provide insights companies may want to keep private. Holochain and other distributed projects aim to give users more <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/what-is-digital-identity/">autonomy and control</a> over their information.</p><p>LLMs combined with generative AI harness enormous amounts of data. While the systems can’t understand data like a human can, they can still create generalizations based on the extremely large datasets.&nbsp;</p><p>If Slack were to implement an LLM model with generative AI, it’s unclear whether your data would be used in conjunction with other company’s data.&nbsp;</p><p>With distributed models, validation happens at the app level between users rather than via centralized consensus. This enables customized security policies tailored to specific collaboration use cases.</p><p>As remote and hybrid work expand, teams want the flexibility to collaborate effectively while maintaining autonomy over their systems and data. Distributed models provide an alternative approach with transparent peer-to-peer connections.</p> What the Future Holds <p>While centralized suites solved many early collaboration challenges, new needs are emerging around flexibility, transparency, and control. Ian Tien summarizes this well:</p><blockquote>"The future of digital collaboration will require increased transparency around data provenance and usage. How can we enable explainability around why systems make certain determinations? What audit trails exist to show the origins and lineage of data used for collaboration?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>“Users want more clarity not just on what algorithms decide but the underlying data and logic driving those decisions. As collaboration platforms leverage more AI and machine learning, robustly documenting data provenance will only grow in importance. Companies want to ensure they can control and account for how data gets managed in collaborative processes."</blockquote><p>Distributed collaboration frameworks like Holochain offer an alternative paradigm with direct peer-to-peer connections instead of intermediary servers. This agent-centric approach gives users autonomy while still enabling effective teamwork across organizations.</p><p>There are still challenges to making distributed collaboration <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/becoming-viable-seeds-to-saplings/">seamless and scalable</a> for the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>But with the right blend of usability, security, and customizable control, these emergent technologies could empower teams with a new generation of tools for digital teamwork. The ideal future likely incorporates both centralized and decentralized elements across hybrid technology stacks.</p>

				  Indicio Proven™&nbsp; now provides a privacy-preserving way to record, share, and verify educational achievements.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, Dec 5, 2023, <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading world’s leading provider of digital trust solutions, today announced the addition of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-badges/">Open Badges</a> 3.0 digital credential format to Indicio Proven™, Indicio’s flagship product for creating and communicating verifiable data.</p>
<p>Open Badges is a powerful digital format for recording educational achievements, skills, and other accomplishments. Increasingly popular as a standard, Open Badges are shared on social media and stored and managed on third-party platforms.</p>
<p>The addition of Open Badges into Indicio Proven, the leading software for enterprise adoption of verifiable credentials, makes it possible for the badge to be directly held and controlled by the person who earned the achievement in a wallet on their mobile device instead of being forced to access their records through a third-party provider or platform.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven makes holding, sharing, and verifying an Open Badges credential truly portable. Now, anyone using the same open-source issuing software can create an Open Badges credential, anyone with the app can receive and share an Open Badges credential, and anyone with the verification software can verify the source and the integrity of the data in the Open Badges credential.</p>
<p>By removing the need for a centralized Open Badges Platform, users have control over their privacy, they can consent to share Open Badge data in secure, privacy-preserving ways, and they — and not the platform — fully own their Open Badges credentials. Indicio will be the first to use the new Open Badge verifiable credentials, issuing them&nbsp; to those who complete training and workshops in the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-academy/">Indicio Academy</a> training and workshops.</p>
<p>“Combining the Open Badges format with a verifiable credential releases its full power,” said Heather Dahl, CEO and co-founder of Indicio. “Similar to the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">Digital Travel Credential we developed on ICAO standards</a>, we’re creating simple ways for our customers to build seamless processes with verifiable data. The Open Badges format is a great way to share and verify detailed academic records and information about skill sets. But now we’ve freed Open Badges to be even greater — to take advantage of interoperable, open-source technology, to be used in faster, more private, and more secure ways, and, of course, to be a record of achievement that can be owned and verified forever.”</p>
<p>Technical details</p>
<p>Indicio’s unique approach combines open-source verifiable credentials based on the W3C Verifiable Credential Data and 1EdTech Open Badges 3.0 (OBv3) standards with open source technologies from Hyperledger Foundation. This enables people to hold the records of their educational achievements in a digital wallet under their own control in perpetuity. These JSON-LD based credentials can be used to easily share verifiable information on social media, when applying to a job online, or with any verifier using open source verifiable credential technology to read the badge.</p>
<p>Open Badges can be issued using Indicio Proven for a wide range of participatory, educational, and learning scenarios and can be verified by ACA-Py and AFJ based agents. Badge types include:</p>

<p>As another year draws to a close, it’s time to start thinking about what trends and challenges may face us in 2024. Next year promises to be a pivotal moment in the evolution of identity management and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). As we grapple with the challenges posed by sophisticated phishing attacks, deepfakes, and the ever-expanding influence of AI, the need for innovative solutions has never been more critical. This blog post explores the emerging trends that will shape the identity landscape, from identity inclusion and access movements to the intersection of AI and security.</p>
<p>Inclusion and Access: Bridging the Digital Divide</p>
<p>The fusion of our physical and digital lives requires a fundamental shift in how we approach identity. As we move toward a future where digital identity underpins social and economic mobility, the importance of inclusivity cannot be overstated. In 2024, there will be a heightened focus on ensuring secure and convenient identity verification, both online and in-person.</p>
<p>Regulatory Surge in the Cyber Risk Landscape</p>
<p>With the Biden administration’s landmark Executive Order setting new standards for AI safety and security, 2024 is poised to see a regulatory surge. Chief information security officers (CISOs) will need to prepare for continued AI regulation, new post-quantum guidance, and anticipated legislation around Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines. As guidance from governments increases, businesses must adapt their cybersecurity strategies to navigate a patchwork of regulations and ensure the security of customer data.</p>
<p>AI-Powered Phishing and the Banking Dilemma</p>
<p>The age-old threat of phishing takes on a new dimension in 2024 as AI-enabled phishing becomes more sophisticated and widespread. The financial industry faces a dual challenge with AI. While AI presents opportunities to enhance customer experience and reduce costs, it also intensifies the arms race with hackers. The scalability and effectiveness of AI-driven attacks means that financial institutions must continuously innovate their security and risk management strategies to ensure continued security to their most important assets: PII data and monetary instruments.</p>
<p>Post-Quantum Cryptography: A Looming Challenge</p>
<p>While post-quantum cryptography may not be a top priority for many CISOs today, its existential threat cannot be ignored. In 2024, businesses, especially in the banking sector, must upgrade their cryptography to post-quantum standards. The long data retention mandates in banking make it imperative to prepare for “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” quantum attacks (in which encrypted data that is stolen now could then be accessed once a suitably powerful quantum computer is available), even if quantum computers are not yet a reality. Failure to do so could have repercussions for decades to come.</p>
<p>Open Banking and the Cybersecurity Wild West</p>
<p>Open banking regulation is set to accelerate in the U.S., posing challenges and opportunities for financial institutions. While consumers seek convenience, banks must navigate the potential threat to direct customer relationships. The cybersecurity landscape will undergo growing pains as open APIs introduce new access points and players. Collaboration with regulators and fintechs, combined with advancements in identity verification, is crucial to ensuring the privacy and transparency of financial ecosystems.</p>
<p>Simplifying Tech Complexity for Enhanced Security</p>
<p>Banks face a growing challenge in managing the complexity of their tech stacks, particularly in the realm of identity verification. Fragmentation increases the risk of attacks, making it essential for institutions to consolidate vendors and streamline their ecosystems. Vendor consolidation not only adds an extra layer of protection against bad actors but also facilitates a more seamless experience for consumers.</p>
<p>Biometrics: Striking the Balance Between Security and Convenience</p>
<p>Advancements in biometrics offer a transformative solution to balancing security and convenience in the digital realm. Banks will increasingly use biometric technology, smartphones, and document recognition to enhance security measures. By adopting innovative solutions, institutions can create a system that deters fraud without frustrating users, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>As we embark on the journey through 2024, the intersection of identity, AI, and cybersecurity will define the technological landscape. From changes in how we view identity to the regulatory surge in AI and the ongoing challenges of phishing and post-quantum cryptography, businesses and individuals alike must stay vigilant and adapt to these transformative trends. It’s a year of innovation, adaptation, and collaboration as we navigate the complexities of the digital age.</p>

 Introducing Multi-Party Approval for On-chain Agreements 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in November of 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Welcome to the November edition of the Product Newsletter, where we highlight the product team’s latest upgrades each month.</p>
<p>This month we are discussing the implementation of the multi-party approval feature, an enhancement of the already existing Conditional Transfer Feature.</p>
 We Upgraded The Conditional Transfer Feature 
<p>In our ongoing efforts to streamline and secure the movement of tokenized securities, we recognized a crucial need for our clients:&nbsp;a system that requires approvals from multiple parties before a transfer can proceed.</p>
<p>Our previous&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/security-tokens-conditional-transfer/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8COCRyIXJFk84a0AvtQsPi2B4w9GRwb6NUlUQ5AlZWZTu4ZrU5yaThZsOrBbLwo_YWYfAZ">conditional transfer feature</a>&nbsp;only allows issuers or agents to have one&nbsp;single-party approval. By adding the&nbsp;multi-party approval&nbsp;feature we create a flexible transfer approval process, catering to the diverse needs of our clients.</p>
 The Multi-Party Approval Transfer 
<p>Multi-party approval transfer elevates the transfer validation process by requiring multiple approvals.&nbsp;Issuers gain the flexibility to&nbsp;create custom approval workflows, tailoring the process to fit their specific transactional needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, as&nbsp;multi-party approvals are set up at the smart contract level, approvers have the freedom to choose their preferred wallet solution in order to approve or disapprove transactions, be it multisig wallets, self-hosted wallets, or hard drive wallets.</p>
<p>It’s designed to provide a&nbsp;unified, on-chain agreement signing process, which further streamlines operations, ensuring transparent and immutable recording of approvals on the blockchain. This feature aims to not only&nbsp;streamline the complex token transfer process&nbsp;but also&nbsp;enhance counterparty interactions&nbsp;in asset management.</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 How it Works: 
 
 Setting Up:&nbsp;Issuers, their agent, or equivalent set the rules for each multi-party approval transfer, including who needs to approve it and in any specified order.<br>
Types of approvers:<p></p>
 
 
 
 Recipient of the transfer 
 Custodians of the seller and the buyer 
 Any other approver the issuer or compliance agent wants to appoint 
 
 
 
 
 Initiating Transfer:&nbsp;When an investor requests a transfer, it’s held in a ‘pending’ state, awaiting approvals. 
 Multi-party Review:&nbsp;Issuers and appointed parties review and&nbsp;approve or disapprove&nbsp;the request. 
 Completion:&nbsp;Once all approvals are in place, the transfer is automatically executed, ensuring both security and efficiency. 
 
<p>Please contact us if you are interested in learning more or trying out this feature.</p>

   Background&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many customers face challenges in managing their Conditional Access (CA) policies. Over time, they accumulate more and more policies that are created ad-hoc to solve specific business scenarios, resulting in a loss of overview and increased troubleshooting efforts. Microsoft has provided <a href="https://aka.ms/ca-zt">guidance</a> on how to structure your Conditional Access policies in a way that follows the Zero Trust principles, using a persona-based approach.&nbsp;The guidance includes a set of Conditional Access policies that can serve as a starting point. These CA policies can be automated from a CI/CD pipeline using various tools. One such tool is Microsoft365DSC, an open-source tool developed by members of the Microsoft Graph Product Group, who are still actively involved in its maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft365DSC can automate the configuration of various Microsoft 365 workloads, including Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access policies. The diagram below illustrates the role of Microsoft365DSC as a tool for automating Microsoft 365, complementing the automation of Azure that’s typically achieved using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and/or Bicep templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has already been documented how you can use Microsoft365DSC to automate and maintain your Conditional Access policies. Two such sources are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/get-started/integrating-with-azure-devops/">Integrating with Azure DevOps</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/ConditionalAccessGovernanceAndPrinciplesforZeroTrust%20October%202023.pdf">Github Conditional Access for Zero Trust Resources</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These solutions work, but they need to either use a self-hosted agent with a managed identity in Azure DevOps or use a shared secret, and neither of the two solutions are optimal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim at being able to do the automation from Azure DevOps using a Microsoft-managed agent for the CI/CD pipeline and no shared secrets. The introduction of Workload Identity Federation with Azure DevOps can help us do exactly that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting Started&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution we’re aiming at is depicted in the figure below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea is to have our CI/CD pipeline files hosted in the Azure DevOps repository and make values in an Azure Key Vault available in the pipeline based on configuring Workload Identity Federation between the Azure DevOps project and Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps to do this are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Configure a service connection the Azure DevOps project settings as shown below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recommended choice can be selected; however, it would automatically create a service principal in Entra ID with permission to the whole Azure subscription that you specify in the settings. To adhere to the principle of least privileged, we suggest using the manual configuration, which means that you manually create the service principal and only assign it permission to the Key Vault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create an Entra ID App Registration using Federated credentials as shown below:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Add application permissions to the service principal for it to be able to create and update Conditional Access policies. Permissions may include: Policy.Read.All, Policy. ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess, Application,Read.All.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Create a Key Vault in a distinct resource group in an Azure subscription. This subscription should be specifically designed to manage sensitive identity-related workloads. Ideally, it should be located under the “Platform” management group within the “Identity” subscription, provided are adhering to the Enterprise Scale landing zone architecture as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/">documented here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Create two certificates in the Key Vault, one certificate that will be used to sign Microsoft365 configurations and one that will be used to authenticate Microsoft365DSC tools to Entra ID. See below.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. In the Key Vault access control, assign M365DSCWorkloadIdentity the “Key Vault Secret User” role for it to be able to read secrets that you create.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you should have the basic prerequisites in place for you to create or change your CI/CD pipeline to take advantage of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline definition 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest using a multi-stage pipeline defined in an YML file in your repo, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/caautomationpipeline.yml">specified in this example YML file</a>. When utilizing Microsoft365DSC, the Conditional Access policies that we aim to configure or enforce within our Entra ID tenant should be clearly defined in our repository. Also, as a prerequisite, you need to configure the groups that you refer to in the Conditional Access policies definition either manually in the portal or using automation described in the referenced GitHub resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This information should be contained within a file, which could potentially be named ‘ConfigureCAPolicy.ps1’. The content for this file can be generated through various methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Create your Conditional Access policies in the Entra ID portal and use export-m365DSCConfiguration as documented here: <a href="https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/get-started/snapshot-of-existing-tenant/">Taking a Snapshot of Existing Tenant - Microsoft365DSC - Your Cloud Configuration</a>.&nbsp; 
 Create it manually using any editor.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/ConfigureCApolicy.ps1">Here’s a sample of a Conditional Access policy</a>. You will notice that the file must define that we want to authenticate using the certificate. You can get a full list of the Conditional Access policies in Microsoft365DSC format based on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/tree/main/ConditionalAccessSamplePolicies/Microsoft365DSCCAPolicies">persona-based approach configured for Zero Trust here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Build Stage 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pipeline for building the solution is divided into two scripts. First, we import the certificates from the Key Vault into the Windows based CI/CD pipeline agent and compile a Microsoft365DSC configuration file into a MOF file that is to be pushed to our Entra ID tenant in the deploy stage. The reason for having this is two scripts is just for ease of debugging. You may choose to combine them into <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/prep.ps1">one script as shown here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/build.ps1">second script here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Deploy stage&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now have our artifacts stored in Azure DevOps and would like to deploy them to our Entra ID tenant. This is done in the deploy stage where the deploy.ps1 is called. The content if <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/deploy.ps1">deploy.ps1 is located here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Final comments&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information provided, you should now have a clear understanding of how to automate your Conditional Access policies within Entra ID and manage changes using Azure DevOps, all without the need to store shared secrets within Azure DevOps. We strongly recommend that you experiment with this process and utilize the resources mentioned in the article for more detailed information about the configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we primarily focus on implementing this process through Azure DevOps, it's important to note that GitHub Actions also supports Workload Identity Federation. This provides an alternative solution if you prefer GitHub over Azure DevOps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today’s interconnected digital landscape, where applications seamlessly integrate to enhance productivity, is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, information is more accessible than ever, requiring switching between apps and services, ostensibly increasing productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the importance of robust identity management cannot be overstated, and if you’re not careful you can lose track of who, what, and where you’ve authorized permissions — and with companies under 2,000 employees <a href="https://youtu.be/s149kAiuCns?t=44">averaging more than 73 SaaS app integrations in 2020</a>, it’s clearly a growing problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s crucial to recognize the potential risks associated with <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth (Open Authorization)</a> grants and how they impact your organization’s data security. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the intricacies of OAuth and shed light on the vulnerabilities that may lurk beneath the surface.</p>
 Broad OAuth access can mean identity sprawl 
<p>Many applications today build on top of each other, using the data from one to power the other. A common example is Google. Google is not one thing; it’s Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc. And for each of these services, Google has a fine-grained API that engineers can use (usually read-only or read-write) to integrate with their products. OAuth is the standard authorization technology across services and is part of what makes an “interconnected” internet experience possible. For example, YeshID Onboard leverages OAuth APIs from Google, Slack, Zoom, and other platforms <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">to streamline identity management</a> for your organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the devil is in the details when it comes to OAuth scopes, which are the permissions granted to applications. An alarming aspect is the breadth of these scopes. Some vendors offer OAuth APIs in an all-or-nothing approach, which hampers the ability to employ least-privilege access principles. This contrasts with providers like Google Workspace, known for their granular scopes, allowing for more specific permissions like manipulating mailbox settings, accessing sensitive files, and even user impersonation. However, granularity does not inherently mean restraint; vendors may still request more permissions than necessary, increasing potential risks.</p>
<p>Complicating matters, the risk of data exposure and account takeover is substantial if an OAuth-integrated application is compromised. This situation is akin to any custodian acting on our behalf; the extent of the compromise is proportional to the level of trust and access we’ve granted. So understanding the granularity and necessity of OAuth scopes is crucial in safeguarding your organization’s sensitive information. It’s imperative to assess not just what permissions are possible, but also what permissions are truly necessary for the task at hand</p>
 OAuth can introduce unintentional vulnerabilities 
<p>One of the major risks lies in users granting OAuth access without fully comprehending the implications, which can lead to unintended vulnerabilities. Consider the scenario of a vulnerability in a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism</a> that allowed unauthorized access using Google credentials. Users, in their quest for convenience, might inadvertently expose sensitive company data by granting access without due diligence.</p>
<p>The accidental use of work credentials in personal applications further exacerbates the problem. This unintentional mingling of professional and personal spheres can result in a breach of company data, underscoring the need for user education on OAuth access and permissions. Here’s an example of what you might wind up with.</p>
 Navigating OAuth security concerns 
<p>Enhancing the security of your accounts can be achieved by clearly understanding the difference between “session length” and “grant validity period.” In OAuth, permissions granted to applications often allow extended, but not indefinite, access to company data, raising potential security concerns. This issue becomes particularly critical when applications with extensive permissions retain this access for prolonged periods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mitigate risks like unauthorized access, data exposure, and account takeover, it’s essential for leaders to proactively manage and monitor these OAuth grants. Regular reviews and audits of the grant validity periods are key practices in ensuring these permissions are necessary and relevant, and in maintaining the overall security and integrity of your organization’s data. <br>
<br>
Here’s a look at the OAuth request lifecycle to illustrate the issue:</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way to do this is by <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgmail-high-risk-oauth-scopes%2Cdrive-high-risk-oauth-scopes">using your Google Workspace console</a> and navigating the following path: Security &gt; Access and Data &gt; API Controls &gt; Manage third party app access &gt; View list. There, you can view apps with access, revoke access if needed, and just get a general view of what’s going on in your app environment. Check out the video below, where I walk you through it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, you can also easily track this information with YeshID. Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of app licenses, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions across different applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.</p>
<p>As leaders in the SMB space, it’s imperative to understand the intricacies of OAuth and its potential risks. By educating users, understanding OAuth scopes, and implementing security measures, SMBs can fortify their identity management practices, ensuring a robust defense against the evolving landscape of digital threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID is your partner in this effort, showcasing the identity sprawl within your organization and aiding in the vigilant management of OAuth access.

				 <p>In the inaugural episode of the <a href="https://untrustables.io/">(un)Trustables Podcast</a>, we delve into the fascinating landscape of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity (NDI) project. This groundbreaking initiative introduces Bhutan’s “edge wallet,” a highly secure mobile wallet designed to safeguard what Bhutan refers to as ‘foundational digital identity,’ the first verified credential issued to citizens.<br><a href="https://untrustables.simplecast.com/episodes/ep001-bhutan-has-launched-a-national-digital-identity-program">Listen to the full episode</a></p>
 The Birth of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity 
<p>Our conversation with Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments, reveals the genesis of Bhutan’s NDI project. This audacious endeavour embodies the vision of Bhutan’s monarchy, aligning perfectly with the principles outlined in the SSI book by Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed. The aim is clear: to create a citizen-centric digital identity system that empowers individuals and streamlines their interactions with the government and private sector.</p>
 Building Blocks of a Bhutanese Digital Identity 
<p>Bhutan’s digital identity framework is a marvel of innovation. It includes unique identifiers, permanent and current addresses, and other critical data points that form the bedrock of citizens’ digital identities. Beyond foundational identity, the NDI opens the door to many use cases, spanning government services and commercial applications.</p>
 Empowering Bhutanese Citizens with Digital Convenience 
<p>The NDI project isn’t just about innovation; it’s about transforming the lives of Bhutanese citizens. It eliminates time-consuming journeys to government offices, saving citizens valuable time and resources. Even in remote areas, the NDI project enhances accessibility, simplifying processes with mobile solutions.</p>
 Drummond Reed’s Perspective on Bhutan’s SSI Journey 
<p>Renowned digital identity expert Drummond Reed shares his initial astonishment at the audacity of Bhutan’s plan to implement a self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution at the national level. He reflects on Bhutan’s forward-thinking approach and alignment with the SSI book’s principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did research and then we read the SSI book which Drummond and Alex wrote, and we just felt so strongly that it’s exactly the vision of His Majesty, our King. We said, why don’t we just build the book? That was kind of our starting place. Since then, we embodied the principles. We really thought about what the idea of the book is and how it should benefit people. We wanted it to be very citizen-centric. – Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments</p>
</blockquote>
 Crafting Legislation and Governance for Digital Trust 
<p>Translating the SSI book’s vision into tangible legislation was a crucial step. Jacques explains how this process, guided by Drummond Reed and informed by extensive consultation with experts, culminated in the unanimous passing of an Act in Bhutan’s parliament. This legislation ensures a citizen-centric approach to digital identity.</p>
 Building an Ecosystem for Digital Trust 
<p>Drummond underscores the importance of creating a comprehensive digital trust ecosystem involving various stakeholders. Bhutan’s NDI project serves as a blueprint for other nations seeking to embark on similar digital identity journeys, emphasizing the collaborative nature of such transformative endeavours.</p>
 Addressing Device Accessibility 
<p>Inclusivity is a priority for Bhutan’s NDI project. Jacques outlines Bhutan’s strategies to ensure device accessibility for all citizens, including a fund to provide devices to families without them. For those in remote areas without mobile coverage, a unique biometric verifiable credential bridges the digital divide, enabling access when they visit friends and family with smart devices.</p>
 Digital Horizons Unveiled 
<p>Bhutan’s NDI project is a testament to the transformative power of digital identity. It offers citizens convenience, efficiency, and accessibility while laying the foundation for a more connected and digitally empowered society.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Earlier this year, Wenjing and I delved into the fascinating intersection of Digital Trust and Generative AI in an SSI Orbit podcast episode (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/digital-trust-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/">here</a>), which serves as an excellent primer on the subject for those unfamiliar with it. Since that episode, the landscape of generative AI solutions has undergone significant transformations, prompting us to record a follow-up discussion.</p>
<p>In this Part 2 episode, we were joined by Sankarshan, who co-chairs the ‘AI and Metaverse Task Force’ at the Trust over IP Foundation, alongside Wenjing. His insights added a valuable dimension to our conversation, particularly as we tackled prevalent misconceptions in the field of AI.</p>
<p>One key misconception we discussed is the belief that AI systems are purely statistical and random. We emphasized that, in reality, the world itself is inherently statistical, and AI systems are designed to mirror human decision-making processes, which are also based on statistical reasoning.</p>
<p>Another topic we explored is the common overestimation of AI’s logical reasoning capabilities and the underestimation of the constraints within AI systems. This discussion led us into the realm of AI governance. We debated the suitability of non-profit models for managing emerging technologies like AI, considering their capital-intensive nature and ongoing maturation. Examples like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/our-guide-to-openai-sam-altman-and-what-the-heck-happened-34da070b">OpenAI </a>and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-operating-costs/">Signal</a> were brought up to illustrate these points.</p>
<p>We aimed to focus part of the discussion on identifying practical solutions and low-hanging fruits for building digital trust tools. These tools are crucial for consumers to discern truth in an era increasingly dominated by generative AI-driven content. Additionally, we delved into strategies to mitigate and prevent the risks of AI abuse, especially as AI systems become more integrated with our daily lives.</p>
<p>A topic that resonated with me was the importance of provenance and authentication in AI systems, especially in content creation. We underscored the need for more robust tools to authenticate AI-generated content. However, we also acknowledged the limitations of current tools in ensuring provenance and their inability to address all security risks comprehensively.</p>
<p>Our discussion also touched upon the influence of human nature on AI development and governance. We pondered whether the current ideal-driven structures would evolve towards more traditional capitalist models, accompanied by regulation. This led to a broader conversation about the purpose of technology, which usually gets categorized as ‘a benefit to mankind’ by its creators. Yet, the complexity of implementing this ideal becomes apparent when considering who should govern these technologies and how they should be regulated.</p>
<p>This podcast episode not only sheds light on the complexities of digital trust in the age of AI but also opens up avenues for further exploration and discussion. As we move towards 2024, these conversations are more relevant than ever, guiding us towards a future where technology is both a tool for advancement and a subject of thoughtful governance.</p>

Aussie Innovators Join Forces to Tokenize $100T+ Assets with End to End Solution for Tokenization<p>In an exciting new partnership, <a href="https://www.redbelly.network/">Redbelly Network</a> and <a href="http://verida.io">Verida</a>, two prominent Australian web3 infrastructure projects, have joined forces to tackle the challenge of tokenizing and managing high-value real-world assets within regulated markets. Amid the plethora of choices in the web3 technology landscape, Verida and Redbelly aim to stand out by providing integrated end-to-end solutions that prioritize ease of use, and regulatory compliance, while offering control and security for&nbsp;users.</p> The Complexity of Real World Asset Tokenization <p>Real-world assets (RWAs) encompass a broad spectrum of tangible and intangible assets, including but not limited to real estate, commodities, intellectual property, and financial instruments. These assets, which are collectively valued at <a href="https://www.redbelly.network/blog/solving-a-trillion-dollar-problem-with-a-ground-breaking-australian-solution">over $100 trillion</a>, have long faced challenges in terms of liquidity, divisibility, and accessibility. Traditional methods of managing and transferring these assets often involve extensive paperwork, intermediaries, and protracted settlement times. The lack of standardized and efficient systems for tokenizing RWAs has hindered their liquidity and the ability to efficiently leverage their&nbsp;value.</p> Redbelly: Bridging Real-World Regulation with Web3 Efficiency <p><a href="http://redbelly.network">Redbelly Network</a>, a layer 1 blockchain born from the <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/csiro-and-the-university-of-sydneys-red-belly-blockchain-breaks-new-ground-for-speed-20180913-h15byh">University of Sydney and CSIRO</a>, stands as the world’s first formally verified blockchain protocol.

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF66 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Challenge DF Wind-Down <p>DF66 is the final round for Challenge DF.</p><p>Starting in DF67, the 1000 OCEAN/week will be redistributed equally to Volume DF and Predictoor DF.</p><p>The Active DF budget will be 37.5K / 37.5K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor DF respectively.</p><p>For more information, please read the announcement <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#d8d5">here</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $24K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Nov 23, 2023: $0.46 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.071 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.46 / OCEAN * 37,000 OCEAN = $17,020&nbsp;USD  $0.071 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,100&nbsp;USD  Total: $17,020 + $7,100 = $24,120 ≈ $24K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.

<p>As part of ongoing support, we are releasing two service patches against SSO 9.2 and SSO 9.3. Found within both of these patches are several corrections against SAML authentication-related issues. The SAML authentication issue has existed for a number of years, but was uncovered with improvements to SSO cacheing performed in SSO 9.2. Specifically, the Microsoft service SignIn with SAML, has permitted non-uniqued entityIDs to exist. Our improvement to caching uncovered this potential minor configuration issue, which is fully corrected in the patches.</p>
<p>Additionally, for SSO 9.2.1, we have included the recent update of OpenLDAP 2.5.16, which includes OpenSSL v3 libraries. For any customers using LDAPS, we encourage you to install one of these latest service patchs.</p>
<p>Please find the SSO 9.2.3 and SSO 9.3.1 patches at: <a title="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/" href="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/">https://downloads.ubisecure.com/</a></p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your Identity Platform in a timely manner. Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility, security, and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.</p>

<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) is stepping up its game in the crypto space. With its <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Consultations/2024/Consultation%20on%20Guidelines%20on%20preventing%20the%20abuse%20of%20funds%20and%20certain%20crypto-assets%20transfers%20for%20ML-TF%20%28Travel%20rule%20Guidelines%29/1063898/Consultation%20paper%20on%20draft%20travel%20rule%20Guidelines%20under%20Regulation%20%28EU%29%202023_1113.pdf">new Regulation (EU) 2023/1113</a>, open for feedback until February 26, 2024, the EBA is extending its regulatory reach, which initially kicked off in 2015, to include certain crypto-assets. This move is all about getting a better handle on tracing crypto transactions and reducing risks like money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>Here’s what’s on the&nbsp;table:</p><p>Filling in the Blanks: The guidelines zoom in on spotting and fixing missing or incomplete info in crypto transactions.</p><p>Tailored Procedures: They’re setting up ways to deal with transfers that are missing key&nbsp;details.</p><p>Risk-Based Approach: This is a big one. The guidelines give Payment Service Providers (PSPs), their intermediaries, and Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) some room to align their compliance efforts with their operational scale and risk exposure.</p><p>In this article, we dive into these guidelines, explore how they might impact various players in the crypto scene, and see how they stack up against broader EU regulations and global standards.</p> Breaking Down the New&nbsp;Rules <p>The EBA isn’t just throwing rules at the wall to see what sticks. They’ve thought this through, addressing complex tech issues&nbsp;like:</p>  Figuring out if a card or device is just for buying goods and services.  Handling tech limitations in the transfer&nbsp;process.  Dealing with different tech protocols and their compatibility (or lack thereof).  Pinpointing the exact info needed for a crypto transfer.  Managing self-hosted wallets.  Laying out duties for different PSPs in direct debit transfers.   Impact Analysis: What Does This Mean for&nbsp;Crypto? <p>If the proposed guidelines become official, the workload for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) is set to increase dramatically.</p><p>To illustrate, under the new regulations, CASPs will have to dive deeper into data collection. This includes classifying customer transactions by the types of goods or services, identifying the nature of the transaction — whether it’s for personal or business purposes, and scrutinizing transaction patterns to figure out the reasons behind payments and receipts.</p><p>The complexity doesn’t end there. CASPs must navigate the diverse protocols in the crypto and blockchain arena — some are open-network, some are closed-network, and others don’t favor any particular network. Not all of these protocols work well together, so CASPs will find themselves juggling multiple protocols to facilitate smooth transactions with each party involved. This juggling act is crucial to meet the EBA’s Travel Rule requirements, which aim to prevent data integration snags and compliance slip-ups.</p><p>Moreover, CASPs are expected to up their game in ensuring seamless and compatible information transfer in line with the heightened data requirements. They’ll need to accurately convey extensive details, including names, addresses, countries, personal document numbers, customer IDs, and even birth dates and places of the parties in the transaction.</p><p>The scenario gets even more intricate with self-hosted wallets. Previously, CASPs only needed to record wallet addresses and verify ownership for transactions above 1,000 Euros. Now, they have to individually track each transfer, whether it’s to or from a self-hosted wallet, identify the parties involved, prove ownership, and implement necessary safeguards.</p><p>Overall, CASPs are looking at a significant ramp-up in responsibilities. This necessitates more advanced technological solutions and a more thorough approach to gathering and transmitting information. They’ll have to be extra vigilant in their operations, as every aspect will demand closer attention. These enhanced obligations could lead to higher compliance costs and potential delays, especially initially due to the complexity and newness of these requirements.</p> Impact on Crypto Transactions Between an EU and non-EU Crypto&nbsp;Firm <p>Under the potential new rules, non-EU parties involved in transactions with EU-based counterparts would face broader data disclosure requirements.</p><p>This involves providing basic location information like the country name, postal codes, cities, states, provinces, and even down to the level of municipalities, street names, building numbers, and&nbsp;names.</p><p>In instances where the provided name, account number, address, and other official documents don’t clearly identify the parties involved, an extra layer of information would be necessary. This means that Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) would also need to gather and disclose personal details like the date and place of birth of the individuals participating in the transaction.</p><p>So, any non-EU crypto firms doing business with EU counterparts will need to be ready to share a lot more&nbsp;data.</p> Final Thoughts <p>As we’re in the consultation phase, it’s a waiting game to see if these guidelines strike the right balance between tight security and fostering innovation in blockchain technology. For now, it’s a matter of watching and waiting as the situation unfolds.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Keeping up with the latest security challenges can feel like you are running a race that has endless hurdles. From rapid advancements in technology – rendering old hardware obsolete – to increasingly stringent requirements and regulations, the time and costs can quickly become enormous.</p>
<p>Many of these challenges are related to the migration of compute, storage, and backup services to cloud services. Picture this, you have moved your databases to the cloud. But are you in control of your encryption keys? Do you know who has a copy or could access a copy?</p>
<p>Today’s solutions offer your organization a choice of how to most effectively secure your encryption keys. You can select a solution that allows your organization to secure your keys in an on-premise HSM or one that allows your organization to protect your keys via a secure connection to a cloud-based HSM with an HSM-as-a-Service (HSMaaS) offering such as Entrust’s nShield-as-a-Service solution.</p>
<p>Entrust recently partnered with TechValidate to conduct a survey to understand how companies view and are implementing HSMaaS solutions.</p>
<p>From On-Premise to the Cloud</p>
<p>For years, the best practice was to use an HSM deployed on-premise. Concerns about security of software based key storage, separation of keys, and sovereignty requirements made it the only viable option. Over time, as-a-service HSM offerings appeared in the market offering lower costs, and a level of security comparable to on-premise HSMs, with more flexibility and quicker implementation.</p>
<p>The Survey Says</p>
<p>Today’s organizations are looking to save time and money. The survey showed that 57% of organizations said a key reason for considering subscribing to an HSMaaS offering is to reduce IT management costs. Further, 69% of respondents said that their organizations would realize reduced spend on physical infrastructure. The next closest benefit noted was improved efficiency with 46% of the respondents selecting that benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The focus on saving time and reducing expenses has also been a significant driver of cloud adoption. With the rise of cloud service providers, as-a-service-HSM offerings evolved even further. Leading cloud service providers offer their own unique approach to securing your encryption keys. While these offerings provide convenience and cost-effective solutions, they do not always meet internal security requirements set by some organizations adding further to the complexity involved when deciding how to store your encryption keys.</p>
<p>In addition to saving time and money, HSMaaS solutions like Entrust nShield-as-a-Service provide the same level of support for a wide range of applications. This is something that was also reflected in the survey results. Respondents indicated that once onboarded, they would leverage an HSMaaS solution for a variety of functions.</p>
<p>The top functions ranked were public key infrastructure (PKI), which was mentioned by 60% of respondents followed by key management which was selected by 57% of respondents. Data encryption/decryption and digital signatures were also mentioned by nearly half of the respondents (49%). These results reinforce the similarities in functionality between on-premise HSM and HSMaaS offerings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Important Cloud Key Management Considerations</p>
<p>Saving time and money are necessary criteria when considering implementing an HSMaaS solution. However, they are not the only considerations you should have when deciding what as-a-service HSM offering to use when storing your encryption keys. It is important to also consider:</p>
 
 Security – Make sure you understand how the HSMaaS offering works. Are you sharing the cloud-based HSM with other users or is it for your exclusive use? This is often referred to as single-tenancy vs multi-tenancy. You must ensure that you chose the right solution to match your risk profile and requirements. 
 Sovereignty of keys. Can the HSMaaS provider guarantee what country or region your keys will physically stored in? Will you be compliant with the regulations affecting your organization? 
 Integrations and the compatibility of the key management software with other vendors. Does it integrate with the other products and services used by your organization? 
 Ease of comprehensive key management for the entire organization. Does the solution give you the ability to rotate, generate, discard, and easily access information required during an audit? 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>When evaluating these considerations and HSMaaS solutions, partnering with a company that understands your holistic security and encryption needs will simplify this process. While cost is always a driving factor, ensuring you are in control of your keys is the most important. Ensuring where your keys are stored for key sovereignty requirements, the available integrations and the key management capabilities need to be carefully reviewed. The right keys need to be stored in the right places, using a solution that will protect your business and significantly enhance your organization’s security.</p>

<p>With credential stuffing attacks on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/">23andMe</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/no-okta-senior-management-not-an-errant-employee-caused-you-to-get-hacked/">Okta</a> just the latest breaches to make headlines in recent weeks, the push for biometrics-based authentication is gaining momentum for Identity and Access Management (IAM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem: Biometrics aren’t all created equal. Yes, device-based biometrics such as Touch ID, Face ID, and Windows Hello can help reduce the threat of password-based account takeover (ATO). But they can still leave IT guessing about the identity behind the device. While hardware tokens and Apple, Microsoft and Google’s decision to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/google-makes-passkeys-the-default-sign-in-method-for-all-users/">passkeys the default</a> for logins are also helpful, they really only confirm possession of a device or biometric and assume (but don’t validate) identity. Thankfully, it doesn’t have to be this way—if you have the right IAM architecture.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Device: Enabling F-Word Free Authentication&nbsp; 
<p>Whether it’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/public-schools-in-denver-colorado-hit-with-breach-fingerprint-scans-grabbed">fingerprints</a> or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/heres-the-newest-camera-hack-fraudsters-are-using-to-beat-facial-recognition">facial recognition</a>, that which is stored can be stolen or spoofed by cybercriminals to infiltrate corporate systems. Hell, even without a hack, traditional forms of biometric authentication only confirm the person accessing an account is the same person who initially enrolled to do so—but not whether that person is really who they claim to be. This matters when enrollment fraud leads to more than <a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/javelins-identity-fraud-study-highlights-the-changing-nature-of-fraud/">$3.2 billion</a> in losses annually. For me, “fraud” is an f-word that typically leads to others we could all do without. That’s where 1Kosmos comes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity-Backed Biometrics &amp; Modern IAM Architectures 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we saw the urgency of finding a way to easily and accurately verify and authenticate identity in a way that can’t be vouched for by mere password, one-time passcode, or a static (and spoofable) biometric. That’s why we set out to modernize IAM by combining strong identity verification and authentication within a unified architecture. One that offers unrivaled identity assurance behind each device used to access online services, along with a seamless account enrollment and authentication experience. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we provided an overview of this architecture and the pillars it’s built upon. In this post, let’s double-click on a core pillar: <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">biometric-based user authentication.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a> employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with 99.6% accuracy, stores them under user control, and binds them to an identity wallet and biometric with liveness detection. This gives IT the security and control they need while providing users with a seamless login experience. The benefits are threefold:&nbsp;</p>
<p>High Assurance</p>
<p>Biometrics verified through liveness testing deliver the highest digital identity assurance possible and enable fast, frictionless multi-factor authentication. When matched to a verified identity, they eliminate fraudulent identities hiding behind valid credentials.</p>
<p>User Convenience</p>
<p>Physical attributes used for biometric authentication are not vulnerable to damage and unexpected alterations. They provide quick, user-friendly authentication with or without passwords.</p>
<p>Flexible Use Cases</p>
<p>Whether the use case demands a fingerprint, voice match, a live biometric or other identifier, the 1Kosmos architecture provides affordable authenticators that adjust to varied and evolving business needs.</p>
 Building Bulletproof Biometric Authentication 
<p>We didn’t just follow the most effective approach to identity-backed biometric authentication. We defined it. 1Kosmos offers the only IAM architecture built with four crucial elements of identity-backed biometric authentication:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certification to FIDO2, NIST 800-63-3 and UKDIATF Standards</p>
<p>Our BlockID platform is certified to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO</a>, <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST</a> and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/kitcp-06-01-certificate-1kosmos/">UKDIATF</a> standards, having undergone rigorous testing to verify quality coding and ensure the use of common devices to authenticate users. When combined with a verified identity, you’re talking about unmatched security and convenience. BlockID supports USB keys, keycard authentication, fingerprint readers, and hardware tokens and provides a robust framework to implement or augment passwordless authentication without being forced into using a single provider. With identity-backed biometrics, you also benefit from stronger security using physical traits. Think fingerprint scan with a USB security key or FIDO-compliant facial recognition, for instance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, biometrics can improve security by replacing or augmenting the use of passwords, but they can also be subject to theft or spoofing. iBeta is an independent, NIST-accredited biometrics testing lab that has developed certification programs to verify biometric applications to recognized standards to prevent these things from happening. When enrolling with our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID</a> solution, the user can perform an advanced form of biometrics called a liveness test that prevents false facial verification using a photo, video, mask, or other substitute for an authorized user’s face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometric Encryption</p>
<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/12/what-is-biometric-encryption/">Biometric encryption</a> leverages a biometric template and public-private key pair to encrypt and decrypt personally identifiable information for authenticating a user and sharing data with an online service. This approach relies on the uniqueness of biometrics to ensure that hackers can’t reverse-engineer a password or key. Without the biometric and matching private key, all data in the digital wallet isn’t accessible, usable, or even legible. There’s no central storage of user biometrics, ensuring these biometrics remain private. Biometric authentication is easy to use and requires little, if any, user training.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flexible Levels of Identity Assurance</p>
<p>With BlockID, you determine the type of biometric appropriate for a given application and the level of identity assurance appropriate to the business risk. For <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/customer-onboarding-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/know-your-business-compliance-guide/">Know Your Business</a> (KYB) standards, Identity Assurance Level 2 can be achieved using <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">LiveID</a> and identity verification using government-issued credentials, such as a driver’s license or passport. A liveness test confirms a user’s facial match to the enrolled biometric and verified documents in real-time.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Lesser forms of identity assurance can be achieved using information from banking, telco, or corporate databases or through “inferred” identity based on access to an email address or logged-in device, as appropriate for the intended use. For additional use cases, 1Kosmos can also verify a user’s social security number (SSN) against the SSA, a driver’s license against the American Association of Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), a passport against ICAO or the US Department of State, or verify a user is indeed a physician by validating their NPIN (National Physician Information Number).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As documentation and accounts are enrolled, the location and phone number are verified against the issuing authority. The user’s LiveID scan is then validated against the picture extracted from the documentation. Once complete, their biometrics are captured, and the data is encrypted with the user’s private key and stored within a private and permissioned blockchain.</p>
<p>An Unbeatable Advantage&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Part Three, we’ll drill down on another core pillar of the 1Kosmos architecture: decentralized digital identity and how it provides users with secure anytime, anywhere access to ID cards, driver licenses, social security details, and more through a reusable identity wallet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  Die Abkündigung von SAP Identity Management (SAP IDM) stellt Unternehmen vor eine kritische Herausforderung. Die bisherige Lösung erreicht das Ende ihres Lebenszyklus, und Organisationen müssen sich nun die Frage stellen: Wie kann trotzdem weiterhin Compliance aufrechterhalten werden?  Die Gewährleistung der Identitätsverwaltung unter Berücksichtigung der gesetzlichen Bestimmungen entwickelt sich zu einem zentralen Anliegen für Fachleute im Bereich Informationstechnologie. 

In diesem Kontext suchen Unternehmen nach effektiven Wegen, um die bisherigen Ansätze und Verfahren aus dem SAP IDM-Umfeld auf andere Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)-Systeme zu migrieren. SailPoint und IBM präsentieren innovative Ansätze, wie moderne Technologien eingesetzt werden können, um IGA-Systeme zu erweitern und deren Vorteile optimal zu nutzen. Dieser Schritt eröffnet neue Wege für Unternehmen, um ihre Identitätsmanagement-Strategien anzupassen und den Herausforderungen des Endes von SAP IDM proaktiv zu begegnen.

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Heather Flanagan, Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and David Birch, Principal at 15 Mb, author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. 
<p>This is the 100th episode of Let’s Talk about Digital Identity – in this special episode two of our most popular guests, Heather Flanagan and David Birch, rejoined the podcast to explore what is exciting them in passwordless, identity wallets and digital money.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“Passwords have got to go. As we’re moving to passkeys, I think there’s always room for improvement on – even on them. If nothing else, focusing a little bit more on the user experience so that people will have a better understanding of what this means.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Heather Flanagan, Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and choreographer for Identity Flash Mob, comes from a position that the Internet is led by people, powered by words, and inspired by technology. She has been involved in leadership roles with some of the most technical, volunteer-driven organisations on the Internet, including IDPro as Principal Editor, the IETF, the IAB, and the IRTF as RFC Series Editor, ICANN as Technical Writer, and REFEDS as Coordinator, just to name a few. If there is work going on to develop new Internet standards, or discussions around the future of digital identity, she is interested in engaging in that work.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The thing that’s broken in digital money at the moment, is identity, not the payment bit.”</p></blockquote>
<p>David G.W Birch is an author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. Principal at 15Mb, his advisory company, he is Global Ambassador for the secure electronic transactions consultancy, Consult Hyperion, Fintech Ambassador for Digital Jersey and Non-Executive Chair at Digiseq Ltd. He is an internationally-recognised thought leader in digital identity and digital money. Ranked one of the top 100 fintech influencers for 2021, previously named one of the global top 15 favourite sources of business information by Wired magazine and one of the top ten most influential voices in banking by Financial Brand, he created one of the top 25 “must read” financial IT blogs and was found by PR Daily to be one of the top ten Twitter accounts followed by innovators (along with Bill Gates and Richard Branson).</p>
<p>His latest book “The Currency Cold War—Cash and Cryptography, Hash Rates and Hegemony” (published in May 2020) “paints a fascinating and stimulating picture of the future of the world of digital payments and its possible impact on the wider global and economic orders” – Philip Middleton, OMFIF Digital Monetary Institute. His previous book “Before Babylon, Beyond Bitcoin: From money we understand to money that understands us” was published in June 2017 with a foreword by Andrew Haldane, Chief Economist at the Bank of England. The LSE Review of Books said the book should be “widely read by graduate students of finance, financial law and related topics as well as policy makers involved in financial regulation”.&nbsp; The London Review of Books called his earlier book “Identity is the New Money” fresh, original, wide-ranging and “the best book on general issues around new forms of money”.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This is episode number 100 of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And for this special occasion, we have invited back Heather Flanagan, and David Birch.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>We have invited back to the show two of our most popular guests. So, these two guests, let me introduce them is Heather Flanagan. She is Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and Acting Executive Director for IDPro. Hello, Heather.</p>
<p>Heather Flanagan: Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Nice having you back.</p>
<p>And our second guest is David Birch. David Birch is an author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. He is Principal at 15 Mb, his advisory company. Hello, David.</p>
<p>David Birch: Hi. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a real pleasure having you both for this special episode, a bit different style, so being out of our usual script. But yeah, hearing a little bit more about yourselves.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to hear something in particular, because we want to hear something – a moment in your lives. So, what I want to hear – think of one specific moment in your career in which you told yourself, “Yes, this is why I love working in the identity industry.” Which moment would it be? Who wants to start?</p>
<p>David: Well, and it’s a bit self-centred, but probably when my publisher agreed to publish my first book. I thought I had some interesting ideas about identity – I mean you always think that your ideas are – but when you get that kind of validation that your ideas actually are interesting to other people. That really did change my career. Yeah, otherwise, I probably would have just carried on being a pretty average consultant and carried on in payments and banking. So yeah, it’s – but I put it all down to my publisher.</p>
<p>Oscar: Which one was this book? Tell us which book was this.</p>
<p>David: Identity is the New Money. It was Diane Coyle, the Economist, who encouraged me to publish it. So yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Heather?</p>
<p>Heather: I don’t have anything. I’ve been actually thinking about this question for a while, and it’s really hard to point to any one thing, because there were no lightning from the sky moments. It’s just, it’s always been such a foundational aspect of everything that I’ve ever done since I started in tech in the mid ‘90s. Where the first question was always – when you’re taking over something from a bulletin board system to an email server, “Who can access this? What permissions do they need to have? How do you set up accounts for them?” That was where everything always started. So, no one moment, it’s all of the moments.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, that’s great that there are several exciting moments. I’m sure for all of us, it’s been like that. Several moments in which we feel that this is exciting to be in this industry. But thank you for sharing that with us.</p>
<p>Being already towards the end of this year 2023 – so there are some keywords which were buzzing in the last years. But some of these buzzwords today are more reality, we have access to those. What do you think, what you feel about these technologies or techniques. And let’s get started with passwordless. So, if I ask Heather, what excites you today about passwordless?</p>
<p>Heather: I’m really excited about the fact that the technology itself is solid, the standards themselves are really, really well-done. But as excited as I am, I am concerned. Like at all the new modern technologies, I look at them and go, “Wow, that’s really cool.” and little anxiety making because for passwordless, what I observe is when you actually get out of the tech field and talk to my mother, she doesn’t trust it because it’s too easy.</p>
<p>And so, I do wonder about as bad as passwords are, the friction that they add, it’s something that people can wrap their heads around. Whereas they don’t understand the magic that’s happening behind the scenes that makes passkeys better. And if they don’t trust it, they won’t use it. And if they don’t use it, we lose out on all the benefits. So, one of the things I’ve been trying to think about for you know, the future is OK passkeys are amazing, but how can we make them less magic scary?</p>
<p>David: I’m a bit frustrated with it really, because I’m extremely lazy. And so, you know, like eBay, for example, uses passkeys, the whole thing works perfectly. So as soon as I go to a site, as in fact I just did 10 minutes ago to look at something and it’s log back in. I’m like, “What I have an account? I didn’t even know I had the account.” And then I had to remember the password. And of course, I didn’t get it. So, I had to click on, I forgot my password, and then I got the password reset. And then I put in the new password. And it said, “You can’t have a new password that’s the same as the old password.” And we just go around in this loop. And it drives me crazy. I’m like, “Why can’t you just all implement this?” Despite the fears of your mom, which I mean I can’t discount those because they’re real. The sooner we make people stop using passwords, the better.</p>
<p>I was reading a fantastic story in the Insider this morning. Did you see this story about the Zelle fraud on Insider? It’s typical kind of thing, you know, guys getting some work done by a contractor. The hackers get into the contractor’s email account, they send him a thing to send money to a different account, which is the hackers’ account. And they make off with all of the money. And so, they go and talk to the contractor and said to him, “You know, did you know that your email has been compromised, you should change your email password.”</p>
<p>And the guy, it says in the article, “We may as well have been speaking Romanian.” The guy had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. Because he’s a normal person. He doesn’t care about all of this stuff. You don’t say to people, “Oh, here’s a car, would you like a seat belt with it? Or would you like a piece of string that you could attach in, you know, particularly opt in place.” You know, as a society, it comes to a point where you say, “I’m sorry, not wearing seatbelts, there’s just too many people dying. So, cars have to have seatbelts. And you have to put the damn things on. End of story.”</p>
<p>And I sort of feel we’re getting to that point. Fraud and scam, it’s just so completely out of control. And this thing about whether you know, you need to put people in charge of their own data and so on. I just don’t believe that for a moment. I just don’t. Most people don’t have the persistent competence that – including me, by the way, I’m not casting the first stone, I’m one of those people that lacks the persistent competence to make this happen. There are reservations but passkeys are a billion times better than passwords, and we should make people use them. I’m sorry, you got to stop pandering to populism.</p>
<p>Heather: No two ways about it – Passwords have got to go. As we’re moving to passkeys, I think there’s always room for improvement on – even on them. If nothing else, focusing a little bit more on the user experience so that people will have a better understanding of what this means. And when they click this button, why would they click this as opposed to clicking something else that might be a phishing site that they wouldn’t recognise. So, it’s an ongoing education.</p>
<p>David: Then you sort of think of contactless as the, you know, in the early days of contactless people, “Oh, it’s too scary.” And in some parts of the world, it appears to be witchcraft, that you can pay for things by not touching it with your card and this, people are going to come and steal all the cards. And there are going to be people of Eastern European origin on the subway system, putting their hands inside your clothes to read your cards and all this. Remember all of this stuff that was going on?</p>
<p>And now, you walk into a store, anywhere in the world. I’m not talking America, I’m talking about developed countries, of course. You walk into a store anywhere in the world, and there’s that little contactless symbol and you pay, and you go, and no one thinks anything about it anymore. It’s a bit different in America. In America, you have to look for the till and where’s the sign? And then you have to press some buttons. And then sometimes you have to sign something as well. It’s baffling. I don’t understand any of it.</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, the day you understand what happens in the United States will be a marvellous day. Because nobody understands what happens.</p>
<p>David: No, it’s mysterious. But the point is, generally speaking, you know, we came up with this symbol, and everybody knows, you tap your card there, and it works. And guess what? All of your money isn’t stolen by Eastern European fraudsters. So, they’re not all Eastern European, obviously, other fraudsters are available. Because the corollary is going to be basically, people like us will start using passkeys, and so all the fraud will transfer onto people like your mom. That seems a little unfair to me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, seeing that you are excited indeed with passwordless. But of course, there are some concerns and some things to improve. Absolutely. Interesting what Heather said that, yeah, some people have been using password for so long, but that anything else feels like how do you say the…</p>
<p>David: An improvement? Real security? System-wide integrity? I don’t know, what’s the word you’re searching for there? I don’t know.</p>
<p>Oscar: How you say the…</p>
<p>Heather: Magic.</p>
<p>Oscar: Magic. Yeah, magic.</p>
<p>David: So, I’m excited as Heather is, I’m probably just a bit more militant on how quickly we should be pushing it out.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, we’ll see what comes in the next year as how it really rolls out. But the next one is about identity wallets. So, what excites you today about identity wallets?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, I have a list on that one. I’m particularly excited over how – as much as I worry about people not understanding the magic, they do understand the concept of flipping through a wallet to get to the right card, the right credential, the right thing they need and then using it and giving them that level of control is a vast improvement, I think over some of the other technology has been going on today.</p>
<p>I’m watching what’s happening in Europe quite closely because I think that – how the governments are handling digital wallets and digital identity is a very interesting model. I will be curious to see how other countries do it. How they do it well, how they do it poorly. And if there’s some way we can actually – I’d love to standardise ‘what’s a wallet’, you know. That’s one of my little pet peeves, there is no standard for a wallet. There’s standard for credentials, but there’s not a standard for ‘what is a wallet’.</p>
<p>David: I mean, it’s interesting to see what the Open Wallet initiative and various other people are doing in this space. I agree with Heather. I think as much as the technology is important, and certainly, in technological terms, the wallet is the sort of crucial pivot between the kind of online and offline world. It’s very central to the next phase of evolution of commerce. A lot of it has to do with – in fact, we won’t even call our wallets now identity wallets, we just call them wallets. But if you actually open up my wallet, I mean, I won’t do it over there. If you open up my wallet, it has no money in it. Everything is in my wallet, it has to do with identity, driver’s licenses and loyalty cards. And my wallet is already an identity wallet, we just don’t call it that.</p>
<p>So, extending that wallet across sort of virtual and real world seems to me, pretty straightforward. But of course, that does rather interestingly open up what I think will be quite a vicious battle about who’s actually going to control those wallets. Because certainly, Heather mentioned kind of the European approach. They’re very, very unhappy with the idea of big tech controlling those wallets. We’re very unhappy with the big tech or big government controlling the wallets. People like me will prefer that it was regulated institutions – banks primarily, that control those wallets. Other people think banks should be absolutely the last people to have any sort of control over those wallets. So really, I’m not smart enough to figure out like the end dimensional gameplay as to how this is going to work out. But it’s pretty serious. It’s pretty serious.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, people understand the concept of a wallet. But what we’re talking about in today’s world is that, you know, “how many wallets are you going to have to carry?” Because there may be one that’s issued by big tech, perhaps via your browser or via your mobile device. But then, you know, as governments are saying, “No, we’re going to issue something that’s completely separate and have its own app, and what is that going to look like. And then how are people supposed to be able to find the credential they need across 2, 3, 5 different wallets?</p>
<p>David: No, I agree with you completely on that, Heather. But I think there’s another level of complexity there as well, which is – because is the wallet going to be like if you imagine there’s some kind of standard wallet, is that wallet the app? Or is that wallet, essentially the underlying SDK the apps plug into?</p>
<p>So, my British Airways app and my Barclays Bank app, they’re all actually the same wallet underneath. They’re all plugging into the same wallet. But is it going to be like that? Is there going to be like a travel industry wallet? Or is British Airways going to have its own wallet? That’s really hard to know. I would think, and this comes from kind of what I think is a reasonably rational calculus. The credentials that are going to be in those wallets are the embodiment of individual reputations.</p>
<p>My British Airways credential is the embodiment of my relationship with British Airways, that I want to take and show to other people. It’s not obvious to me that British Airways would benefit from owning the wallet, because they’d have to maintain it and upgrade it and whatever. They’re having enough trouble just with their own website to do that. On the other hand, I can see why they’d be nervous about just handing the whole thing over to Apple and Google, because then they’ll end up paying a tax, which I’m pretty sure they don’t want to do. So, I don’t know how that’s going to work out. But I listen to a lot of smart people about this. It’s a very fascinating topic to me.</p>
<p>Heather: I talked to Don Thibeau and Juliana Cafik and a couple others about “what was the Open Wallet Foundation trying to do?” And they’re trying to work towards interoperability in code and maybe a standard will come out of that someday when they see what works and what doesn’t work. But at the moment, they are not standardising wallets. They’re just…</p>
<p>David: No, that’s true. There’s…</p>
<p>Heather: They’re just putting together a platform to try and make it work together.</p>
<p>David: But as you pointed out earlier on, some of the components are standardised. We have VCs, we have MDL. We’ve got MDL 7 and 9 coming in a few months, a year or something. So I mean, there is some pretty useful standardisation going on anyway.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, more in the credential format space.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That might give us enough interoperability to get started.</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ll see. Indeed, it sounds like it’s…</p>
<p>David: I’m a naturally simple and optimistic person. Heather’s looking at all the nuances here. And that’s why she’s so, that’s why my superficial, cheery approach to this – it’s not washing with her I can see it from her face.</p>
<p>Oscar: You seem to be both excited about identity wallets, I think.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I think wallets are really interesting topic for the coming year.</p>
<p>Heather: Huge potential.</p>
<p>Oscar: You, David, mentioned that as far as I understood, you don’t carry cash anymore, that was my understanding how you have your wallet, your real wallet without cash.</p>
<p>David: No, actually, I mean I don’t carry my real wallet, it’s in the drawer over there. So, I had an interesting conversation with somebody last week about premium cards. That’s how interesting my life is, Heather. I just, I benchmark, I had an interesting discussion with someone else last week about premium cards. This is a tragic trajectory of my life.</p>
<p>But I have this fancy new American Express Platinum Card, which is made out of some sort of metal. I don’t know if it’s actually platinum, but it’s sort of metal. And it’s really fancy and heavy and solid and whatever. And I couldn’t even tell you where it is. It’s in the house somewhere. I haven’t the slightest idea.</p>
<p>Oscar: Don’t activate it.</p>
<p>David: No, no, because as soon as I got it, it’s on my phone. I only ever use it on my phone. I don’t know where the actual card is, I have no interest in that. I’m going into London in a minute, I have a ring. So, the ring I use for getting on the subway and bus because I don’t always want to take my phone out. But if I’m paying in a restaurant so I got to use my phone. I think the days of physical wallets, I mean, lots of people keep saying, well, there’s going to be a backlash at some point, and people are going to want to use cash, sort of the way they want to use vinyl records, I suppose. But I think that will just be like a few hipsters. I don’t think it’ll be the rest of us.</p>
<p>Heather: I don’t trust having network access consistently enough to go without some kind of physical something. Do I use my wallet on my watch and my phone more often than not? Well, when I’m in Europe, yes. When I’m in the US, maybe. I don’t count on it. I don’t think I can count on it yet. So, there’s always the physical components that I think I have to have.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I mean, I would say that’s an interesting argument in favour of using offline verifiable credentials. And it’s also a crucial argument in favour as to why Central Bank Digital Currency should operate offline. So, I mean, I agree with you about that. As to the state of things at the moment, well, if the transit gates fail and can’t go online, they have to fail open, it’s a public safety issue. You can’t fail transit gate shut. So, they have to, they should have – I can always get home, you know, but it’s never happened. But when push comes to shove, I’ll get home, so I’m fine.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and that related to my last question, but just to hear what you liked the most. So, what excites you about this digital money that we were already starting to discuss?</p>
<p>David: I’d say there’s probably three things. I mean, Heather’s going to disagree with me on every single one of them, which is why it makes for an interesting conversation. But I’d say there’s probably three things.</p>
<p>So, the first thing is digital money, well, certainly digital currency is the subject of irrational delusional comment by conspiracy theorists, which makes for entertainment. So, I get emails, “oh, you know, Central Bank Digital Currency is the mark of the devil. And we know this because Bill Gates implanted microchips in us through the vaccine, and the microchips are going to steal the digital currency from unvaccinated people and send it through the 5g towers to Satan.” Or somebody, I can’t remember exactly, I don’t remember. But you get emails like this, which add to the gaiety of the nation.</p>
<p>So, the first thing is, there are parts of America where non-existent digital currency is already being banned. So, this is all getting a bit, sort of witch trail-y, so that’s quite entertaining.</p>
<p>The second thing is, and I wasn’t joking about that offline point, which is any scale digital currency in any developed country, even where you have networks and infrastructure has to work offline. It’s the crucial design requirement of it. If you’re going to have a cash substitute, it has to work offline. And that, for me, poses very interesting technological problems, all of which I think, have already been solved. But nonetheless, it’s really intellectually interesting, so I sort of like that.</p>
<p>And the third thing is, I think a lot of people look at digital currency as ‘the thing’. Like, you know, we need digital currency. And that’s it. I mean, what we need is a platform for innovation and development. Digital currency in itself is sort of not that interesting. As we’ve just established, I can already buy milk in the supermarket without using physical cash. So that’s not, but this idea of permissionless innovation that you could bring into our space from the cryp– because digital it doesn’t involve any credit risk, you see. So, you could imagine a situation where as long as you’ve got an approved chip in your iPhone, or something, they’re certified as being capable of storing digital dollars or something like that, then you can use the API to do whatever you like, there’s no credit risk involved. So, allowing people to experiment with interesting new things – micro payments, and Escrow and blah, blah, blah. On top of it is really where it’s at. And that’s why, you know, I get it a bit when people say, “Well, what are the sort of key uses?” Well, I don’t know, I’m too old. Give it to some kids in a garage and let them come up with something.</p>
<p>Heather: OK. So, for one thing, I really want to see your emails about this because they sound hilarious. I admit, I’m absolutely a digital currency sceptic. For one thing, as David has said, right, you don’t generally need to carry cash now anyway, so what is it getting you? And everything I understand about it is like, “Well, yes, but then you’ll be able to transfer money quickly without the bank getting in the way.” And I’m like, “Hmm, you say the bank getting in the way and verifying the transaction is a bad thing.” “Oh, but it’s expensive.” And I’m like, “Well, that’s a different problem, not just because the banks are charging a lot.” So that’s like a completely different problem to solve that it’s not a technology problem at all.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’m definitely not convinced. Having the permission to innovate and work with this kind of currency, to me in a way, that’s like saying, “Yup, let’s turn this into a barter system, except you’re bartering these digital currency components.” “OK. Go for it, go to town.” That’s just people agreeing with each other. And it’s a completely different system in the same way that a barter system is completely different with my cash system.</p>
<p>David: That’s a really interesting point. And I don’t mean that in any sort of patronising sense, I really mean that because you’re right, of course. And what that means is, if this stuff worked, then downstream you could imagine an environment where if you and I engage in some sort of transaction, right, I’m going to pay you to write something or you’re going to pay me to come and speak or something like that. My, you know, supercomputer at the end of a wire, it can be a through my mobile phone, my giant killer robot artificially intelligent wallet will negotiate with your super intelligent giant killer robot Terminator wallet to exchange baskets of tokens to an agreed –</p>
<p>The idea that you would need money as an intermediary when you have that kind of barter that works. I think that’s really, that’s as a very interesting point. So, if our super computers could agree on these baskets of assets to exchange, which sounds weird when its people talking about it, but it’s a few nanoseconds for super computers. Why would you turn those assets into dollars or something in the first place? Why wouldn’t you just swap the assets around?</p>
<p>So, I actually rather agree with that point. But I think that’s much further downstream. I think, in the short term, you see the demand for dollar stable coins in particular, as an indication to me that a lot of people around the world and in America, for that matter, wants to hold digital dollars. They would find digital dollars useful to do things with that you can’t do with regular dollars, and I sort of agree.</p>
<p>So, I can see sort of both things. But to me, the short term and the long term are quite different there. Because I probably do drink my Kool Aid, and I’d probably do think that that’s kind of a stupid expression actually it’s, don’t drink that Kool Aid because everybody that drank the Kool Aid died, didn’t they? Or am I getting the stories mixed up?</p>
<p>Heather: I wasn’t going to say it.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, no, I think they did. OK, that’s a bad example. But the point is, I think in the long run, you might well be right. I think in the short term, digital currencies, I think would add to the net welfare. I mean, I can imagine, you and I agreeing to something, and the money just goes from my digital wallet to your digital wallet. It never goes anywhere near the banking system. It just goes over Bluetooth or whatever but yes. It is exciting. That’s true.</p>
<p>Oscar: Heather, what’s not so exciting to digital money?</p>
<p>Heather: We’ll see.</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ll see. We’ll see. Anything else that it’s for you is exciting?</p>
<p>David: What’s not working digital money, you know, these answers are intertwined, because the thing that’s broken in digital money at the moment, is identity, not the payment bit. Like the reason why you’ve got Zelle frauds and authorised push payment frauds and these massive crypto scams going on all the time. It’s because nobody knows who anybody is. It’s not because the payments don’t work properly. It’s because identity doesn’t work properly.</p>
<p>If the identity, you know, I’m going to sound like a broken record on this one for the teenagers there. I’m going to sound like a vinyl implement that used to go around whether it has a scratch in it. So, this sort of needle would prompt up, down and come back to this, I have to talk them through this metaphor. But I’m going to sound like a broken record on this. Because if you fix the identity problem, payments are easy.</p>
<p>If you know the reputation of all of the counterparties in a transaction, then pricing the risk in that transaction is easy. And that’s kind of what we should be aiming for. The next phase of evolution is really about identity. It happens that I think, and I can’t prove this with any kind of actual analysis, this is just my sort of crackpot theory about this. But actually, if central banks do drive forward with digital currency, digital currency doesn’t work unless you have digital identity. You can’t give people wallets unless you know who those people are. You can’t maintain limits on personal holdings unless you know who’s got the wallets. There must be an identity system for the currency system to work. So it could be that Central Bank Digital Currency actually turns out to be a vector for people like Heather to actually get something done about wallets and digital identity. So, there’s an interesting interrelationship there.</p>
<p>Heather: They are certainly tied together. There’s no two questions about that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Anything else that you think that is exciting today in the identity world that we have not covered?</p>
<p>David: Well, there’s two things I’m excited about today. I can tell you what I was doing before I came on this call. So, one is – I’m very excited about only because I’m not a normal person. I’m very excited about ultra-wideband technology. So, all iPhones for a while, you know some of the top end Samsung’s you know Apple Air Tags, things like this, they all have this thing in them called you UWB, Ultra-Wideband which a lot of people kind of overlook a little bit because we focus everything on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. But when Bluetooth and Wi Fi came out there were actually three wireless standards. There was Bluetooth, UWB and Wi-Fi. And UWB never really got used because the Wi-Fi chips got cheaper much quicker, and everybody just started building Wi-Fi into things. And meanwhile Bluetooth ranges went up.</p>
<p>But ultra-wideband, which is short range, medium speed that uses this pulsed radio. Because of the way it works, it can only tell where things are, this is how Air Tags work. But it can also tell whether you’re moving towards something or away from it. So, this idea of having a phone that knows you’re walking up to the point-of-sale terminal or knows you’re walking up to a door. And the way that Apple are part of this digital car keys alliance, which I’m very interested in with Google, and I think BMW and people like that.</p>
<p>So, this idea that you have one technology like this, which locates you, you’re walking towards the POS terminal, and then it flips to Bluetooth to execute an actually secure transaction with real cryptography, and real keys. I’m really interested in that at the moment for a variety of different ways. So that’s the first thing.</p>
<p>And the second thing is, and I think we have touched on this before, we think of identity as being about people. But actually, everything needs identity. And when everything has an identity, working out how to get both privacy and security in that environment is really rather complicated. It’s very intellectually challenging. And that’s what I’m spending the rest of my time on with another startup at the moment. So yeah, there’s no end of things to be excited about in this space, honestly. And frankly, figuring out how people can log into their bank account without password is the least interesting of the things that’s going on at the moment.</p>
<p>Heather: Probably the most interesting thing that I’m trying to stay on top of right now is watching the standards development space, because that is like one of my favourite things to do. Because I might also be a little bit of a strange person. So, standards development space, seeing how ISO, the IETF, the W3C, as well as some of the smaller standard’s organisations like the OpenID Foundation, the Decentralised Identity Foundation, Trust Over IP, how they’re all circling closer and closer to each other and sometimes hitting each other, bouncing off.</p>
<p>You know, it’s becoming a really dense space to try and follow and understand what’s happening with W3C verifiable credentials? How do those relate to the ISO MDOC standards, and what’s happening with the IETF’s OAuth and CBOR and you know, all of these different standard’s groups are all starting to get closer and closer at nibbling down this problem. And they’re never going to succeed because they’re reaching the point where it’s not a technical problem anymore. It’s a societal problem. And the regulators are starting to move ahead of them and saying, “No, this is what, you know, we need to happen. And it’s not about technology, as much as it is sometimes about the society and the cultural requirements.” So, seeing these organisations tighten up, it’s pretty cool.</p>
<p>David: I was just going to ask you, because I’ve sort of lost the thread on this a little bit, because unless you follow it with minute detail every day, you don’t. I wonder if the whole kind of MDOC thing doesn’t have its own momentum. So, in other words, in a lot of circumstances, you can see why people are going to go to MDOC and MDL part 5, even for something that’s not a driving license, just because. It reminds me a little bit, and here’s another one of the teenagers, it reminds me of X.500. Because having spent part of my young life, she doesn’t even know what X.500 is, how he’s been part of my – X.400 was the ISO messaging standard that existed before the internet and that no longer exists. And X.500 was the directory standard for that. And that no longer exists. An X.509 was the standard for exchanging public keys in that directory. And X.509 version 3 is how everything works on the internet.</p>
<p>So, the whole of X.400 has disappeared, the whole of X.500 disappeared. And I just wonder if MDL isn’t going to be in the same place, like people are going to end up using MDL just because it exists. It may not be the optimum for a lot of the appli– but it doesn’t matter. The format exists. Wallets can understand it. Apple and Google Wallets can understand it. The MDOC stuff will carry on standardising, and I think maybe a lot of stuff will just get sucked into that.</p>
<p>Heather: What’s getting complicated about it – is the MDL standards. They are in their own way the X.509 to the modern world. They’re specifying a credential. This is a discrete concrete, and this is what this is supposed to be used for. It is your driver’s license. It is your identifier. Verifiable credentials using W3 capital V, capital C verifiable credentials. That’s not what they are really, those are much more generic thing that’s actually more an authentication thing. So, the fact that they’re hitting each other in the ways that they are is very interesting and a little disturbing. And the fact that the browser vendors are debating within themselves, which one they’re going to support when ultimately, they serve different purposes, I worry that we’re going to be driven towards…</p>
<p>David: No, no, I… your analysis is spot on. I agree with you completely Heather. I’m just saying that in practice, what seems to be happening is like people like me would say, “Well, actually…” you know, use the canonical example going into the bar, you know, people like me would say, “Well, you should be presenting an ISO W3C verifiable credential that says that you’re over 18 or over 21. So, I’m going…” But that doesn’t exist. The standard for the credential exists, but the contents, whereas on MDL, OK, that’s not really what it was meant for. But actually, demanding to see your MDL driver’s license, I can do because the standard exists. And I, you know, so I agree with your analysis. I’m just saying I wonder if actually, well, Trust Over IP and all these other things are kind of circling around, bumping into each other. MDOC is just steadily progressing, you know.</p>
<p>Heather: Told you Oscar, I told you, you’re going to have all sorts of fun things to talk about.</p>
<p>David: He’s going to get very bored on our – just our island, Heather. Like after the plane crashes, we’re going to be fine. He’s going to be, I don’t know what he’s going to do all day, making those little token at men or something.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, fantastic. Hearing all this from you. You’re definitely super passionate about – many of these things that you’re talking about, frustrated about some of them, but yes, super excited about most of them. So, thank you very much for joining us in very special episode for us. So, thank you very much. And please tell us how people can learn more about you, Heather?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, easiest thing is – go to LinkedIn and find me there. I check it every day. It’s one of my major social media accounts.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I mean, I spend more time on LinkedIn now since Twitter kind of went all weird. So, I mean, I’m on LinkedIn too. But it also you can just look up www.dgwbirch.com.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, thank you very much. So, let’s see how exciting comes the next coming months, years and yeah, how all the things we were discussing today will roll out. So, again, thanks a lot and all the best.</p>
<p>Heather: Great. Bye</p>
<p>David: Bye guys. Talk soon.</p>

   Evaluate your access management (AM) strategy with guidance from Gartner 

<p>Access management (AM) has become instrumental in fueling business growth while protecting against modern attacks. Today's economic environment makes AM even more critical, with enterprises seeking a converged access management solution that can address myriad use cases for multiple populations. But what capabilities should you prioritize for your organization?</p>

<p>The 2023 Gartner® Critical Capabilities for Access Management report is a technical companion to the Gartner Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management. While the Magic Quadrant provides an overview of a vendor including its market share, Critical Capabilities is purely a technical analysis of a vendor's products and services.</p>

<p>This year Gartner scored 11 vendors against four common use cases, including workforce access management, business-to-consumer access management (B2C), business-to-business access management (B2B), and application development.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce that ForgeRock received the highest scores in two of these use cases, namely B2C and B2B customer access management.</p>

 11 critical capabilities to consider for your 2024 roadmap 

<p>In addition to the four use cases, Gartner outlines a set of critical capabilities essential for any organization's access management strategy:</p>

  Core Access Management 
	 User Authentication 
	 Authorization and Adaptive Access 
	 Portable Identity Integration 
	 Business to Business 
	 Business to Consumer 
	 Customization and Extensibility 
	 API Access Control 
	 Threat Reporting and ITDR 
	 Resilience 
	 Ease of Deployment 
  ForgeRock understands your business to the core 

<p>Our commitment to simplifying complex user journeys can be a differentiator for your business. We support various delegated administration approaches for B2B capabilities, all orchestrated seamlessly through <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">ForgeRock Intelligent Access</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, our comprehensive catalog of global and regional cloud identity provider connectors, integrations with government IDs, customizable consent flows, self-service social identity registration, and a <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/marketplace/">marketplace</a> featuring a wide array of identity verification providers and wallets make us a solid choice.</p>

 We give you ultimate control 

<p>Customizability and extensibility are paramount for large enterprises and their unique use cases. Our solutions offer the flexibility and power required for different <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">deployment models</a>, while our Intelligent Access orchestration (“Trees”) and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/sdk">SDKs</a> simplify integrations for developers. We also provide robust support for integrations with both our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">identity gateway</a> and third-party API gateways.</p>

 Deploy identity your way 

<p>ForgeRock embraces flexibility when it comes to identity deployment. Whether you prefer a fully cloud-based approach, on-premises solution, or a hybrid environment for gradual migration, we've got you covered. Recognizing the challenges of migration from legacy solutions, we've introduced <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">pre-configured accelerators</a> to facilitate co-existence with, and migration from, Oracle Access Manager and Broadcom CA SiteMinder to the ForgeRock Identity Cloud.</p>

 Ultimate security without sacrifice 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">ForgeRock Autonomous Access</a> employs a unique blend of AI, machine learning, and pattern recognition to detect threats at the identity perimeter. Notably, we've addressed the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/how-attackers-are-circumventing-mfa-and-how-stop-them">rising challenges in MFA</a> with features such as MFA push authentication with context and push authentication with number matching, enhancing both security and user experience. ForgeRock also supports <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> capabilities through FIDO2 WebAuthn standards and passkeys within the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a>.</p>

 ForgeRock and Ping Identity: A Winning Combination 

<p>I'm thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html">Ping Identity</a> received the highest scores in one use case and the second highest in the three other use cases in the Gartner Critical Capabilities for Access Management research. To us, this recognition underscores Ping Identity's excellence and deep understanding of the AM market. Read more on Ping's performance <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2023/ping-identity-leader-gartner-critical-capabilities-access-management-2023.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The results of the Gartner research speak for themselves. And now, by uniting together as <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/lp/pingandforgerock.html?utm_source=forgerock&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=forgerock">one company</a>, we are able to offer customers greater choice and flexibility to address their unique use cases for all identity types. We're confident that with our strong product offerings reinforced by our years of experience, we can help you become better positioned to innovate your identity roadmap today and well into the future.</p>

 The future of digital finance is evolving, and it’s happening just in time 



<p>Over the last few years, the move to digital finance has accelerated. Consumers are adopting emerging financial apps and services, empowering them to take control of their financial health. The same technological leaps that are enhancing payments, financial management and banking are also changing lending for the better, and they couldn’t have come at a more opportune time. </p>



<p>That’s because consumers are feeling the impact of economic uncertainty and worry about the effect that it may have on them. In a 2023 survey, Mastercard spoke to 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the U.K., Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences. &nbsp;</p>



<p> Over 89% of respondents say that they’ve been negatively affected by economic uncertainty. &nbsp;</p>







<p>At the same time, whether they’re making big purchases like homes or handling everyday needs like transportation or food, consumers worry that they won’t be able to borrow what they need. &nbsp;</p>







<p>Open banking data can help consumers get to the bottom of these challenges.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, open banking allows consumers to permission access to their bank account, allowing lenders to augment their credit decisioning models with real time information that gives a better view of the consumer’s ability to repay a loan.&nbsp;That’s important because 95% of those who have been denied a loan in the past two years want more insights into the lending process. People are willing to share secure access to their bank account data, if it means better interest rates, instant approval for a loan, improved chances of being approved for a credit card or to secure an increase in the limit on a credit card.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lenders benefit, too. By augmenting traditional credit models with open banking, they can improve operational efficiencies, lower costs and create innovative new lending models that can give consumers the credit they deserve, when they need it.  &nbsp;</p>

				  Decentralized identity technology is increasingly being adopted to quickly and securely share data in the private and public sectors. With widespread interest in the technology’s ability to create verifiable data and streamline processes, the question of how you create a solution has never been more important.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>More people are interested in verifiable credentials and decentralized ecosystems than ever— which is awesome to see! But as new people enter this space the amount of information and the options available can be complicated and overwhelming. For those seeking to learn about the technology, the fundamental concepts, and how it works, Indicio recommends this quick, but comprehensive, <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">Beginner’s Guide</a>. But once you have decided that a decentralized solution is what you want for your organization, there are several things to consider when it comes to actually making a purchase.</p>
<p>Vendor / Platform lock-in</p>
<p>Being locked into one vendor or platform can have downstream consequences: surprise costs, slow responses to adding new competitive features, and the risk that should something happen to the vendor, your platform suddenly becomes unsupported. In today’s business world, vendor lock-in is often seen as unavoidable for some things; for example, many companies are reliant on Microsoft for their entire office suite and the licenses they can provide. But it simply doesn’t need to be like this for your decentralized identity solution — and shouldn’t be. The space is new and growing so fast that it doesn’t make sense to tie your hands to a proprietary solution from a particular provider.</p>
<p>Instead, do as we do: Indicio builds on open-source technologies whenever possible. For example the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven™</a> line of products are built on the open-source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy">Hypereledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries</a> codebases. Open source gives you freedom: freedom to build what you need to succeed, freedom to add what you need when you need it to meet opportunities, and most importantly — freedom to walk away.</p>
<p>Open source codebases incubate innovation and resilience: the more people using the code, the more it is tested, the better it becomes, and the quicker it evolves. However, do note that open source comes in two flavors: free and supported. Many companies opt for a supported solution (e.g., the Red Hat model), which saves their developer teams from having to climb the learning curve of unfamiliar codebases and frees them to focus on business solutions. Indicio provides supported open-source product solutions, both pre-designed and customized, so that you get to implementation as quickly as possible and have all the technical support you need to grow.</p>
<p>Do they sell all the pieces you need?</p>
<p>There are four major pieces of technology that form a working decentralized ecosystem for the secure exchange of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<p>Issuer agent— for creating and issuing a credential</p>
<p>Mobile wallet — for holding and presenting a credential</p>
<p>Mediator — coordinates messages between wallets on mobile devices and verifiers / issuers</p>
<p>Verifier agent — for verifying the credential</p>
<p>Not all vendors sell these as a package. Some only have one or some of the parts to create the functionality you want. It is important to understand exactly what it is that you’re getting. Just being able to download a mobile wallet will not give you the ability to create your own credentials.</p>
<p>Indicio offers each of these components separately if you want, (learn more about our mobile wallet <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a>, or play with <a href="https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/">one of our mediators</a>), but if you are seeking to implement a complete ecosystem, it is better to buy a complete ecosystem. That way, you get everything “in the box,” so to speak, and you know that everything will work together smoothly. This was the impetus for Indicio to create Proven as a complete, off-the-shelf ecosystem.</p>
<p>Interoperability</p>
<p>The world will never operate completely on one system. The more credential formats your decentralized solution supports, the more people will be able to use and benefit from it. Building this kind of support into solutions takes time and money, so not all vendors provide it or plan to do so, and instead pick a format in hope that it will become the format that catches on and everyone uses.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how this can go wrong, building special integrations for Internet Explorer would have looked like the smart move in 2009 when it had <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/worldwide/2009">65% of internet browser market share</a>, but today, even after a rebrand to Edge, it is now <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">hovering at just over 5%</a>, and only 5% of customers being able to use your integration would be severely limiting to your business.</p>
<p>Indicio is committed to building as much interoperability into our solutions as possible, commonly using a variety of verifiable credential formats including Anoncreds, SD JWTs, JSON-LD, JSON-LD BBS+, Open Badges 3.0, W3C, and Mobile Drivers Licence. Our team has years of experience implementing successful solutions, and we can advise you on the credential types that best meet your use case’s requirements, or help build a custom solution using an additional credential type your organization needs.</p>
<p>Network</p>
<p>You’ll need to host your verifiable credential solution on a blockchain-based distributed ledger network — or have someone else take responsibility for writing credential data to the ledger. Either way, you’ll want to make sure that the network supporting your solution meets your needs.</p>
<p>A distributed ledger network, typically, consists of several networks: one for developing and testing a solution, one for demonstrating a solution, and a main or production network to support your finished product. There may also be a temp network for stress testing, which gives you the freedom to push your solution to breaking point and easily reset, something better done before going to market.</p>
<p>In all cases, there are several important questions: how much does it cost to use each of these networks (singly or bundled), including how much does it cost to write credentials to the main or production network and, if necessary, revoke them? How much will it cost to scale your solution, and whether “all-you-can-write” packages can simplify payments and deliver significant cost savings in the medium and long term.</p>
<p>Second, what kind of technical support or support packages are provided? If you are new to verifiable credential technology, is there full customer onboarding and operational support for each network? What kind of engineering support is there for solutions that are mission-critical?</p>
<p>You’ll also want to assess the network’s performance by asking for uptime metrics and ask how the network is monitored to ensure that any problems can be quickly addressed. (For example Indicio’s network has a 99.97% uptime)</p>
<p>In terms of resilience, you’ll need to know how many nodes support the network and how extensive their geographic distribution, as some customers, particularly governments, have regulations on where nodes can be hosted.</p>
<p>Governance</p>
<p>What rules will be in place for your decentralized ecosystem? Who will implement these rules and how will they be integrated into the system? While your solution might function from a technical standpoint, its usability in the field depends on governance. When considering a solution or provider, examine how rules such as trust lists for approved credential issuers are implemented. How are credentials verified in near-offline or offline conditions? Governance in decentralized identity often seems complex. It doesn’t need to be.</p>
<p>Indicio developed machine-readable governance to deliver this simplicity. This enables governance rules to be published in a machine-readable format (currently in development as a specification at the Decentralized Identity Foundation), propagated to all participants in a decentralized identity ecosystem, and cached in their software. This enables the governance authority responsible for the use case to quickly implement system-wide rules and rule changes, manage trust lists and provide offline verification. Indicio developed a <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">Governance Editor</a> to simplify creating the governance files. You can try it out <a href="https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/Indicio-tech/governance-editor/tree/main">here.</a></p>
<p>We hope this article gives you a decent starting place when evaluating your options for a decentralized solution. You can never ask too many questions, especially when building something to last.

<p>Use of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/certificate-solutions/learn/certification-authority-authorization">Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)</a> was mandated for TLS certificates in September 2017. The primary purpose of CAA is to allow the domain owner to authorize specific CA(s) to issue TLS certificates for their domains. It also prevents other CAs from issuing TLS certificates for those domains. CAA limits the risk and scope of certificate issuance to only approved CAs.</p>
<p>When the Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) Requirements were introduced in July 2021, CAA was included with the “issuevmc” record. It was important to have a new record, so TLS CA authorizations would not impact VMC issuance.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/smime-br/">S/MIME Baseline Requirements</a>, there is now a place to provide standard requirements for S/MIME certificate issuance. One goal was to extend CAA to email addresses for the issuance of S/MIME certificates. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9495.html">Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Processing for Email Addresses- RFC 9495</a> has just been published to support this requirement and provide the “issuemail” record to permit CAs to issue S/MIME certificates.</p>
<p>The standard CAA record form for email addresses would look like this:</p>
 
 mail.client.example &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAA 0 issuemail “authority.example” 
 
<p>The “authority.example” identifying domain value would be provided by the CA in their CPS. The Entrust CAA identifying domain is “entrust.net”.</p>
<p>Domain owners are encouraged to use CAA to streamline the CAs that can issue TLS, VMC, or S/MIME certificates for domains. From a risk mitigation point of view, this stops CAs from issuing requests that have not been approved. An unapproved CA request could come from an attacker or could also come from a colleague who is not familiar with your CA selection process.</p>
<p>Note; There has been no CA/Browser Forum ballot to date, so the S/MIME Baseline Requirements have not been updated to require CAA to be checked before issuing S/MIME email certificates. We expect a CAA checking requirement to be added to the S/MIME BRs within the next year.</p>

<p>In the second release cycle of 2023, we have updated our SSO to include Client Credentials Grant. &nbsp;In addition, we have performed several corrections and improvements as well as regular security updates and life-cycle management on the Identity Platform. For full details, please review the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9084600321/Identity+Server+2023.2+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
 Features 
 Client Credentials Grant with OIDC (OpenID Connect) 
<p>In brief, the Client Credential Grant permits an application (or client) the ability to request an access token. This token is used instead of having the application configured with an administrator password, thus being more secure.</p>
<p>Ubisecure’s <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9138405377/Client+Credentials+Grant+reference+-+SSO">Client Credentials Grant</a> implementation supports two key use cases for the flow.</p>
 
 Authorised Access use case, also known as Common flow – the Client’s access token is used to impersonate the client and request resources from other servers or applications. 
 A lessor used, but available within the specification, configuration method is the Single application use case. In this flow a server is using its own credentials to access local resources on the same server, requiring user’s access rights. 
 
 Improved Stability 
<p>Also found in this development cycle are several smaller stability improvements. Memory and cache cleaning improvements will help environments with very long uptimes or very high utilisation for SSO. For CustomerID we have resolved a number of registration work-flow errors that could result in additional manual clean-up requirements of the LDAP directory.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>With the CI running updates continuously for many of the utilised third-party libraries, we have been able to focus on additional security items. We have updated OpenLDAP MDB to 2.5.16, which includes OpenSSL v3 – an essential update as OpenSSL v1 is no longer being maintained. This OpenLDAP update has been backported to IDS 2023.1 release (SSO 9.3, in SSO 9.2.3).</p>
 Improved Information 
<p>Addressing a concern raised by a number of customers, we’ve also reorganised the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9103376399/Change+Log+-+Identity+Platform">Change Log for Identity Server</a>.&nbsp;With this new format, you can quickly see which version of SSO should be grouped with which version of CustomerID and if there have been essential patches to each core application.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>Over the coming winter, we will be focusing on essential improvements around Swedish BankID, namely the support of the required animated QR codes. We’ll also be performing essential life-cycle management updates – we expect you to be able to see these clearly on a new area of the Developer Portal that will help to illustrate the overall system requirements and maintenance for your on-premise environment; note that using our Identity Cloud will ensure that all of the life-cycle management and upgrade requirements are fully managed by Ubisecure’s Operations Team.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>In my presentation at the KuppingerCole's <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution 2023 conference</a> in Frankfurt, entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/beware-of-easy-paths-cre23">"Beware of Easy Paths: The Journey Towards NIS2 Compliance",</a> I focused on the complexities of the revised Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2) issued by the European Union. While I am neither a lawyer nor an auditor (so they might be important peers to talk to on your NIS2-journey), my focus is on the practical implications of this crucial piece of cybersecurity legislation. As a critical component of the EU's cybersecurity strategy, NIS2 extends its influence across various essential sectors, encompassing energy, transport, banking, and health. This directive marks a significant shift in the cybersecurity landscape, setting forth new challenges and requirements for organizations, particularly for medium-sized and large companies, as they strive to align with these evolving regulations.</p>
 Understanding NIS2 
<p>NIS2 is a pivotal piece of legislation issued by the European Union, aimed at fortifying cybersecurity measures across its member states. This directive serves as a cornerstone in the EU's strategy to enhance resilience and response capabilities in the face of growing cyber threats. NIS2 applies broadly within the EU, encompassing a variety of sectors deemed critical for the economy and society. These sectors include energy, transport, banking, health, digital infrastructure, and public administration, among others.</p>
<p>Crucially, NIS2 came into force on January 16, 2023. However, its practical application involves a multi-stage process. First, member states are required to transpose the directive into national law. This aspect underscores the need for harmonization of cybersecurity standards across different jurisdictions while allowing for some degree of customization to address national specifics. Second, the organizations within the scope of NIS2, particularly those categorized under <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80065/kritis-understanding-and-protecting-critical-infrastructure">KRITIS</a> (Critical Infrastructures), are mandated to comply within a 21-month period. This staged approach aims to provide a structured and feasible pathway for entities to adapt and align with the directive's requirements.</p>
 The Scope and Impact of NIS2 
<p>NIS2 significantly expands the framework of cybersecurity obligations compared with its predecessor. It encompasses a wider range of organizations by categorizing them as either "essential" or "important" entities. This distinction is critical, as it brings a greater number of companies under the purview of NIS2, particularly those that were not previously subject to such stringent cybersecurity regulations.</p>
<p>For essential facilities, the level of criticality and obligations is higher. Important institutions, although new to this level of regulatory scrutiny, now also fall under the ambit of NIS2. This expansion significantly broadens the range of affected companies and organizations, moving beyond the traditional sectors of critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Moreover, NIS2 introduces specific thresholds for determining which companies are considered medium-sized or large, making many more companies subject to these regulations. &nbsp;Medium-sized companies are defined as having 50-250 employees and a turnover of €10-50m and/or a balance sheet of less than €43m.&nbsp; Large companies are those with more than 250 employees and a turnover of €50m and/or a balance sheet of €43m. The implications of these thresholds are substantial, especially for medium-sized companies, which may find themselves grappling with a massive tightening of cybersecurity requirements.</p>
 Requirements and Enforcement under NIS2 
<p>NIS2 introduces a blend of specific and generic requirements to ensure comprehensive cybersecurity across various sectors. Article 21 of NIS2, for instance, lists several specific mandates, particularly focusing on risk management, incident response, authentication, and other measures. However, NIS2 also emphasizes adherence to current best practices, certifications, and a generally high and appropriate level of security. This dual approach allows for flexibility while maintaining a baseline of cybersecurity standards.</p>
<p>The enforcement of NIS2 is marked by firm oversight and significant sanctioning power. Supervisory bodies are designated at the national level to monitor and enforce compliance. This includes strengthened supervisory measures ensuring entities' adherence to cybersecurity protocols and the introduction of severe penalties for non-compliance. Cross-border collaboration is a key feature, enhancing cooperation between member states for consistent enforcement. And requirements for transparency and disclosure are stipulated, mandating clear communication regarding cybersecurity incidents and measures. NIS2 encourages initiatives exceeding minimum requirements, fostering a culture of cybersecurity excellence, and promotes public-private partnerships to enhance overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
 Focusing on Compliance: A Tailored Approach 
<p>From KuppingerCole’s perspective, a key aspect of complying with NIS2 is recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, no matter what vendors, consultancies or whoever tells you. Each organization must define and implement NIS2 compliance in a manner that reflects its unique context and challenges. This tailored approach is crucial, considering the diverse range of sectors and company sizes affected by the directive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image: NIS2 - From Initial Assessment to Continual Implementation</p>
<p>Organizations should prioritize a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, as advocated by NIS2. This involves not only identifying and assessing cyber risks unique to their operations but also developing bespoke strategies to mitigate these risks. Compliance, therefore, becomes a dynamic and continuous process, necessitating ongoing adjustments and improvements in line with the evolving cyber threat landscape and organizational changes.</p>
<p>Key areas of focus include risk management, incident reporting, supply chain protection, and cyber hygiene. Each of these areas requires a detailed and customized strategy, taking into account the specific needs and capabilities of the organization. For instance, incident reporting protocols must be efficient yet sensitive to the particular operational context of the business.</p>
 Practical Implementation Strategies 
<p>For practical implementation, especially for SMEs, the focus should be on developing manageable and cost-effective cybersecurity strategies. SMEs often face resource constraints and skill gaps, making it imperative to find solutions that balance cost with effectiveness. Simplifying compliance processes and tailoring strategies to the operational realities of SMEs can significantly aid in meeting NIS2 requirements. Collaboration and community initiatives can also play a pivotal role, allowing SMEs to pool resources and share knowledge to enhance their cybersecurity posture collectively.</p>
<p>In summary, the implementation of NIS2 demands a thoughtful, customized approach, particularly for smaller organizations facing unique challenges in their compliance journey.</p>
 Navigating NIS2 Compliance 
<p>NIS2 marks a significant shift from the conventional checkbox compliance to a more integrated approach, embedding cybersecurity, compliance, and resilience into the very fabric of organizational processes. It prompts a departure from the simplistic, procedural adherence to regulations, focusing instead on a comprehensive assessment of risks. The directive advocates for a customized journey to compliance, one that is not generic but tailored to the specific needs and risk profiles of individual organizations, underscoring the need for a strategic and nuanced application of its mandates.</p>
<p>In addressing NIS2 compliance, it is clear that a uniform solution is not feasible. Each organization must approach compliance in a manner tailored to its unique context. Seeking assistance from a range of professionals, including peers, consultants, analysts, lawyers, and the enforcing bodies is advisable for navigating this complex regulation. Collaboration with these experts can provide the necessary insights for effective compliance strategies.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole Analysts, we focus on offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-nis2-directive-who-what-and-how">realistic strategies for NIS2 compliance</a>. We understand the challenges involved and aim to provide pragmatic solutions, recognizing that each organization's journey towards compliance is distinct.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the path to NIS2 compliance is intricate and requires a bespoke approach, there are <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/advisory">resources</a> available to guide organizations through this process, ensuring a secure and compliant digital environment.</p>

 Sudo digital identities sit at the heart of Sudo Platform 



<p>To empower users to better protect their personal identity online, we’ve created the Sudo digital identity, also simply called a <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>. A Sudo lets your customers interact with other people and organizations while protecting their personal data.</p>



<p>Sudos are at the heart of Sudo Platform, and most Sudo Platform features are built around the Sudo. Your customers can create multiple Sudos by leveraging our Sudo Platform products, protecting them from inadvertently disclosing their personal details.</p>



<p>People already know not to mix their work and personal identities. Sudos take this approach one step further, allowing users to create a different identity for every activity they do. This is called <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a> and it’s a great way to improve safety and security online.</p>



 Sudo Platform offers privacy as a service 



<p>Sudo Platform is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform with a unique focus on privacy.</p>



<p>Your organization can leverage Sudo Platform to rapidly develop and deploy easy-to-use, privacy-first products that interoperate seamlessly and intuitively. Sudo platform capabilities include:</p>



 
 Safe and private browsing including ad and tracker blocking and site reputation services 



 Virtual private network 



 Password management, security, and automation 



 Online commerce protection through virtual cards and compartmentalization 



 Open and encrypted communications including voice/video, messaging, and email 



 Decentralized identity services including identity wallets, verifiable credential services, and passwordless authentication. 
 



<p>We take a privacy-first stance to architecture, design, development and deployment of our products and services to deliver immediate value to organizations that seek to sell privacy and online security to their customers, either as new products or as enhancements to existing offerings.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform is a continually evolving offering as we develop new products and enhance existing services. Common services such as accounts, entitlements and profile management, underpin our offerings.</p>



<p>To find out more, check out <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/how-you-can-use-sudo-platform-digital-identities-and-decentralized-identity-capabilities-to-rapidly-deliver-customer-privacy-solutions/">how you can use Sudo Platform to rapidly deliver customer privacy solutions</a>.</p>



 <br>Sudo Platform combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of SDKs 



Figure 1: Sudo Platform



<p>Sudo Platform is built for developers by developers.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Sudo Platform is a set of scalable hosted services that provide the capabilities to an enterprise developer. You can integrate these hosted services with your systems to provide entitlement, federated single sign-on, and other integrations that allow your existing customers to seamlessly access the Sudo Platform services you want.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform hosted services are also integrated into various third party systems such as cloud providers, telephony carriers, banks, payment processors, blockchains, and more. These hosted services are deployed individually for each of Anonyome’s consumer-facing customers/partners, completely separating them from other customer/partners’ data and services and providing the ability to customize that environment for the individual organization.</p>



<p>Above the hosted services sit SDKs, documentation and sample apps distributed through GitHub which allow Sudo Platform customers to quickly develop applications using Sudo Platform services. This software is open source so you can quickly become productive. All Sudo Platform SDKs are offered in Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript/TypeScript, which means you can freely enhance any of your web, mobile or desktop products that make up your full software suite.</p>



<p>If you’d prefer a faster route to market or lack the internal expertise or capacity to create and deploy applications to end users, we also publish UI kits that enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications that can be quickly branded and delivered to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms. This rapid white label offering is very attractive to organizations that want or need to move quickly.</p>



<p>A UI kit gives you access to libraries of advanced software modules with complex data and graphical flows that go beyond basic Sudo Platform service access. The first library contained in a UI kit is the core library, which provides complex business logic for data management and functional utilities that span one or more of the Sudo Platform services. The second library contained in a UI kit is the UI library, which has widgets, screens and minor user flows that give recommended user experiences for a feature and can be integrated into your application. UI kits are supported across Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript/TypeScript.</p>



<p>An unbranded application (or white label application) allows you to take advantage of fully developed and supported applications for web, mobile and desktop platforms. Our unbranded apps deliver an optimal user experience of Sudo Platform services, and you can add your logo, color palette and other branding requirements. Once complete, you simply add your new apps to your product portfolio for fast deployment and integrate them with your user management and accounting systems.</p>



 Sudo Platform keeps up with the privacy landscape 



<p>We can only achieve privacy if Sudo Platform products and services adapt to the ever-evolving data surveillance landscape. We have built Sudo Platform offerings against enhancement roadmaps and with a philosophy of continuous development so it stays abreast of user needs. Each release incorporates the latest support for all mobile, web and desktop platforms and features regular security updates for packaged software dependencies.</p>



<p>The Sudo Platform GitHub site is shown below. We include our SDKs and sample apps (including source code) to make it easy to leverage the capabilities into your applications.</p>



Figure 2: Sudo Platform GitHub site



<p>The instructions for how to build Sudo Platform capabilities into your applications are included in our documentation site:</p>



Figure 3: Sudo Platform documentation



<p>You can find more information about Sudo Platform in our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/">documentation</a>, open source <a href="https://github.com/sudoplatform">SDKs</a> for mobile, web and desktop, and official <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asudoplatform+sample">sample applications</a>.</p>



 Getting started takes just 4 simple steps 



 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create an account 



<p>Start by creating an account so you can access, configure and integrate Sudo Platform services into your products.</p>



<p>Creating an account is simple. Each Sudo Platform account has two key characteristics:</p>



 
 complete account isolation 



 feature service customization. 
 



<p>Unlike accounts with traditional multi-tenant SaaS companies, Sudo Platform accounts are individual and isolated from others within the system so that core services and data are unique to each deployment. In real terms, this helps to eliminate any risk of information cross-contamination within our internal systems.</p>



<p>Each Sudo Platform account is unique for each customer based on individual need. When you create a Sudo Platform account, your selection of features and any subsequent configuration makes your deployment different from other customers’ deployments on Sudo Platform. This means:</p>



 
 You only pay for what you need. 



 The deployment is implemented against your compliance, data and location requirements. 



 You have clear visibility into what you are developing against. 



 Manage your account with the Sudo Platform management console<br><br>The management console lets you manage your administrative and end users, gain critical insight into the analytics underlying your deployment, and explore ways to enhance your Sudo Platform experience. 
 



<p>Your Sudo Platform management console is a real-time reflection of your deployment. It lets you view and alter the features that back the integrated products and affects how your services interact with Sudo Platform. This means you can easily adapt your customers’ experiences with Sudo Platform features and your existing authentication, subscriptions, billing and entitlements systems.</p>

This means you can easily adapt your customers’ experiences with Sudo Platform features and your existing authentication, subscriptions, billing and entitlements systems.</p>



 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start with a sample app or go straight to SDKs 



<p>Once you have your Sudo Platform account, why not check out what it can do? You can do this via a sample app or jump right into integration with our SDKs.</p>



<p>Using a sample app is the fastest way to see how the Sudo Platform services work and the value they can provide. You can easily explore the technology and imagine the potential for your products, either as an enhancement or brand new offering.</p>



<p>If you dive right into integration with our SDKs, you’ll find they are designed for seamless integration with all your existing and new applications. Each SDK is built to run natively on all supported platforms, so they have the highest chance of compatibility with your applications, independent of the frameworks and architecture you employ.</p>



<p>To integrate with the platform you’re developing on, simply use the appropriate package manager (see table below) and add a dependency to the Sudo Platform SDKs you need for your project. If you need help using one of the listed package managers, refer to its documentation.</p>



PlatformPackage manageriOS (Swift)Cocoapods: https://cocoapods.org/Android (Kotlin)Maven Central: https://search.maven.org/Javascript/Typescriptnpmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/



<p>See our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/getting-started">documentation</a> for more information.</p>



 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain your Sudo Platform application 



<p>Maintaining a Sudo Platform application is an important exercise once you have integrated our SDKs. Everything you need to know each release to plan or automate how you pull in fixes, updates and new features is available in GitHub and the Sudo Platform documentation.</p>



 Changelogs 



<p>Changelogs for all Sudo Platform SDK releases are available in the associated GitHub repository. Within these changelogs there is information about each release, including:</p>



 
 a description of changes that are newly available 



 an indication of SDK versions that are compatibility breaking 



 a description of fixes that are available 



 assets associated with a release. 
 



<p>To access this changelog information for each release, simply go to the appropriate GitHub repository and click the ‘Releases’ link in the right pane:</p>







<p>The next page gives you access to the changelogs associated with each release of the SDK:</p>







 Versioning 



 Rules 



<p>Our versioning adheres to semantic versioning-like rules so integrating up-to-date releases into your CI/CD development pipelines is easy. Introducing Sudo Platform products from official release repositories into your dependency pipeline and adhering to versioning rules ensures constant compatibility with the services in your Sudo Platform deployment.</p>



<p>The rules in Sudo Platform versioning are:</p>



 
 MAJOR version when incompatible API changes are released 



 MINOR version when backwards compatible functionality is released 



 PATCH version when backwards compatible bug fixes are released. 
 



<p>If we deviate from these rules, we will let you know in the documentation as soon as possible so you can adapt.</p>



 Compatibility 



<p>Another important consideration is the compatibility of the version of the SDKs your application uses and the version of the SDKs supported by the services within your Sudo Platform deployment. Ignoring the compatibility of your application’s SDK versions can cause your application to stop functioning correctly or completely.</p>



<p>We have an API that lets you verify the general compatibility of your application against your deployed instance. This API gives you information about the compatibility status of your application and any features that are incompatible. As a result, you can design your application to appropriately respond to this API based on your needs and the overall scenario:</p>



 
 understand the compatibility of an application during development 



 inform a user about the need to update their application installation to a compatible version 



 gracefully disable select functionality of the application based on the nature of the compatibility issue. 
 



<p>You can find specific guidance on each platform’s implementation of this API and some sample code in our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/getting-started#verifying-the-app-compatibility-with-backend-services">documentation</a>.</p>



 Those 4 simple steps achieve 3 big rewards

<p>To act in the world we must first make sense of it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the world is complex, containing an amount of information exceeding the processing capacity of any individual or group. Adequate sensemaking in the context of complexity and info-abundance therefore requires the ability to process and analyse data. </p><p>We refer to this capability as data-driven sensemaking.</p><p>Yet, today the means for data-driven sensemaking are unevenly distributed. In our essay, <a href="https://www.culturehack.io/issues/issue-02-territories-of-transition/data-commoning-as-a-territory-of-transition/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Politics of Data: Data Commoning as a Territory of Transition</a>, we described how data is shaping the landscape of power, perpetuating and amplifying asymmetries. Unsurprisingly, the principal beneficiaries are large corporations and state actors with the financial and technical resources required to undertake data collection, processing and analysis at scale. As with ‘natural resources’ and ‘labour’, the dominant economic and cultural logics of today regard data as another resource to be extracted, siloed and abused in service of narrow objectives and/or for the benefit of a few.</p><p>While data alone cannot orient us, it can help to reveal new possibilities and trajectories. Yet, data only realises its potential as a coordinative aid if it is able to flow freely through our digital territories. Practices of data sharing are important — surely — but data must also be capable of transmutation; of undergoing a kind of alchemical process of reconfiguration and recombination in the midst of varying contexts. This conception regards data — or information — as a living process rather than a static object or resource. Data is made more contextually relevant when the logics and infrastructure we employ to generate, channel and transform data support these kinds of evolutionary dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this series of posts and the technical interventions described, we are seeking to understand and embody this conception of data as a living process, and to articulate interventions intended to help unlock data toward greater service to life. In other words, like many in the Holochain ecosystem, we are endeavouring to engage in data commoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we will introduce the technical stack for a data commons, discussing data collection, discovery, and analysis; considering distributed computing and large language models; and proposing an algorithm library for analytic tools. We then go on to discuss the social effects of narrative and to think about how data and sensemaking could be reframed to support a generative future. Finally, in part two of this article series we will dive deeper into knowledge graphs, so don’t forget to read that article as well.</p> The Data Commons Stack <p>The capacity for commoning derives in part from maintained symmetry in power dynamics preventing data from becoming a source of extraction, enclosure, and ultimately tragedy. Consider that, the moment we click 'send' or 'save', our tweets, notes, and messages are expedited to a remote data warehouse controlled by the respective platform provider. Here our data becomes a means by which platforms increase revenue and market dominance rather than as a means for collective sensemaking. The digital spaces where we gather, lauded as the 21st century ‘town squares’ are, in truth, more like vast feudal estates. The conversations occurring within are, in many respects, the property of our digital usurpers rather than the domain of public knowledge.</p><p>Yet we remain hopeful that these power asymmetries can be mitigated — even corrected — given the right cultural and technological conditions. We’ll begin by addressing the technological dimension and speak to the cultural dimension toward the end of this post.&nbsp;</p> Layer Zero <p>Agent-centric, peer-to-peer (P2P) frameworks like <a href="https://holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> support data commoning by providing certain assurances with respect to access, control, and provenance of the data we collectively generate. On the one hand, local-first storage affords us privacy and control with respect to our personal data whilst distributing and validating shared data among peers allows more flexible, selective means of data access. Here, data can be stewarded and evolved in a cooperative manner with reduced risk of extraction and exploitation. With these foundations, it becomes possible to support what we call 'generative information ecosystems': spaces in which information evolves toward greater complexity, relevance, and integration.&nbsp;</p><p>While Holochain's agent-centric architecture and data integrity mechanisms provide essential ingredients toward data sovereignty, it does not automatically grant the capability to discover and derive insights from data. Hence, an initial focus for our team at Arkology Studio is developing a suite of modules for data discovery and analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>For us, important sensemaking occurs in the context of our lived realities; human beings embedded in community and specific bioregions, rather than just the halls of academia and research laboratories.&nbsp;Hence, the hope is that the affordances of open, data-driven sensemaking tools can be matched with the orienting/decision-making capacities of grassroots organisations and communities attending to local challenges. By empowering local actors to share, discover, and draw insights from data, we may see connective tissues expand, and local solutions spread and adapt to new contexts.&nbsp;</p><p>The following diagram offers an initial high-level overview of a ‘data commons stack’, indicating the five functional categories or ‘layers’: collection, storage, discovery, analysis, and knowledge. </p>Figure 1: high-level systems overview of the ‘data commons’ stack<p>While the diagram above depicts a linear progression for illustrative simplicity, in actuality there exists a variety of feedback loops between the many subsystems. Note, for example, that published insights at the knowledge layer may themselves become data points in the data storage layer, to be included in later analyses (this unlocks, for example, interesting possibilities for narrative analysis, which we investigate in part two of this article series). Furthermore, there exists a feedback loop between our understanding of the world and our behaviour in the world. In other words, knowledge can engender change in material reality, which in turn may affect our understanding of said material reality. It is these sorts of feedback loops which reveal the complex, dynamical nature of a data commons and, if supported, enable it to adapt to evolving contexts.</p> Collection <p>Since data-driven sensemaking is impractical without a diversity of data, methods for channelling and/or exposing data from a multitude of sources is paramount. On the one hand, this involves developing standardised, consensual methods for data collection from applications, including IoT devices, traditional web apps, and other Holochain apps: what we term ‘data channels’. Data entering the ecosystem from the ‘outside’ (i.e beyond the data-sovereign membrane) is always mediated through an agent (e.g. a human or IoT device), who submits the contents along with a record containing metadata that can be recognised and validated by other agents (see <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain’s validation rules</a>). In other words, we record the provenance and context associated with any data point. Since other Holochain apps are already operating within their respective data-sovereign membrane, and self-host their own data, participants in those networks may reveal relevant data to the data commons ecosystem for query. As for storing all this data, Holochain already provides us with mechanisms for distributed data storage (see <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain’s DHT</a>), with capacity scaling linearly with the number of peers.&nbsp;</p> Discovery <p>With a data commons, one is presented with the challenge of effective data discovery. Since those who control the map control the territory, it is important to mitigate against monopolies on discovery mechanisms. Google’s search engine dominance engenders a kind of monoculture with respect to the very way we discover new information. Since search/discovery algorithms privilege certain data over others by design, it may be necessary to mitigate against algorithmic monopolies by encouraging a multiplicity of discovery services. Since the data commons is essentially a giant peer-to-peer (P2P) network composed of human and non-human agents, it may be useful to conceptualise these services as ‘personal agents’ who crawl the data commons on our behalf, surfacing data relevant to our needs. Imagine, for example, that you are undertaking interdisciplinary research on a controversial topic and are aware of potential biases. Here, you may be inclined to engage a search agent proficient at discovering diverse/divergent viewpoints. Furthermore, agents may operate on our behalf even when we are not actively engaged in search/discovery. For example, you may initiate an agent to notify you of regional climate events or the latest research results in cancer treatments. Since the way we acquire data is an essential step in data-driven sensemaking, it is important that we have the means to parameterize and personalise data discovery in accordance with our intentions and aspirations.</p> Analysis <p>One of the first and most exciting mechanisms for sense-making that becomes available to participants of the data commons can be conceived as similar to both <a href="https://openpds.media.mit.edu/?ref=blog.holochain.org">SafeAnswers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation?ref=blog.holochain.org">secure-multiparty computation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, ‘safe answers’ refers to the ability to perform computation on user data without revealing the raw data itself. The analyst is responsible for sending an inspectable analysis algorithm to the agent whose data is being processed for insight. This way, all computation is performed locally on the machines where the data is stored (the machine of the agent on a Holochain network). The analyst receives only the return of the algorithm and has no access to the raw data itself.&nbsp;</p><p>One can imagine the unlocking potential of this type of distributed computation when it comes to personal or sensitive data. This is demonstrated by an example pertaining to personal health data. On the one hand, it can be very useful to understand, say, the amount of people in a given area who are predisposed to cancer. The disposition may be informed by genetics, lifestyle, and other factors. In a traditional data relationship between an app user and a company stewarding their data, there is no assurance that the company will not use/sell their data in a compromising way, such as to an insurance firm that may increase the excesses to the user given their predisposition. By running an algorithm on the devices of the users who are being considered in the analysis, it becomes possible to undertake sensitive and important investigations without creating a honeypot of compromising data.&nbsp;</p> Algorithm Library&nbsp; <p>A library of datasets alone is necessary yet insufficient for effective sense-making. Tools are required to effectively traverse and distil the meanings and implications contained within the datasets in order for the data to affect meaningful change in the world. In order to unlock the agentic capacities of groups endeavouring to common around data towards data-driven sensemaking we are proposing a library of open-source algorithms aimed at crowd-sourcing data-science expertise in order to make data-driven sensemaking more accessible to less data-literate folk. By introducing algorithms into the data commons ecosystem, our intuition is that a data commons is not just informed by inert data points, but rather is the interaction of these data points and the actors that engage with them towards distilling an understanding of reality. In this way, it can be useful to think of this project as a praxis for data commoning, more than simply a 'data commons'.</p> Large Language Models <p>The speed of Large Language Model (LLM) development is overwhelming, with a multitude of new tools being released that are changing everything from education, to search engines, to AI assistants. Without dedicating too much of this text to this topic, it is important to indicate the possibilities for organisations and communities to develop specialised agents fine-tuned on the capacities of the data that they are commoning around. In some ways, a generative model trained on a given set of data is a codified narrative; an artificial agent acting on behalf of the semantic patterns that inform it.&nbsp;</p> Narrative Ecosystems &amp; Cultural Evolution <p>The transformative potential of a given technological ecosystem is <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/?ref=blog.holochain.org">limited by the values and ontologies</a> associated with the dominant cultural environment in which their activity is based. Hence, while we think tools that improve our capacities for sensemaking are important — especially when grounded in data-sovereign infrastructure like Holochain — they are not panaceas. Responding to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBoLVvoqVY&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">poly/metacrisis</a> requires a transformation of the dominant culture, not merely technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In light of this, Arkology Studio has been collaborating with <a href="https://culturehack.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Culture Hack Labs</a> to advance a set of tools for narrative research. For Culture Hack Labs, effective system change necessitates understanding the narrative forms and narrative ecologies that perpetuate social and ecological breakdown. Here, <a href="https://www.culturehack.io/curriculum/curriculum/introduction-to-narratives/module-2-introduction-to-narratives-2/?ref=blog.holochain.org">narratives can be understood</a> as “interpretive social structures that frame our experience and function to bring meaning to our everyday reality, guiding our actions and decisions.” In other words, one can transform culture by intervening at the level of narratives.&nbsp;</p><p>The narrative, ‘data as resource’, reflects the tendency of modern, industrialised societies to regard nature — including her living creatures and material output — as something to be exploited for human benefit (or, rather, for those with the means to exploit her first). Through this framing, data is something to accumulate (‘big data’), gatekeep (e.g. academic journals), and exploit (e.g. behaviour profiling to sell ads). Contrast this narrative with ‘data in service to life’ or ‘data as living process’, which invites us to consider data and its associated processes as a fundamentally cooperative dynamic.&nbsp;</p><p>In recognising the power of narratives to guide cultural evolution, we have begun to explore what meaningful narrative interventions could look like in the context of a data commons. In particular, what would it mean to meaningfully shift narrative ecosystems toward more life-affirming frames without necessarily prescribing, in a top-down manner, the frames themselves? Is it conceivable, in other words, that the very insights generated within a data commons might help steer society toward a more generative future?&nbsp;</p> What’s Next? <p>In part two of this series, we investigate this question through a speculative discussion on the ‘knowledge’ layer of the Data Commons Stack. Specifically, we explore how to represent knowledge in a manner that is pluralistic rather than homogenising, and how we may more readily perceive the influence and evolutionary potential of the narratives that live within and amongst us. We propose a toolkit that draws from the knowledge emerging out of cooperative communities and allows the construction of agent/community-centric knowledge graphs; networks of insights built upon a shared node library and structurally arranged to represent the epistemic geometries of their ontological framing.&nbsp;</p><p>Our inquiry also leads us into a discussion on knowledge discovery and the risks of epistemic pluralism; in particular, how we might use open discovery patterns and quantitative measures from Integrated Information Theory to move us toward more integrative frames.</p> Guest Authors <p>This guest post, the first of two articles on data commoning, was written by Ché Coelho and Ross Eyre of Arkology Studio.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arkology/about/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Arkology Studio</a> (‘architecture’ + ‘ecology’) is a transdisciplinary design and software engineering studio whose mission is to support the development of commons-oriented socio-technical interventions for systems change. </p>

Government: Verify you are a resident of a particular country without revealing personal information,which can help prevent identity theft and protect&nbsp;privacy.  Decentralized Finance: Verify identities and credentials for DeFi applications, ensuring that only authorized parties have access to sensitive financial data.  Job Applications: Verify your qualifications, education, and experience for a job application without revealing personal information.  <p>These verifications are generated directly on the user’s local device. Once a user generates a zkPass proof, it is securely sent to the user’s Verida Wallet, stored on the privacy-preserving Verida Network as a Polygon ID credential. This credential can be leveraged with a zero-knowledge proof, both on and off-chain.</p>Verida Wallet supports zero-knowledge credentials on Polygon&nbsp;ID An Integrated Solution: Building the Future with a Privacy-First Technology Stack <p>This end-to-end solution demonstrates the software architecture of the future. Decentralized identity, private storage, zero knowledge proofs, credentials and blockchain, all working together to provide an incredibly secure and private technology stack.</p><blockquote>“From the outset, Verida has been focused on providing the necessary infrastructure to build a privacy preserving, decentralized technology stack. zkPass’ zero-knowledge proof technology is another example of the innovation happening in this space and we are thrilled to welcome them to the Verida ecosystem.” <a href="https://twitter.com/tahpot">Chris Were</a>, CEO and co-founder of&nbsp;Verida.</blockquote><p>Stay tuned for updates as we further our partnership with zkPass and provide new opportunities for you to be part of the data ownership revolution with <a href="http://missions.verida.network">Verida Missions.</a></p><p>Developer Resources</p>  <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">Verida Documentation</a>  <a href="https://zkpass.gitbook.io/">zkPass Documentation</a>   About zkPass <p>zkPass is a private data protocol that enables privacy-preserving verification.

 Navigating the Complexities of the FATF and FinCEN Crypto Travel Rule: Your Questions Answered — Part&nbsp;3 <p>Building on the insights from <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/demystifying-the-fatf-travel-rule-your-most-googled-questions-answered-part-2">Part 2</a> of our comprehensive series of articles on the most asked questions around the FATF Travel Rule, we delve deeper into the complexities of these regulations, focusing on their global implementation, specific targets, direct impact on cryptocurrency transactions, and the challenges faced by Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) in this third installment of the series. Let’s dive into&nbsp;it.</p> Which Countries Have Implemented the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>As of November 23, 2023, the countries that have implemented the Travel Rule are Canada, Estonia, Germany, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, The Philippines, The United States, and the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p><p>The United States has been enforcing the Travel Rule <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-fincen-idINKBN1XP1ZO/">since March 13, 2013</a>. Several years after the US, Switzerland implemented the rule <a href="https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2019/08/20190826-mm-kryptogwg/">on January 1, 2020</a>. Singapore’s implementation came into effect <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2020/payment-services-act-comes-into-force">on January 28, 2020</a>, whereas the Philippines began enforcing the Travel Rule on <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Regulations/Issuances/2021/1108.pdf">February 5,&nbsp;2021</a>.</p><p>Germany’s adoption of the Travel Rule <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1auLvlIOx2zJb8i2CSe9lFEStzlC3BP3zvSKhkejF-jo/edit?usp=sharing">dates back to October 1, 2021</a>, followed by Gibraltar’s enforcement, which began on March 22, 2022. Canada joined in <a href="https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/travel-acheminement/1-eng">on March 31, 2022</a>. <a href="https://www.fma-li.li/files/list/fma-wegleitung-2021-18-travel-rule.pdf">Liechtenstein</a> and <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/api/documentms/download.ashx?id=b682d829-38bc-4827-b48d-022726d75a17">Malaysia</a> joined next, as they both implemented the crypto Travel Rule on April 1,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>South Korea’s implementation date was <a href="https://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/pr010101/75410">March 25, 2022</a>, and both<a href="https://www.cr.gov.hk/en/publications/docs/es32022262516-e.pdf"> Hong Kong</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan</a> started enforcing the rule on June 1, 2023. Finally, Estonia began enforcing the Travel Rule <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/515042021009/consolide/current">on June 15, 2022</a>, with the United Kingdom implementing it on <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1082704/MLRs_SI_2022_-_Consultation_Response.pdf">September 1,&nbsp;2023</a>.</p> Who Does the FATF Crypto Travel Rule Apply&nbsp;to <p>The FATF Crypto Travel Rule applies to a wide range of entities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Primarily, it targets virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallet providers, and other financial services dealing with virtual&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The rule requires these entities to collect and share personal data during transactions. This includes the name, account number, physical address, national identity number, or date and place of birth of both the sender and the recipient for transfers exceeding a certain threshold.</p> What is the FinCEN Travel Rule Crypto; How Does it Affect Cryptocurrency Transactions <p>The “FinCEN Travel Rule Crypto” refers to a regulatory framework originally established by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for fiat currencies and later extended to include cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Targeting virtual asset service providers (VASPs) like cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallet providers, and other financial services dealing with virtual assets, the FinCEN Travel Rule Crypto requires these entities to collect and share key personal data during transactions. This data includes the sender and receiver’s names, account numbers, physical addresses, national identity numbers, or their dates and places of birth for transactions that exceed&nbsp;$3000.</p><p>This adaptation of the rule to cryptocurrencies aims to enhance transparency in digital currency transactions and combat money laundering and terrorism financing. It aligns the regulatory requirements of the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies with those of traditional banking, posing new challenges and compliance requirements for businesses in the virtual currency&nbsp;space.</p> What Challenges Do VASPs Face During Travel Rule Compliance <p>VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) face several challenges during Travel Rule compliance, including data privacy concerns, varying international regulations, technology integration issues, and the risk of non-compliance penalties.</p><p>Data Privacy Concerns: Ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive customer data while complying with the Travel Rule is a significant challenge. VASPs need to strike a balance between adhering to regulatory requirements and protecting client information against unauthorized access and data breaches.</p><p>Varying International Regulations: The Travel Rule requirements vary across different jurisdictions, making it difficult for VASPs to develop a uniform compliance strategy. This lack of standardization requires VASPs to adapt their compliance processes according to the regulations of each country they operate&nbsp;in.</p><p>Furthermore, since many countries have not yet enforced the Travel Rule, VASPs operating in jurisdictions where the rule is implemented face challenges when dealing with transactions from countries that are non-compliant. This is known as the Sunrise&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Technology Integration Issues: Implementing the necessary technology to comply with the Travel Rule often involves significant investment and integration challenges. VASPs need to upgrade their systems to handle additional data requirements and ensure interoperability with other service providers.</p><p>Risk of Non-Compliance Penalties: Failure to comply with the Travel Rule can lead to hefty fines and legal penalties. This risk puts pressure on VASPs to ensure strict adherence to regulatory requirements, which can be resource-intensive and&nbsp;costly.</p><p>Veriscope effectively addresses these challenges. Its decentralized framework enhances data integrity and reduces risks, while the absence of centralized PII storage boosts data security.</p><p>An open-source platform, Veriscope fosters transparency and continual improvement. Key features like automatic counterparty VASP discovery, secure P2P PII transmission, and robust due diligence streamline the compliance process.</p><p>Additionally, its pay-as-you-go model, interoperability with various platforms, and unique features like historic transaction lookback and user signing for wallets, position Veriscope as a versatile and comprehensive solution for Travel Rule compliance.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>As we conclude the third part of our series on the FATF Travel Rule, we have navigated through the essential aspects of its global implementation, targeted entities, and the profound impact on cryptocurrency transactions. This analysis has also shed light on the multifaceted challenges VASPs encounter in complying with these regulations.</p><p>Our journey through these complexities underscores the importance of continual adaptation and informed compliance within the evolving crypto landscape, ensuring that stakeholders in the cryptocurrency domain remain aligned with international regulatory standards.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

			 Gonzalo García Arahuetes is a Back-End Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-garcia-arahuetes/">Gonzalo García Arahuetes</a>, and I was born in Segovia, Spain. I work as a Back-end Developer at Tokeny, although it would have been crazy for me to think of such a job some years ago, since my initial formation had nothing to do with computers. I started Law and Business Administration studies in Madrid but soon changed it for Humanities and moved to Barcelona for my master’s degree. Although I did a lot of research on Literature and Philosophy, I eventually started some courses on Digital Humanities, focused on database maintenance and data management, and this is how I became more and more curious about technology and its ethical and political implications. With that in mind, I started another master’s degree in Web Development and began to study the consequences of blockchain for economies and individuals.</p>
<p>I love keeping those two paths alive, as I regard them as complementary. While my professional career is devoted to web development and tech-related issues, I am still working on a Ph.D. thesis on Peter Sloterdijk’s early work, and I dedicate a great deal of my free time to books, writing, and research.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>I was working for a small start-up as a Full-Stack developer. One day, I saw a job offer from Tokeny for senior developers. I applied, specifying that I was not a senior at all but that I had plenty of curiosity for the blockchain world and was eager for an opportunity like this. Of course, I expected no response, but Luc himself, the CEO, replied! We had a very pleasant meeting, and he told me that all he wanted were ‘smart and motivated people.’ The process took some time because Tokeny was opening its Spanish office in Barcelona, but joining this team was the perfect decision for me.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Luc wanted a team of ‘smart and motivated people,’ and I think that is what he got! Working at Tokeny means sharing time and goals with some of the most fun, skilled, and professional people I have met. On top of that, it is a company committed to remote work, which makes life so much easier for all of us in terms of schedule and location. In a few words, I would say that Tokeny always considers the workers’ necessities in the first place.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life?  
<p>My family is at the top: my wife Yaos and my little Lila, who was born in June. Other than that, I am very passionate about many things: books, films, my guitars, my friends, cooking, sports… In this regard, being passionate about something reveals its ambiguity (for the word ‘passion’ has a very ancient origin, always related to suffering): I love all these things, but often, it is demanding to keep up with them and not end up frustrated or exhausted.</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I am rather cautious when it comes to making long-term plans for my life, not to mention having big dreams about changing the world. I always remember Walt Whitman’s beautiful verses: “The Earth, that is sufficient, I do not want the constellations any nearer, I know they are very well where they are, I know they suffice for those who belong to them.” In my opinion, being focused on big dreams and aims keeps us from noticing that sometimes we are just carried away. Knowing that the tide is dragging you may or may not make a better swimmer out of you, but at least you will take it easy and stop worrying about reaching a certain place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>My personal view is that we are on the verge of mass adoption for blockchain technology. Given that scenario, being part of a company so involved in the transformation of the entire financial industry is a thrilling and adventurous experience. There is so much yet to learn and to witness!</p>

 Stakers can claim DF64 rewards. DF65 runs Nov 23— Nov 30,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 64 (DF64) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 100K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Nov 16, 2023 and ended 12:01am Nov 23.

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF65 is live today, Nov 23. It concludes on Nov 30. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF65  Section 5: Challenge DF Wind-down   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has three substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and earn.<br>– Challenge DF. Accurately predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are four ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), Challenge DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash bad Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. <br>– Challenge DF substream.

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF65 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Challenge DF Wind-Down <p>DF66 is the final round for Challenge DF.</p><p>Starting in DF67, the 1000 OCEAN/week will be redistributed equally to Volume DF and Predictoor DF.</p><p>The Active DF budget will be 37.5K / 37.5K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor DF respectively.</p><p>For more information, please read the announcement <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#d8d5">here</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $24K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Nov 23, 2023: $0.46 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.071 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.46 / OCEAN * 37,000 OCEAN = $17,020&nbsp;USD  $0.071 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,100&nbsp;USD  Total: $17,020 + $7,100 = $24,120 ≈ $24K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

Northern Block Product Update: Supporting Mote Credential Exchange Protocols and Credential Formats<br><br></p>
 
<p>We’re excited to announce that Northern Block products now support two credential exchange protocols – DIDComm/Aries-based protocol implementations and the newly added OpenID4VC. Additionally, we’ve expanded our support to three credential formats: AnonCreds, JWT, and JSON-LD.</p>
<p>As staunch advocates for open agent technology, which is crucial for digital wallets and achieving digital trust, we’ve consistently integrated DIDComm and various Aries-based implementations (such as ACA-Py, AFJ) into our products. The recent focus on the European Union’s Architectural Reference Framework (ARF) has highlighted the importance of the Open ID for verifiable credential specifications. We’ve embraced these specifications in response to feedback from issuers who appreciate the protocol’s simplicity and the widespread availability of OpenID/oAuth resources, making the issuance of verifiable credentials more streamlined.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide our customers with the flexibility to receive and store their preferred credential format via any protocol. We also strive to enable verifiers to accept a diverse range of credentials and protocols available in the market. Looking ahead, we plan to support the mobile driving license (mDL) standard.</p>
<p>Here’s what we now offer:</p>
 
 
 For Issuers: Our platform now allows issuers to use either DIDComm/Aries or our OpenID4VCI issuer to issue an AnonCred, JWT, or JSON-LD credentials. (Note: our issuance service allows users to issue AnonCreds and JSON-LD through DIDComm, and JSON-LD and JWT through OpenID4VCI) 
 For Holders: Customers using our wallet or wallet SDK can now receive and store in any of the three formats over DIDComm/Aries or OpenID4VC implementations. 
 For Verifiers: Our verifier customers can now consume credentials in their preferred combination of formats and protocols. (Note: our verifier toolkit allows for presentations of AnonCreds and JSON-LD over DIDComm, and JSON-LD and JWT over OpenID4VP) 
 
 
<p>We’re excited to see how these enhancements will empower our users and pave the way for more innovative uses of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Here’s a short video showcasing how our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet can now receive credentials from various protocols:<br><br></p>
 
 
    
 
 
<p><br>Contact us for a demo/conversation – or feel free to test it out yourself. We’re happy to chat with anyone 🙂 –&gt; info@northernblock.io</p>

 Dive into the dynamic world of digital identity with Rob MacDonald, VP of Product Marketing, and Huzefa Olia, Co-founder and COO, in our latest vlog! Join this insightful conversation as they unpack the significance of 1Kosmos’ recent certification by the Kantara Initiative for the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. Watch now:<p></p>
  
<p></p>
 
 
 Robert MacDonald:<p></p>
 
<p>Hi, Rob MacDonald here, vice president of product marketing at 1Kosmos, and welcome to our vlog.</p>
<p>Today, I’ve got Huzefa with us, our co-founder and COO. How you doing today, Huzefa?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Very good, Robert. Very good to see you. It’s been a while.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>It has been a while. I guess the unfortunate thing of working remotely, we don’t get to see each other more often. But, welcome.</p>
<p>Today, we want to talk a little bit about one of our latest announcements. So we just announced a new certification by the Kantara Initiative and it’s for the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. So for those of you that know the acronym, that’s UK D-I-A-T-F. I know you had a lot to do with that so why don’t you tell me a little bit about what that framework, the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework is all about?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>No, absolutely. So the UK Digital Identity Attribute Trust Framework came into existence a few years back and it was a standard that has been designed by the UK government, primarily designed that’s just not for corporations, but for regular citizens where any time if you want to hire somebody, if you’re renting an individual or any kind of a background service they’re providing, which requires a user to be proofed, how do you do it based on standards?</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Okay, right.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>This is a very good development in general because traditionally we’ve all been used to the NIST standard here in the United States. I know it’s been more widely being adopted as well.</p>
<p>Now local governments are creating their own standard for identity proofing. Yeah. So we saw that, we said, you know, our friends at Kantara were the ones who were reviewing and approving vendors who wanted to sign up for the standards. So we went through that process and came through it.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. So are there specific specifications that we’re certified to against that framework?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yes. So there are specifications around how you would proof an individual, what are the different levels that would go with respect to it. And we have subscribed to a level which will require a user to scan one of their digital documents, take a live selfie, and prove that cryptographically that we have a secure credential for a specific user.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>And since UK, how do you make sure that you are keeping the data very secure on our end as well?</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Great. Fair enough. So what does that certification in general say about our platform?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>This is something that we have looked at it just from the inception of the company. Don’t just build technologies, but do it based on standards as well.</p>
<p>I believe our first certification that we signed up for was for the NIST 800-63-3. We are very much into the weeds of the revision four, which is coming out, too. We saw the UK standard that was developed and then we signed up for it. And I don’t want to peel the curtain a lot, but we are involved in a lot of new standards that are coming across the globe as well, right?</p>
<p>So at 1Kosmos, we want to prove that who the individual is behind the device. To do that, you have to effectively proof a user and you have to do that based on standards as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Fair enough. So we continue to add a lot of certifications to our list. We’ve got a whole webpage dedicated to it on our website. We’ve got corporate certifications like ISO and SOC 2. We’ve got product certifications like NIST, FIDO, and iBeta. What does this certification mean to us as an organization?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, we love certifications. We have a lot of time to go through the certifications.</p>
<p>I mean that’s important, right? It’s important because have different geographies, you want to make sure that those users understand that what we are providing, that this particular technology has been vetted, vetted by their local government based on their standards as well. So I think it’s extremely important, specifically in this case for the UK market, that we are providing a digital identity platform that has been proofed, verified and not just a set of capabilities that are available for them to use.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Fair enough. And that kind of leads into my next question. It is probably more important than the last, but what do these certifications mean to our partners? What does it mean to our customers and even future partners and customers of 1Kosmos?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So anybody, so I’m talking specifically with respect to the UK certification that we have, right? If you are an entity in UK, especially if you are in the public service area, and if you have citizens that need to be proofed or even if you’re in the private sector and you are looking to hire individuals and you want to do that based on a company that is subscribing to these standards, a company that can prove those individual users and securely have them provide access to whatever service that they would like, they can sign up with us.</p>
<p>And what we would then allow to do is these individuals have been proved, have been verified based on this particular standard, this is a result of what the proofing is, we would then provide it to that particular service as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Cool. So what is it about our platform that enables us to meet these seemingly pretty stringent guidelines in your opinion?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>I would say that our platform has been very, very modular, right? So anybody who’s new to this particular podcast, we provide a set of different capabilities, identity proofing, using that particular identity to give secure access to a variety of different systems by using user’s biometrics. And the third aspect of it is to create a digital identity wallet, which will allow a user to be in control of their identity and share their attributes to whatever service that they would like.</p>
<p>What this has allowed us to do is that every specific capability, we have pretty modular where if there are certain standards, if there are certain capabilities that we need to prescribe to, it’s fairly easy for us to make that available as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Cool. Okay. So thank you for all that, by the way.</p>
<p>What’s next for 1Kosmos? I mean, like I said earlier, we kind of touched on it briefly, some of the other certifications we have, but what’s next in line for us?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>More certifications.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Continue to update the website, Rob, okay.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>We’re going through FedRAMP right now. Hopefully we will go through that process fairly soon.</p>
<p>I alluded to this earlier, but there are more government-based standards that are coming up and we are looking to prescribe to that. We are looking to get certified against them as well, not just in US and North America or in UK, but we’re talking about Asia and other parts of Europe as well. So just stay tuned, right? These are developments that are happening and we’ll be looking forward to announce them soon.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. Listen, Huzefa, thank you for taking the time to talk to us about the certification today. This is pretty awesome news and I look forward to talking to you about the next one.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Wonderful. Good catching up with you as well, Rob. Thanks.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Talk to you again.</p>

				  Indicio’s Digital Travel Credential streamlines identity verification at border crossing points for a faster and more secure journey.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>Never would I have thought I’d use the word ‘beautiful’ to describe my experience passing through immigration when traveling internationally, but that’s exactly how it felt last week in Aruba. The reason? <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-301989815.html">Aruba’s Happy One Pass (AHOP).</a> I was able to walk through border control without having to take my passport out of my pocket. It was so quick and smooth that I didn’t realize it happened.</p>
<p>With this system, you can actually go from the airplane to the beach in just 30 minutes, completely transforming the typical airport and arrival experience. And lucky travelers to Aruba will begin using the same technology to enter and depart the island nation in March 2024. This is not a federated system that sends information to other third parties and is held by others. Travelers hold their digital passport data just like they hold their physical passports — and there is full consent for data sharing at each step of the process.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. Every traveler must apply for an Embarkation Debarkation card (ED card) to enter Aruba. The night before flying to Aruba, I downloaded the AHOP app on my personal mobile phone using a special invitation sent by the Government of Aruba. Then I used my mobile phone camera to scan my passport and the RFID scanner to collect the information from the chip inside, allowing me to create a Digital Travel Credential (DTC). After taking a selfie, my face was matched and liveness was checked to ensure the passport was actually mine. Then, I sent my DTC, directly to the government of Aruba during my ED Card application process. They used my biometrics and personal information to process my application and send me my approved digital ED card. In other words, the Government of Aruba was able to check my passport and clear me for arrival all while I sat on my couch.</p>
<p>The next day when I landed in Aruba, instead of standing in a long line in the immigration terminal to get my paper documents and passports visually inspected, I headed toward the “AHOP” line, where I was presented with a camera that took my photo. Within seconds, the system had matched my face with the photo I’d sent the night before, verified my immigration status, showed the security officer the match, the green light flashed and I went on my way. It was the easiest immigration system I’d ever encountered.</p>
<p>In adopting this technology, Aruba isn’t just positioning itself as a global leader in digital travel, it is extending the seamless digital experience to everything a tourist might need or want when they visit the island, from hotel check in to booking activities with approved tour operators.</p>
<p>This seamless approach to guest services fully aligns with consumer expectations that anything and everything digital should be quick, contactless, and frictionless. The bonus with the technology used by Aruba is that it does all this while providing travelers with state-of-the-art data privacy and protection.</p>
<p>While this technology will change the experience of travel and tourism, the underlying technological accomplishment — the ability to verify the source of any data and that the data hasn’t been altered — will transform every facet of digital interaction across every sector.</p>
<p>AHOP is a milestone for Indicio, its partner in the air travel sector, SITA, and Aruba. Next stop, the world.</p>

<p>Ensuring the safety of sensitive data and privacy shifts from just a priority to an absolute necessity. Authentication, the gatekeeper of these digital resources, is crucial in this fight against cybercrime.&nbsp; In this article, you will learn what it is, why it’s helpful, how it differs from other types of authentication, and how you could implement it in your organization.</p>
 What is Step-Up Authentication? 
<p>Step Up Authentication is a dynamic form of multi-factor authentication. It works by adjusting the level of security and user verification based on the associated risk of a specific action, transaction, or mobile account.</p>
<p>Different triggers can prompt Step Up Authentication’s activation, like irregular user behavior, access requests from unfamiliar locations or devices, or high-risk transactions accessing sensitive data. Users may initially authenticate via traditional methods (username/password), but Step Up Authentication comes into play as the perceived risk escalates, demanding additional login credentials.</p>
<p>Step Up Authentication uses a hierarchical model adaptive authentication scheme, scaling from simple to complex; it provides the flexibility to apply the optimal level of security based on the perceived threat or the user’s risk profile.</p>
 The Anatomy of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes operation of Step Up Authentication is a balance between risk assessment and corresponding adjustments to the step up authentication work up level. Each transaction or request initiates a process where the system evaluates the risk level and prompts the user for a related step up authentication.</p>
<p>To make these decisions, the system utilizes various risk assessment metrics. These include factors such as the sensitivity of the requested data, the location of the user’s location request, the behavior of the user, and even the time of the request.</p>
<p>Policy management plays a big role here, as it sets the rules and parameters for when and how the system should step up the authentication process. These policies, dictated by the nature of the business and its unique security requirements, ensure that the system remains secure and user-friendly.</p>
 The Evolution of Authentication 
<p>The progression of authentication techniques paints an interesting picture of human ingenuity in the face of evolving threats. Beginning with the humble password, these techniques have developed in response to escalating risks and more sophisticated threat actors.</p>
<p>The initial stage was dominated by password-based authentication systems, a straightforward and user-friendly method, yet not without its weaknesses. Passwords, being susceptible to breaches via techniques like brute-force attacks and phishing, necessitated a more robust system.</p>
<p>Subsequently, security tokens emerged as a new layer of protection. Yet, their physical nature introduced inconvenience and added risk of loss or theft. Later, the advent of biometric authentication marked a significant stride forward against identity theft, tying access to unique human characteristics such as fingerprints or retinal patterns.</p>
<p>The most significant leap in this evolutionary process was the introduction of multi-factor authentication, combining multiple layers of security to create a formidable barrier to unauthorized access to sensitive information.<br>

</p><p>While both Step-Up Authentication,&nbsp; Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Adaptive Authentication serve the goal of improved security, they differ significantly in their approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MFA  involves presenting two or more independent credentials at every step up authentication vs. event. This could include something the user knows (password), something the user has (token), or something the user is (biometrics). MFA’s strength lies in its layered defense, using multiple authentication factors and making it challenging for unauthorized users to gain access even if they compromise one aspect.</p>
<p>Adaptive Authentication employs real-time risk assessments, considering many factors such as device reputation, IP reputation, geolocation, and behavior anomalies. Based on these assessments, Adaptive Authentication may permit, or deny authentication apps, or step up the authentication process.</p>
<p>Step-Up Authentication adjusts its various authentication factors and requirements based on the perceived risk level of a transaction or request. It might begin with a simple or two-factor authentication, such as a password, and add more layers as risk escalates. It offers the flexibility of user-friendly authentication for low-risk actions and robust security for higher-risk operations.</p>
 Viewing vs. Editing Data 
<p>One of the significant features of Step-Up Authentication is its ability to adapt to the nature of the user’s actions. For instance, when a user views data, the authentication process might require only the user’s password or a simple username and password in/password combination. This allows users to perform low-risk actions with minimal friction.</p>
<p>However, when the same user attempts to edit or export sensitive data, the system recognizes the higher risk and steps up the authentication process. This could involve using additional authentication credentials, such as a one-time password, biometric verification, or answering security questions. This dynamic response to requires users based on the action type underlines the adaptability and intelligence of Step-Up Authentication.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication in Practice 
<p>In practice, you’ll encounter Step Up Authentication in different scenarios, Financial institutions often apply it during high-value transactions. Cloud services employ it when users request access to susceptible information. It’s becoming increasingly ubiquitous across digital platforms, from email services to social media networks.</p>
<p>Sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and corporate entities, utilize Step Up Authentication as an essential tool in their security arsenal. It is increasingly recognized as a powerful means to secure sensitive data, protect user identities and stolen credentials, and maintain system integrity.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication Use Cases 
<p>Step-Up Authentication is not just a theory but a reality with practical applications across various digital platforms. For example, take a standard action like transferring funds from a banking app. Users might log in to the app using a username/password or biometric authentication. However, when the user initiates a high-value transfer, the system might request additional identity verification as a one-time password (OTP) sent to the user’s registered mobile number or email.</p>
<p>Another use case can be found within corporate systems; an employee may be able to access common, low-sensitivity resources using a simple password. Still, when attempting to access further sensitive resources, more sensitive information, or administrative controls, the system prompts them to undergo further authentication, such as answering security questions or presenting a physical token.</p>
 The Strengths of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>By assessing its impact, the merits of Step Up Authentication become abundantly clear. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to bolster security, creating a robust defense against a wide array of cyber threats.</p>
<p>But its benefits extend beyond security; it contributes significantly to improving user experience, as the need for rigorous additional authentication factors and measures only arises under elevated risk conditions. This reduces friction and potential frustration in day-to-day user interactions.</p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, Step Up Authentication also aids in meeting regulatory requirements for data breach protection. Moreover, it has become a potent tool in the risk management arsenal, offering an adaptive and responsive approach to data breaches and threat mitigation.</p>
 Pitfalls and Proactive Measures 
<p>Like any system, Step Up Authentication has its potential pitfalls. These include technical implementation challenges, user acceptance, and the ever-present struggle to balance security with ease of use. However, with a strategic approach, these obstacles can be navigated effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proactive problem-solving measures, such as comprehensive user education programs, policy optimization, and ongoing system monitoring and updating, are key to addressing these challenges.&nbsp;</p>
 Security Implications and Concerns in Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Though a significant security improvement, step-Up Authentication has potential risks and vulnerabilities. Understanding these security implications and how they can be mitigated is essential to ensure robust protection against cyber threats.</p>
<p>One potential concern is user acceptance and cooperation. Given its nature, users may need clarification on the changing requirements for authentication. This issue is not just a usability concern but also a security concern, as user non-compliance or bypass attempts can introduce vulnerabilities into the system.</p>
<p>Another concern revolves around the accuracy of risk assessment. The effectiveness of Step-Up Authentication depends primarily on correctly identifying and responding to potential risks. Inaccurate risk assessments can lead to security breaches if high-risk actions are not identified correctly and high-risk resources don’t trigger a step-up in authentication.</p>
<p>The additional security measures used in Step-Up Authentication, like biometrics or security questions, bring potential vulnerabilities. For instance, biometric data can be spoofed, and security questions can often be guessed or discovered through social engineering.</p>
 Mitigation Practices for Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Mitigating these concerns involves several strategies:</p>
 
 Clear communication about how the system works and its necessity can be beneficial to increase user acceptance.&nbsp; 
 User training can also help ensure that users understand the authentication requirements. 
 Refinement of the risk assessment algorithm and learning from past mistakes are critical for improving risk assessment accuracy.&nbsp; 
 Regular auditing and testing can help identify potential weaknesses in the risk assessment process. 
 
<p>As for the vulnerabilities related to additional security measures, it is key to ensure these are implemented with their own security best practices. For instance, biometric data should be stored securely, and liveness detection tools, like <a>BlockID,</a> should be used to prevent spoofing.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Within an organization, inactive user accounts can persist for various reasons, including former employees, service providers, and service accounts associated with products or services. These accounts may remain inactive temporarily or for extended periods. If an account remains inactive for 90 days or more, it is more likely to remain inactive. It’s crucial to periodically review these inactive accounts and eliminate any that are unnecessary. Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews now offers the capability to detect inactive accounts effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Entra ID Governance Access Review feature, it’s possible to identify accounts that have not been actively used to sign into Entra ID, either interactively or non-interactively, for up to 720 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accounts that are left inactive are susceptible to being targeted by cybercriminals for several reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inactive accounts may still use well-known passwords or credentials that have been compromised.&nbsp; 
 Inactive accounts are less likely to have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.&nbsp; 
 Due to their inactivity, these accounts may go unnoticed by advanced security controls in place.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While organizations with a formal JML (Joiners, Movers, and Leavers) process in place can mitigate some of these risks, regular reviews are still essential to ensure that security measures are effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding the standards for monitoring accounts&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-navigator">CIS Control V8 Safe guard 5.3</a> it’s recommended to delete or disable any dormant accounts after a period of 45 days of inactivity, where supported. This is also aligned with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-privileged-access#pa-4-review-and-reconcile-user-access-regularly">Azure Security Benchmark v3 PA-4 Control</a> - Review and reconcile user access regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yuting and Nico are the founders of ZKorum. Yuting earned her Bachelor's degree at NYU Abu Dhabi and her Master's at ESSEC Business School. Nico is a Software Engineer and previously worked on projects that utilized Filecoin. </p><p>Nico is passionate about self-sovereign identity, and when he and Yuting joined forces, they started building this vision of a social network that runs on verifiable and anonymous data. </p><p>They both recognized a big problem with social media today. It's incredibly invasive and full of bots, scams, and disinformation. We cannot trust anyone online, and we have no way to prove that we are who we say we are unless we trust a third party to verify our identities. For example, some apps require you to verify your identity by uploading your ID. But this is very invasive. </p><p>Furthermore, our personal information is being collected and sold online every day by data brokers. In fact, the global data broker market was valued at <a href="https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/report/global-data-broker-market#:~:text=The%20global%20data%20broker%20market,US%24545.431%20billion%20in%202028.">$319 billion</a> in 2021. According to the <a href="https://epic.org/issues/consumer-privacy/data-brokers/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a>, data brokers collect and aggregate numerous types of personal information, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, gender, age, marital status, children, education, profession, income, political preferences, cars, and real estate owned. </p><p>Is there a better solution? How can we verify ourselves without trusting the third-party verifier and keeping our personal information safe?</p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs! A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method or protocol used to demonstrate the authenticity of a statement or the possession of certain knowledge without revealing the actual information or knowledge itself. </p><p>Currently, ZKorum uses zero-knowledge proofs by acting as both the issuer and the verifier of Verifiable Credentials. Most large organizations already own a domain name and distribute unique email addresses to their members. Using this infrastructure, ZKorum can issue the user corresponding Verifiable Credentials, such as "female employee of XYZ Company." In this way, the user can prove her eligibility without revealing any unique identifier. ZKorum's closed-source competitors also rely on email addresses to verify that users indeed belong to those companies, but by being 100% open-source, ZKorum minimizes the trust that users need to put in them. In other words, "Don't trust, verify." Even in the event of a security breach, data would already be anonymized and unlikable to user profiles. &nbsp;</p> ZKorum as a Social Site <p>Yuting and Nico wanted to build an online forum where communities and verified members could create and participate in anonymous polls, surveys, discussions, and votes - a progressive web app where anyone can browse the existing public surveys and view their results.</p>Example Poll (Source: ZKorum)<p>ZKorum strives to create a safe and inclusive space where everyone feels secure and comfortable sharing their experiences and exchanging opinions without fearing backlash. That is why privacy-preserving technology is so important!</p> How is ZKorum using Fission Tech? <p>ZKorum is using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> for passwordless authentication between the client and the server. Since ZKorum took a DID-centric authentication approach using a wallet, they needed cryptographic keys.</p><p>However, ZKorum innovated even further by taking the security and seamlessness of UCAN authentication and combining it with the ease of use of email address verification. A one-time code is used to register a new user and their device, and then every request is signed using the device’s DID. Currently, ZKorum is utilizing the WebCrypto API to store cryptographic secrets in the browser, but eventually, it will switch to passkeys. ZKorum opted to hide the UCAN authentication behind the email address login flow because users are used to it, and they did want to overwhelm folks with technical jargon or multiple steps. ZKorum's end users are not expected to be highly technical users. They might be, but there is no assumption there. The idea is that anyone who can answer surveys on a computer will be able to understand how to use the ZKorum web app.</p> Future Plans <p>Yuting and Nico see ZKorum as a powerful way to protect people's privacy by separating a user's profile from their actions, also known as unlinkability. They want to build an open-source library providing this core feature of unlinkability, making it available for other developers to use across different products of their own.</p><p>ZKorum also actively provides feedback to the EU regulators and builders working on the EU ID Wallet. ZKorum aims to be compatible with official Verifiable Credentials, such as the European Digital Identity.</p><p>Yuting and Nico are also working with the Master's Program at ESSEC Business School in France to issue Verifiable Credentials, which would be a novel way to engage the student body and gather their opinion.</p> <p>If you want to learn more about Zkorum, please visit their <a href="https://zkorum.notion.site/9c3e955c69204a2a82d23dd2e2621a30?v=1d312aa5f20b43a09f95a94ca98b75ac">website</a>.</p>

A 3-way points tie for 3rd place brought 5 participants to the podium in this data challenge. Overview <p>This data challenge leaped into the fascinating world of automobile reviews with the “AutoInsight Challenge.” This challenge invited participants to delve deep into Doug DeMuro’s car review score. Here data scientists could explore, analyze, and uncover the data’s myriad stories and insights directly from Doug’s scoring metrics. Participants were able to navigate various aspects of the car reviews, from understanding correlations between different scoring categories to exploring how these scores might influence car prices. This data challenge received the most amount of submissions to date in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges">Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Program</a> and as a result, this experiment produced some of the highest-quality reports recorded to date. Enough high-quality reports to grant a 3-way tie for a 3rd-place finish on the&nbsp;podium.</p><p>The dataset, pulled from <a href="https://www.dougdemuro.com/">https://www.dougdemuro.com/</a> comprises 585 car reviews, revealing a balanced representation between weekend and daily scores across 80 car&nbsp;brands.</p> Objectives <p>The challenge embraced several data analysis dimensions: from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to insightful data visualization and predictive modeling. Participants unraveled the data, made it clean and coherent for analysis then subsequently explored it to uncover insights, correlations, and patterns within the data. The key purpose for participants in this challenge was to Submit a comprehensive report synthesizing their findings from the data analysis in a format that is accessible and engaging for a non-technical audience, such as car enthusiasts or prospective car buyers; or even Doug DeMuro&nbsp;himself.</p><p>The winning reports for this challenge are as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st place — Luca Ordronneau <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:8883bc816cea8651382e83caa1193a1c7ac3fbe7ef0ad4abaca3415c21d2677b">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:8883bc816cea8651382e83caa1193a1c7ac3fbe7ef0ad4abaca3415c21d2677b</a></p><p>Due to an emphasis on the business readiness objective of this challenge and reporting structure, the review committee agreed that the report entered by Luca Ordronneau included the most precise, clean, and thorough information about the data and challenge at hand. Luca’s report efficiently demonstrated relationship analysis in the data, a complete understanding of the dataset, and business-ready formatting in this winning&nbsp;entry.</p><p>A snippet above shows a slide from Luca’s report that tells an audience the top 20 cars with the highest Doug score. Further data organization leads readers to learn that Doug often favors German vehicles, and as the year of the car model increases, so does the average score that Doug gives to the given car make &amp;&nbsp;model.</p> 2nd Place — FonkMasterFlexr <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:858bb213650fe33e086560e7743c52ff2ba37817a8678dad5ca1c43cc26c4141">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:858bb213650fe33e086560e7743c52ff2ba37817a8678dad5ca1c43cc26c4141</a></p><p>The 2nd place finish in this challenge includes a high-speed and high-impact approach to navigating through Doug’s car scores. FonkMasterFlexr, in this exercise, displayed great execution in delivering clear-cut and direct findings from the dataset and recommendations to prospective luxury car buyers whilst leveraging data science&nbsp;tools.</p><p>The above shares a snippet from FonkMasterFlexr report: here the Fonk Master shows readers a dual nature between the weekend score and daily score. If you know Doug’s brand and channel, you know there are different sides to not only the personalities of weekday and weekend vibes of classic cars but also the personalities of the people driving said&nbsp;cars.</p><p>This data challenge received a record-high 18 qualifying submissions. After scoring and review, the calculations for podium finishes and prizes resulted in a 3-way tie for 3rd place. To accompany so many high-value reports, the Ocean Data Challenge team approved allowing all 5 submissions to enter the podium finish. The 3-way tie for 3rd place includes the following:</p> 3rd — Haumea <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:969d503eb93dbe852748159ce9422f3eb99670f02bf80ad6432e1f20973730ad">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:969d503eb93dbe852748159ce9422f3eb99670f02bf80ad6432e1f20973730ad</a></p><p>The report “The World of Cars through Doug DeMuro’s Eyes” by Haumea analyzes Doug DeMuro’s car review dataset to understand how various factors influence a car’s overall rating. Relevant findings include a negative correlation between Practicality and Fun Factor, with Practicality scoring negatively influencing the overall DougScore, and a strong positive correlation between Acceleration and Handling, suggesting sportier cars excel in both, though at a cost to Comfort, especially for cars with Acceleration ratings above 6. The report also identifies a weak correlation between Styling and Quality, indicating that a car’s aesthetic appeal doesn’t always match its build&nbsp;quality.</p><p>The analysis shows that sport-oriented brands like Lamborghini and Ferrari typically score higher on Weekend Scores, while family-oriented brands like Lexus and Hyundai excel in Daily Scores. The study also reveals non-linear relationships and interaction effects between scoring components, such as high Acceleration and Handling scores disproportionately boosting the overall DougScore, while improvements in Styling or Comfort have diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds. The report’s insights provide a nuanced understanding of Doug DeMuro’s scoring system and offer valuable perspectives for automotive industry professionals and car&nbsp;buyers.</p> 3rd — Nicolas&nbsp;Landry <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:b1eee66c360e73b45844689f05614260bf3e285748fe57d2f9d53a6fbcb4ebad">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:b1eee66c360e73b45844689f05614260bf3e285748fe57d2f9d53a6fbcb4ebad</a></p><p>A standout finding is a negative correlation between Practicality and Fun Factor, with vehicles like the Rivian R1T and GMC Hummer EV Pickup ranking high in these categories, but Value remains a distinctly independent factor. The analysis also uncovers a strong positive correlation between Handling and Acceleration, indicating that cars that accelerate faster generally handle better. However, this comes at the expense of Comfort, especially for cars with an acceleration rating above&nbsp;6.</p>The image above shows a heat map of interaction effects found between DougScore indicators.<p>Further, the report explores the nuanced relationship between Styling, Quality, and Cool Factor, with a subtle positive correlation between Styling and Cool Factor, but a weak negative correlation with Quality. Brand-wise, sports brands like Lamborghini, McLaren, and Ferrari focus on Weekend Scores, contrasting with family-oriented brands like Lexus and Hyundai, which excel in Daily Scores. The report is insightful for its exploration of how different scoring components interact, particularly highlighting the disproportionate impact of high acceleration and handling scores on the overall DougScore and the diminishing returns in areas like styling or comfort beyond certain thresholds. This comprehensive analysis offers valuable perspectives for both the automotive industry and potential car buyers, dissecting the nuances that make a car stand out in Doug DeMuro’s&nbsp;reviews.</p> 3rd — Philip&nbsp;Roman <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0cf0fbd28a359ce8ff06c5f1bab47f2e70a4e25f6e0c51fd7dd110890fec04b3">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0cf0fbd28a359ce8ff06c5f1bab47f2e70a4e25f6e0c51fd7dd110890fec04b3</a></p><p>Key findings in this 3rd place tying report include strong correlations between score categories, such as the negative correlation between Fun Factor and Practicality, and the positive correlation between Acceleration and Handling. It reveals the interaction effects of score components and their non-linear influence on the final DougScore. The report also explores relationships between car origins and scores, indicating higher average DougScores for cars from Germany, Italy, and the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>Notably, this report uncovered diminishing returns in the DougScore for cars with very high ratings in specific categories. Overall, the report highlights the complexity of the DougScore, emphasizing the importance of a balanced car profile in achieving high&nbsp;ratings.</p>Here Philips report compares fun factor and practicability scores.

<p>In a previous blog we introduced <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/digital-certificate-linting/">Digital Certificate Linting</a>. It is interesting how certification authorities (CAs) have deployed certificate linting of public trust certificates without policy requirements from the browsers or the CA/Browser Forum. Linting does not need to be mandated as it naturally helps CAs to be compliant by limiting certificate miss-issuance. This also increases customer service as certificates do not need to be revoked and reissued.</p>
<p>Over a number of years, Entrust has slowly deployed linting. Our first goal was to ensure the linters were not developed by the same team which developed our products. The thought was to minimize the duplication of errors in the policy software and the linting software. We focused on using third party linters for TLS certificates such as cablint and <a href="https://github.com/zmap/zlint">zlint</a>.</p>
<p>Entrust first ran linting against all of our active TLS certificates to find issues and remove errors. We ran post-issuance linting to detect errors, which do not interfere with certificate issuance. When we were happy with the results, we implemented pre-issuance linting.</p>
<p>With pre-issuance linting, if there is a linting error detected a certificate should not be issued. When a pre-certificate is issued for certificate transparency (CT) logging, then the pre-certificate with a linting error will be revoked. The goal of pre-issuance linting is to not miss-issue certificates and provide the details of the error to the team in order to correct the issue.</p>
<p>Although the public certificate linters were designed for TLS certificates, we expanded post-issuance linting to all certificate types. This was done first by only using the non-TLS components of the linters, plus adding other specific components. For each issuing CA, we created a certificate profile, which the CA could issue. This would separate each CA to its certificate type and would narrow down the CA scope to its key usage, extended key usage, permitted key size, hash algorithm, certificate policy, CRL link, etc. We also added in weak key checking, CT logging requirements, and ensured the subject name met the requirements which were validated.</p>
<p>Certificate linting can support the three per cent self-audit requirement from the CA/Browser Forum baseline requirement documents. In fact, since linting is done in an automated fashion, it can be extended to 100 per cent of the certificates. The result is the most extensive and non-subjective self-audit methodology, which may be the primary source of detecting certificate miss-issuance. In the case where a CA miss-issues a certificate which is not detected by linting, the CA may consider updating the linting software to better detect the error in the future. In addition, the linting results and actions can also be provided to the compliance auditor, which shows extensive monitoring and actions when an error is detected.</p>
<p>All CAs issuing publicly trusted certificates should consider certificate linting. Also, CAs which perform linting, but have miss-issued certificates should consider whether linting can be updated to detect the error in the future. Updates to shared linting software will reduce the risk to browser users and the inconvenience to secure server operators.</p>

  <p>We are honored to be acknowledged as a Leader in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management for the fourth consecutive year. To us, this recognition is an acknowledgement to our deep understanding of the market, our teams of innovators, and our close collaboration with customers, partners, and industry experts to deliver the products and services needed in the dynamic, digital economy.</p>

<p>We take pride in our history of providing simple and safe access experiences for all identities across any environment and we're thrilled to be recognized as a Leader in this space. And now that ForgeRock has joined forces with Ping Identity — another recognized Leader in the Magic Quadrant for Access Management — we anticipate even greater opportunities to serve customers' needs through broader and deeper product capabilities.</p>

<p>For more information, please download the full <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2023">2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management report</a>.</p>

<p>Ping Identity's PingOne Cloud Platform and ForgeRock Identity Cloud were both named as a Leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management. The two solutions were evaluated independently before Ping Identity and ForgeRock were combined on August 23, 2023.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 ForgeRock Product Capabilities 

<p>ForgeRock Access Management capabilities come together seamlessly through identity administration and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">access orchestration</a>.</p>
	
<p>ForgeRock's identity administration capabilities help our customers connect and manage their identity data in ways that align with their business objectives. For example, our customers can create organizational hierarchies that represent the reality of their specific customers, brands, partners, suppliers, and more. Next, customers can create relationships between users and organizations to best manage different experience and security requirements for each different user population. At runtime, this data is provided as an input to the orchestration flow, which delivers personalized user journeys based on the dynamic data inputs — all from a single platform.</p>
	
<p>Recent <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> enhancements noted by Gartner include:</p>

  <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">New signals for threat detection</a>: Our AI/ML-powered big data architecture ingests data from various sources and converts that data into signals, giving customers fine-grained control over how the signals are weighted for risk, synthesized, and interpreted. Out-of-the-box signals detect anomalous user behavior, suspicious IP addresses, credential stuffing and brute-force attacks, impossible traveler scenarios, and bots. We are bringing rich signals and prevention from the endpoint to the application and building practical features around those signals to ensure they are explainable and usable in real-world scenarios. 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration/capabilities">New flows and connectors to orchestration trees</a>: Intelligent Access (“Trees”) gives customers ultimate control of their user identity experiences through the use of low-code orchestrated identity journeys. We continue to evolve this capability, providing new journeys and nodes (the building blocks of journeys) for common use cases. We also have extended our cloud solution to include Trust Network marketplace nodes for common partner integrations. 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">Passkeys compatibility</a>: We have always been a leader in the passwordless space with early adoption and support of FIDO standards, including WebAuthn. This year, we added support for passkeys, further strengthening our ability to support CIAM and workforce use cases looking to go truly passwordless. 
  ForgeRock and Ping Identity: A Winning Combination 

<p>As we look into the next year, the combination of ForgeRock and Ping Identity will drive further innovation and greater customer value in the access management space. I believe having a unified vision and strategy is a winning combination for customers seeking the best solutions for their often complex needs — and our collective team has years of expertise and diverse backgrounds to help on that journey.</p>

<p>To learn more about the access management market, I'd encourage you to read this latest version of the Gartner Magic Quadrant and check Ping Identity's positioning. I believe analysis by Gartner can help you select a partner that can support your enterprise's need for a modern access management solution.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The European Digital Identity (EUDI), a cornerstone of the eIDAS regulation, represents a cross-border digital identity initiative set to revolutionise electronic identification in the EU. Available to all EU citizens, residents, and organisations, EUDI is designed to offer a unified, secure, and efficient method for online identity verification. Central to its functionality is the innovative EUDI Wallet, a sophisticated platform for electronic identification that digitally encapsulates individual identities. This wallet integrates various attributes and credentials, ensuring they are stored and managed with utmost security and respect for privacy. As an integral part of the EU digital identity and trust services framework, EUDI extends beyond the wallet, offering a comprehensive solution for digital identity management across the European Union.</p>
 Why is EUDI Needed? 
<p>Although the majority of countries within the EU have some form of national digital identity solution or eID, only 60% of citizens from 14 member states are able to use their eID in another state (cross-border). That leaves over 150 million people in the EU alone without access to strong cross-border authentication, and with only 14% of public service providers allowing cross-border authentication. Yet, 63% of EU citizens want a single eID for online services across the EU according to the Eurobarometer survey (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU Commission</a>). The EUDI will provide an EU-wide digital identity that will allow for cross-border trust service usage.</p>
 Key features of EUDI 
 User-Centric Control: 
<p>At the heart of the EUDI’s design is user-centric control, aligning with eIDAS principles. It empowers both individuals and businesses to manage their electronic identification and digital identity with autonomy. Users have the discretion to select the information they share, the entities they share it with, and the purposes for which it is used. This feature not only enhances user autonomy but also bolsters privacy protection within the digital ecosystem.</p>
 Interoperability: 
<p>EUDI exemplifies interoperability as envisaged in the EU digital identity framework. It offers a harmonised solution across the EU, enabling seamless cross-border access to digital services. An EUDI issued in any member state is recognised across all others, facilitating service access without the need for redundant verification. This interoperability is a significant step towards realising a cohesive digital Europe.</p>
 Security: 
<p>Security is a paramount feature of the EUDI, incorporating state-of-the-art encryption and authentication mechanisms. These technologies protect against identity theft, fraud, and other cyber threats, making EUDI a reliable and secure tool for electronic identification and online transactions.</p>
 Accessibility: 
<p>The EUDI champions digital inclusion, crafted to be accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities or limited access to technology. This inclusive approach is integral to the EU digital identity and trust services ethos, ensuring equal access to online services across all member states.</p>
 Expandability: 
<p>Designed to be versatile, the EUDI supports a wide array of applications, from basic online authentication to more complex uses like digital licenses and insurance. It even facilitates instant payments using the digital Euro, showcasing its adaptability to various digital identity needs and trust services within the EU framework.</p>
 Benefits of EUDI 
<p>The EUDI will be available for all EU citizens that are eligible for a national ID card and will be recognised across the EU. It will be a secure way to share information with services, allowing users to control how much information they want to share. The EUDI will be operated via digital wallets on mobile phones and other devices and will enable users to identify themselves both online and offline. The EUDI wallets will allow users to store and exchange government-provided data (i.e. name, date of birth and nationality), information provided by trusted private sources, and to use the information as confirmation of the right to reside, work, or study in a certain member state. It ultimately provides a cross-border digital identity that will benefit citizens across the EU.</p>
 Practical Uses of EUDI 
<p>There are a variety of key use cases that the EUDI can be used for, including public service applications and requests, opening bank accounts, tax returns and applications to universities, alongside proof of identity, storing medical prescriptions, and securing transactions. There are some use cases that underpin the development of the EUDI Wallet, to support meeting objectives.</p>
 Practical Example of EUDI Usage 
<p>Currently, opening a bank account involves multiple steps that may involve in-person meetings, signing paperwork and a tedious back and forth if any documents are missing. In addition, any cross-border banking is hampered by the lack of standard document formats, document coverage/accuracy and even simple language barriers. However, with the introduction of the EUDI a user would simply be able to respond to the bank’s request by selecting the required documents that are stored on their EUDI wallet, already in a standard format. These documents will then be sent securely to the bank as verifiable digital documents, for the bank to process and continue with the application.</p>
 The interplay between EUDI pilots and eIDAS Regulation 
<p>After a six-month delay, the EUDI pilots are now starting and will continue well into 2024. Unusually, the actual eIDAS legislation is still being developed at the same time, even as the pilots are running. In addition, there are two further parallel streams: writing of the standards and documenting the reference implementation. All four of these elements: legislation, standards, reference implementation and the pilots, are dependent on each other. The standards must comply with the law, the reference implementation needs to implement the standards, and the pilots should utilise the reference implementation. Ideally, feedback from the pilots should in turn guide the legislative process, closing the circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loop of interdependencies is caused both by the repeated delays in defining the base architecture and by the aggressive “Swiss knife” approach to the EUDI by the European Commission. What is often missed, however, is that the main hurdles regarding the whole EUDI project are not technical, or legal framework but political. The EUDI is designed to be much more than a simple mobile authenticator and therefore it must forge a compromise between 27 nation states from minute technical details to very profound decisions potentially affecting hundreds of millions of people – for example, whether to force every resident to adopt a persistent unique identifier.</p>
 The road to hell is paved with eternal secrets 
<p>When we think of strong digital identities, likely the first thing that we visualise is a unique identifier or a “name tag” that is then linked to a natural person for life. That is indeed one possible solution, but perhaps surprisingly there are alternative designs as well. The 27 EU member states have widely varying approaches. In some member states, one is automatically assigned a persistent unique identifier before leaving the maternity hospital. Elsewhere one will be assigned only in specific circumstances, while finally some member states do not assign such identifiers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On paper, having an identifier can simplify many governmental processes and ease digitalisation. However, its unchanging nature makes it very unwieldy in practice. The identifier will continue to exist, unchanged, for the lifetime of an individual. As the end users are required to use it to identify themselves in both on- and offline transactions, it becomes very challenging to simultaneously keep it secret for their entire lifetimes. The same applies to every private and public organisation who stores or processes it, and sadly it takes just a single data breach to lose control of it forever. In the age of pen and paper perhaps this was deemed a not so omnipresent threat. But as digitalisation marches on and KYC legislation spreads from finance to the hospitality industry and beyond, having copies made of one’s personal documents is turning from an exception to a standard policy. As it stands, the persistence and omnipresent use of the unique identifier leaves the unfortunate victims of identity theft with only bad options: either be on constant lookout for any misuse for life or go through the massive process of changing the identifier (if allowed by national legislation) and then getting every single document from one’s birth certificate to school records to work contracts changed to reflect the new identity.</p>
<p>Nothing is certain until the legislation is finalised, but currently it seems likely that the EUDI will controversially force everyone to adopt such an identifier yet seeks to bypass some of the shortcomings both via the magic of public key cryptography and by optionally allowing the creation of pseudonyms – aliases that only officials are able to link to an individual. For example, there could be a ‘healthcare me’, distinct from a ‘banking me’ and a ‘social media me’. Officials would be able to link all three together, but a cybercriminal or a data breach would be (hopefully) limited to an identity affecting a single sector. Of course, this is not a perfect solution, but it certainly is better than no solution.</p>
<p>Once again it should be emphasised that the 27 member nations have very differing opinions on how to best proceed and marking features as optional – like the pseudonyms mentioned above – is a well-known compromise when the standardising body cannot gather enough support to either include or exclude it from the core standards. Optional features rarely become universal, and worryingly it seems likely that any optional features of the EUDI will not be exceptions to this rule. Any optional features will be adopted by some of the member states, while others will decline to take them into use. This threatens the fragmentation of the whole European digital market from day one… which is exactly how the situation stands after eIDAS version 1, and what the EUDI is seeking to solve.</p>
<p>Controversies around the fundamental design principles highlight both the importance of the whole EUDI project, as well as how politically influenced or even driven any cross-border effort can be. It is wrong to say that international projects would be generally disadvantaged from intense debate though, as having over two dozen interest group opinions and different viewpoints is a tremendous advantage to any undertaking. The varied features and pilots of EUDI would not be possible if a single member state would have to carry all the burden by themselves.</p>

			 Navigating the Booming Trend of Tokenized T-Bills&nbsp; 
 
<p>In recent weeks, the tokenization of Treasury bills (T-bills) has become a trending and popular topic, with on-chain data from our friends from RWA.xyz (see the chart below) revealing a total value of approximately $750 million and an average yield of 5.24%.&nbsp;This marks a remarkable 700% increase for the year, sparking market enthusiasm. However, it’s worth noting that the actual aggregate value of tokenized real-world assets, including T-bills, exceeds reported figures due to traditional players withholding on-chain data, indicating&nbsp;a larger market size than apparent.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>While it is fascinating to see the surging assets brought on-chain, a fundamental question arises:&nbsp;‘Why tokenize?’&nbsp;If the motivation behind tokenizing T-bills is solely market-driven, without added value, it won’t succeed in attracting traditional issuers and investors into the market.&nbsp;Traditional T-bills are already extremely accessible and liquid&nbsp;for US citizens. Individuals outside the US can easily purchase and sell T-bills ETF via fintechs or distributors.</p>
<p>The true value proposition of tokenized T-bills lies in transferability and interoperability,&nbsp;providing holders with unique utilities and automation beyond the scope of traditional forms. This encompasses the capacity for peer-to-peer transfers with eligible counterparts, trading across diverse platforms, utilizing them as collateral for borrowing, and staking to earn additional yields.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>To access these advantages,&nbsp;issuers need control to enforce compliance at the token level, requiring sophisticated smart contracts. Basic standards like ERC20 and ERC721 (NFT) are inadequate, as they are inherently permissionless, allowing unrestricted transfers. This limits issuers to conducting KYC only during the onboarding and redeeming process, with intermittent actions going uncontrollable by issuers.</p>
<p>Hence, the issuance of tokenized T-bills must adopt&nbsp;permissioned token standards such as ERC3643. This enables tokens to embed data and compliance rules&nbsp;to ensure compliant automation, transfers, and interactions throughout the entire token lifecycle while enabling issuers to obtain controls.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Having successfully supported clients in tokenizing T-bills and money market funds through the ERC3643 standard, we’re here to assist if you’re contemplating a similar issuance with a turnkey and white-label solution.</p>

<p></p><p>It was Friday night in New Orleans, and I was ready to kick off the weekend in true local style with a drink. I ordered my favorite wine on a food delivery app, but before the sale could be finalized, the wine store needed to verify my age. Seamlessly, they connected to my digital <a href="https://lawallet.com/">LA Wallet</a>, and without sharing any extra details, my wallet confirmed I was 21+. Within 30 minutes, I was sipping my wine, in awe of the blend of tradition and cutting-edge technology - technology that I'm fortunate to work on, and also enjoy the convenience of.</p> LA Wallet<a title="Direct link to LA Wallet">​</a> <p>Louisiana leads the way with its fully operational mobile driver's license (mDL) system. In the Big Easy, where I live, we go with the flow - meaning you never know what your day may entail. In such a culture, I've really enjoyed the convience of having things like my driver's license and COVID vaccination cards readily available on a mobile app for whenever I may need them.</p><p>Recognized legally as an equalivalent to physical identification, LA Wallet is my go-to for age-restricted purchases/entry, voting, and (heaven forbid) police encounters.  Because of this, the mDL ensures legal compliance and security while leveraging the convenience and accessibility of mobile technology. They accomplish this by using Verifiable Credentials.</p> Verifiable Credentials<a title="Direct link to Verifiable Credentials">​</a> <p>In the simplest terms, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> are digital versions of traditional documents like driver's licenses, passports, or university degrees. But they're more than just digital copies; they're secured with encryption, making them tamper-evident and instantly verifiable.</p><p>When the store connected to my LA Wallet, it wasn't just pulling up a digital version of my driver's license. Instead, the app used a Verifiable Credential – a piece of digital data that proves certain information about me without revealing everything. In this case, it confirmed that I am over the age of 21. The beauty of this system is in its respect for privacy; it didn't disclose my exact age, or any other personal detail that would be available had I shared my full driver's license.</p><p>Once my age was verified, the vendor allowed the purchase, and the delivery proceeded as planned. The entire process was seamless, fast, and respectful of my privacy. This is particularly interesting in my scenario where there's likely legal responsibilities for the delivery company as well as the wine vendor to verify my age. My mDL is a trusted source that can provide this proof to all of the involved parties without sharing all of my details.</p><p>This experience is a prime example of how Verifiable Credentials can simplify and secure everyday transactions. As we move more into the digital realm, the need for secure, private, and efficient verification methods becomes increasingly crucial. Verifiable Credentials meet these needs by offering a way to share necessary information without over-sharing.</p><p>The use of Verifiable Credentials is set to expand in various sectors, from healthcare to finance. As technology continues to evolve, it's exciting to see how innovations like Verifiable Credentials are making our digital lives more convenient and secure. It's not just about the technology; it's about how it enhances our daily experiences, one verification at a time.</p>

   The blog post discusses Federated Identity and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), comparing the two architectures. Functionally, there's a lot in common. Technically, not so much. Read on to learn more!

<p>Understanding federated identity and how it compares to self-sovereign identity (SSI) requires a basic understanding of when, where, and how digital identities are used online today. There is no “one size fits all,” though passionate proponents of various technologies may beg to differ. Alas, the world is not that simple: Different use cases drive different architectures and prioritize different technologies. That makes for quite a bit of confusion and a rather long blog post.</p>



 Why the confusion? 



<p>One question you might ask is, why is there so much confusion, anyway? The terms don’t look anything alike, so surely they must be entirely different things! Well, no, not at a functional level. (The technology stacks used to support that functionality differ, but we’ll discuss that later.)</p>



<p>First, let’s recognize that not everyone even likes the term SSI. It’s unclear whether digital wallet technologies fall under this category; some people say they do, others don’t. Other people are immediately turned off by how early proponents of SSI focused almost exclusively on blockchain technology. For the sake of this post, know that I’m coming at this from the perspective of SSI as an architecture that encompasses a user-centric focus for digital identity credentials. YMMV.</p>



<p>Both Federated Identity and SSI models support similar (but not wholly overlapping) use cases. For example, both models can support remote identification, authentication, and/or authorization to online services. Both require an entity that holds the source records, issues credentials, and supports the possibility of a third party using those credentials. It’s also possible (but rarely implemented in the Federated Identity model) that the person engaged in the transaction has some control over what exactly is shared with the third party requesting the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more!&nbsp;</p>



 Discovery 



<p>In both models, there is also the requirement that an individual be able to make some choices about what credential they want to use. Within Federated Identity, that means being able to pick the identity provider (IdP) from a list or type an identifier for it into a dialog box. In the SSI model, that means being able to pick from a list of locally stored credentials OR picking the correct container (aka, the digital wallet) used to store the appropriate credentials.</p>



<p>If this sounds like a UX nightmare, it is. Federated identity has been used in production environments for decades, and they still haven’t definitively solved what’s referred to as “the discovery problem.” In the research and education sector, for example, a single relying party (RP) might need to offer a choice of nearly 6,000 IdPs for the user to select from. The SSI model is realizing the same pain now, exacerbated by the desire not to let any third party know more information than they absolutely have to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there is just enough functional similarity to make things interesting when talking about these two architectures. Some might even say that SSI is just another flavor of Federated Identity (note: that way lies madness). Now, let’s talk about some of the differences.</p>



 Federated Identity 



<p>What use cases drive decisions toward one model and not the other? Well, for one thing, it provides the company that operates the IdP control over the authentication process and the information shared during the transaction. In the case of an enterprise organization, that makes a lot of sense. Authentication and authorization in this use case is by, for, and about an individual as they relate to a company. It’s not about the individual’s private information; it’s the data about them as associated with and owned by the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s all a question of functional requirements. The technology stacks, however, are quite different. When talking about federated identity models, protocols like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml">Security Assertion Markup Language</a>&nbsp;(SAML),&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol">OpenID Connect</a>&nbsp;are what describe (and constrain) everything including the claims, the assertions used, the structure of the attributes shared, the way identity provider discovery is handled, and more. A great deal of control is given to both the RP and the IdP, and there is a coarse level of control for the individual (generally in the form of “you can either choose to log in or not, but you aren’t guaranteed control over what information is shared as a result”).</p>



 SSI 



<p>The SSI model is a very different beast in the underlying assumptions, protocols, and architecture used. The most important entity involved in any transaction is the individual, aka the user (not my favorite term, but it’s pretty common in the documentation). The individual decides what information is shared and with whom. In a typical use case, when an individual uses a credential in an SSI model, nothing reports back to the issuing authority that lets them track what the individual is doing with their credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, the individual has discrete control over every bit of information in their credential. In fact, the protocols are being designed to ensure a minimum of information is shared in an identity transaction. For example, when a third party asks for verification that the individual is over 55, all they should get in return is a ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ They should not get the date of birth, home address, a photo, and whether the individual has chosen to donate organs upon death: the information shared when presenting a physical US driver’s license to verify age. Another name for this is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dock.io/post/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a>.</p>



<p>When considering the protocols, SAML (as far as I know) will never properly fit in an SSI world. OAuth and OpenID Connect may, and there’s work in progress to make that happen (check out&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;if you want to know more). Work is also underway regarding the credential itself, most notably the W3C’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/">Verifiable Credential</a>&nbsp;efforts, the&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF’s SD-JWT specification</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ul.com/resources/new-isoiec-standard-electronic-credentials">ISO’s mdocs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 New Solutions 



<p>The good news is that, as one likes to see when it comes to evolving technologies, SSI is helping solve some of the challenges that traditional Federated Identity models weren’t able (or chose not to for reasons that made sense at the time) to support. I already mentioned selective disclosure. SSI models have this as a fundamental requirement of the technology, not just something that an IdP might implement on behalf of its users but rarely under the control of its users. Big privacy win here!</p>



<p>Another possibility in this brave new world is cross-device support. Rather than a password that has to be memorized and/or copied over to multiple devices (for example), a credential that lives on one mobile device can be used in an authentication or authorization process on another device, like a desktop or tablet. (I will note that this may fall under the category of “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.” There will be a LOT of different types of credentials, even identity-focused ones, available to the individual. They are not all designed with authentication in mind.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, when a credential is designed for authentication and authorization AND moves us away from relying on passwords, it is really a Very Good Thing.&nbsp;</p>



 New Problems 



<p>Sign me up! Let’s do it! Rah Rah, go, team!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or, maybe not quite yet, because new challenges must be addressed before people decide to jump on the SSI bandwagon.</p>



<p>For one thing, the UX challenges are pretty significant. The technologies under development to move ahead in an SSI model support more than just identity. They also support payment systems, transportation tickets, library cards, insurance cards, hotel keys, car keys – the list goes on. It’s one thing to compare this model as similar to having all these cards in a physical wallet, but there comes the point where there are too many cards for me to find the right one when I need it. Surely, a computer can search for the one I need, right? Right?</p>



<p>Well, not yet. This is where the privacy considerations make usability that much harder. Credentials are often stored in a digital wallet, and that wallet protects the credentials from any random request. Arguably, the wallet shouldn’t have anything to do with the credentials it holds any more than a physical wallet has anything to do with the cards it holds. Just to make sure we’re maxing out on the potential for complexity here, there may be more than one wallet holding various credentials!&nbsp;</p>



 More New Problems 



<p>Not everyone wants to live in a paternalistic nation-state that assumes people are unlikely to make good choices and protects their population by restricting various freedoms and technical innovations. That said, not everyone wants to live in a completely libertarian environment that leaves individuals responsible for their actions, whether or not the ramifications of those actions are clear. Trying to find the compromise in the middle usually involves some level of transparency and accountability so that it’s possible to verify all parties did the right thing as defined by contract or law.</p>



<p>That’s not too hard in a traditional Federated Identity system. The IdP has logs of transactions. The RP has logs, too. The only entity that (probably) doesn’t have logs is the individual (although the IdP and the RP sometimes make their logs visible to the user). With two out of three parties having info on what happened, cross-checking becomes possible if something goes to court.</p>



<p>However, In an SSI model, the entity that issues the credential knows that it issued it. When it comes to the credentials being used, however, they (in some implementations) don’t know anything – on purpose. The RP (aka, the Verifier) may only know a potentially small subset of information that doesn’t identify the individual at all. Whether the individual (or the device or application holding their credential) has a transaction log is still under debate and may be an implementation detail. Some developers may implement one (and get yelled at regarding the privacy implications), and some may not (and get yelled at for not supporting accountability and transparency).&nbsp;</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>The functionality of Federated Identity and SSI architectures is similar if you tilt your head just right. Both serve to support remote authentication and authorization. Both have one party responsible for creating the digital identity credential, another party expected to consume it, and an individual (and their devices) instigating the transaction in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technical decisions that inform the protocols and subsequent implementations, however, are where the designs quickly divide. While no one wants to support more identity systems than is necessary; the traditional Federated Identity model and the newer SSI architecture are not mutually exclusive. They just focus on solving different problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t help that SSI technologies are very young and under active debate and development. The technology you see right now is not fully baked, and it still needs to grow to solve everything technologists hope it will. Of course, you can wait for that and ask someone to let you know when it’s all resolved. Or, as always, my preferred option: you can get involved in the discussions to ensure you help guide these technologies’ development and deployment.</p>

 Although financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK’s financial services industry, when it comes to crypto, there appears to be confusion over what is and what isn’t allowed, and who the new rules actually apply to. Our Global Head of Crypto and FinTech, Jason Tucker-Feltham explains all. 



 



<p><br>Within just 24 hours of the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a> (FCA) releasing its<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-issues-146-alerts-first-24-hours-new-crypto-marketing-regime#"> financial promotions regime</a> for the crypto industry, it had issued 146 alerts of unregulated crypto firms illegally promoting crypto assets in the UK.</p>



<p>While these startling high numbers could be interpreted as a reflection of the FCA’s commitment to safeguarding consumers and fostering a responsible crypto industry amidst ongoing regulatory developments, it also showcases how unprepared the UK’s crypto industry is. Or, at the very least, how difficult the FCA registration process for crypto firms can be.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a financial promotion? 



<p>According to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/section/21">Section 21</a> of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, a financial promotion refers to “an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, communicated by a person in the course of business.”</p>



<p>In other words, financial promotions are advertisements or other promotional materials used by financial firms to market their products to consumers. Financial promotions can be disseminated via newspapers, mailings, product brochures, social media platforms (remember the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183/"> Kim Kardashian scandal for touting crypto in 2022?</a>), websites, in fact, any medium if they include an invitation or incentive targeting consumer credit activity.</p>



<p>The FCA regulates the conduct of nearly 50,000 firms to ensure the fairness, honesty, and competitiveness of the UK’s financial markets. According to the <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/">FCA Handbook</a>, all financial promotions must be clearly identifiable, accurate, balanced, and not misleading. Promotions must explicitly mention prominent risk warnings and must not contain inappropriate incentives. Since financial promotions by firms can influence a consumer’s decision when choosing a financial product or service, they must comply with specific FCA rules. Firms must also, of course, be registered with the FCA.</p>



<p>The fact that the FCA had to issue so many alerts on the first day of the new regime emphasizes its vigilant approach to crypto asset promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s not only the UK that has measures in place to protect consumers from unregulated entities. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) regulates financial promotions in the US, while in Canada, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency.html">Financial Consumer Agency of Canada</a> protects the rights of consumers of financial products and services.&nbsp;</p>



 Financial promotion punishments. 



<p>So, what punishment awaits the 146 companies that broke the rules on the very first day of the regime? Well, as per the FCA Handbook, anyone committing a financial promotion criminal offense may face up to two years of imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The FCA will assess the severity of the breach to determine the appropriate penalty level, which ranges from Level 1 to Level 5.</p>



<p>Crypto firms in the UK have been aware of the upcoming rules, and the potential repercussions of sending out financial promotions for quite a while. In 2022, there were <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/annual-reports/annual-report-2022-23.pdf">1,882 warnings issued</a>, marking a 34% increase from the previous year. As a result, 8,582 financial promotions were amended or withdrawn, which was 14x more than observed in 2021. Financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK financial services industry.</p>



 Riding the wave of crypto. 



<p>The rise of crypto and <a href="https://crypto.com/university/bull-vs-bear-market-difference">extreme market cycles</a> have resulted in many wondering if they too could benefit financially from investing in crypto assets. Recent reports suggest there are as many as <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/newsroom/press-releases/crypto-wealth-report-2023#:~:text=There%20are%2088%2C200%20crypto%20millionaires,investment%20migration%20specialists%20Henley%20%26%20Partners.">88,200 crypto millionaires</a>, including some fairytale stories of people amassing their wealth by investing very small amounts. However, the sheer number of <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/heres-how-many-crypto-coins-failed-last-year/#:~:text=How%20many%20cryptocurrencies%20have%20failed,to%20fail%20than%20new%20ones.">cryptocurrencies that have ceased to exist</a> is less highlighted, and as a result, many people’s investments have just been completely wiped out. As such, the financial promotions regulation seeks to protect the most vulnerable, especially from influential celebrity endorsements.</p>



<p>In March 2023, the SEC charged eight celebrities, with some of the most notable examples including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/22/sec-sues-celebrities-cryptocurrencies-lindsay-lohan-tron">Lindsay Lohan and Jake Paul</a>, for failing to mention that they were partaking in a paid promotion.</p>



 UK’s proposed crypto regime. 



<p>The addition of crypto to the UK’s financial promotion regime marks a step toward a full <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">crypto regulatory framework</a>. Much like its European equivalent, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> (Markets in Crypto Assets), a core aim of the UK’s proposed crypto regime will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>The UK’s proposed crypto regime is expected to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">take effect</a> in 2024, and crypto firms wishing to operate in the UK must register with the FCA and adhere to its regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government’s proposed <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">changes</a> for crypto firms include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/britain-sets-out-plans-to-regulate-crypto-industry-in-wake-of-ftx-collapse.html">Establishing</a> a world-first system for crypto lending<br>  Introducing new regulations to safeguard consumers from market manipulation<br>  Enforcing a market abuse system for cryptocurrency trading<br>  Requiring crypto exchanges to have clear and detailed requirements for admission criteria<br>  Mandating disclosures for new crypto assets<br>  Offering a 24-hour <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/letter-to-cryptoasset-firms-financial-promotions-regime.pdf">cooling-off</a> period for new investors<br>  Banning referral bonuses  



<p>The FCA will regulate crypto firms under the current <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/finalised-guidance/fg23-3.pdf">promotions</a> law, which is expected to protect consumers from misleading or inappropriate crypto <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/cryptoasset-registration-flowchart.pdf">promotions</a>. The FCA’s rules for marketing crypto assets include the following:</p>



  Advertisements must be transparent, fair, not misleading  



  Crypto asset firms must ensure consumers have the necessary understanding and expertise to invest in crypto<br>  Crypto promotions must establish clear risk warnings  



 Weighing the benefits and drawbacks of the new regulations. 



<p>These new crypto regulations will prevent users from being exposed to unregulated platforms and crypto scams like the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/09/ftx-takes-its-place-among-historys-most-infamous-financial-scandals/">FTX scandal</a>, which involved the collapse of a crypto exchange, in November 2022. The collapse was due to a liquidity crisis that revealed an US$8 billion hole in company accounts.</p>



<p>Of course, a potential drawback of the financial promotions regime is that only firms registered with the FCA or partnered with someone registered by the FCA will be able to operate in the UK, which may pose a barrier to entry for firms. This is because becoming FCA-<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/registering">registered</a> in order to comply with the financial promotions regime could prove costly, not to mention time-consuming. Registering as a crypto asset firm falls into <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/FEES/3/Annex1A.html">Category 6</a> of the FCA’s pricing categories, meaning that firms currently have to pay at least £10,000 to register. The FCA also imposes an annual fee following authorization.</p>



 Promoting crypto in the UK? 



<p>The recent publication of the UK’s revised ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets</a>’ marks a crucial advancement in the nation’s journey towards cryptocurrency regulation. The document, released by HM Treasury, outlines the present regulatory framework for crypto assets, definitions of different kinds of crypto assets, and a proposed policy approach to introducing crypto asset activities under the UK’s regulatory boundaries. As of April 2023, the FCA had registered just <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/business-plans/2023-24">41</a> crypto asset firms under its AML regime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balanced regulation that ensures consumer safety while maintaining an attractive marketplace for crypto firms is crucial, especially to fully realize the UK government’s aims to become a major crypto hub.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, they are also a requirement to be able to comply with FCA requirements. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/"> identity verification solutions</a> work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>We often think about our personal identities when we think of verifiable identifiers and verifiable credentials. We think of things like personal credentials, mobile driver’s licenses, or professional accreditations. But what about using the same tools and principles when it comes to managing the identity of an organization? How do the same tools and principles apply when managing the identity of an organization? Is it easier or more challenging to implement these concepts for organizational identities compared to personal ones? And importantly, what are the implications and impacts of effectively managing organizational identity?</p>
<p>In this podcast conversation with Lance Byrd, we delve into these questions, exploring the nuances and potential of organizational identity in the digital age.</p>
<p>Lance has been closely involved with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/">GLEIF</a>), an initiative born out of the 2008 financial crisis. GLEIF’s primary mission is to foster a transparent global system for identifying legal entities, known as the Legal Entity Identifier (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">LEI</a>). This system is crucial for enhancing transparency in organizational identities, which is essential for effective regulation and risk assessment. More recently, GLEIF has focused on expanding the LEI’s utility by transforming it into a verifiable credential, termed the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">vLEI</a>. This discussion with Lance taps into various use cases, frameworks, and insights from GLEIF, providing a deeper understanding of the complexities and significance of organisational identity.</p>
<p>In our conversation, I was particularly intrigued by Lance’s insights on the contrast between administrative and cryptographic trust. Administrative roots of trust, which are widespread in our daily lives, often lead to persistent cybersecurity challenges. Lance elaborated on how cryptographic roots of trust offer more secure and dependable methods for identity verification. We delved into real-world scenarios, including the recent MGM/Okta cyberattack, to illustrate these concepts.</p>
<p>This discussion was enlightening, and it felt like we could easily spend many more hours exploring this topic. There might be more on this in 2024! I hope you find this podcast episode as engaging and informative as I did.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Lance and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 Differences Between Personal and Organizational Identity: We explored the unique challenges and political concerns surrounding personal identity, contrasting them with the complexities yet seemingly smoother processes in organizational identity. 
 Legal and Privacy Concerns in Identity Management: The discussion highlighted how legal structures and privacy concerns shape the management of both personal and organizational identities, with a special focus on GDPR and its implications. 
 Governance and Trust in Organizational Identity: The conversation shifted to the role of governance and trust in shaping organizational identity, using examples like the EU Banking Authority to illustrate these concepts. 
 Integrity of Signatures and Cybersecurity: We discussed the critical importance of signature integrity in preventing cybersecurity attacks, examining recent incidents like the MGM Okta attack. 
 Security Mechanisms and Key Rotation: The podcast touched upon the importance of security mechanisms like key rotation in enhancing digital security, differentiating it from traditional password changes. 
 The Interplay of Security Features and User Experience: We delved into how user experience and design play a crucial role in the adoption of security technologies, balancing ease of use with robust security measures. 
 Differences in UX Between Consumer and Organizational Contexts: The discussion concluded with an examination of the varying approaches to user experience in consumer versus organizational settings, and the challenges in changing consumer behaviour regarding privacy and security.

<p>We frequently use the word “identity” when we don’t really mean it. We frame digital identity solutions around proving who you are or proving who someone is.</p>
<p>But IRL we rarely want to know who someone else really is (and from the personal perspective, we rarely want to reveal who we really are).</p>
<p>The fact is, we do not routinely ask “Who are you?” not with any seriousness anyway. “Who you are” is just vernacular, or shorthand. And it stands for something that is very different from identity.</p>
<p>In business and administration, we are always much more precise about what we really want to know about the other party.</p>
<p>Two parties always go into a transaction with a clear idea of what they need to know about each other and what they are going to have to prove about themselves.</p>
<p>These are known unknowns. In the case of business applications, the unknowns are defined when the systems are designed (typical examples are usernames, legal names, account numbers, licence numbers, government IDs and device serial numbers). And there are recognised sources or systems from which pertinent information originates, together with conventions and mechanisms for telling if the information is reliable.</p>
<p>In general, “digital identity” should not be the question. When we design a transaction system, we should start by asking What Do We Really Need To Know about each party. And the answer should include the all-important metadata that confirms the information is fit for purpose.</p>

<p>If you were present for CEO Boris Mann's presentation at the PL Summit, you heard the alpha on Everywhere Computer. Yes, that's right. After several years of being deep in the protocol mines, Fission is thrilled to launch our first product! </p>IPVM Protocol | Everywhere Computer | Homestar Mascot<p>We've shared several exciting announcements over the past few months, so let's break them down in full context now.</p><p>IPVM is the open source protocol that powers Everywhere Computer.</p><p>Homestar is the individual node that makes up the network (similar to how IPFS Kubo, Iroh, Nabu, or other implementation nodes make up the IPFS network). It's written in Rust, and is designed for performance and composability.</p><p>Everywhere Computer is Fission's platform: a branded and supported distribution that bundles Homestar + control panel, a function &amp; workflow marketplace, and managed compute resources.</p>Slide from Boris Mann's PL Summit 2023 Presentation Writing Wasm Functions  <p>Today we've got a few sample functions to test the network, with Rust → Wasm being the happy path. We'll have some tooling and examples for JavaScript → Wasm soon.</p><p>Like NPM providing a library of functions that developers use to quickly write applications, Everywhere Computer's directory will lead to re-use of serverless functions. UCAN can be used to gate access to functions, or specific communities or companies can federate their own set of functions for internal usage only, or to share with everyone.</p> Goodbye Cloud, Hello Crowd <p>As an application developer you can take advantage of Everywhere Computer's Wasm functions to replace backend functions in a serverless style. You're not locked into any one cloud provider's serverless stack, and can pick functions from the directory rather than needing to write them from scratch.</p><p>Additionally, not every job needs to go to the cloud. Many jobs can be done locally on an application's clients desktops and browsers. Every compute cycle that gets done locally is one that you don't need to pay for in the cloud.</p><p>When it's time to scale up, you can utilize Everywhere Computer's distributed network to orchestrate jobs along the parameters you've set, allowing it to utilize whichever platforms are most efficient. Everywhere Computer never locks you into any subscription. You pay when you compute, so you never worry about getting locked into one provider. </p><p>This means your job could run on your desktop, Homestar nodes in your community network, or managed compute services from Fission and other compute providers.</p> What's Coming Next - Future Plans <p>Speaking of writing functions and workflows, one of the things we'll be exploring is to fix some of the issues with directories where developers don't get directly compensated even though potentially 10s of millions of applications use their libraries. We will look to support development of high quality, performant, and maintained functions by having compute providers pay the developers who write them.</p><p>Don't have a Wasm-compatible function but still want to connect to Everywhere Computer, taking advantage of its distributed and interoperable network? If your service is <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a>-enabled, you will soon be able to plug it in, introducing new functionality to the entire network. As has always been the plan, UCAN's capabilities model provides a flexible IAM-like backbone that can connect the open web, rather than locked to one cloud provider.</p> <p>We are so excited to share <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> with you. If you'd like to join the early access beta, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfREjmoTBOW2gyUSFypn3omifibvptH0K_IQwtFWiGORU5vAQ/viewform">complete this form</a>. We're looking for enthusiast hackers &amp; node hosts, function writers, and compute providers.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about the underlying IPVM protocol, you can join the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM Working Group</a>.</p>

 <p>Een consument doet op de website een aanvraag voor een lening, en krijgt direct uitsluitsel of de aanvraag geaccepteerd wordt of (nog) niet. Oftewel; volledig STP (Straight Through Processing) accepteren, het kan!</p> 
 <p>Dat was de afdronk van de rondetafel die we organiseerden in samenwerking met iLoan. Het onderwerp: "STP Acceptatie: Hoe bereik je dit in overeenstemming met de regels".</p> 
 <p>In de consumptief krediet sector worden daar snel grote stappen gezet. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van het Keurmerk Private Lease en de VFN gedragscode.</p> 
 <p>Tijdens de rondetafel deelden we met 20+ experts van de grootste consumptief krediet- en private lease-organisaties in Nederland tips, ervaringen en inzichten die we samen met <a href="https://www.iloan.nl/">iLoan</a> en klanten zoals <a href="https://ockto.eu/kennisbank/praktijkcase-toyota-louwman-financial-services">Toyota Louwman Financial Services</a> hebben opgedaan.</p> 
  10 inzichten over STP accepteren  
 <br> 
   
   Volledig STP werken is mogelijk - voor zowel private lease als huurkoop/consumptief krediet.<br><br>  
   100% STP betekent ruim 300 businessrules die akkoord zijn; op basis van Keurmerk Private Lease of de VFN leennormen.<br><br>  
   Een lager percentage STP betekent nog steeds veel efficiency omdat de Loan Officer/Acceptant nog maar op enkel van de ruim 300 checks een oordeel hoeft te geven (in plaats van op allemaal).  
   De normen geven nog een behoorlijke interpretatieruimte; enerzijds een kans, anderzijds ook onderwerp van in- en externe discussie.<br><br>  
   Zorg dat je 'audit trail' op orde is: doe A/B-testing met een x-aantal dossiers waarbij je de consument eerst accepteert op basis van documenten, en vervolgens met (enkel) brondata &amp; banktransacties.<br><br>  
   Gebruik die testen om business rules te finetunen, om interne goedkeuring te krijgen én een goedkeurend knikje van de toezichthouder.<br><br>  
   Volume en continue verbeteren is key: dit spel krijg je niet op orde met tientallen dossiers. Er moet veel volume/data door het proces omdat je dan onderscheid zult zien in de verscheidene 'persona's': een groep die makkelijk als STP is te definiëren, kansrijke 'oranje' aanvragen en de 'hard-rode' gevallen. Met continu verbeteren stel je doorlopend de engine bij, en zorg je ook voor draagvalk bij de loan officers/acceptanten.<br><br>  
   De loan officers/acceptanten zijn wellicht wel de belangrijkste stakeholders: zij moeten vertrouwen krijgen in het digitale proces en ook vertrouwen dat (bijvoorbeeld) 296 businessrules al automatisch gecontroleerd zijn en zij enkel de nog resterende 4 oranje velden checken. Bezuinigen op FTE kan een doel zijn, maar veel partijen focussen juist op STP van de massa om de loan officers/acceptanten vooral in te zetten op enkel de oranje posten én om meer volume aan te kunnen zonder afhankelijkheid van meer handen.<br><br>  
   Er is sterke behoefte aan een ketenoplossing zoals bijvoorbeeld gebruikt wordt in de hypotheeksector (<a href="https://ockto.eu/ockto-brondata-service">Ockto Brondata Service</a>): adviseur/dealer laat een Ockto sessie doen, Ockto slaat deze max. 90 dagen op, kredietverstrekker krijgt sleutel mee bij de aanvraag en kan met eigen datafilter toegang krijgen tot de initiële brondataset van de betreffende consument. <br>Er zijn ontwikkelingen op dit gebied met diverse partijen.<br><br>  
   En last but not least: er blijkt veel behoefte te zijn om periodiek gezamenlijk te sparren over dit onderwerp. Als ketenpartners gezamenlijk tot oplossingen komen op gedeelde uitdagingen, dan is dat winst voor iedereen én hoeft het concurrentieel voor- en nadeel daar niet meer over te gaan. Plus kunnen er in de normenkaders ook sneller verbeteringen worden doorgevoerd.

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees to your IT systems is like an intricate dance — it can either be a graceful waltz or an out-of-sync electric slide. In this post, we’ll talk about four potential trip-ups when thinking about employee access management. We’ll also show you practical steps you can take today to streamline onboarding and offboarding. Let’s take it for a spin!&nbsp;</p>
 Using a tool that’s too big (or too small) 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Imagine trying to dance the tango in tap shoes or attempting a waltz in hiking boots. Similarly, using tools that are either too complex or too basic can throw off the entire rhythm of your onboarding and offboarding dance.</p>
<p>With advanced providers like Okta, for example, you have to configure SAML, SCIM, and JIT to authenticate and manage users. This is known as <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">the SSO tax</a> and can mean a lot of work on technology that you might not really need yet. On the other hand, people who try to manage the process with Jira tickets or Notion/Docs, often forget to track and update things.</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Find a tool that’s your perfect dance partner — one that adapts to your rhythm by helping you accomplish what you need to get done today and grows with you. Instead of taking an over-comprehensive approach to SSO that may overwhelm customers and inflate costs, focus on the tasks you face today — the stuff you just need to work and to be secure. And with the right tool, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>, which will help you scale as your business expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. It’s also free for now (<a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">find out why</a>).</p>
 Trying to do it all yourself 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Picture a solo dancer trying to cover the entire stage – it might look impressive, but the risk of exhaustion and missteps is high. If you’re the Google Admin for your small startup or company, odds are you’re an overachiever, but stretching yourself too thin can have negative effects on your work and your health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Enter your dance ensemble – your application administrators. Delegating tasks during the onboarding and offboarding performance lightens the load and ensures a smoother routine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Onboard, you can assign an admin to each app your company uses, then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper admins. We also help you empower employees to initiate requests for new application access, which can also be routed to the proper application administrator.</p>
<p>In this way, automation becomes your dance partner, stepping in to handle repetitive tasks while you take center stage. Things like customizable templates, task assignments, and email notification not only help you save time but also minimize the chances of errors.&nbsp;</p>
 Putting off best practices until “later”&nbsp; 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Delaying the incorporation of best practices is akin to attempting a complicated dance routine without rehearsal – it leads to chaos and missteps. Maybe it’s too expensive to manage right now — time or budget wise — but what you end up with is a messy company footprint and opening yourself to security risks.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/right-sized-onboarding-and-offboarding-free-for-the-first-100-signups/">Onboarding and offboarding tools have overlooked the middle of the marke</a>t. There are plenty of smaller businesses that want to easily manage their processes now while setting up good practices for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>We created YeshID Onboard because we saw that gap. Specifically for 50-250 people, Onboard provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 Only focusing on onboarding, not offboarding 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. And focusing solely on onboarding is like nailing the first half of a dance and forgetting the finale. Onboarding is about efficiency, but offboarding is both a security and compliance requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. This is another area where your Product Administrators can play back-up dancers, ensuring a seamless transition.&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s dance 
<p>In the dance of onboarding and offboarding, perfecting each step is essential for a harmonious performance. Choose tools that dance to your rhythm, build a team of Product Administrators as your dance ensemble, kick off best practices from the first note, and never forget the importance of the grand finale – offboarding.&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: On this episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity we are joined by Gautam Hazari, from Sekura.ID as we discuss what is the missing Identity layer of the Internet. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hello and thank you for joining us, a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Today’s guest is Gautam Hazari. He is a mobile identity guru, a technology enthusiast, artificial intelligence expert and futurist. And he is the CTO of Sekura.id, the global leader in mobile identity services. Gautam led the implementation of the mobile identity initiative Mobile Connect for around 60 mobile operators across 30 countries. He has also been an advisor to startups in Digital Identity, healthcare, the Internet of Things and fraud and security management. Hello, Gautam.</p>
<p>Gautam Hazari: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good, happy to have you here in the show.</p>
<p>Gautam: My pleasure. Thanks.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s going to be super interesting. Now, we are focusing on mobile – mobile initiatives, like the one you are working with, can help us to solve the identity problems we usually discuss in this show.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself. So, if you can tell us your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. Thanks, Oscar. I have been in the identity space for quite some time now. And it started in the telecom world and that’s why I talk about mobile identity a lot. So I spent many years of my life in the telecom, so I worked with the Vodafone group for nearly 14, 15 years. What I realised is that there is one thing that the mobile operators have done quite efficiently is solving what I call the identity crisis of the internet. I started to talk about it quite passionately in different forms.</p>
<p>And in 2013, end of 2013, GSMA approached me. GSMA as you know is the GSM Association which is the trade organisation for the mobile operators. So the GSMA board was discussing that there were some assets within the mobile operators which can actually help in solving the identity crisis in the internet. Then they approached me that, “Hey, you were talking about this identity thing for quite some time, do you want to come and join?” And that’s when I joined GSMA to do the initiative for mobile operators to solve the identity crisis of the internet.</p>
<p>Then I led the technology for what was known and still known as Mobile Connect Initiative. I was the Chief Architect for Mobile Connect. And then me and my team created the reference architecture, the specification. And then of course, that’s not enough, so I went around the world, worked with the mobile operators to implement it as well. You know, at that time, there were around 62 mobile operators around the world who implemented it. And they did very passionately and this is where I met some of the founders, Mark and Keiron, in GSMA, working with the same team. And then I’m taking that journey forward in a much more accelerated and commercial way in Sekura.id.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Well, definitely a lot of your journey is in identity already and mostly in mobile, as you said. Before we start going to what you are doing in Sekura.id and we definitely want to hear more about that. I know that you have a special experience which is you have even a TEDx talk. So if you can tell us a bit of that experience.</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah. Thanks, Oscar. It has been a fascinating experience actually, while preparing for the TEDx talk and also after that. So I was invited to do this TEDx talk to share my vision and dream of a world without passwords. I have been talking about these things passionately and that’s kind of my personal journey has been as well.</p>
<p>So, I had a lot of learning, you have to compact all that you want to talk within 18 minutes and that’s very interesting, right? If you have a free floating, I mean I’m really, really passionate about this identity thing, I can keep talking for days. But if you need to give your message within 18 minutes that’s quite interesting. So I learned how to deliver the message in that concise way.</p>
<p>And after delivering that, and once the TED organisation published the video in their YouTube. Interestingly, they didn’t actually remove any part of that, generally they do some editing but they didn’t do that for me. I’m really thankful to TED on that. So it happened end of last year. It’s been just one year completed and it has been viewed more than 157,000 times. And I have been receiving some very, very interesting messages from all around the world. From identity enthusiasts to security specialist, and also, from general public as well, saying that awareness is important. And we are having some inertia, right? We have been using passwords since, you know, 1961 actually, even before the internet was invented in 1989. But we don’t actually think that we are actually using it, and the complication that it brings too. I have been fortunate enough to hear lots of personal stories as well. These viewers, they have been sharing their personal stories related to passwords, and discussing what is the solution that can actually solve this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it has been a fascinating experience and I’m really, really thankful for all the viewers who have been watching it and also most importantly, interacting with it and sharing their stories.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Yeah, I also watched and as you said, the way you explained also definitely appeals to the general audience which is of course what mostly TEDx is about, reaching wider audiences. So it’s definitely a good job you have done there. And I am happy to hear also that there have been a lot of conversation because that’s also important that people not only hear the stories or the ideas but also get involved in, spreading those problems, sharing their own pains, et cetera.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: I also know that you have written, of course, you write blogs, particularly, I read the you talk about the missing identity layer of the internet, missing identity layer of the internet. Could you tell us what is that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. I mean it’s extremely important that we acknowledge and realise that. Let me go back to when the internet was invented, right? Let’s face it, the internet was never designed to identify the human users. It was designed to identify the computers, right? That’s why there are IP addresses. Fortunately, or unfortunately, we humans don’t have IP addresses.</p>
<p>So, in the initial days of the internet, if you remember, all we used to do in the internet was browsing, right? We used to browse AOL, we used to browse Yahoo, different stories within Yahoo. So, it did not matter if for me, Gautam, is browsing AOL or Yahoo, or it’s Oscar browsing, or there’s fraudster who is browsing, right?&nbsp; Because all we did was browsing the internet. Yes, the returning user needed to be identified, not as Oscar or Gautam but whoever was browsing, right? So that’s why cookies were invented just to provide a continuity of the experience, right?</p>
<p>But then we started to do interesting things on the internet. We started to do commerce on the internet. We started to look for things on eBay and started to pay for those things. We started to do banking on the internet. We started to interact in the social media in the internet. And then it did matter whether it’s me, Gautam, doing that commerce transaction, whether it’s me, Gautam, who is doing that banking transaction or it’s you, Oscar, or it’s the fraudster. Or, in the current days, if it is that AI chatbot who is doing that transaction, right?</p>
<p>Internet was not designed to do that. Internet did not have that identity layer. So what did we do? We created a trustless model. So, if I want to pay for some things that I found on eBay, or if I want to do a banking transaction, my bank will say, “Hey, you cannot do that, because I don’t trust you. First, I’m challenging you to prove that you are Gautam.” That’s what we created, because the internet didn’t have that identity layer.</p>
<p>So how did that challenge happen? And they initially did this, this challenge happened in the form of user ID and password, right? And again, we all aware of all the complications related to password from convenience to security, right? Then we said, “Hey, passwords are not enough. Let’s add other things.” So, we started to talk about MFA, Multi-factor authentication, we added SMS OTP, right? And again, OTP, the last P is about password, right? Just changing the acronym doesn’t change the problem.</p>
<p>But then again, they said, “OK, maybe that’s not enough. Let’s add the biometrics on top.” But again conceptually what we are doing is, we are creating a trustless model where these services are challenging me and the human user to identify myself, right? And whenever the human user is involving in providing a response to the challenge, for example in form of I need to type back the password, or I need to provide back the OTP, however I give, whether by typing back the OTP or some auto read happens. Or even if I do this, let’s say, biometrics in the form of facial recognition and so on, I, as a user, is the weakest link in the chain. I do something wrong, which is perfectly fine because me, as a user, is not a security architect. As a normal user, I am not aware of all those security complications that can go away, right? And that’s where all the problems that you have seen and again, why? Because the internet was not designed to identify this human user. Internet never have the identity layer. It still doesn’t have.</p>
<p>But we almost ignored the fact that almost at a similar time, there was a parallel internet that was getting created. So, as you know, I’m actually using the world wide web as synonym to internet, so when I say internet, it’s actually the world wide web, right? So, 1989, this wed, world wide web or internet as we call it was invented. In 1991, there was a parallel internet that was created. And we never call it the internet, we call it the mobile network, right? The first SIM-based GSM mobile network was used in 1991. And that parallel internet worked completely differently.</p>
<p>So, as we discussed, in the traditional internet, if I want to do any interaction, where I, as a human user, needs to be identified, I’ll be challenged, right? My bank will challenge me, my social media will challenge me, my e-commerce provider will challenge me, even my grocery store, online store will challenge me, right? But this parallel internet, which we call mobile network, worked completely differently, still works differently.</p>
<p>If I need to make a phone call, receive a phone call, send an SMS, receive an SMS, it doesn’t challenge me. My mobile network doesn’t say that “Hey, I don’t trust you. First, you prove that you are Gautam, then only you can make a phone call.” It doesn’t work that way. It just knows that it’s me, who is Gautam. So how did they do that? They actually created this identity layer. They actually created a mechanism which identifies this human user from day one, since 1991.</p>
<p>But we know this. How did they do that? They did that using this small gadget that we always carry in our mobile phone, this is the SIM. We almost forget that I, in the SIM, stands for identity. It’s Subscriber Identity Module. SIM was created to solve this identity problem in that parallel internet, which we call the mobile network, right?</p>
<p>So, isn’t that a solution? We were just ignoring it and also, just unfortunately, these mobile operators knowingly or unknowingly, kept this with themselves, right? What we are doing at Sekura.id, I’ll just mention here, that we are bringing in that identity layer from this parallel internet which we call the mobile network into this traditional internet so that we actually solve the fundamental problem rather than keep creating technologies on top like password, like SMS OTPs, like biometrics. And that is what will solve the problem from its root and bringing in an identity layer from this parallel internet to the traditional internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you for the explanation, of the lacking, missing identity layer of the internet. And then you put a parallel, I haven’t thought of it in that way, the parallel of the mobile network which always had this identifier of the subscriber. As you say, even in the term it’s subscribe, the SIM card. So, I understand that Sekura.id solution is primarily based on the SIM card. Tell us a bit more how it works and if you can give also how it works, Sekura.id besides being based on the SIM card.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. So, GSMA doing this Mobile Connect, the conceptual idea was very similar, right? It’s to utilise the assets from the mobile operators, not just the SIM card. SIM card is a cryptographic engine. But there’s a lot of data available with the mobile operators which can help to identify the human user without challenging them. &nbsp;And also, protect them without putting a hurdle for the user, like what user ID, password, OTPs or biometrics are. They are hurdles, right? They are actually saying, “Hey, you cannot access the service until you pass that hurdle.”</p>
<p>This is where Mobile Connect started and this is the journey that we are continuing in Sekular.id as well. So, in Sekular.id, what we do is, as I say, the SIM is a cryptographic engine. And now, in the digital world, there is realisation that all the different, let’s say, identification and authentication methods where the user is actively involved, which means the user is challenged to prove who they are, or authenticate themselves, that is a limitation. A limitation in the form of that you know, if let’s say the user has got an OTP they have received, these fraudsters will always call this user and say, “Hey, I’m calling from your bank, or I’m calling from the government, you have received an OTP, can you hand it over, right?” If the user is not involved, right, these fraudsters can call the user but they have nothing to handover. So in that case, we solved this problem of all the fraudulent activities that’s going on.</p>
<p>So now, there is a realisation in the digital world as I was seeing that we need to avoid involving the user. So we need to do passive authentication. And how do we do that? Cryptographic authentication is one way to do. So, Apple last year in WWDC announced these passkeys which is basically based on the FIDO, the Fast Identity Online mechanism, where this is reliance on cryptography and cryptographic key on the device. And then that’s how we identify the user, right?</p>
<p>But exactly same mechanism is what happens in the SIM. And it is happening for the last 30 years. There is a cryptographic key which sits in the SIM which the user is not even aware of. And that’s an important thing. The user is not aware. As soon as the user is aware, or the user is involved in that awareness, OK, all these problems will happen because these fraudsters will approach the user and try to do some funny things, right?</p>
<p>And that’s another aspect that we say that here, this cryptography is humanised. If the user is not involved, it just happens behind the scene. In that case, this technology is humanised. Invisibility is more humanised. Steve Jobs used to say that technology should either be beautiful or it should be invisible. So here, this technology is invisible so that makes it much more humanised, right?</p>
<p>So, at Sekura, we’re utilising this cryptography in the SIM to seamlessly, invisibly authenticate this user. At the same time, there are a lot of what we call signals associated with the SIM which can help protect the user, at the same time, identify the user. For example, one of the largest fraud happening in the digital space right now is SIM swap fraud, right?</p>
<p>If we can identify that hey, is there a recent SIM swap happen? By recent, I mean in the last few hours, for example, to one day. If there is a SIM swap happen, in that case, that’s a red flag, that might mean that the user who is in the transaction process, who is interacting with the digital service may not be the genuine user, it could be a fraudster who have got access to the phone number of the user and using their own SIM. That’s one data signal that’s there in the mobile, with the mobile operator, that doesn’t need to involve the user to ask if something has happened or not.</p>
<p>Similarly, setting up a call redirect, right? The fraudsters can actually setup a call redirect for my number calling up the operator, doing some mechanism, some process there where they can say, “Hey, I have lost my phone, or I left my phone at my home and I’m expecting an urgent call from my family who is in the hospital. Can you please redirect all the calls to my number to this?” If I can convince the operator, in that case what will happen is, all calls, SMSs will be redirected or forwarded to me as a fraudster, right? So, if we can actually identify, is their call forward active for this number? That data itself can protect the user, again, without involving the user. So, we have identified 66 such potential data signals which can invisibly protect the user and their identity. And that’s what we do at Sekura, working primarily with the mobile operators.</p>
<p>Oscar: I like the idea of this invisibility because from the beginning you started that the human side is going to make security fail, right? But if the human doesn’t have to be involved, yeah, I’m sure, there will be less hacking. So that is definitely the concept, it’s very interesting.</p>
<p>Gautam: And just to add there, Oscar, you know, of course, there is this identity protection, there is this authentication without involving the user. That element is there. At the same time, it is allowing these good guys to access the service, right? So, as I was giving that example, it’s me, right? I’m not the fraudster. It’s me who wants to pay a particular merchant online, right? And I’m assuming I’m the good guy, right? And I want to pay. In that case, there shouldn’t be a barrier for me, right? And it’s good for the business because the business will get me to pay them. That’s what they want, right? So, in that case, it’s important that the good guys should sail through, right? For them, there is no barrier.</p>
<p>If we make it invisible for the user, in that case, these good guys can actually access, you know, without any trouble. At the same time, because it’s invisible, we can actually protect this user behind the scene as well. What does that mean is – it’s not just helping out with the identity verification, security and authentication, it’s also getting better business. Because if we put barrier to the good customers, good users, in that case, there are dropouts happen.</p>
<p>We have been told by our clients all around the world that on an average globally 20% of the users dropout due to all these, let’s say, challenges. They say, “Hey, I’m not going to use it.” SMS OTP is needed to do our transaction or to pay and OTP doesn’t get delivered or it is delayed, the user say, “Hey, I’m not going to pay now, right?” So that will direct 20% on an average globally, dropouts happen.</p>
<p>Here, if you make it invisible, you don’t have any dropouts, right? Because there are no barriers. There is no door which is closed that needs to be opened. So, in that case, the businesses get 20% more conversion, so that’s more business, more revenue. So that element is also there, if you make is invisible using the mobile operator’s asset like the SIM and all the data. That needs to be considered as well alongside security.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what if, myself as a normal user, I want to try Sekura.id, how can I use it already? There might be some services which is already available?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. So one element here is you know as you can understand, this is B2B service, right? So the businesses are using us. Businesses are protecting that. All our services are, you know, they go through one single API, right? So, it’s not the user who is accessing our services directly. As I was giving the example, I, as a user, accessing my banking service, right? And my banking service is using the Sekura.id services through the API, right? So that’s how I, as a user, as a consumer use it. Not directly through Sekura, through my services. And then again, I may not be even aware that that service is getting used, right? Because this service, as I said, for the human user it’s invisible.</p>
<p>So majority of our clients right now are mostly from the financial services, so the major banks in the UK, they are using our one or more of the services like Barclays is using our services, Virgin Money is using our services. In the US as well, Morgan Stanley, they are using our services, Flora Bank, they are using our services.</p>
<p>But again, just to reiterate, it’s not a B2C service, right? So it’s not that me, as a consumer, is using the Sekular.id services. It’s my business who is using the service to help me as a user getting protected. And at the same time, no buyer has been put by the businesses to access it. And we are actually expanding globally. As I mentioned to you earlier, I was in India, I came back yesterday, we are actually launching in there. We have some very, very exciting discussions happened across the use cases there, not just in the financial sector, beyond as well. And then we will be announcing those pretty soon.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK,as soon as they are launched, it will be interesting to know what are these use cases. So, very interesting initiative that you have in Sekura.id. So what happens for instance if – because this depends on people having good mobile networks and good phones, so what happens if that’s not available in some regions in the world?</p>
<p>Gautam: That’s a very important question you ask, right? And there are two elements you said, one is good mobile phone. One of the thing that we really passionately believe in Sekura is inclusiveness. And that’s very important for us. We have a mission statement for identity for all and everything. So no one should be excluded from identity protection, right? And this is why we tackle it from multiple angles.</p>
<p>So for example, we have platform that we have created from ground up based on all our learning from the GSMA and also my learning from Vodafone. That platform can integrate with any mobile operator in the world, right? Because all mobile operators are different. There are 700 plus mobile operators there. Right now, we are connected to around 75 mobile operators globally and we want to connect to all. Why? Because we don’t want any operators to be excluded because if we exclude that, their consumers or their users will be excluded.</p>
<p>So, one example is in India, one of the phone smallest operator is BSNL, right? It’s government-owned operator. They are quite small. They don’t have platform. And they were actually not included in this identity space. So what we have done is we have provided our platform to them so that, that platform can actually connect to that mobile operator and then it can actually expose their services, right? So that we don’t want to exclude their users.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important, as you rightly asked. What happens if I don’t have a good phone? So, this is where the principle that we use in all our services has got two major aspects. One, I already talked about – not involving the user because if you don’t involve the user, we increase the security, because user is the weakest link, right? And rightly so. And the second thing is not depending on the mobile device, because that’s extremely critical. Because let’s say, if the user can afford an iPhone 15 right? Of course, that’s extremely secure. The key chain there where the keys are stored is a hardware, right? That’s an HSN. So, it will be extremely secure.</p>
<p>But what about the user in let’s say Southeast Asia or in Sub-Saharan Africa where it’s a sub $10 phone? That may not have that much security. So, it’s unfair on the user because they cannot be pay for that advanced phone, they are getting excluded from security and identity verification. At the same time, it is unfair on the businesses, they cannot rely on a security because the user cannot afford that high end phone.</p>
<p>That’s why that’s the principle we use. We don’t rely on the mobile device. What do we rely on? The SIM. The exact same SIM is in the iPhone 15 or any of the high-end devices or in the low-end, not so expensive phone and provides the exact same security, right? The cryptographic security that I talked about doesn’t differentiate whether it’s a very high-end, expensive phone or not so expensive, much simpler phone. So that’s an important element here, right? So, our services don’t rely on the device. It doesn’t matter what device the user is using.</p>
<p>Secondly, all the data elements that I talked about is in the mobile network. This is completely independent of what device it is. So that way as well, all those data elements that I talked about, all those 66 potential data elements are independent of the device. So, that’s how we use the service and then make it inclusive end to end, for any user, right?</p>
<p>The other thing you asked about is what if there is no mobile network? It doesn’t really matter. So, the way to look into this thing is, we are relying on the mobile network. But the user doesn’t have to use the mobile device even at that moment of time for majority of the services. For the authentication services, the mobile device need to be in the network. But again, if the mobile device is not in the mobile network, it is connected to Wi-Fi or any other networks, in that case, we have fall back mechanism because we cannot really, rely on the mobile network because the device is connected to Wi-Fi, still we have a fallback mechanism.</p>
<p>And in some regions, like in US, we have worked with one of the large mobile operator there. Where we have worked with them to utilise the SIM, even if the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Because even if the mobile device is not connected to the mobile network, still there is a SIM there, right? If you can reach out to the SIM, we protect the device anyway.</p>
<p>And the other thing I was talking about, all these 66 potential data signals, they are available at the mobile operator’s secure CRMs, CVM and all the OSS, BSS system, right? So they don’t need the user to be using the mobile device at that moment of time. For example, if there is a SIM swap that has happened in the last few hours, the mobile operators databases, they already are aware of that even if there is no network. So, all our services other than the authentication service which we call SAFr Auth, all our services are data-related or signal-related services where these businesses, let’s say, this is a bank or an e-commerce provider or even a social media provider, their server makes the API call to our platform to get this data signal. So the mobile device is not involved, mobile network is not also involved there. Because again, we want that inclusivity for every user to be involved in there.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Well, definitely very novel way of addressing these problems. So I’d like to ask you one final question, Gautam, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot Oscar for asking that. The most important thing to add into their agenda is an acknowledgement that the internet doesn’t have that identity layer. Because that’s a fundamental problem. Because if we start to add technologies on top to fill the gap, that will not solve the problem. And we have seen over the years, right? We have seen user ID password, they didn’t solve that, SMS OTP or any form of OTP, they didn’t solve that. Then we added all sorts of other OTPs, right? TOTPs, authenticated apps, we even used those RSA tokens that we used to carry on. Then we evolved into biometrics. And by the way, biometrics, I’m sure your audience is aware of this, after Generative AI, every form of biometrics is challenged.</p>
<p>And then actually, you know, interestingly, LexisNexis, which is one of the largest fraud management provider on app based in US, their CEO of the government affairs came to the press. This person gave an interview to Fox News in June, saying that we are so much relying on these biometrics and after Generative AI revolution, there is a financial impact in the industry and then that impact is around 1 Trillion USD because every form of biometric is challenged through this Generative AI. Not just through deep fake, through all sorts of mechanism. I mean you can actually search the internet on those kind of fraudulent activities happening on almost a weekly basis.</p>
<p>So, let’s acknowledge that there is a fundamental issue with the internet and that’s no one’s fault because internet was not designed for that. If you acknowledge that, then we can solve the fundamental problem, right? And that can be done through the already existing identity layer which is existing in the mobile operators. Let’s work through that and solve the problem forever.</p>
<p>So, basically, what I am saying is, let’s bring in that identity layer from that parallel internet which we call mobile internet into the traditional internet. And let’s solve that problem at the root. And that’s what we are doing in Sekura.id. And that’s what we would invite all the leaders in the digital space to look into and solve the problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you very much, Gautam, for this very insightful conversation. And let us know if people would like to find more about you on the net, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot, Oscar. Thanks for inviting me. I am on LinkedIn. Please connect to me. It’s Gautam Hazari, G-A-U-T-A-M H-A-Z-A-R-I. If you Google me, you will find me there as well. And also, please visit Sekura.id, S-E-K-U-R-A.ID. You will find insightful solutions there and also we post lots of insightful stories, articles, blogs and what the future is looking like. Recently, one of my article is published in Forbes, I’m calling it Internet of Thoughts, where the future is coming and where, if you don’t solve this identity crisis in the internet it may create more issues. So, please reach out. Please look into Sekura.id and let’s solve this identity crisis together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, of course. Again, thank you very much Gautam for this conversation, and all the best.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thank you very much Oscar for having me.</p>

  One year ago, the first post on Bluesky was created. Now, we're working toward federation and a truly open network.

<p>Exactly one year ago, on November 16, 2022, the first post on Bluesky was created:</p>

The first post on Bluesky.
<p>Fast forward a year later, and we’ve just crossed two million users after opening the app to users around February. We’re excited to continue growing a truly open social network.</p>
 Toward Federation 
<p>Imagine you’ve just spent 10 years building your audience and making friends on a social platform, only to decide that it’s no longer for you. When you leave this platform, you’re essentially leaving behind all of your relationships, your saved posts, and more.</p>
<p>We’ve been there too, and we’re similarly tired of packing our bags each time another platform winds down and everyone collectively moves to the next big thing. Signing up for a new social network every few years and losing all our data on former ones shouldn’t be the price that we have to pay in order to keep our relationships online.</p>
<p>That’s why our biggest priority right now is launching federation, which is <a href="https://atproto.com/blog/2023-protocol-roadmap">timelined</a> for early next year. This is one of the core features of Bluesky that makes it “billionaire-proof” — you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too.</p>
 A Public Network 

<p>More exciting news: around the end of this month, we’ll release a public web interface. With this, you’ll be able to view posts on Bluesky without being logged in on an account.</p>
<p>This will make posts on Bluesky much more accessible, which will be especially useful for real-time commentary and breaking news.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Bluesky is a public social network, so your posts, likes, etc. have always been publicly accessible through the API. We designed Bluesky with the openness of the internet in mind, and you can think of your profile as a blog on the internet. To read more about data privacy on Bluesky, here’s our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/5-19-2023-user-faq">user FAQ</a>.</p>
 Other Updates 
<p>In between all of the above, we’ve also shipped some much-requested features, including:</p>
 
 Mobile push notifications: receive notifications on your phone 
 General user lists: add users to shareable lists and see their posts in one feed 
 Email verification: verify your account email for added security 
 Advanced feed and thread preferences: sort replies by time, likes, or randomly; see replies from your follows first; show/hide replies or quote posts in your feeds, and more 
 Media tab for user profiles: easily find and see the photos that a user has posted 
 A Likes tab on your own profile: see all your liked posts in one place 
 Improved startup and loading time: reduces the time spent loading the app 
 Suggested follows: get recommended follows based on each user 
 Accessibility improvements: improvements to alt text, component labels, screen flashing, and more 
 
<p>And there’s much more to come — join us for the ride! See you on <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>!</p>

  <p>Most contemporary digital identity discussions deserve another label: They are mostly about electronic trust ecosystems, considering all kinds of attributes beyond just pure identity. Additionally, nowadays they include natural persons, legal entities and (internet of) things. Everyone seems to agree the future is decentralized and all this only works with these curious wallets. Andre Kudra takes us on a journey through electronic trust ecosystems, diving into questions like: Which ones do we already have today? Some are successful, others not – why? Regulators are on it, too: What will eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDIW bring? What’s in the pipeline in other parts of the world? Will organizational digital identity (ODI) now invoke the breakthrough of decentralized identity overall? Why is decentralized identity the only way for Zero Trust Architectures which deserve the name?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/electronic-trust-ecosystems-cre23"></a>

  <p>The realm of cloud security has been extensively covered in books and articles, yet a crucial aspect remains ripe for exploration. It revolves around the fundamental understanding of what your cloud service provider offers and, equally vital, where your responsibilities lie in the realm of cloud security.</p>
<p><br> When embarking on the journey of adopting a cloud service, the foremost question to answer is, "What aspects of security do I need to oversee?" In a traditional on-premises setting, roles are distinct: IT manages infrastructure, information and cybersecurity handles security, and application developers bear the responsibility for code integrity. However, the landscape is evolving, with many organizations embracing DevOps, where these responsibilities are often shared, and the lines between development and operations blur or vanish.</p>
<p>Regardless of organizational structure, the majority of security obligations reside within your company's domain when you use an on-prem environment. Transitioning from an on-premises environment to a cloud environment presents one of the most intricate challenges—a more intricate shared responsibility model for security.</p>
<p>In the context of cloud security, two paramount concerns need close attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is the risk of misconfiguration. In a cloud environment, misconfigurations can inadvertently expose sensitive data and vulnerabilities, underscoring the critical importance of ensuring that cloud services and resources are set up correctly to mitigate such risks.</p>
<p>The second concern is insider attacks. Cloud users often lack influence over the staff of cloud service providers, making it essential to consider the possibility of insider threats. While cloud service providers typically promise robust security measures in place, it's crucial for organizations to implement their own layers of security to safeguard against insider attacks and unauthorized access, fortifying the shared responsibility model in the cloud.</p>
<p>In my presentation, I will delve into these intricacies, providing valuable insights and real-world examples of what your cloud service provider can do, irrespective of your specific needs and/or preferences.</p>

  <p>Fraud is a major cost to businesses worldwide. Banking, finance, payment services, and retail are some of the most frequent targets of fraudsters. However, insurance, gaming, telecommunications, health care, cryptocurrency exchanges, government assistance agencies, travel and hospitality, and real estate are increasingly targeted as cybercriminals have realized that most online services trade in monetary equivalents. After years of being the focus of cybercriminals, banking and financial institutions are more likely to be better secured than other industries, meaning that fraudsters are increasingly likely to attack any potentially lucrative target if given the opportunity. Fraud perpetrators are continually diversifying and innovating their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).</p>
<p>The most prevalent types of fraud businesses, non-profit organizations, and government agencies experience today are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Takeover (ATO) Fraud - occurs when fraudsters use breached passwords, phishing, social engineering and credential stuffing attacks to execute unauthorized transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Opening (AO) Fraud – also called New Account Fraud or Synthetic Fraud, often happens as a result of using stolen identities or assemblages of personal information to create synthetic digital IDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session we will provide an overview of Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms and show the highlights of our latest research in this area.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/technology-powers-fraud-prevention-cre23"></a>

  <p>The 2023 Cybersecurity Workforce Study identifies a daunting 4 million-person workforce gap. This shortfall in qualified candidates hampers industry growth. To tackle this challenge, the industry must broaden its recruitment scope, targeting individuals with potential to learn, including those from diverse backgrounds like business, arts, or engineering. Cultivating entry-level opportunities for students, young professionals, and career changers is vital for industry expansion. However, assessing cybersecurity aptitude in candidates without direct experience poses a challenge. Traditionally, the industry has lacked accessible entry points for newcomers. In this presentation, ISC2's CEO, Clar Rosso, advocates for a clear and adaptable pathway to cybersecurity careers, offering data-driven insights and strategies to ignite recruitment efforts and welcome new talent into the field.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/global-cybersecurity-workforce-gap-cre23"></a>

Times of e.g. required proof of personhood, predicted behavioural biometrics, and advanced data brokerage.<br> <br> How are social engineering tools, tactics, and procedures evolving? What can we expect? And how can we prepare?<br> <br> In this presentation, Emilie van der Lande, certified information privacy professional (CIPP/E) and certified by MIT in Artificial Intelligence’s implications on business and strategy, will explore prevention and detection tips to be a step ahead of the shifting paradigms of Cyber Deceptology.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-rodeo-cre23"></a>

  <p>Paul Fisher delves into the multifaceted approach required to foster trustworthiness within complex software supply chains. This discussion begins by delineating the critical components of software supply chains and the potential risks associated with each link—from development and deployment to maintenance and decommissioning.</p>
<p>Key to establishing a chain of confidence is the adoption of transparent processes and tools that provide verifiable evidence of security at each step. The audience will be introduced to Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), cryptographic signing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines fortified with automated security checks.</p>
<p>The talk will also consider the human aspect, emphasizing the need for cultivating a culture of security awareness and collaboration among stakeholders. This includes not only developers and security professionals but also suppliers, distributors, and end-users.<br>Finally, the talk will provide actionable insights and strategies for organizations to audit, monitor, and continuously improve their software supply chains.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/chain-of-confidence-cre23"></a>
