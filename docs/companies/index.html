 Compare and Contrast — Federated Identity vs Self-sovereign Identity <p>This is a comparison series of articles where we will compare the different methodologies, frameworks, standards, and more in the world of digital identity and its implementation.</p><p>As always, we start with the basics and in this article, we will talk about the differences between federated digital identity and self-sovereign identity and when you should choose one over&nbsp;another.</p><p>At the most basic level, identity is a unique characteristic, value, or document that has a one-to-one relationship with only one entity. For individuals, identity is biometric information, a unique number such as a driver’s license number, etc. However, the key aspect is that this information must be owned solely by the individual.</p><p>This discussion brings up a pertinent question. What are the forms of identity that an individual can&nbsp;have?</p><p>In this context, we can say physical and digital identities.</p> What is a Physical Identity? <p>A physical identity is typically a card that is issued by a relevant authority such as the government, university, employer, store, etc, as the case may be. This card contains a unique value or a code that helps a verifier identify a particular entity. In the case of individuals, this card will most likely have a photo as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Markus Winkler</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/id-documents?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">&nbsp;Unsplash</a></p> What is a Digital Identity? <p>A digital identity, as the name suggests, is a form of identity where there are no physical cards, photos, or objects. Rather, these are pieces of information online that can be traced to an entity. It can include photos you have uploaded, username/password combinations, your details stored in a third-party database, and just about anything else that can uniquely identify you. It can be a single piece of data or a combination of digital identity credentials.</p> Evolution of Physical to Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Physical identities were a good starting point of identification, but they came with many shortcomings.</p>  Obtaining a physical ID is not easy, especially when stringent and bureaucratic processes are involved. This gets worse if the ID is lost and a new one has to be obtained.  There’s always a possibility for theft or loss, both of which can have serious ramifications  The information is not private, Anyone who accesses the physical card can know your name, unique ID, address, date of birth, and other personally identifiable information  It could be hard to identify an entity if the central repository or database that contains an entity’s information is destroyed due to natural/man-made calamities.  <p>These shortcomings led to the emergence of digital identities.</p><p>The earliest form of digital identity was a siloed model where every organization had a unique username/password for every user. This led to an explosion of usernames and passwords that became hard to remember. Also, maintaining these unique usernames and passwords became cumbersome for both individuals and organizations, and it also led to security issues such as thefts and breaches.</p> Federated Identity <p>The next step was a federated form of identity where third parties issued digital identity credentials using which users could log into other websites or services. Typically, these were your Google and Facebook logins. In the process, these third parties that issued federated identities became the middlemen.</p><p>So, what are the disadvantages of this form of digital identity?</p>  Third parties need a financial incentive to store your data and provide a federated login, so the data owner became a potential target for advertising. In all, the privacy of the owner was compromised.  There were many security issues because all the data was stored across central servers, so a hack or breach greatly increased the chances for a PII of an entity to fall into the wrong&nbsp;hands.  The verification depends on the availability of the service. For example, if Facebook is down, you can’t use its federated login.  You have no control over how your data is stored or&nbsp;shared.  <p>As you can see, the existing physical and digital identities are not foolproof and&nbsp;safe.</p><p>The good news is that digital identity is moving to its next stage of evolution where the existing drawbacks are being addressed. The emergence of technologies such as the Distributed Ledger Technology and cryptography has led to the emergence of a new form of digital identity called the self-sovereign identity.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) — A New Form of Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Self-sovereign identity is a form of digital identity where an entity owns and controls its information completely, including who can see what personal information and how it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>At the most basic level, SSI eliminates third parties in a transaction. So, it is just you and the organization/individual (peer) with whom you want to share your&nbsp;data.</p><p>In SSI, the credentials of an individual such as the date of birth and other PII are stored in a digital wallet. This is similar to a physical wallet, except that the credentials are stored in a digital format. Also, these credentials have the digital signature of the issuer to prove their authenticity.</p><p>So, each of these digital credentials describes</p>  Who issued it? Could be a government organization, university, employer, a startup company,&nbsp;etc.  Who is the subject of each credential? Could be an individual, group, or organization  Validity. Establishes if the credential is still valid or whether it was revoked or has&nbsp;expired.  <p>Above everything, the holder of a credential can decide, what, how, and with whom it has to be shared. For example, if an individual (John) has digital credentials of his date of birth, employment, degree, and driver’s license, he can choose to selectively disclose just his date of birth with an organization that wants to know if he is more than 21 years old to make him eligible to buy alcohol. Similarly, John can choose to share just his past employment details with a prospective employer without revealing any other information.</p><p>All these give the entity complete control over the credentials and how it is shared. Further, it is highly secure, thanks to the underlying private-public key cryptography. The digital signatures present in the credential make it authentic while the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) makes it tamper-proof.</p><p>Another advantage of VCs is that they are highly interoperable. Extending the above example, John can send his date of birth as a part of a verifiable presentation for a loan application. This is because the data model of the VC doesn’t&nbsp;change.</p> Federated Identity vs SSI: A Quick&nbsp;Glance <p>The above comparison leads us to the next question. Which is&nbsp;better?</p><p>In reality, there’s no straight answer to this question because it depends on the situation. For example, federated identity may be the easiest way for an organization to give its employees a single click access to third-party applications like Slack and Salesforce.</p><p>However, in transactions that involve the sharing of PII with third-party entities, SSI is a better&nbsp;option.</p><p>Affinidi provides the building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

 Through the partnerships, users of Tapmydata will be able to reclaim and stake with their data in DeFi&nbsp;markets. <p>We are excited to announce our latest partnership with Tapmydata, a decentralized data protocol enabling people to own their digital identity and earn crypto, while allowing companies to rebuild trust. Tapmydata are able to achieve this through using Privacy by Design and blockchain technology to keep the score. With this partnership, Shyft Network will be able to integrate Tapmydata’s innovation of allowing users to utilize their data to stake in the DeFi&nbsp;market.</p> The partnership <p>The issues surrounding online data and its uses have increased especially due to social media and the growth of the internet. The importance of data and identity verification on different platforms allows users to own their data as well as have power over its use. Many companies have been benefiting from data acquired without the users knowledge or consent. Additionally, little parameters have been put up to identify owners of data, meaning that the validity of certain data or user information is a challenge.</p><p>This partnership therefore will allow Shyft Network and Tapmydata to offer users more security for their data, while allowing them to earn by consenting to its usage. The mantra for Tapmydata allows for the inclusion of all users into Web3’s digital economy even if they have no money to invest, through their data. Shyft Network’s attestation framework will help users grant, manage and revoke consent in a secure manner, as well as enable data to be validated by trusted third parties and become more valuable and usable by data aggregators and consumers. In addition, Shyft Network will offer users an opportunity to stake and earn rewards by simply using their&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“We set out with a simple mission, to help people take back control of their data. With the first release of our app we broke new ground in the personal data space and finally, after sending more data access requests than any other company on the planet, it feels like the industry is ready for us. This partnership is a key element in delivering our vision of a Universal Data Income for all of our users. Enabling third party verification is critical in order to deliver this” — Irfon Watkins, Chairman of Tapmydata</blockquote><blockquote>“As Shyft Network enters a new phase of development, bringing strongly aligned partnerships that have a natural fit to our mission and objectives is more important than ever. Shyft Network was built to address real needs and problems. For us, it’s important to keep a user-centric privacy-focused approach to build better standards for personal data management. With Tapmydata, we see a perfect opportunity to create synergies and empower users to own their data, to gain control over it and to contextualize it through trusted third parties, and, ultimately, to be able to benefit from it.” — <a href="mailto:juan@shyft.network">Juan Aja Aguinaco</a>, Co-Founder of Shyft Network&nbsp;Inc.</blockquote> The importance of this partnership for Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network is committed to partnering with platforms that have tangible solutions for their users. The importance of such partnerships open the platform up to more users and use cases, as well as presenting more ways that we can serve the community. It is our hope that this new partnership will allow Shyft Network to make more steps towards strengthening interoperability and decentralization, as well as embedding trust and validation into&nbsp;data.</p> Why us this important for Tapmydata <p>We know we are aiming to tackle a huge problem and realize we cannot do it alone. There has to be a shift in worldwide awareness that data has value and it is being monetized without our consent. By partnering with a project that has the same mission, Tapmydata knows we can make a change and are thankful to Shyft Network for embarking on this journey with&nbsp;us.</p> About Tapmydata <p>Tapmydata’s solution helps users to reclaim their digital footprint, giving them the right to decide who they can share the data with and on what terms. Through the platform, people have control of their data and can make decisions on whether to share it or capitalize on the market and earn rewards from their data. The data broking sector trades information without transparency, hence owners of this data have no choice or control over&nbsp;it.</p><p>More details about this partnership will also be on Tapmydata’s <a href="https://tapmydata.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tapmydata">Twitter</a>. You can join the conversation on their <a href="https://t.me/tapmydataofficial">Telegram</a> to get involved.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner. Shift Network allows and gives incentives to individuals and enterprises to work together to add context to data, unlocking the ability to build authentic digital reputation, identity, and credibility frameworks.</p><p>For any further details and developments about this partnership, information will be aptly available on our <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://shyft.network/">website</a>.</p> More INFO <blockquote>Website: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network/</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram Group: <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram ANN: <a href="https://t.me/ShyftAnnouncements">https://t.me/ShyftAnnouncements</a></blockquote><blockquote>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a></blockquote><blockquote>Medium: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/</a></blockquote><blockquote>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6</a></blockquote>

Our Torus Wallet users can now enjoy seamless Face/TouchID authentication that OpenLogin brings, coupled with the advanced security features powered by the <a href="https://docs.tor.us/key-infrastructure/overview">Torus Key Infrastructure</a>.</p><p>Users would still be able to access their old wallets, as well as their newly created OpenLogin wallets within the same account. However, when interacting with dapps, users would need a few additional steps to ensure that they are using their intended wallet to interact with the dapps that they are accessing.</p> What Has Changed: Fast&nbsp;Login <p>With the OpenLogin upgrade, previous tKey wallets will be migrated to OpenLogin wallets. Old tKey shares/factors stored on devices will be upgraded to now be secured behind the device’s native biometric token with OpenLogin. Users can make the upgrade by following the steps shown within the guide&nbsp;modal.</p>Migrate tKey Wallets to OpenLogin with the modal&nbsp;guides<p>If the user has biometric scanners installed on their device, they would be able to register their device factor with their biometric authentication, which would give them access to Fast&nbsp;Login.</p><p>Once Fast Login has been set up, subsequent logins into Torus Wallet would just require a Touch/FaceID scan from the user to gain access to their&nbsp;wallets.</p> Setting Your Default&nbsp;Wallet <p>With OpenLogin, users now have access to both their OpenLogin wallet as well as their basic Torus Wallet tied to their method of authentication (Google, Facebook, Discord, Passwordless etc.). They have a choice of selecting which wallet they intend to use to interact with&nbsp;dapps.</p>Setting your Default Wallet within <a href="https://app.tor.us/">https://app.tor.us/</a><p>To select the wallet that you wish to interact with&nbsp;dapps:</p>  Log in to your Torus Wallet at <a href="https://app.tor.us/">https://app.tor.us/</a>  Go to the Settings&nbsp;Tab  Select your Default Wallet from the Account Management Section  <p>The selected Default wallet would be the wallet that would be used to interact with dapps when logging in to the same account, from here onwards, you would be able to log into dapps with your Torus Wallet through OpenLogin or your preferred mode of authentication.</p> Using an Older Version of Torus&nbsp;Wallet <p>For users who have difficulty logging into their OpenLogin accounts, and wish to access an older version of the Torus Wallet to access their old Torus accounts, they can log in at <a href="https://app.tor.us/v1.9.19/">https://app.tor.us/v1.9.19/</a>.</p> How Keys are Secured: Torus Key Infrastructure <p>The underlying technology securing the user’s keys remains unchanged and is still powered by the Torus Key Infrastructure.</p><p>TKI is a model of threshold key management that solves the trilemma without sacrificing user experience while retaining end-user autonomy and security. The model implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing#:~:text=Shamir's%20Secret%20Sharing%20is%20an,number%20of%20parts%20is%20required.">Shamir Secret Shares (SSS)</a> scheme using the user’s device, private input, and wallet service provider. The user’s private key is split into multiple factors, and these split factors are used to reconstruct the original encrypted secret&nbsp;key.</p><p>Like 2FA systems, as long as the user has access to 2 out of 3 of their factors, they will be able to retrieve their private key and gain access to the&nbsp;wallet.</p>The user’s private key is split into multiple&nbsp;factors<p>1. User Device Factor: Implementation is device and system-specific. With OpenLogin, the factor is secured via biometrics within the device’s secure&nbsp;enclave.</p>Further decentralizing the social login, this corresponding “share” is split into sub-shares<p>2. Social Login Factor: This factor is kept and managed by a login provider via their own authentication. With Torus, this factor is further split via a distributed key generation protocol and kept on large ecosystem stakeholders to secure your factor further, retrievable via OAuth logins. <a href="https://docs.tor.us/key-infrastructure/overview">Click here to learn how Torus&nbsp;works</a>.</p><p>3. Recovery Factor: This is based on user input (e.g., password, security. questions, hardware device,&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>As long as the user has any 2 of their factors, they will gain access to their&nbsp;wallet.</p> Reach Out to&nbsp;Us <p>Should you have any questions with regards to using your Torus Wallet, join our Telegram group at <a href="https://t.me/TorusLabs">https://t.me/TorusLabs</a> and reach out to any of our admins with the “Torus Team” tag, and our team would be happy to assist&nbsp;you.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/upgrade-your-torus-wallet-with-openlogin-a5c63d81d43a">Upgrade your Torus Wallet with OpenLogin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Torus Labs</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

I started my career in industrial chemistry after my engineering studies and worked in that sector for 3 years. As I have always been interested in a lot of different sectors, I started to study computer sciences in parallel with my job in chemistry. I discovered the blockchain at that moment and quickly fell in love with the idea of decentralisation and autonomous applications running on the blockchain. I started to work in this for a few ICOs during the ICO boom of 2017 and left my job in chemistry to work full time on blockchain projects and I never stopped since then.</p>
<p>At a personal level, I am addicted to good food. Before COVID-19, I was always looking for new restaurants to discover in Luxembourg. Now it’s more about cooking good stuff at my place 👨‍🍳. I also really like sports, I used to do fitness and boxing before the lockdowns, but I discovered a passion for mountain bikes during this weird times as Luxembourg is a perfect place for that.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I met Luc, the CEO of Tokeny, at the LHoFT in Luxembourg at the end of 2018, just before Tokeny’s first birthday. We decided to work together as we are both passionate about blockchain technology. When I look back to what we have accomplished since then I have to say that I am quite proud of the result 🙂.</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I honestly really like working at Tokeny, the company has grown a lot since I landed here in 2018 but everyday we have new challenges and the team is very skilled. I also like the fact that I can work on a lot of different subjects, from coding to business related tasks. This is something that really reflects the startup spirit, and it prevents me from getting bored!</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I am passionate about innovations and new technologies, from spacecrafts to 3d printers, to blockchain, etc. I am really amazed by what humans can achieve when they put their intelligence at work on meaningful subjects. I think we need more people like Elon Musk in this world, and I am convinced that intelligence and technology can solve all the problems that humanity is facing at the moment.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream would be to live long enough to see us (humanity) become a multi planet civilization.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Tough question, there are a lot of things that would need to change in the world unfortunately, but if I have to choose one, I would say that the best thing that could happen to the world would be to see all nations cooperate, first to solve global problems such as global warming, poverty, etc. but also to solve technological challenges such as space colonization. But it’s probably quite utopian to believe in such a cooperation.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>On April 21, 2021, the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-european-approach-artificial-intelligence" title="European Commission proposed a legal framework">European Commission proposed a legal framework</a> for Artificial Intelligence that covers all AI systems that impact natural persons within the European Union, regardless of whether they are operated from within or outside the EU.</p>
 Main goals 
<p>There are a few stated goals that create the foundation for this proposed regulation. First is that AI systems must be safe and must respect the fundamental rights and values of the European Union. This must be true not only for the outcomes of AI systems, but for the entire value chain of AI development.</p>
<p>The commission also recognized that the absence of regulation had a hindering effect on the development of, the investment in, and the implementation of AI. The lack of clear guidance was a risk factor for all stakeholders, including users who would not benefit from the safety requirements, investors who may not be able to recoup their investment if the unregulated space were at some point in the future hit with more restrictive requirements, and of course AI system developers and implementing customers who would face the fines and penalties if found to be non-compliant. Issuing a regulation before massive widespread adoption of AI systems hits the EU market reduces the risk and uncertainty of AI investment.</p>
<p>Then comes the substance of the issue: providing concrete guidance for governing and enforcing safety and protection of fundamental rights as it relates to AI systems. Being the first regulation of its kind, it sets a global example of how to approach the varied designs, applications, and potential risk of AI systems. This proposed regulation takes a risk-based approach, sorting AI systems into different risk categories, and applying more stringent requirements on higher risk systems.</p>
<p>Lastly, the European Market should remain harmonized, and many disparate regulations from each member state could cause major disruption to the development and use of systems across borders. The EU Commission moved relatively quickly to get ahead of and avoid such a muddled regulatory environment.</p>
 What to expect 
<p>There are a few important aspects to know about this regulation. The proposed regulation will follow a risk-based approach, as we surmised in a previous <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/bailey/new-developments-in-european-ai-regulation" title="blog post">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>AI applications will be categorized as creating unacceptable risk, high risk, low risk, and minimal risk. An AI system that causes unacceptable risk by violating the fundamental rights of EU citizens will be prohibited. These prohibitions are called out specifically, including:</p>
 
 Manipulation with the intent to affect human behavior that would result in physical or psychological harm, including subliminal techniques 
 Exploitation of vulnerable people groups 
 Social scoring systems by public authorities 
 Remote ‘real-time’ biometric identification systems in public spaces for law enforcement 
 
<p>High-risk AI systems are permitted to be on the market, given that they follow stringent requirements to mitigate the extent to which they create risk to the health, safety, or fundamental rights of individuals.</p>
<p>Systems with low or minimal risk have fewer requirements imposed on them, but notably do need establish transparency. This will be in the form of communication to end users that information has been generated or altered in an automated way. Systems that interact with humans, used to detect emotion or come to other conclusions based on biometric data, or to generate or manipulate content (‘deep fakes’) must account for the possibility that a user will be manipulated by the outcome. A disclosure that automated means were used for in such situations will need to be communicated.</p>
<p>Lower risk systems are encouraged to voluntarily adhere to the mandatory requirements of higher risk systems, with provisions for environmental sustainability, accessibility, diversity of development teams, and multi-stakeholder approaches.</p>
<p>Governing bodies will be established at the EU level and at the member state level.</p>
 What to consider at this point 
<p>The regulation is still only a proposal, and it must cycle through the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament before it is formally adopted. After that point, the regulation will have one and a half years before it comes into full force.</p>
<p>Debates over on the high-level approach to AI governance and minute details will likely arise. The enforcement of this regulation should be not only applied to AI systems but also to member states. Member states should show adequate effort in enforcing this upcoming regulation.</p>
<p>The regulation itself walks a fine line between prohibition and innovation empowerment, with limited success. The legal architecture supports the restrictive aspects, with only voluntary participation in visionary measures, such as committing to generating public value or environmental sustainability. Facilitating both restrictive safety precautions and enabling bold digital advancement for society is a tall order, but could be better articulated and provided for.</p>
<p>It is expected that AI vendors or customers will contest the risk categorization of AI systems, arguing that their systems are in lower risk categories as it will impact the additional regulatory hurdles that they need to overcome. To give an example, evaluating the financial credibility of individuals – as Schufa does in Germany – is by definition a high-risk AI application. Organizations running such high-risk applications must self-assess to find out whether their doing is ethically compliant. This may be the result of strong interest groups, leaving the draft with an unbalanced outcome.</p>
<p>At a detailed level, there may be concern that deep fakes are only subject to minimal transparency obligations, like disclosure that the audio/visual content was altered. Indication to which degree the content was altered is not required. Since deep fakes pose a high risk for social manipulation as well as algorithmic manipulation, the infiltration of deep fakes into training data can undermine the trustability of all algorithms if left with such a minimal and difficult to enforce requirement.</p>
<p>The public debate on the most appropriate way to regulate and govern AI will continue, but the hope that a comprehensive regulation that aims to protect the rights and safety of individuals in a multi-stakeholder manner is a significant step forward.</p>

  <p>Elasticsearch is a popular datastore for all types of information. It is distributed for speed and scalability and can index many types of content which makes it highly searchable. It uses simple REST APIs for ease of access.</p>

<p>Go has an official Elasticsearch library which makes it simple for Go developers to work with data stored in Elasticsearch programmatically.</p>

<p>Today we’re going to take a look at how you can easily build a simple app that allows data to be added and searched in Elasticsearch using Go. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>PS: The code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/go-elasticsearch-example">GitHub</a></p>

 Prerequisites to Writing an Elasticsearch Application in Go 

<p>First things first, if you haven’t already got Go installed on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Download and install - The Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>A Go workspace is required. This is a directory in which all Go libraries live. It is usually <code>~/go</code>, but can be any directory as long as the environment variable <code>GOPATH</code> points to it.</p>

<p>Next, create a directory where all our future code will live.</p>

   <code>mkdir go-elasticsearch-example
cd go-elasticsearch-example
</code>   

<p>Then, make the directory a Go module and install the Go Elasticsearch library.</p>

   <code>go mod init go-elasticsearch-example
go get github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8
</code>   

<p>A file called <code>go.mod</code> should have been created containing the dependency that you installed with <code>go get</code>.</p>

<p>After this, we need to install Elasticsearch. A convenient way of doing this is to use a Docker image containing an already configured Elasticsearch. If you haven’t already got Docker on your machine <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Install Docker Engine</a>.</p>

<p>We then need to pull an Elasticsearch Docker image. This will take some time to download.</p>

   <code>docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.5.2
</code>   

<p>Now we need to create a Docker volume so that Elasticsearch data doesn’t get lost when a container exits:</p>

   <code>docker volume create elasticsearch
</code>   

<p>The Docker command line to run an Elasticsearch container is quite long, so we will create a script called <code>run-elastic.sh</code> to run the Docker command for us:</p>

   <code>#! /bin/bash

docker rm -f elasticsearch
docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -e discovery.type=single-node \
    -v elasticsearch:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data \
    docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.5.2
docker ps
</code>   

<p>The script needs to be made executable and then run.</p>

   <code>chmod +x run-elastic.sh
./run-elastic.sh
</code>   

<p>Finally, verify that Elasticsearch is running:</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:9200
</code>   

<p>You should see a JSON object containing details of the server.</p>

 How to Find and Understand How to Handle Data in Go 

<p>We need a fairly large set of data to load into Elasticsearch. This web site <a href="http://stapi.io">STAPI, a Star Trek API</a> contains huge amounts of data from the Star Trek universe. We will use the spacecraft data as our dataset for this application. It is always a good idea to know what the data looks like. Enter the URL http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/spacecraft/search?pageNumber=0&amp;pageSize=100&amp;pretty into a web browser. You should see a JSON object containing page information and a list of spacecraft information. There are over 1200 spacecraft in total.
PS: Bookmark this link or keep the page open for future reference.</p>

 A brief introduction to data types in Go 

<p>If you’re new to Go, this section covers topics that will be helpful to understand before you move forward. If you’re already familiar with Go, you can skip ahead to the next section.</p>

<p>The STAPI site and the results of Elasticsearch searches are sent to clients as JSON objects. The Go APIs receive JSON objects like maps and lists. Map and list values can be of type <code>nil</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>list</code>, and <code>map</code>. Go is a compiled language and it is also strongly typed. Map keys are always strings. The values of any map or list can be a mixture of types, so the values of a map or list can’t be given an explicit type in the code.</p>

<p>Go allows maps and lists to have values of any type by declaring the type as an interface:</p>

   <code>var vessels []interface{}
var craft map[string]interface{}
</code>   

<p>This leads to another issue. It is impossible for the compiler to determine what the actual type of the value is. This can only be determined at runtime, making it important to know what the data structure is. If you know the type, you can use a type assertion that tells the compiler what the actual type is. In our example, <code>vessels</code> is a list of maps and <code>craft</code> is a map containing a number of attributes including a name which is a string.</p>

<p>The type assertions become:</p>

   <code>craft0, err := vessels[0].(map[string]interface{})
name, err := craft["name"].(string)
</code>   

<p>If the type assertion agrees with the actual type the <code>err</code> will be <code>nil</code>. You can omit the <code>err</code> return value, but if the type assertion fails then an exception will be thrown. Multiple type assertions can be used in the same expression:</p>

   <code>name := vessels[0].(map[string]interface[])["name"].(string)
</code>   

<p>Finally, if you don’t know the actual type of an interface value, then you can use <code>reflect</code> to find it out:</p>

   <code>print(reflect.TypeOf(vessels[0]))
</code>   

 How to Access Elasticsearch from Go 

<p>First of all, we will write a simple Go program that connects to Elasticsearch and prints out server information. Create a file called <code>simple.go</code> containing:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    es, err := elasticsearch.NewDefaultClient()
    if err != nil {
   	 log.Fatalf("Error creating the client: %s", err)
    }
    log.Println(elasticsearch.Version)

    res, err := es.Info()
    if err != nil {
   	 log.Fatalf("Error getting response: %s", err)
    }
    defer res.Body.Close()
    log.Println(res)
}
</code>   

<p>The program should be self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Now run the program.</p>

   <code>go run simple.go
</code>   

<p>You should see the server information displayed in JSON format.</p>

 How to Build a Console Menu in Go 

<p>We are going to build a user interface in the form of a simple console-based menu-driven application. Create a file called <code>Elastic.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func Exit() {
	fmt.Println("Goodbye!")
	os.Exit(0)
}

func ReadText(reader *bufio.Scanner, prompt string) string {
	fmt.Print(prompt + ": ")
	reader.Scan()
	return reader.Text()
}

func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	for {
        fmt.Println("0) Exit")
        option := ReadText(reader, "Enter option")
        if option == "0" {
			Exit()
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Invalid option")
		}
	}
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s see what this code does. The function <code>Exit()</code> prints out a message and terminates the program.</p>

<p>The function <code>ReadText</code> is a helper function that encapsulates the three lines of Go code required to print out a prompt and read a line of text from the keyboard.</p>

<p>The main function first creates a scanner object which reads from standard input. It then enters an infinite loop as we don’t know how many times the loop needs to execute. The menu options are printed out and then an option string is read from the keyboard. Finally, either the <code>Exit()</code> function is called or an error message is displayed.</p>

<p>Now, run the program and try entering a few options.</p>

   <code>go run Elastic.go
</code>   

<p>You should only see one option: “0) Exit”</p>

<p>Exit from the program by pressing “0” and hitting the “Enter” key.</p>

 How to Read Data from STAPI and Store it in Elasticsearch from Go 

<p>We are going to add a menu item to load the data from STAPI and store it in Elastic search.</p>

<p>First of all, we need to make some changes to <code>Elastic.go</code>. We need an import statement and create an instance of the Elasticsearch client.</p>

   <code>import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8"
)

var es, _ = elasticsearch.NewDefaultClient()
</code>   

<p>Next, add another menu item to load the data:</p>

   <code>func main() {
    reader := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
    for {
        fmt.Println("0) Exit")
        fmt.Println("1) Load spacecraft")
        fmt.Println("2) Get spacecraft")
        option := ReadText(reader, "Enter option")
        if option == "0" {
            Exit()
        } else if option == "1" {
            LoadData()
        } else {
            fmt.Println("Invalid option")
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The code isn’t ready to run yet. We still need to write the <code>LoadData()</code> function. For that function, we are going to read all of the spacecraft data from the STAPI site. The site only allows up to 100 entries to be read at once, so the data is spread over 13 pages. This means that we need to read each page in turn. Create a file called <code>LoadData.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"context"
	"encoding/json"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
	"strconv"
	"strings"

	"github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/esapi"
)

func LoadData() {
	var spacecrafts []map[string]interface{}
	pageNumber := 0
	for {
		response, _ := http.Get("http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/spacecraft/search?pageSize=100&amp;pageNumber=" + strconv.Itoa(pageNumber))
		body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)
		defer response.Body.Close()
		var result map[string]interface{}
		json.Unmarshal(body, &amp;result)

		page := result["page"].(map[string]interface{})
		totalPages := int(page["totalPages"].(float64))

		crafts := result["spacecrafts"].([]interface{})

		for _, craftInterface := range crafts {
			craft := craftInterface.(map[string]interface{})
			spacecrafts = append(spacecrafts, craft)
		}

		pageNumber++
		if pageNumber &gt;= totalPages {
			break
		}
	}

	for _, data := range spacecrafts {
		uid, _ := data["uid"].(string)
		jsonString, _ := json.Marshal(data)
		request := esapi.IndexRequest{Index: "stsc", DocumentID: uid, Body: strings.NewReader(string(jsonString))}
		request.Do(context.Background(), es)
	}
	print(len(spacecrafts), " spacecraft read\n")
}
</code>   

<p>So, what does this code do?</p>

<p>First of all, it creates a variable named <code>spacecrafts</code> containing an empty list of maps. Map entries have string keys and the values can be of any type. It also declares a page number that starts from zero.</p>

<p>Next, we have an infinite loop to fetch the pages of data. We will terminate the loop when the last page has been read.</p>

<p>Then, the Go <code>http</code> API to fetches a page of data from STAPI, specifying the page number to fetch. The response body is then read, and the body is closed to free up resources. The response body is a JSON object which is unmarshaled into a Go map called <code>result</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>result</code> map has two entries, a map called <code>page</code>, and a list of spacecraft information called <code>spacecrafts</code>. The page map contains information about the current page. We are only interested in the total number of pages so we extract that information into a variable named <code>totalPages</code>. Next, the code iterates over the spacecraft list and uses type assertion to type each entry as a map. The entry is then appended to the list of spacecraft maps.</p>

<p>It then increments the page number and if it is the last page terminates the infinite loop using <code>break</code>.</p>

<p>We now have a list containing all of the spacecraft, each entry being a map containing data about the spacecraft.</p>

<p>Now it is time to store the data in Elasticsearch. Data is inserted in Elasticsearch by creating a map of type <code>esapi.IndexRequest()</code>. Data items in Elasticsearch are called documents and Elasticsearch stores documents in a collection called an index. Each document needs to be given a unique identifier within the index so we use the spacecraft <code>uid</code> as the unique index. For the body of the document we marshal the data for the spacecraft into JSON and use that. The actual insert operation is performed by calling the <code>Do()</code> function, passing it a Go context and the Elastic search client.</p>

<p>Now, run the program and select the menu item to load the data. As the code is now in two files, both need to be specified to run the program.</p>

   <code>go run Elastic.go LoadData.go
</code>   

<p>You can now verify that there is some data in the <code>stsc</code> index by pointing a web browser at (http://localhost:9200/stsc/_search)[http://localhost:9200/stsc/_search]. Some, but not all of the data should be displayed.</p>

 How to Get a Document out of Elasticsearch from Go 

<p>Loading documents into Elasticsearch was quite complex due to the data conversions that were required. Getting and searching for documents is much simpler.</p>

<p>The changes that we’ll be making require some new imports, so let’s start by updating our import statement:</p>

   <code>import (
    "bufio"
    "bytes"
    "context"
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/esapi"
    "github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8"
)
</code>   

<p>Elasticsearch returns documents in the form of a JSON object containing metadata and the document content. This is not very readable. We will add a function called <code>Print()</code> to <code>Elastic.go</code> which prints out some of the spacecraft information in a more readable form.</p>

   <code>func Print(spacecraft map[string]interface{}) {
	name := spacecraft["name"]
	status := ""
	if spacecraft["status"] != nil {

		status = "- " + spacecraft["status"].(string)
	}
	registry := ""
	if spacecraft["registry"] != nil {

		registry = "- " + spacecraft["registry"].(string)
	}
	class := ""
	if spacecraft["spacecraftClass"] != nil {

		class = "- " + spacecraft["spacecraftClass"].(map[string]interface{})["name"].(string)
	}
	fmt.Println(name, registry, class, status)
}
</code>   

<p>The function takes account of the fact that some of the fields can be <code>nil</code> and that type assertions are required.</p>

<p>Documents can be requested by specifying the index and the document identifier. Let’s add another menu item to <code>Elastic.go</code> to get a spacecraft. The menu calls a function called <code>Get()</code> passing it to the reader. Next, add the function:</p>

   <code>func Get(reader *bufio.Scanner) {
	id := ReadText(reader, "Enter spacecraft ID")
	request := esapi.GetRequest{Index: "stsc", DocumentID: id}
	response, _ := request.Do(context.Background(), es)
	var results map[string]interface{}
	json.NewDecoder(response.Body).Decode(&amp;results)
	Print(results["_source"].(map[string]interface{}))
}
</code>   

<p>The document is returned in a JSON object which is decoded into a map. The actual document is in the map entry <code>_source</code>.</p>

 How to Search for Documents in Go 

<p>Elasticsearch supports a number of different types of searches. Each search has a query type and a list of key, value pairs of fields to match. The result is a list of hits, each given a value indicating how good the match was. A match search looks for work matches. The search values should always be in lowercase. A name match for <code>uss</code> would match all spacecraft with the word <code>uss</code> in the name in any case including <code>USS</code>. A prefix search matches any word which starts with the specified string.</p>

<p>Now, we will add searches to <code>Elastic.go</code>. First of all, let’s update the <code>main()</code> function to add searches to the menu.</p>

   <code>func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	for {
		fmt.Println("0) Exit")
		fmt.Println("1) Load spacecraft")
		fmt.Println("2) Get spacecraft")
		fmt.Println("3) Search spacecraft by key and value")
		fmt.Println("4) Search spacecraft by key and prefix")
		option := ReadText(reader, "Enter option")
		if option == "0" {
			Exit()
		} else if option == "1" {
			LoadData()
		} else if option == "2" {
			Get(reader)
		} else if option == "3" {
			Search(reader, "match")
		} else if option == "4" {
			Search(reader, "prefix")
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Invalid option")
		}
	}
}
</code>   

<p>Note that the new <code>Search()</code> function takes the search type as a parameter.</p>

<p>Next, add the search function.</p>

   <code>func Search(reader *bufio.Scanner, querytype string) {
	key := ReadText(reader, "Enter key")
	value := ReadText(reader, "Enter value")
	var buffer bytes.Buffer
	query := map[string]interface{}{
		"query": map[string]interface{}{
			querytype: map[string]interface{}{
				key: value,
			},
		},
	}
	json.NewEncoder(&amp;buffer).Encode(query)
	response, _ := es.Search(es.Search.WithIndex("stsc"), es.Search.WithBody(&amp;buffer))
	var result map[string]interface{}
	json.NewDecoder(response.Body).Decode(&amp;result)
	for _, hit := range result["hits"].(map[string]interface{})["hits"].([]interface{}) {
		craft := hit.(map[string]interface{})["_source"].(map[string]interface{})
		Print(craft)
	}
}
</code>   

<p>After obtaining the key and value from the user, the function constructs a data structure from the query type, the key, and the value. This then gets encoded as a JSON object. The <code>es.Search()</code> function is called with the index name and the query as a body. This returns a list of hits. These are iterated over and the source object is printed.</p>

<p>Run the program and try some match and prefix searches. For example:</p>

<p>For option 3 (“Search spacecraft by key and value”) try:
Enter key: <code>name</code>
Enter value: <code>enterprise</code></p>

<p>For option 4 (“Search by spacecraft key and prefix”) try:
Enter key: <code>registry</code>
Enter value: <code>ncc</code></p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>Enter key: <code>name</code>
Enter value: <code>iks</code></p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Elasticsearch can store many types of data in documents. Each document resides in a collection called an index. Each document also has an identifier that is unique in the index. Elasticsearch has a comprehensive REST API.</p>

<p>Go has a library that is an API on top of the Elasticsearch REST API. It makes inserting, getting, and searching for documents very easy for a Go developer. The only real complexity is handling maps and lists with different value data types. Once the Go interfaces and type assertions are understood, the complexity is resolved.</p>

 Introduction &amp; Web Evolution 
<p>Mathieu: Stepan, thank you for joining me today.</p>
<p>Stepan: Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I’ve been very much looking forward to this conversation! The times we’ve spoken before have been quite interesting; we both come from the crypto space, and we’ve moved to the SSI space. We share similar visions for the decentralized future and the decentralized tech stack. So, I’ve been very much looking forward to this conversation on the podcast today, and maybe we could geek out a little bit or push ourselves more into the future.</p>
<p>I think these are fun conversations to have! At the same time, I’m hoping we could also focus on topics around go-to-market and near-term things that we think are interesting with SSI to keep pushing the adoption forward.</p>
<p>Where I want to start is, we hear a lot about web 3.0. It’s this space, or the umbrella, that we fall into: how do you look at the evolution of Web 1.0 through 2.0 to 3.0? My thinking is that we are still in Web 2.0. We’ve come to realize that in the Web 2.0 version, it resulted in significant centralization and censorship and other restrictions. Is Web 3 taking back the ethos of Web 1? How do you look at that?</p>
<p>Stepan: First of all, thanks a lot for inviting me. I’ve listened to some of the previous episodes. I really enjoyed the podcast, and some of the guests are just great. In my opinion, Web 3 is only one of the terms; it might not be the one that we eventually settle on. Previously, there were a few things that were called Web 3, and none of them actually became Web 3: That includes the Ethereum library and the Javascript library, which are given this name today. Some people call this the metaverse; there’s the decentralized web, different names. But it’s the same thing, I think; it’s not a replacement; it’s all an evolution.</p>
<p>Web 1.0 was an amazing invention. If you look at the initial Arpanet, to what then became the worldwide web, it took a lot of great minds and a lot of time to develop. Then, Web 2 was the best way to scale it, because you cannot go from a few thousand people online to 3.5 billion and at the same time, make sure that it’s all privacy-preserving, and decentralized, and fully compliant with all the ethical and technical requirements. I believe that Web 3 is the next layer up the spiral. For me, it’s more about fixing; it’s all about taking what works well and then fixing the things that were created through this natural evolution. I think the reason Web 2 exists as it is today, it’s not some deliberate decision — it’s more about economic trends.</p>
<p>Companies that were created in the 90s or later: Facebook, Twitter, Google: they had to find a business model. Especially in the early 90s, there was no way to make payments online. That naturally led to advertisement-based business models. Therefore, if you’re doing advertising, it’s all about collecting data. Basically, companies compete in terms of who has better targeting and more audience. So, they need to lock people in, and they need to collect as much data as possible to provide better service to their advertisers. Generally, I think most of the users are fine with this. Google is not forcing anyone to use their service, or Facebook is not blocking you from not using it, if you don’t want to share any data or if you don’t want the data to be collected. The good thing about Facebook, is it provides an ability to communicate with your friends and the whole world. That is a positive thing, and it should be definitely should exist in Web 3 and in different services.</p>
<p>You can do the same and actually provide the companies who build this an ability to make money and the ability to have a business model. But, with the new technology, it can be done more correctly by taking into account user preferences and the different risks that exist. As we’re speaking, a few days ago, Facebook was hacked, or I don’t know exactly what happened. Somehow, they lost personal data on 500 million users, which is definitely not a good sign. In the SSI world, this couldn’t happen. There are a lot of economic, ethical, and regulatory trends, which force internet companies to start thinking about decentralization in order to provide the same or better level of customer experience, while giving users more autonomy or sovereignty.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes. Many of the companies that spun up and built business models on top of Web 2.0 are amazing. You alluded to that with Facebook; you can connect to literally anyone in the world, and that’s phenomenal. With Amazon’s services, it’s ridiculous to think that you could order anything you want for so cheap, and the next day it’s on your doorstep — it’s magic, right?</p>
<p>Many of these companies are built on advertising models: you had explained that there were no payment options, so the model became a data mining model, and selling that for advertising. For these companies that today have business models built on top of all these Web 2.0 methods; what’s the transition for them to Web 3.0? And perhaps we could talk a bit more about the business models of Web 3.0?</p>
<p>I think we see that Twitter is a good example of this. I believe that Twitter realizes where the world is going. It’s quite clear that their CEO is a big advocate of decentralization: is it replacing the plumbing? From your point of view, how does a company think about transitioning and building new protocols to take them from Web 2 to Web 3? </p>
<p>Stepan: The common trend is that great companies such as Amazon, or Twitter, or Apple, or Google, they do think about their customers first. For example, if we think about who might be one of the largest competitors for some of the <a href="https://northernblock.io/">SSI products</a>, I think Apple comes to mind. That’s not because it’s decentralized; Apple has not released any blockchain-based product, or anything by product. However, at some point a few years ago, they realized that being privacy-conscious, and advertising that, is important for the users. Now, they mention it at any convenient moment. For most of Apple’s products, you always have these privacy settings; they always highlight it, they always show how they care, and they can do it because their business model does not depend on advertising at all. They have the app store, and they have hardware. There is probably some value for Apple to get more insights into their customer behaviour, but it’s not their core business model.</p>
<p>In terms of transitioning, I think there are maybe two different schools of thought. One is that there will be a new decentralized Facebook, decentralized Youtube, decentralized Twitter, and they will replace the existing companies. In some verticals, that is definitely the case. However, most IT companies are not like Blockbuster when faced with Netflix; they’re not discarding this technology. I think that some people at Google or Twitter; at those larger corporations, they do understand decentralized technology quite well. They understand blockchain; I don’t know what they’re thinking, but maybe they feel it’s too early. Facebook tried to launch their Libra currency, but if you’re large, you are faced with this regulatory pushback.</p>
<p>It’s not as easy to launch decentralized products, but it is still important from a product standpoint. As Jack Dorsey has mentioned, there are a lot of scandals and discussions around, “Should social media be blocking or banning some of their users? Is it ethical? Should they comply with government regulation.?” In some countries, governments are actually forcing social media to ban people who simply don’t like the political situation. In other situations, it’s the companies themselves who are deciding that something is inappropriate, even if it’s not purely illegal. I think that the reasons are that it’s not that those companies are taking too much initiative; it’s because there’s no good framework. Government, or most of the governments, cannot provide feedback because governments don’t understand the internet as well as those companies.</p>
<p>Decentralized technology can be a solution, because it creates a flexible system where all opinions can be present. So, for example, for social media, you can have a layer with decentralized identifiers and people posting their tweets as verifiable credentials. Then, you can have multiple UI’s that are connected to the same underlying protocol. The protocol with the data is decentralized, and it’s completely permission-less, but then you can build a kid-friendly Twitter on top of that, that filters out any content that is not good for kids. So, that is kind of self-regulating, and I think this is very similar to how the internet looked in the beginning. I think initially; the transition would happen in those areas where this is a real problem for the customers. You don’t want to risk your business just to try something. On the other hand, there are many experiments, and the whole crypto space, which is simply one big experiment. I think for me, it’s still the fact that bitcoin works, and every ten minutes, you get a new block; it’s still a miracle.</p>
 Privacy, Anonymity and Pseudonymity 
<p>Mathieu: I’m with you on that one. There’s a lot to unpack in what you said there. The Apple privacy positioning is quite evident, and is a very good indicator. I’ve always thought that the biggest feature of the 2020s is going to be privacy, and Apple is really driving that forward in their marketing. They’re also making things happen in the product, where they’re trying to be transparent, and they’re trying to give control to people that are using their products. Apple posted billboards across big cities about it; I remember a massive one in Toronto, where we are.</p>
<p>I do find it interesting: In the crypto space, there are a lot of projects where they’re taking an approach that the existing world is wrong, and we’re going to rebuild. But, on the other side people think that that’s perhaps not the best way to adoption either; when there are already network effects, there are already so many benefits and so much value that these companies are providing today. They have the distribution, they have the scale, and they have the client base. So, if privacy is inherently important to them, and <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity-for-organizations/">moving towards a more decentralized model</a> is important to them, then I think that there are steps that they could take.</p>
<p>The Twitter one is interesting to me. I think this whole cancel culture, as you described; it’s political, at the end of the day. You could think one way or another about the President of the United States being removed from social media platforms; you could think one way or another about an app like Parler being removed, where the server’s not running it anymore. But, it comes down to this: if you want to move that forward, and you want to look into some of these issues such as the cancel culture and all these things that are happening, there’s something interesting about pseudonymous identities online. I’m interested in what your thoughts are on pseudonymous identities; SSI enables that to some extent. SSI, or having <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">trusted digital credentials</a>, enables you to conduct business transactions or to access products and services according to their rules, or their terms and their conditions. You could prove that, but your identity as Stepan or as Mathieu — we don’t necessarily need to have attributes such as our names that we’re given. Our legal names are attributes that are potentially outdated for Web 3.0. There’s a lot of risk associated with that, and the fact that our online lives are attributed to our names or these attributes. So, when you see a hack like the Facebook hack happen, it’s not great. Similarly, when your browsing and chat histories get exposed, it’s going to cause a lot of issues for people. Is that something you think about; of being able to use credentials where you’re still able to be compliant; conduct business transactions, and follow terms and conditions, while being pseudonymous?</p>
<p>Stepan: Yes, and I want to unpack this a little. I do agree that the decentralized web is not happening just because it’s decentralized; it has to solve some problems, and has to bring some value. From a very high level, I think there are two clusters of reasons why these technologies are getting traction. The first one, we could call it ‘boring SSI,’ but in reality, it’s not boring. In fact, it delivers very clear economic benefits. The first bucket of why decentralized technologies are getting adoption, is because they’re really solving some pricing problem today. For example, you have paper-based credentials, or documents, or attestations, and then you replace those with digital ones. They’re decentralized; they can also be exchanged in a peer-to-peer manner. That means that a lot of companies don’t have to be integrated into a single database, so it’s cheaper to maintain. Those are purely economic benefits.</p>
<p>Basically, what happens is that moving a trusted data exchange system onto verifiable credentials or SSI rails reduces the transaction costs, and those transaction costs are present in any economic activity. So, blockchain does the same if you want perhaps to reduce legal costs; you can use a smart contract because it’s automatically enforced. Or, you can use a blockchain to reduce supply and chain management costs, or in verifiable credentials — this is clear. Most of the applications of verifiable credentials today are focused on this transaction cost reduction, and that can be huge. It can be tens of times reduction, because you not only make it cheaper, but you also make it less prone to fraud. It’s possible to fake paper certificates or paper documents; it’s much harder with digital signatures. You reduce the single point of failure, because there’s no database. You increase privacy, and you get mathematical compliance. If you build <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">an SSI system</a>, it’s already GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) compliant from Day One, because there’s no centralized company that is storing everything. It comes down to ‘Issuers and Holders,’ and they have the right to do it. I think the same can be said about every layer of the decentralized stack. This works for decentralized storage, verifiable credentials, blockchain, cryptocurrencies and so on.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the second bucket, which is more future-looking. It’s still not about the idea that we will have a new world that’s better; it has to be about creating a new paradigm of trust or a new paradigm of interaction. Before the internet, it was not possible to have anonymous communication at all. With the internet, we now have anonymous communication; we have all the problems associated with that, because we have scum, we have fraud, or we have people pretending to be other people, or we have people getting angry, and other problems. Then, we can apply decentralized technology to that. So, we can have pseudonyms on the internet that are not revealing your real-world identity, yet you can still prove something about yourself.</p>
<p>For example, I recently was reading about Gitcoin Grants in Vitalik Buterin’s blog, and he wrote about the recent Gitcoin program they have. Gitcoin is a system where companies come together, and they have a fund that is used to fund some ‘public goods.’ Those are educational programs, or open-source development that benefits the whole industry. The problem that they started having, is that because everything is anonymized, people use their DIDs from their cryptocurrency wallets to identify themselves. Now, they’re seeing SAML attacks, such as one person pretending to be multiple users. SSI can solve this problem, because you can have a completely anonymous DID, but yet you can have several verifiable credentials attached to it that prove your personhood, or prove that you have a social media account, or a phone number, or that you met someone in person, all without revealing your name. In reality, this can go even further; you can have the whole professional identity. So, you can be an anonymous developer, someone like Satoshi, and yet you can prove that here’s your cryptocurrency wallet, and you have money, or you received money from someone. You can prove that you contributed to this code base; you can prove that you have this skill or competency, or that you participated in some public work. So, now you can be anonymous, and this is going to be as efficient as a not-anonymous approach.</p>
<p>To sum it up: the first bucket is about finding economic inefficiencies or customer problems in the world today; in government, in the public sector, in enterprises, or in different economic interactions. For example, for SSI, it’s usually establishing trust: How do I trust that this parking ticket is valid, or is issued by the right person? Or, how do I know that this diploma, issued in another country, can be accepted here in my country? So, we can use SSI in all those problems, because those things can be solved today. It takes time: I need to call the university, I need to get an apostille, I need to spend a lot of money. In fact, I recently went through the problem of notarizing my diploma. I have a diploma from the United States, and I had to present it to German authorities. It cost me 500 euros in total, for shipment and authorization and all different costs. With SSI, this can be done — maybe it should cost one dollar.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the second part, which is thinking about a new paradigm of trust, a new paradigm of social interaction, that can be enabled through decentralized technologies. Now we can have decentralized money, which is uncensorable. We can have decentralized storage, which, at a minimum, is not controlled by Amazon. It can still be based on the Amazon infrastructure, but it’s encrypted and it’s distributed. That means that I can have my data in a decentralized, accessible way. I can have my personal identity, which is anonymous. If I want, I can generate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">zero-knowledge proof</a>, or not disclose some of the parameters or some of the attributes, and I can even have the programmatic governance through decentralized autonomous organizations.</p>
<p>I can have a complete business built in this new paradigm, but from a go-to-market standpoint, realistically, I think it’s still mostly the first part that presents real current market problems. That is huge, because, if we take world GDP and we calculate what percentage of it represents the transaction costs associated with establishing trust; that is, in my opinion, trillions of dollars. So, there’s a lot of work to do there. We have this new market which is completely ‘blue ocean,’ and even hard to predict how deep it can be.</p>
 Supply Chain &amp; Crypto-economics 
<p>Mathieu: I agree; the new paradigm activity is super interesting, and these are topics that I always felt haven’t been figured out yet. Obviously, it’s stuff that, when you build and do more experiments, you start seeing what is newly possible. A nice comparison to that, is that with the rise of the internet, people were trying to send faxes over the internet. You don’t want to redo things the same way; you could do something completely different. I agree with that.</p>
<p>Stepping back, and looking at the first bucket you illustrated; where you’re able to solve the problems today of economic inefficiencies; I think that’s when I got into the crypto, blockchain, decentralized space. With many projects that we worked on or saw, we were trying to use a blockchain or distributed ledger to solve some of these economic inefficiencies. You’ve mentioned supply chains: how could you use a supply chain to lower the cost throughout the chain, to create more transparency or traceability in the supply chain, as well?</p>
<p>We were going after a number of benefits with that. It was interesting, because, since the start of crypto, there’s been this on-and-off trend of people being excited about public blockchains and public crypto. Every now and then, there’s all this excitement about these permissioned or “enterprise-suited” systems. Many of these “enterprise-suited” blockchain systems haven’t really taken off as people would have liked to see them take off. We don’t have to name any specific projects; we all know them.</p>
<p>One of the things we always faced being deep inside of that world, was that if you’re trying to achieve some of the properties that you get from decentralized technology, such as verifiability, or immutability, or traceability; there are different elements to the decentralized stack that need to be deployed. It’s not one solution that fits all. What we saw, is that people are trying to throw everything on the blockchain, but, at that moment, it didn’t really make sense. We always felt like there was a big missing piece, which had to do with credentialing and identity. So, if you want to build a system to achieve some benefits, you’re making a decision to use a private blockchain or consortium environment, because maybe you need performance, or privacy, or whatever the reasons are.</p>
<p>I think that the big piece that we noticed was missing, is this SSI piece. It’s the credentialing piece to it. Another piece that we felt was missing from the enterprise blockchain space, and is a space that you know quite well, is crypto-economics. What’s the point of creating a consortium, when there’s no incentive for people to run these things? That’s where you see a lot of projects die. So, I think it’s clear that verifiable credentials and the SSI stack fit in nicely to this model with these projects, and it fits nicely into public blockchains as well, if you’re using it for specific purposes. How do you view crypto-economics fitting into this whole thing? How does it play with SSI?</p>
<p>Stepan: Yes. Let me address the first part first: In my opinion, I think that I’m not a huge fan of permission blockchains. I think that idea was quickly proven not to work economically. The reason there were still a lot of companies that kept trying, was the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) boom. So, I think it overlapped because there was a lot of excitement about enterprise blockchain. Then, people realized that for several companies, if they have a centralized database with cryptographically signed data, they don’t need blocks; they don’t need this type of complex solution; they only need a way to track authenticated data, and you can do that in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> or <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>. But then, because blockchain was a new technology, not everybody fully understood what it is. As bitcoin was growing and a lot of ICOs popped up, I think that that was a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>I had a few projects that were trying to put coal mines, or gold mines, or oil drilling on the blockchain — that was the permission blockchain, but they had tokens, and they were trying to sell those tokens. I think it doesn’t make sense. I believe that the problem that enterprises are trying to solve, is best addressed by the SSI stack, especially today. I don’t believe that crypto-economic incentives are necessary; I think it’s more about a governance system that is missing. Some of the key areas of innovation for SSI today are actually creating better governance mechanisms that are not economically incentivized, but they are compliant, and they’re transparent. Ideally, they are at least somehow connected to government frameworks; for example, the European Union self-sovereign identity framework.</p>
<p>It’s a good way for enterprises to start using these systems, because it’s not merely blockchain; you have your data off-chain. It’s not as if your competitors can access all your customers’ data. That’s good, but it’s important to think about what Trust over IP is doing, and in general, the governance approach. In other words, how do I trust Issuers or Verifiers, and at the same time, do it in a way that is recognizable by the government or by the legal system? I think <a href="https://northernblock.io/removing-roadblocks-to-ssi-adoption/">it’s important for wider adoption</a>.</p>
<p>The crypto-economics part; that one is necessary when you actually don’t have enterprises. The reason for that, is that you can have superior economic efficiency by removing intermediaries. So, you need crypto-economics to replace intermediaries that are enforcing trust in the system. I can build on the example of professional identity: you can have a centralized university that you pay a hundred thousand dollars. You get your degree, and you get your diploma; it might be a verifiable credential, or a referral credential. At the same time, you can go to Youtube and watch the same lectures. Stanford or Harvard: they have great Youtube channels. You can go and practice, you can do a coding project on GitHub, or meet with someone.</p>
<p>So, the internet allows access to education, and it’s virtually free in a lot of cases. However, you don’t get that degree, that official diploma. We can imagine a system that is, in reality, decentralized, but which can afford you the recognizable educational credentials. For example, if you are a software engineer; you taught yourself, you did a bunch of projects, but then you go on this website, or you have a smart contract. In that event, you have someone who is a Verifier who checks your knowledge. They might run a paired programming session with you and award you with the degree of Software Engineer, Layer Level 3, in TypeScript or something like that. Because the system is prone to fraud — you could collude or bribe that person — we can use crypto-economic mechanisms in order to protect the system. Similar to what OGRE is doing for the prediction market, we could have a staking mechanism. For example, as a verifier, you have a stake of, let’s say, a thousand dollars; you assess different people who come to you, and then this assessment is public. If someone can find that you’ve assessed someone incorrectly, or they think that there was collusion, they can open up a dispute. If this dispute passes, you would have some portion of your deposit removed.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a very rudimentary idea; it has to be tested, it has to be evaluated in the real world because crypto-economics are hard algorithmic economic mechanisms. It’s more about experimentation and iteration than simply creating a great initial idea, but this shows that you can actually have some type of credential that is received through a decentralized mechanism. In that case, you don’t have the intermediary who awards that credential, and in the end, it’s cheaper. So, you can get the same degree or the same credential as a Computer Science Bachelor’s degree, but instead of spending a hundred thousand dollars, maybe you spend a hundred dollars for that assessment.</p>
<p>Mathieu: If you talk about working talent as an example; I totally agree with you. If you have the motivation and the curiosity to learn; if you have access to a computer and to the internet, you could pick up anything. It potentially could lower the value of a university degree, because you could look at this as,” Why am I spending tens of thousands of dollars every year to get this degree? And, when I do get the degree, it proves that you could read, you could write, you could do certain things, but it doesn’t really prove your skills at that point. Whereas, with the internet and access to so many different tools, you could think of an even better micro-transaction-driven skills model. In that model, you could get credentials for smaller things that actually showcase your skillset and suitability for a job, better than if you’re coming at it with a degree. In many cases, it could be: “Okay, it’s cool that you have a degree, but are you actually able to add value to what I’m trying to do?”</p>
<p>If I’m understanding where you’re going here, and going back to one of your comments earlier, there are two approaches. One is that existing institutions and organizations could innovate, and continue to drive down costs and solve economic inefficiencies. But, in your second model, this future-facing new paradigm model, this is where something like crypto-economics is interesting, because you could think of a proper incentive mechanism being put in place that will inherently increase the value of a credential that will come out of an ecosystem.</p>
<p>Stepan: Yes. Maybe to put it in a different format, we can think of different business models. You can get the same results or the same service by different business models. First, it is pipelining a business model, when you have a supplier that fits with a producer, and you have this production chain. At each step, you have some portion of transaction costs that are covering the trust problem, and connecting those different companies in that business model. Something like manufacturing is usually a pipeline business model, and you saw this through economies of scale. So, you build a larger factory, and you have vertical integration, and it works.</p>
<p>What’s happening more and more, especially online, is that we see platform business models. That’s when the platform is not actually producing the product or the service; it’s acting as a facilitator. It connects producers with sellers and with buyers, and the value creation is happening outside the platform. The platform business model is more efficient, because you have a direct relationship between the buyer and the seller. The platform takes a small cut on each transaction, because they provide some guarantee that those sellers are valid or licensed or whatever. If we continue this model, the next step would be a decentralized business model.</p>
<p>That business model is also a peer-to-peer connection, but in that case, the platform is not existent anymore. Instead of a platform, we have a decentralized service. What that does economically, is that the fee that Uber, or the App Store was taking is reduced to the marginal cost of providing or running that smart contract, if it’s a smart contract that connects drivers with a decentralized Uber, as an example.</p>
<p>That model might not make sense for Uber or for other types of business. For example, you wouldn’t build a decentralized steel mill; it wouldn’t work, or it wouldn’t be more efficient than the traditional one. For Uber, it might not be the best example because of a lot of regulation, and it’s still a real-world business. However, it makes sense for anything that is done purely online. Maybe for Uber, an example would be that drivers have their own DIDs, and they have verifiable credentials that prove that they have a car; and its technical status — that it’s operational and working fine. It could include their driving license, their criminal history, Know Your Customer information, and so on. Then, it could be a smart contract; it could be your own chain; it could be a purely SSI system that is working off-chain; you might have multiple user interfaces or apps that allow you, as a passenger, to find the driver. In that system, instead of Uber’s fixed fee, or however much they charge, the marginal cost of each ride can be reduced to, let’s say, half of that, because you only need to essentially fund the gas for that smart contract. Put simply; if it’s an open-source development and maybe a UI or an app that provides a user interface, that might take a small cut. But, it’s definitely much lower than Uber, because it’s a much more competitive market: the protocol and the underlying data are public, and anyone can build an app that uses the same underlying data.</p>
<p>Another way to look at these crypto-economic mechanisms is in terms of how they enable either better service or the same kind of service, but at a lower price through this change of the business model — essentially, through disintermediation.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s super interesting. I’m quite a fan of being able to properly understand the pipe versus platform, the business models, and the differentiations. When you’re starting a business or looking at your own business — and I am — I love some of the writing that Sam Smith has done on the platform business models, as well; it’s all about reducing transaction costs. That leads to more of a network of networks effect, and you’re reducing trust costs; you’re able to leverage each other’s networks. I think for both of us, that is what’s super exciting, and how we’re trying to build the foundation to strive towards that.</p>
 SSI Momentum 
<p>I think it’s clear to say that we see significant momentum in the SSI space. There’s a lot of activity happening; there’s more money going into it. This week, there was an announcement from Microsoft that they’re going to be leveraging ID proofing companies’ technologies in order to then issue a verifiable credential inside of their authenticator app. There are clear efficiencies in that too, and that’s an example of what’s happening right now. What’s your view on the space right now? What’s exciting?</p>
<p>I know there are many projects that you’re familiar with; whether it’s the US Department of Homeland Security, or activity that’s happened through MIT, or the <a href="https://northernblock.io/digital-identity-in-canada/">Canadian government is doing interesting stuff.</a> What’s your view on that space right now?</p>
<p>I’ll add a second question on top of that; who absorbs the cost for these ecosystem solutions?</p>
<p>That’s kind of a big theme. We could go one at a time here, but this is another thought: if you are developing these ecosystem solutions, whether it’s government or private sector. Who’s benefiting from this? Who absorbs the costs? I would love to hear your thinking around that.</p>
<p>Stepan: Yes. I agree that the momentum is picking up. I’ve been involved in the SSI industrial market for about three years at this point, and I think the growth that has been happening in the last three to six months is accelerating. The pandemic was definitely a catalyst for some of those changes. One of the products that we developed is called ‘Safe Travel,’ and it’s something that a lot of companies are doing, but I think we have quite a good momentum. It allows people to travel internationally with digital credentials. The main customers for those, are immigration authorities and airline companies, because they are the first players who demand people to have their vaccination records and pre-departure tests. They are the ones who are losing money, or creating public health problems if people are coming with fraudulent documents. It’s also an operational problem, because, for an airline company, it might take a few minutes to verify paper-based documents. This is especially true if it’s in a foreign language, or from some laboratory that you’re not even sure whether it exists. So, verifiable credentials are solving most of these issues.</p>
<p>I think that more and more countries, over the course of this and the next year, will be demanding digital healthcare documents for international travel. For example, in 2019, there were 1.5 billion people traveling internationally, and many of them were doing this multiple times a year. That means that most of those people, in a couple of years, will be users and customers of verifiable credentials or SSI products, and that is a huge adoption. That will happen much faster than some of the blockchain technologies, because cryptocurrency is probably more popular today, but it won’t be growing as fast. If your bank, and your visa card, and your mobile Fintech app work fine for you, then you don’t really need Bitcoin if you’re not an investor and don’t want to risk too much.</p>
<p>SSI can really grow quickly into every aspect of life. Every time you open a bank account, you’ll be giving a KYC document in the form of a credential. Every time you apply for a job, you will have a resume, or previous working history, or your education. For public credentials, you can have pretty much any kind of government documents, from parking tickets, to business licenses, to customs documents, or healthcare. There are a lot of applications; we could spend a full hour discussing those.</p>
<p>So, the potential is there. I think that things like the desire, and the need to open up international trade and travel, but at the same time doing that safely, are some of the important catalysts to spark this growth. It was happening organically. I remember at the last IIW (Internet Identity Workshop), people were talking about use cases; we need more use cases. Everyone talks about technology, and technology is not as hard. It’s much harder to get the business model right and to get adoption. Now, we see much better solutions to that problem, but it’s obviously still in the early stages.</p>
<p>To address your second point about the costs; in my opinion, it depends, but usually, it’s the Verifier who’s benefiting the most. Therefore, they are the one who is paying for the system, but not always. You can think of the SSI system as a closed system: you have a platform or an application, and you have Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers. In that case, usually, it’s the Verifier who’s paying, but not always. They are getting the most value out of the system in most cases, because it’s an optimization and increasing transparency for their business process.</p>
<p>The second option is to have a network approach, where it’s not necessarily one of those three who’s paying for the system. Rather, it’s a network, and the network of networks of different verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>We’re having a few discussions on this topic at DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation), and we started this group called VC Marketplace. The idea is, how can we design a system that allows different Issuers and Verifiers who are not familiar with each other to participate in the same network. To build on the same example of what Microsoft is doing: let’s say, I’m a bank in Canada, and I want to verify the identity of a new customer. I don’t want to build the system for people to acquire those KYC credentials; in fact, I can accept anything that fits certain criteria. That means that this bank can publish a record in that marketplace, saying that we are paying one dollar to any KYC provider who creates a KYC-VC. Then, as a customer, I go to the marketplace, I choose the one that I like the most out of the list, and they can be part of the same network. They can be all partners of Microsoft, or they can be completely independent companies that have some decision capabilities. They’re not necessarily connected because of the niche, but because of the openness and interoperability of the protocol, this would work. Therefore, there’s no need for direct interactions, and then those marketplaces can be decentralized, and they can also have a reputation system within them.</p>
<p>So, you can have 100 different KYC providers, but as a bank, you can say that I’m only trusting the top 50 because there’s been a lot of issuance and verification, and there’s no problem with that data. As a result, we will probably see the cost of a KYC credential going down. Today, we have companies such as Onfido, who are huge and almost have a monopoly. They can set prices for issuance, even though it costs them nothing. The first time they do KYC, they need to verify, but the second time, it’s almost free for them. They still charge, but as the competition increases and the market becomes more efficient, that would drive the cost of issuance down. That’s one example.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s where, for your verifiable credential marketplace idea, it comes back to governance. You mentioned governance earlier as being one of the areas that perhaps requires a little more innovation, and a little more thinking and investment to allow these types of things to happen. I do agree with you on KYC or ID proofing: it’s logical that as these solutions become more and more commoditized, the price keeps going down. Although, it would be nice to be in that space today, and raise 300 million dollars on a crazy valuation. It will be interesting to see how they adapt as things are changing. From my perspective, a lot of the use cases are compliance-driven today. When you talk about the COVID credentials, or the basic ID credentials such as KYC; it’s all compliance-driven.</p>
<p>The interesting thing once you’ve been able to solve a compliance problem is, “Now, how do I extend that, and how do I start tying this original identity credential to further transactions and create traceability in the value chain?” I think that’s an area where there was innovation, or a lot of trial-and-error that was happening with blockchain. But, that’s where I think that traceability is an issue that, for me, SSI is the solution for that property.</p>
<p>Stepan: Yes, and I think the reason it is starting with compliance is that we need to change the perception of what verifiable credentials are today. For most people, it’s blockchain; it’s some technology that no one understands how it works, but you need to invest in this. From the average corporation standpoint (not an IT corporation), it’s something that we need to do, but we don’t understand. As a bank, it will possibly somehow solve our business problems, but we’re not sure. The problem is that the very public credentials are addressing the notion of trust, and trust is such a basic concept that it’s existed for millennia. When the first item, maybe a document that was signed by the king, or some other type of official document; that was the first trust transmission systems. You had people on horses who were distributing different orders from monarchs, and it was hard to change. Today, most people believe that you can trust information either if it’s nice-looking paper; it has a stamp and a wet signature, or if it’s coming from an official email address.</p>
<p>The notion of a cryptographic signature is a little complicated. If we start with compliance use cases, and if this is accepted by someone big, like a government, or immigration authorities, or banks, that would change this perception. I think what we want to achieve as an industry is this equality between a legally valid document and a verifiable credential. It’s maybe not 100 percent correct, but that’s a good starting point. After that, the main positive property that verifiable credentials have, and also other decentralized technologies such as DeFi (Decentralized Finance), or NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens), or blockchains have, is that you can stack those one on top of another. So, if someone develops an MD5 protocol like Uniswap, because it’s open-source someone else can go and develop a yearn.finance which helps you to be more efficient in providing liquidity. Then, someone can build something on top of that, which makes it easier to work with a specific asset. It’s the same for verifiable credentials, because it’s intrinsically interoperable. Once you have those KYC documents, then you have a scoring of different KYC providers. You can have a different zero knowledge or a partial disclosure system that allows you to, for example, buy alcohol without revealing your name. The stacking property of decentralized technology is, ultimately, what in the long term will be differentiated from centralized KYC or a trusted data records system.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Stepan, I think we could go all day on that subject, and it would be something interesting to discuss in some forum. I want to thank you for doing this today. I think it was quite a deep and very interesting conversation. I really appreciate you sharing your thinking and your opinion on the space, and on all of this stuff. My last question is: when is this Clubhouse session happening? Let’s do something!</p>
<p>Stepan: Great Question! We need to have some active discussions happening, outside of conferences. There’s an IIW (Internet Identity Workshop) conference coming up. That would be a great community event. I’m very interested in organizing, or at least attending, a Clubhouse event on SSI. Moving forward, it could be an even split because SSI is actually quite a big area. There are more nuanced areas that deserve discussion and sharing of expertise.</p>
<p>Mathieu: &nbsp;Yes, I look forward to making that happen. We’ll try to move that forward. Thanks once again for doing this; this was phenomenal.</p>
<p>Stepan: Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Dock’s newest addition to the delegatable credentials feature now allows delegations to be publicly posted and searchable.</p><p>Since announcing our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/delegatable-credentials-now-available/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=more-features-added-to-delegatable-credentials/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=public-delegation-feature-released">delegatable credentials feature</a> in March 2021, the team at Dock has been working diligently to expand its capabilities. As discussed in the initial announcement, the first version of the feature provided the ability for an entity to delegate credential-issuing authority to another entity by issuing a verifiable credential (that serves as the proof of delegation) to the delegatee. In this version delegation was done in a private manner, with the details of delegation reflected only in the credential issued to the delegatee. This meant that, when the delegatee issued verifiable credentials to others on behalf of the delegator, the holders of these new credentials needed to bundle their credentials with the proof of delegation, and present these together when getting their credentials verified.</p><p>Our latest release, which we call Public Delegation, improves upon the existing feature by adding the following capabilities:</p>  Ability for delegators to publicly attest delegations by adding details of delegation to their &nbsp;DID documents on the Dock blockchain  Ability for credential verifiers to search for delegation details publicly posted on DID documents using a crawler  <p>These new capabilities remove the necessity for the credential holders to present the proof of delegation during the verification process, as verifiers can now search for and obtain the publicly posted delegation information.</p><p>To illustrate this in an example, let’s return to the scenario used in our previous delegatable credentials blog post: a government delegates credential-issuing authority to a private testing center, so that the latter can issue professional licenses to the individuals who qualify. With our updated delegatable credentials feature, the government has an option to include the details of the delegation on their <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/concepts_did.html">DID document</a> (which is publicly stored on the Dock network and describes the government’s decentralized identity (DID) on Dock) instead of issuing a verifiable credential (proof of delegation) to the testing center.</p><p>If the government does post the delegation details to the DID document, once the testing center issues verifiable credentials to the individuals who qualify, the holders of these new credentials no longer need to manage and present the proof of delegation as part of the verification process. Instead, the verifier can use the new crawler feature (which we call the “Curious Agent”) in our SDK to automatically seek out and fetch any delegation information on the DID documents associated with the credentials being verified, and determine whether the testing center has the proper authority to issue the credential on the government’s behalf. The result is a simplified credential management and verification experience.</p><p>You can learn more about the public delegation feature by reading our <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/concepts_public_delegation.html">concepts document</a> and <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/tutorial_public_delegation.html">tutorial</a>.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/fisher">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>What is left to say about PAM that has not already been said? Well in my opinion, quite a lot – as I hope you find out when you join me at the forthcoming KCLive Event, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2021/04/operationalizing-privileged-access-management" title="Operationalizing Privileged Access Management">Operationalizing Privileged Access Management.</a></p>
<p>I talk to PAM vendors all the time and I believe it is a truly exciting space to be covering and some of the innovations that vendors of all sizes are bringing to the table promise real progress in how we manage privilege access in the workplace – and, as you will discover, beyond the workplace.&nbsp;</p>
 Punching above its weight 
<p>PAM is not by a long chalk the biggest revenue earner in Access Management, but it punches above its weight in contributing to security and governance, and that’s why new vendors are entering the market and private investors are getting more involved. Already this year we have seen the merger of two of the biggest players in the market, Thycotic and Centrify, who hope to piggyback on each other’s strengths to build a super player to take on the current market leader CyberArk. When I spoke to senior people at Thycotic recently they were bullish and excited about the coming together of the two entities which will have solutions for both SMBs and enterprise. We look forward to developments there and its impact on the market.</p>
 Capital investment into identity 
<p>But private money flowing into the market has been accompanied by movement within the industry as CyberArk, for example, after acquiring iDaptive in 2020 is now heavily trailing its expertise in “Identity Security” in its marketing? At the same time, Okta has added PAM capability to its Identity Management toolkit. Is this a trend, how will it affect traditional PAM? I will be providing some answers at KC Live.</p>
<p>I will also be looking at the impact events and trends are having on PAM, not the least of which was the pandemic and the shift to remote working. The impact of working from home is something we have been talking about a lot recently, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/wfh-trends-2021" title="including this podcast">including this podcast</a> with my KuppingerCole colleagues, Matthias Reinwarth and Annie Bailey.</p>
<p>I am sure that many remote endpoints are now better protected than they were 12 months ago – but you can also find out why EPM must now be accompanied by Remote Privileged Access (RPA) – which is the same but different.</p>
 Millennial focused tech is influencing PAM 
<p>The influence of consumer tech and millennial choice is having an impact in enterprise IT and perhaps a little belatedly PAM is catching up. We are seeing much improved UX and UI designs from vendors with button and menus replacing CLI and clunky windows. This had to happen. Such is the need for PAM across the enterprise that we need ordinary users to be able to do some of the management tasks normally reserved for admins (under pressure to perform too many tasks). I will bring you up to date on this and other PAM product developments at the KCLive Event. And don’t worry, I will of course talk a little about DevOps! I am looking forward to meeting you on the day.</p>

 “Just setting up my&nbsp;twttr”   Jack Patrick Dorsey, first tweet in Twitter,&nbsp;2006  <p>Fifteen years ago, Twitter Co-Founder Jack Dorsey posted the very first tweet (beginning of “tweet”) on Twitter. This famous tweet was converted into a non-replaceable owner’s certificate token (NFT — Non-Fungible Token) which was auctioned for about 2.9 million dollars (about 3.27 billion won). It is not known whether this is an artistic act or a new form of digital ownership, but people have realized that NFTs could be a new opportunity.</p><p>With the recent rise of bitcoin in 2021, the blockchain market has become the spotlight. The need for the blockchain industry and ecosystem is expanding. Here, the ecosystem refers to a group of blockchain networks in which several companies gather a common service rather than a single&nbsp;company.</p><p>As the number of cryptocurrency projects gradually increase, ecosystems are beginning to take shape in new forms such as DTT, DID, and NFT, depending on the use of the service, but realistically dynamic services performed on one consortium blockchain is difficult to migrate to other blockchain platforms.</p><p>Currently, the most widely used blockchain platform for issuing NFT is Ethereum. When issuing NFTs through an open blockchain such as Ethereum, uniqueness is guaranteed to be decentralized. If so, will Ethereum be enough? The biggest problem with Ethereum is the gas fee. The price of Ethereum is currently over $2,400. In addition, the limitations of the network’s scalability led to an increase in gas&nbsp;prices.</p><p>Ethereum Gas Price these&nbsp;days</p><p>Of course, there are also NFTs issued through closed (permitted) blockchains. The closed blockchain is managed by a reliable central authority. We are then left to believe in the institutions and expect them to manage our assets responsibly. To solve this problem, the consortium chain, which is disconnected from the main network, guarantees data integrity through anchoring, but the data in the consortium chain is not transparent to everyone, thus subject to opaque/incomplete blockchain that includes the possibility of manipulation.</p><p>Aergo has conducted research to solve this problem through an ingenious method called the Merkle&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-aergo-merkle-bridge-explained-d95f7dcec510">Merkle Bridge A convenient way of bridging side chains for state-Merkelized blockchains.</a></p><p>The Merkle Bridge enables the movement of data-proven assets through merkle tree proof while maintaining the loosely-coupled state between chains. Merkle Bridge is more flexible than Plasma, more secure and decentralized than using a&nbsp;broker.</p><p>Aergo-Aergo Merkle&nbsp;Bridge</p><p>Our partner Blocko has previously created Merkle Bridge and is in the process of rebuilding on the test network so that it can be used for future NFTs. Various data from Aergo Enterprise, including DTT, are expected to be transmitted to and utilized by Aergo Mainnet and cross-species public blockchains through the new Merkle Bridge. Recently, with the 2.2.8 patch, AERGO-AERGO Merkle Bridge has completed the task to pass AERGO&nbsp;tokens.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/releases/tag/v2.2.8">https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/releases/tag/v2.2.8</a></p><p>Aergo Merkle Bridge featuring NFT</p><p>Merkle Bridge can be used not only for Tokens but also for information exchange. Information such as DID and TSA can be moved or utilized between heterogeneous networks. This can be seen as a kind of Smart Oracle between networks. We will be able to transfer important assets normally stored in Ethereum to the Aergo network and use them for day trading at low fees. In addition, NFTs issued by various central institutions on its own blockchain network, can also be transferred to ‘user owned’ wallets on the Aergo Network or Ethereum using Merkle&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p>Aergo is exploring various business opportunities, including NFT. In the future, businesses may enjoy Aergo Inter-Blockchain Communication service by using Merkle Bridge to deliver NFT or TSA information issued by the sidechain to the main&nbsp;network.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-merkle-bridge-what-else-is-needed-for-nft-c5170502da3a">Aergo Merkle Bridge: What else is needed for NFT?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>For the first time, a US national privacy law looks&nbsp;likely—and soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s been&nbsp;serious&nbsp;movement from both sides&nbsp;of the political divide, and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">strong and increasing action from some states</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US has&nbsp;long&nbsp;been lagging behind the rest of the world&nbsp;in this.&nbsp;It’s one of the only major global economies without&nbsp;strong&nbsp;national privacy laws&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">akin to the GDPR</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It almost goes without saying now that privacy laws are essential for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/reasons-why-privacy-rights-are-important/">many reasons</a>&nbsp;not least of which is that in an increasingly digitized world, businesses simply must be better stewards of the vast volumes of users’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>, to uphold the fundamental human right to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;and to protect users from harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For consumers, the delay&nbsp;in getting a national law&nbsp;has not been for want of trying. They’ve&nbsp;long been&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">calling for change</a>&nbsp;to how companies treat their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;In 2019,&nbsp;Pew Research&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Pew-Research-Center_PI_2019.11.15_Privacy_FINAL.pdf">75 percent</a>&nbsp;of consumers want more privacy online.&nbsp;A US national privacy law is no longer about&nbsp;if&nbsp;but&nbsp;when.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having a&nbsp;national privacy law would&nbsp;not only bring the US more into line with most other major economies it would&nbsp;establish&nbsp;a uniform set of data privacy rights for consumers and a single set of rules for business.&nbsp;While&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">state-level action</a>&nbsp;is applaudable—California and Virginia now have comprehensive privacy laws and we’re watching&nbsp;several&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">other states</a>&nbsp;with interest—only a federal law could offer blanket&nbsp;data protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commentators on this issue are feeling optimistic, particularly&nbsp;this year,&nbsp;because&nbsp;from the&nbsp;plethora of federal privacy bills&nbsp;put forward, there are&nbsp;three standouts:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/COPRA%20Bill%20Text.pdf">Consumer&nbsp;Online&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;Rights&nbsp;Act</a>&nbsp;(COPRA)&nbsp;(Democrats)&nbsp;–&nbsp;Sponsored&nbsp;in November 2019 by Democratic Senator&nbsp;Maria Cantwell of Washington,&nbsp;this bill&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433">considered by some</a>&nbsp;to be&nbsp;“GDPR-esque”&nbsp;and more consumer than business friendly.&nbsp;The bill requires&nbsp;“entities that process or transfer a consumer’s data to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  make their privacy policy publicly available and provide an individual with access to their personal&nbsp;data;&nbsp;  delete or correct, upon request, information in an individual’s&nbsp;data;&nbsp;  export, upon request, an individual’s data in a human-readable and machine-readable&nbsp;format;&nbsp;  establish data security practices to protect the confidentiality and accessibility of consumer data; and&nbsp;  designate a privacy officer and a data security officer to implement and conduct privacy and data security programs and risk assessments.”&nbsp;  



<p>The bill will also stop those entities from:&nbsp;</p>



  “engaging in deceptive or harmful data&nbsp;practices;&nbsp;  transferring an individual’s data to a third party if the individual&nbsp;objects;&nbsp;  processing or transferring an individual’s sensitive data without affirmative express&nbsp;consent;&nbsp;  processing or transferring data beyond what is reasonably necessary or for which they have obtained affirmative express&nbsp;consent;&nbsp;  processing or transferring data on the basis of specified protected characteristics (e.g., race, religion, or gender);&nbsp;  conditioning the provision of a service or product on an individual’s agreement to waive their privacy rights; and&nbsp;  retaliating against an employee who provides information about a potential violation of the bill’s provisions, or who testifies or assists in an investigation or judicial proceeding concerning such a violation.”&nbsp;  



<p>If this bill succeeds, it&nbsp;would&nbsp;require the Federal Trade Commission&nbsp;to&nbsp;establish a new bureau to&nbsp;help enforce the provisions.&nbsp;Read what the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/sen-cantwell-leads-new-consumer-data-privacy-bill">EFF has to say about COPRA</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Setting an American Framework to Ensure Data Access, Transparency and Accountable Ability Act (<a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/BD190421-F67C-4E37-A25E-5D522B1053C7">SAFE DATA&nbsp;Act</a>) (GOP)&nbsp;– Combining three previous bills, the SAFE DATA&nbsp;Act&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433">considered by some</a>&nbsp;as more “business friendly”. It is&nbsp;well summarized in&nbsp;<a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/10/what-tech-companies-need-to-know-about-the-safe-data-act/">this article</a>&nbsp;from Security Boulevard:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This law&nbsp;would expand what’s considered sensitive data and include enacting data security standards to accompany data privacy standards. It would create rights to transparency, access, deletion, correction, and portability and require opt-in consent to process or transfer “sensitive covered data.” Under this law, businesses would need to name privacy and data security officers within their firms and meet “reasonable” and “appropriate” data security requirements&nbsp;…&nbsp;This bill introduces an algorithmic ranking system to determine how content can be presented to consumers. It also establishes regulations for the “manipulation of user interfaces”, which prevents deceptive UIs from coercing customers into giving up personal data.&nbsp;The SAFE DATA Act would be enforced by the FTC and state attorney’s general, take precedence over state privacy laws, such as CCPA, and would not include a private right of action.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAPP provides this handy infographic&nbsp;to show the combining of three bills into&nbsp;the&nbsp;SAFE&nbsp;DATA Act:&nbsp;</p>











<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/consolidating-u-s-privacy-legislation-the-safe-data-act/">IAPP</a>.&nbsp;Read what the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/consolidating-u-s-privacy-legislation-the-safe-data-act/">IAPP says about the SAFE DATA&nbsp;Act</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://delbene.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2740">Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Re-introduced by&nbsp;Congresswoman Suzan DelBene (WA-01)&nbsp;for the fourth time (the latest&nbsp;on March 10, 2021),&nbsp;<a href="https://delbene.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2740">this bill</a>&nbsp;“…&nbsp;protects personal information including data relating to financial, health, genetic, biometric, geolocation, sexual orientation, citizenship and immigration status, Social Security Numbers, and religious beliefs. It also keeps information about children under 13 years of age safe.”Beyond this it requires businesses to write their privacy policies in simple language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DelBene’s&nbsp;<a href="https://delbene.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2740">outlines the&nbsp;key elements</a>&nbsp;of the Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act&nbsp;as:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Plain English: Requires companies to provide their privacy policies in “plain English” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Opt-in: Allows users to “opt-in” before companies can use their most sensitive private information in&nbsp;ways&nbsp;they might not expect&nbsp;</p>



<p>Disclosure: Increases transparency by requiring companies to disclose if and with whom their personal information will be shared and the purpose of sharing the information&nbsp;</p>



<p>Preemption: Creates a unified national standard and avoids a patchwork of different privacy standards by preempting conflicting state laws&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enforcement: Gives the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) strong rulemaking authority to keep up with evolving digital trends and the ability to fine bad actors on the first offense. Empowers state attorneys general to also pursue violations if the FTC chooses not to act&nbsp;</p>



<p>Audits: Establishes strong “privacy hygiene” by requiring companies to submit privacy audits every 2 years from a neutral third party.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Enforced by the FTC, this bill also requires the FTC to&nbsp;hire 500 additional&nbsp;staff&nbsp;to&nbsp;focus on privacy and data security issues, 50 with technical expertise in the area, plus for the FTC to receive $350 million to implement the plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If enacted,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.databreachtoday.com/federal-privacy-bill-reintroduced-in-congress-a-16178">Omer&nbsp;Tene, VP of the IAPP</a>, says: “This will place the FTC at the forefront of the global regulatory effort to implement data protection laws and develop privacy policies.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What would consumers get out of a national privacy law?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We agree with this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433">commentator’s&nbsp;</a>perspective on what a US national privacy law will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433">need to offer</a>&nbsp;consumers:&nbsp;</p>



  Capacity to opt out of forming long-term relationships with companies for one-off transactions&nbsp;  Freedom from needing to choose services and providers based on location, especially if a US national law works in with the GDPR&nbsp;  New ways to engage with business for those willing to give companies access to their data (new business models emerging from this leveraging of personal information).&nbsp;  



<p>When we forecast where&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">privacy&nbsp;will be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the next&nbsp;10 years</a>, we said that we believe by 2030 “opt out” won’t mean “miss out” and big tech will have abandoned the mantra that if you are not charged for the product, you are the product.&nbsp;We foresaw&nbsp;the regulatory environment supporting&nbsp;these changes,&nbsp;with&nbsp;consumers demanding&nbsp;to have their data collected but forgotten and&nbsp;legislation making this possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, we’re really seeing some&nbsp;evolution in this space.&nbsp;Let’s see how much longer this takes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get a lot of feedback from the wider community. One of the most common complaints, especially from crypto day traders, is that we do not do enough marketing.</p><p>I call bullshit.</p><p>I don’t tend to cuss, but marketing before your product is available is a recipe for disaster. Holo is not a hype company, we are in this for the long haul. We are a real enterprise doing the work to build and deliver the infrastructure and applications that will power a distributed hosting platform for peer-to-peer applications. This may not sound electrifying, but it does address a real need because blockchains cannot get it all done. Some of the benefits of blockchains such as the supposed decentralisation, transparency of transactions, and the data integrity provided by the validated transactions are not worth the energy costs involved. We know this because of the gap between promises and what has been delivered to the larger world. While the business world has taken note of blockchain because of the hype, it will not get all the innovation value in the long term simply because blockchains are not efficient.</p><p>So back to the marketing. Holo has an adoption strategy which is a long term proposition. When companies like Microsoft and Amazon (yes the behemoth that many of you hope that we can eventually topple) lost the vast majority of their value after the dot-com bust — they did not go under. That is because they had focus and flexibility. They knew that what they were building had real demand and real potential. They along with other notable organisations, like StubHub who incorporated in the month prior to the first crash in 2000, succeeded not because of their marketing spend but because they focused on the real needs of their customers. The companies that played into the hype and spent millions on marketing campaigns and splashy parties are the ones who disappeared. These companies wasted their resources before they had a product and they&nbsp;failed.</p><p>I want to talk a bit about the global market adoption strategy for Holo&nbsp;now.</p><p>It’s all about Holochain.</p><p>Holo is a marketplace for hosting Holochain applications. Nothing matters more for Holo’s success than people learning how to build and then building Holochain applications that can and will be hosted on Holo. So here is what we will be doing to build long term&nbsp;success:</p>  Contracting one of the best Security Review teams in the world to provide the security audit of Holochain and Holo technology  Ensuring that when we go live, US customers can purchase HOT at exchanges so they can participate in the Holo ecosystem  Providing self-service access to developer materials, such as API documentation  Delivering developer resources and programs that are available 24x7  Supplying a lot of sample code that’s simple to try&nbsp;out  Providing quality tech support (specific to developer issues) with quick turnaround  <p>What we have been doing these past months while we’ve been quiet about our adoption strategy, is working to build out our foundations. We’ve outlined plans for content, completed developer segmentation analysis, defined developer journeys and value propositions, set ourselves up to be in a continuous learning process through analytics and user research and we’ve also built up a cohesive core community. Moving into full binary releases for Holochain will mean more content, more meetups, more dev camps, more programs, more videos, more clear community guidelines, and more tools, all of which will directly lead to growing the capacity for developers to build&nbsp;apps.</p><p>In the coming weeks and months we have announcements planned that will touch aspects of our websites, educational programs, and online communities. We have plans for hosts, developers and the end users of peer-to-peer apps. We are also going to promote and support the accomplishments of the projects building on Holochain. And when the time comes we will promote the learning programs and the projects that will catalyse the foundations and infrastructure of the entire ecosystem. We have strategies for global PR and for localised community growth. We will walk before we run. We will learn from the programs we launch and we will automate for scale when the programs are hugely successful.</p><p>To reiterate… we won’t be shilling, promoting or otherwise marketing our token, and if you ever see anyone using our name or logo to do so, be aware of them as scammers and report&nbsp;them.</p><p>That sums it up. <br>Look for a few updates and announcements later this&nbsp;week.</p><p>Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/no-hype-holos-global-adoption-strategy-f845cf563bdf">No-Hype: Holo’s Global Adoption Strategy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What if any GlobaliD Group could launch their own branded debit card in a matter of&nbsp;minutes?</p><p>Maybe you’re a small business developing a rewards program. Maybe you’re a content creator or influencer looking for new ways to connect with fans. Maybe you’re a charity looking to give people a passive way to contribute through their spending.</p><p>And there will be countless compelling use cases none of us have yet thought&nbsp;of.</p><p>For GlobaliD, the vision of Instant Issuance is that anyone can create a Group, connect a wallet to that Group, and issue a branded payments card to Group&nbsp;members.</p><p>With the launch of <a href="https://aptopayments.com/instant-issuance/">Apto’s Instant Card Issuance platform</a>, we’re one step closer to that&nbsp;vision.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1384636232303398916">Greg Kidd</a>, co-founder of Apto Payments, co-founder and CEO of GlobaliD:</p><blockquote>Congrats to Apto Payments for bringing Instant Issuance of payment cards to market. This empowers developers for issuing cards the same way that Stripe empowered developers a decade ago for accepting cards. Super powerful.</blockquote><p>From <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apto-payments-launches-instant-issuance-platform-301272296.html">the announcement</a>:</p><blockquote>Apto Payments, a next-generation cards and payments company, today announced the launch of its <a href="https://aptopayments.com/instant-issuance/">Instant Issuance platform</a>, a self-serve, developer platform that allows companies, merchants, financial institutions, and businesses of all sizes and industries to issue debit cards. With Instant Issuance, card programs for challenger banks, employee payroll, rewards and loyalty programs, and many other use cases can be built with just a few hours of development.</blockquote><blockquote>Designed with developers in mind, the Instant Issuance platform offers a frictionless, self-serve experience that allows companies to quickly bring their card programs to market. While card issuance is often a slow and complex process, Apto’s Instant Issuance platform allows developers to start working in sandbox within minutes. The platform also makes it seamless and easy to switch from development to production, customize cards, onboard users, and track sign-ups and revenue. Going from sign-up to having physical cards in the hands of users can happen in as little as a&nbsp;week.</blockquote><p>Meg Nakamura, co-founder and CEO of Apto Payments:</p><blockquote>“Historically, card issuance has required immense time and resources just to establish relationships with the requisite players, deal with compliance hurdles, and, finally, initiate the program. At Apto, we believe card issuance is overdue for an update.

<p>Over 4,000 developers use <a href="https://usedevbook.com/">Devbook</a> to make them more productive.</p><p>Learn how Devbook chose Magic to onboard users with the least amount of friction possible and achieved over 90% conversion rate.</p> In search of a seamless auth&nbsp;solution <p>Devbook is a search engine, purpose-built for developers. With keyboard shortcuts, you can easily search Stack Overflow and documentation directly without leaving your IDE (integrated development environment). It works similar to Spotlight on&nbsp;macOS.</p><p>The idea for Devbook came from the two co-founders’ own pain points. As developers themselves, Vasek Mlejnsky and Tomas Valenta realized they spent more and more time searching for answers to questions on Google or in 3rd party tools. Context switching from code to browser slowed them down, and they became inspired to solve this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>When Vasek was considering authentication, the team was already migrating away from Firebase completely, after deciding not to use their functions and database. The challenge was to find the right authentication service that felt as intuitive to implement and use, particularly as their users are time-strapped developers.</p><blockquote>“From the start, we knew it would be a bad idea to build auth from scratch. We didn’t have several weeks to spend only on that. There are so many possible security headaches, and we’re not security engineers.”</blockquote><p>Rolling their own authentication system was never considered an option. The rationale? Time and speed. The sheer number of weeks and cycles that would have been spent on auth and security was too high an opportunity cost for their lean&nbsp;team.</p><p>In the beginning, Vasek explored Okta and Auth0 and came to the same conclusion: both options felt geared towards enterprises and were not a good fit for a small, fast-growing startup. From pricing to complex documentation, neither felt like friendly solutions that could scale with the hypergrowth they were aiming&nbsp;for.</p><p>With auth, their top priorities were&nbsp;to:</p>  Drive user activation  Offer a great onboarding experience (especially important for a desktop&nbsp;app)  Avoid vendor&nbsp;lock-in   Enter Magic <p>When Vasek discovered Magic, he immediately saw the benefits of passwordless login. The technology stood out as “forward-thinking”, leveraging blockchain-based, public-private key cryptography rather than traditional user-set credentials.</p><blockquote>“Magic was exciting! We wanted to try out something new, something that feels like the app we are developing comes from the&nbsp;future.”</blockquote><p>In just a matter of days, the Devbook team made the switch and successfully implemented Magic auth by following the simple, straightforward <a href="https://docs.magic.link/">docs</a>.</p><p>See the end-to-end onboarding experience below — better yet, download Devbook <a href="https://usedevbook.com/">here</a> and try out the product for&nbsp;free.</p> Significant boost to conversion <p>The results far exceeded Vasek’s expectations. Since launch, conversion rate has surpassed 90% with no signs of slowing down. Users have shared overwhelmingly positive feedback.</p><blockquote>“We’ve been asking users how much they like the passwordless login and so far literally 100% of those we asked like it a&nbsp;lot!”</blockquote><p>With Magic, the Devbook team saved valuable time and bandwidth, freeing up focus for them to be more ambitious with their plans to rapidly iterate on the core product. Perhaps most importantly, their users — developers of all levels, from beginners to advanced — are enthusiastic about the ability to log in seamlessly without needing passwords.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-devbook-switched-from-firebase-auth-to-maximize-conversion-rate-with-magic-58faa7bc3f6a">How Devbook switched from Firebase Auth to maximize conversion rate with Magic</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Over the past number of years, and particularly last year with the rise of DeFi, Ethereum’s network has been inefficient and troublesome for users to work with. This has been true in the world of tokenized securities, and also for others in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we recently partnered with Polygon, the layer 2 protocol building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. This partnership will accelerate the adoption of security tokens and open new business models for industry actors.</p>
<p>Here are five key reasons why we partnered with Polygon and what it means for the ecosystem:</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 1. Cheaper 
<p>The transaction fees are 10000 times cheaper on Polygon compared to Ethereum.</p>

		 
	 
                               
	 
		 
			 2. Faster 
<p>The transaction speed on Polygon is &lt;5 sec which is very quick compared to Ethereum, where users need to wait for &gt;1 min most of the time.</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			 3. Scalable 
<p>Polygon is scalable, capable of &gt;10k tx/s per sidechain, and is able to use multiple side chains to multiply the maximum throughput while Ethereum is currently limited to 15tx/s.</p>

		 
	 
                               
	 
		 
			 4. Easy-to-use 
<p>Users can still use Metamask and other Ethereum wallets, they just need to switch the network to Polygon.</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			 5. Interoperable 
<p>Polygon is based on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), which means that it leverages the security of Ethereum and everything that was developed to work with the Ethereum blockchain is 100% compatible with the Polygon network, including ONCHAINID.</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			<p>As a result of the partnership we recommend Polygon’s Ethereum layer 2 solution to security token issuers. Our customers can now benefit from the security of Ethereum’s decentralized network whilst executing token transfers in under 3 seconds and for 1 cent.</p>

		 
	 
          
	 
		 
			 Compliant securities transfers and management on Polygon 

		 
	 
      &lt; 3 seconds / transaction         &lt; $0.01 / transaction         Secured by 91 validators and 6,000+ nodes

Then the carbon is published for sale to carbon buyers, thus generating income for the&nbsp;farmers.</p><p>Farmers will now also be able to publish their carbon data for sale on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a>. Carbon datapools become an additional source of income for farmers working with DOVU, on top of their carbon sales, and provide valuable insight to researchers or the industry into carbon farming practices. The collaboration expands the list of potential data sources on Ocean Market, an open-source community marketplace for&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>We’re pleased to welcome this new stream of data to Ocean Market. By bringing carbon data from DOVU farmers onto Ocean Market, Ocean Protocol continues its mission to bring data sovereignty to the world — in this case, to agriculture. DOVU data has utility for both research and industry to gain insights into agricultural practices and its impact on the environment. Ocean Protocol will allow for AI models to train on the data in a privacy-preserving manner.</blockquote><blockquote>Sheridan Johns, Head of Ecosystem at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Ocean Protocol will also be leveraging the DOVU Carbon Offset Platform to give the Ocean community insights as to how they can reduce their carbon footprint.</p><blockquote>As DOVU sources its own carbon supply the collection of data from our carbon suppliers is essential. This partnership will be welcomed by our farmers as a new source of revenue as well as our carbon buyers as it provides more visibility and therefore increases trust in the process. We also look forward to integrating the DOVU Carbon Offset solution within Ocean Protocol, offering all participants an opportunity to reduce their environmental impact.</blockquote><blockquote>Irfon Watkins, Founder of&nbsp;DOVU</blockquote><p>DOVU’s mission is to incentivize users to carbon offset their lives by capturing and rewarding value.

 Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs — Nuclear Disarmament <p>Earlier, we saw what are <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a> (ZKPs) and the critical role they play in giving the necessary information without revealing the exact&nbsp;data.</p><p>In this article, let’s explore some futuristic possibilities of ZKP implementation.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how ZKPs can be used in nuclear disarmament?</p> Nuclear Weapons and their&nbsp;Danger <p>Nuclear weapons are undoubtedly one of the most dangerous weapons in the world as they have the potential to wipe out life from a vast area within no time. Hiroshima and Nagasaki are classic examples of the scale of destruction that’s possible.</p><p>Since World War II, many countries have built nuclear weapons to protect themselves and to display their growing might on the world stage. Since this poses a threat to international peace and stability, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was formulated.</p><p>This treaty has been signed by 189 countries (out of 197 countries) and has three main pillars — nonproliferation, disarmament, and peaceful use of nuclear technology.</p><p>Out of these, disarmament is the most contentious one, and let’s see if ZKPs can be a remedy for&nbsp;it.</p> How can ZKPs Help with Nuclear Disarmament? <p>The first and the most common question that comes up in this discussion is how <a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-not-nuclear-disarmament">compliance with existing nuclear treaties can be verified</a>. An unofficial solution has been to check whether a nuclear-armed country is moving beyond the limits imposed by the treaty militarily. In particular, you’d want to know more about the nuclear head, its design, destruction capability, and exact location.</p><p>Now, how can you check this? One way is to ask this question to the head of the state of the country that’s planning this nuclear move. However, as you may expect, the chances of getting a direct answer are slim given the secrecy of these military operations.</p><p>You may argue that the other option is to send a crew of independent auditors to check, but the chances for them to come back alive is, let’s say&nbsp;minimal.</p><p>In such difficult circumstances, ZKPs can be the answer as they can give information about the nuclear warheads without revealing the actual design, which is often a closed secret. Essentially, zero-knowledge proofs can provide sufficient information to help a verifier decide whether two objects are the same without revealing their actual design or composition.</p><p>This idea is based on a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27649477/">breakthrough research</a> by researchers at the Princeton University, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering where they use binary assertions to validate the similarity of two physical&nbsp;objects.</p><p>Extending it to nuclear warheads, you can know if the design of a nuclear warhead has been changed or not without knowing the exact design, which is, of course, a matter of national security and could have serious ramifications if it gets into the wrong hands. Nuclear warheads are the key part of a nuclear weapon and it contains secret information about the destination, potency, and other details that give one country an edge over another in the event of a&nbsp;war.</p><p>Moving on to how ZKPs can be used in nuclear disarmament, Areg Danagoulian, an MIT Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering, has <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/laboratory-nuclear-security-and-policy-receives-32-million-nuclear-warhead-verification-1126">proposed</a> a way to probe using gamma rays and isotope-sensitive resonant processes that can be used to understand the internal structure of the nuclear bomb including the isotope mix and its shape. He and his team are exploring the possibility of using Zero Knowledge Proof to understand changes made to the nuclear&nbsp;warhead.</p><p>Essentially, the secret nuclear head data is transformed into a long value by encrypting them with a huge number, which is the key. The resulting data is indecipherable and only contains a long set of values that makes no sense to anyone seeing it. However, this long value changes when the data in the nuclear warhead&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Le’s say, for example, the nuclear warhead’s data on Jan 1, 2020, was fsdkfjafjajfkadjfklsfoery89ry913417918–18-e8970r369r6-aksalkndsandjadsfsdfgsgo2y23y130293=ejfkdjflkjf.</p><p>On June 28, 2020, it was jfhwoefhohffo0103910913–03msndfkflkefuerqurpwoq;wmddnfjkfhdnvmdfjfhjfhqo9urpdfa,fmdsmaksdmaksdmaiirpqoe</p><p>Though both the values are gibberish, it’s enough to know that the values are changed, so the design of the warhead has changed too. This is an example of the ZKP that only tells you what you need to&nbsp;know.</p><p>Under the terms of the treaty, every country is assigned a random cryptographic key that encrypts the information from the nuclear warhead at random intervals and sends it to a global Distributed Ledger Technology where every country is an entity. This way, the other countries can know that the nuclear warhead has changed and could take the agreed measures accordingly.</p><p>It’s important to note that these are possible theories and can become a reality when nuclear treaties provide a way to implement these ZKPs. But there’s hope that ZKPs are possibly the closest that we can come to living in a nuke-impact-free world.</p><p>Maybe a futuristic opportunity for your consideration?</p><p>In the meanwhile, to get a hands-on feel of what zero knowledge proofs and how to use them in your way, join our <a href="https://affinidipocathon.devpost.com/">PoCathon</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-2-nuclear-disarmament-abb5c879a7c5">Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs — Part 2: Nuclear Disarmament</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Quick Guide On OWallet Backup &amp;&nbsp;Recovery <p>This guide should help you get through backing up and recovering your wallet originally created with <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet</a>. Guide was prepared by your Telegram admin &amp; Ontology Harbinger <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Dumont</a>.</p> OWallet backup&nbsp;options <p>Before you create your first wallet address, you will be asked to select folder to store your keystore.db file. This file is a database of your private and public keys and can also help you to recover your wallets. However, it is not best option to use as primary&nbsp;backup.</p><p>Once you create new wallet, you will be asked to save your keystore&nbsp;.dat file, which by default, has same name as your wallet. For example, if your wallet name is Jack, the&nbsp;.dat file will be jack.dat. This file contains your wallet’s private key encrypted with password. To use it as a backup, you also need to remember or save the original password. If you have your&nbsp;.dat file, but do not remember the password, you will not be able to recover your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>In addition, you can also save your private key in WIF format. This is a good option to store it as a recovery backup, because you don’t need to remember any additional passwords. The private key grants full access to the wallet, therefore, store it in a safe place and never share it with&nbsp;anyone!</p> How to restore the wallet if I have one of the above&nbsp;backups? <p>In case you have your keystore.db file, all you need to do is to click on settings in the lower left corner and change the keystore path to the folder where your file is located. This will load your wallet addresses protected with original passwords.</p><p>In case you have your&nbsp;.dat file backup, navigate to Wallets/Individual Wallet/Import wallet/Keystore (.dat). Here, set a new name for wallet, select&nbsp;.dat file and set original password to decrypt your&nbsp;.dat file. This option will import your wallet protected with the original password.</p><p>In case you have a private key as a backup of your wallet, navigate to Wallets/Individual Wallet/Import wallet/Private key (WIF). Here, set a new name for wallet, type in your WIF private key and set a new password.</p><p>Other import options, such as mnemonic phrases or private keys (64 Hex) serve for importing wallets created elsewhere. For instance, you can use mnemonic phrase to import wallet originally created in&nbsp;<a href="http://onto.app">ONTO</a>.</p> That’s it! <p>Warning! Keep all your backups in a safe place. Never provide it to anyone, because who owns your backups has full control over your wallet. Anyone who asks for your backup details is SCAM. Stay&nbsp;safe!</p><p>If you have any questions, or to report missing or wrong content, or if you want to tip my wallet to buy me a cup of coffee, please reach me on <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Twitter.</a> See&nbsp;you!</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

<p>Sevgili Ontolojistlere nihai stake etme kılavuzuna hoş geldiniz! Bu makale, başarılı bir stake etme deneyimine giden yolda ilerlemeniz için tüm stake etme sorularınıza cevap bulabileceğiniz bir yer olarak hizmet etmelidir. Bu makale, Telegram yöneticiniz ve Ontology Harbinger Dumont tarafından hazırlanmıştır ve yaşayan bir belge olarak düşünülmelidir, bu nedenle her zaman günceldir.</p> Bölüm 1:&nbsp;Teori  1.1) Stake&nbsp;nedir? <p>Staking, tokenlerinizi düğüme devretme işlemidir. Basitçe söylemek gerekirse, ONG ödülleri kazanmak için ONT jetonlarınızı kilitlediğiniz süreçtir. Stake edilmiş ONT tokenlerinizi asla kaybetmeyeceksiniz, çünkü node’lar stake edilmiş tokenları hiçbir zaman tutmaz veya yönetmez. Tek risk, aktif tüccarlar veya kısa vadeli sahipler için uygun olmayabilecek stake kilitleme süresi olabilir. Bir düğüm operatörü düğümünü iptal ederse, stake edilmiş tokenleriniz, hissenizi iptal etmişsiniz gibi davranacak ve ilgili kilit süresinden sonra talep edilebilecek.</p> 1.2) Blok ve fikir birliği turları&nbsp;nedir? <p>Blok, işlemlerle ilgili bilgileri depolayan blok zincirinin temel bir parçasıdır. Ontology’de 1 bloğun üretimi 1 saniyeden 30 saniyeye kadar sürüyor, yani birisi her saniye bir işlem yaparsa, blok her saniye üretilecek demektir. Karşılaştırma için, 1 bitcoin bloğunun üretimi yaklaşık olarak sürer. 10 dakika. Bu, Ontology blockchain’in ne kadar ultra hızlı olduğunu — neredeyse anında işlemlere sahip olduğunu gösteriyor. 30 saniye boyunca hiçbir işlem görünmezse, oybirliği turlarının sınırlı bir süre verirken akmasını sağlamak için boş bir blok üretilir. 1 konsensüs turunun 60000 bloktan oluştuğu belirlenmiştir. Basit hesaplama sayesinde, fikir birliği tur süresi 16,66 saatten 20,83 güne kadardır. Yani trafik ne kadar yüksekse, turlar o kadar hızlıdır. Şu anda bir konsensüs turunun ortalama süresi yaklaşık. 7 gün. Raundları izlemek için, son 5 raundun başlangıç / bitiş zamanlarını ve ayrıca yakl. mevcut turun sonuna kadar geçen&nbsp;süre.</p> 1.3) Stake etmede fikir birliği turlarının rolü&nbsp;nedir? <p>Stake etme, fikir birliği turlarına bağlıdır. Peki nasıl çalışırlar? Her stake olayı veya değişiklik, bir fikir birliği turu sona erdiğinde gerçekleşir. Bu, örneğin 139. tur sırasında ONT hissenizi gönderirseniz, 139. tur sona erdiğinde aktif hale gelecek ve kilitlenecek ve ardından ONG ödülleri oluşturmaya başlayacaktır. O zamana kadar hisseniz aktif değildir, dolayısıyla ONG ödülleri üretmez. Bahis tutarınızı iptal etmeye karar verdiğinizde de aynı şey geçerlidir. 139. tur sırasında bahis tutarınızı iptal ederseniz, düğüm türüne bağlı olarak 139 (veya 140) turu bitene kadar kilitli kalacaktır. Dahası, ilgili ONG ödülleri, her konsensüs turunun sona ermesinden sonra stake sahipleri tarafından talep edilebilir.</p> 1.4) Node&nbsp;türleri <p>2 Node tipi, konsensüs node ve aday düğümler vardır. Nodalarin tam listesi ve sıralaması node.ont.io adresinde mevcuttur. ONT staker bakış açısından ana farklar şunlardır:</p><p>fikir birliği node (ilk 15'inci sırada): mevcut turun kilitleme süresi + 1 tam tur, daha düşük ödüller, temel bonus dağıtma (ilk 7), nadiren ödül dağıtım oranını değiştirme</p><p>aday nodalar (seviye 16+): sadece mevcut raundun kilitlenme süresi, daha yüksek ödüller, temel bonus dağıtma, ödül dağıtım oranını daha sık değiştirebilir</p><p>Çoğu staker için aday düğümler için bahis yapmak daha iyidir, çünkü bahis tutarınızı iptal ettikten sonra daha yüksek ödülleri ve daha kısa kilit süreleri&nbsp;vardır.</p> 1.5) Stake etme ödülleri nereden&nbsp;geliyor? <p>ONT stakerları için 3 ONG ödülü vardır. Bu ödülleri stake sahiplerine hangi düğüm türlerinin dağıttığını inceledim:</p>  Konsensüs turu sırasında toplanan işlem ücretleri (her iki düğüm&nbsp;türü)  sürüm modeline göre serbest bırakılan ONG (her iki düğüm türü) — 4. maddede bununla ilgili daha fazla bilgi edinin&nbsp;(burada)  vakıf bonusu   1.6) Neden aday düğümlerin daha iyi ödülleri&nbsp;var? <p>Konsensüs düğümleri ve aday düğümler ödülleri (işlem ücretleri ve serbest bırakılan ONG) 50/50 böler. Şu anda konsensüs düğümlerinde yaklaşık 167,7m ONT varken aday düğümlerde yalnızca 25,1m ONT bulunmaktadır. Aday düğümlerin şu anda stake etme / düğümlerde çok daha az ONT jetonuna sahip olması ve konsensüs düğümleriyle aynı miktarda ödülü dağıtması nedeniyle, 1 ONT başına ödülleri çok daha yüksektir</p> 1.7) Herhangi bir özel düğüm var&nbsp;mı? <p>Düğümler, elbette, paydaşlarını ödüllendirmenin farklı yollarını kullanmaya karar verebilir. Örneğin, kendi tokenlarını veya bazı airdrop’larını dağıtabilirler. Şu anda Sesameseed adında yalnızca bir tane böyle düğüm vardır. Özel SEED jetonlarını kullanarak tüm stake etme ödüllerini dağıtırlar. Bu durumda, stake etme ödülünüz ONG değil, SEED jetonudur. Makalede bununla ilgili daha fazla bilgi edinin. Geçmişte, MovieBloc düğümü ayrıca stakerlara MBL tokenları biçiminde ekstra ödüller dağıtmak için kullanılırdı, ancak bu sona&nbsp;erdi.</p> 1.8) Kilitlenme süresi&nbsp;nedir? <p>Kilitleme süresi, ONT jetonlarınızın stake etme durumunun kilidi açılıncaya kadar beklemeniz gereken zamandır. Konsensüs düğümlerinin 1 tam tur ekstra kilitlenme süresi varken, aday düğümlerin mevcut fikir birliği turunun sonuna kadar kilitlenme süresi vardır. Örnek: 110. tur sırasında konsensüs düğümündeki bahis tutarını iptal edersiniz. Bu, 111. tur bittiğinde ONT jetonlarınızın kilidinin açılacağı ve talep edilmeye hazır olacağı anlamına gelir. 110. tur sırasında aday düğümdeki bahis tutarını iptal ederseniz, ONT jetonlarınız 110. tur sona erdiğinde talep edilebilir olacaktır. Esnek olmak istiyorsanız, aday düğümlerle uğraşmak daha iyidir, çünkü kilit süreleri çok daha&nbsp;kısadır.</p> 1.9) node.ont.io’daki veriler nasıl anlaşılır? <p>2 liste vardır — İlk 15 düğüm fikir birliği düğümleridir ve geri kalanı aday düğümlerdir. Tüm sütunların anlamını açıklayalım.</p>node.ont.io<p>a) Toplam bahis: kullanıcı hissesi (bireysel pay sahipleri tarafından stake edilen jetonlar) + düğüm&nbsp;hissesi</p><p>b) Düğüm hissesi: düğüm operatörünün düğümü oluştururken ilk hissesi olarak düğümünde kilitlediği ONT&nbsp;miktarı</p><p>c) Ücret paylaşım oranı: Temel olarak, düğüm ONT jetonlarının 2 parçaya bölündüğünü, düğümün ilk hissesinin birinci kısım, ikinci kısmının ise kullanıcı hissesi olduğunu hayal edin. Popüler oran% 10 /% 90 olabilir. İlk rakam (% 10), düğümün ilk düğüm hissesi için aldığı ödüllerin ne kadarını stake sahiplerine dağıttığını ifade eder. İkinci rakam (% 90), düğümün kullanıcı stake edilmiş tokenlar için aldığı ödüllerin ne kadarını stake’lere dağıttığını ifade eder. Örnek: (düğüm başlangıç hissesi 10.000 ONT, kullanıcı hissesi 100K ONT, oran% 10 /% 90, 1 ONT başına ödül 0.01 ONG diyelim) Bu varsayımsal durumda, düğüm 10.000 başlangıç hissesi için 100 ONG alır ve bunun% 10'unu verir Stake sahiplerine eşit olarak ve 100.000 kullanıcı için hisseli düğüm 1000 ONG alır ve bunun% 90'ı stakerlara eşit olarak verir. Toplam: Stakers toplamda 910 ONG paylaşırken, düğüm operatörü 190 ONG tutar. Oran% 0 /% 85 ise bu, staker payının 850 ONG olduğu ve düğüm operatörünün 250 ONG tuttuğu anlamına&nbsp;gelir.</p><p>d) Yıllık getiri: (APY), bir sonraki konsensüs turu için mevcut stakerlar için beklenen yıllık ödüllerin gerçek zamanlı dinamik değerini temsil eder. Stake etme ve düğümlerdeki toplam ONT miktarı, düğüm operatörü tarafından belirlenen paylaşım oranı, ONT ve ONG tokenlerinin gerçek zamanlı piyasa fiyatı gibi birçok faktöre dayalı olarak gerçek zamanlı olarak hesaplanır. Fiyat dalgalanması ile APY’nin dinamik olarak nasıl değiştiğini görebilirsiniz&nbsp;. Örneğin, ONG’nin fiyatı% 100 artarsa ve ONT aynı değerde kalırsa, stake etme APY iki katına çıkar. Yeni düğümler,% 1000000 APY gibi çılgın sayıları gösterebilir, ancak bunun tek nedeni, 1 ONT belirteci gibi çok düşük kullanıcı hissesine sahip olmalarıdır. Daha fazla bahis eklendiğinde, ödüller çok hızlı bir şekilde normal değerlere düşecektir. APY’nin gerçek zamanlı hesaplanmasının bir yan etkisidir. Yaklaşık getirilerinizi hesaplamak için bir hesap makinesi kullanabilirsiniz.</p><p>e) Ulaşılan bahis sınırı: Düğüm operatörü, kullanıcının ilk düğüm hissesinin izin verilen maksimum 10x hissesini ayarlayabilir. Ulaşılan pay sınırı, şu anda maksimum kullanıcı hissesi kapasitesi düğümünün ne kadarına sahip olduğu anlamına gelir. Örnek: 10K başlangıç düğüm payına sahip bir düğüm, maksimum 100.000 kullanıcı hissesini kabul edebilir. Daha fazla stake sahiplerine yer açmak için, başlangıçtaki düğüm hisselerini artırmaları gerekir. İlk düğüm hisselerine başka bir 5k ONT ekleyeceklerse, düğümleri ek 50.000 kullanıcı hissesini kabul edebilir, vb.</p> Bölüm 2: Alıştırma  2.1) Nasıl bahis&nbsp;yapılır? <p>Üçüncü taraf seçenekleri olmasına rağmen, en yüksek ödülleri almak için ONTO mobile veya PC için OWallet gibi resmi bir Ontology cüzdanı kullanmanızı tavsiye ederim. Her iki cüzdan için tokenlerinizi nasıl stake edeceğinize dair adım adım yönergeler doğrudan node.ont.io/stake adresinde bulunabilir.</p><p>Cüzdanınızda ONT jetonlarınız olduğunda, gaz ücretlerini ödemek için ONG jetonlarına da ihtiyacınız olacak. Bahis yapmak için 0,05 ONG’ye ihtiyacınız var, ilk ödülleri de 0,05 ONG talep etmek için, aynı, hisseyi iptal etmek ve kilidi açılmış jetonları talep etmek için de aynı. Gaz ücretlerini ödemek için cüzdanınızda her zaman 1 ONG bulundurmanızı tavsiye ederim. Tüm ONG’yi borsalara göndermeyin çünkü 0,05 ONG olmadan işlem yapamayacaksınız.</p><p>ONT jetonlarınızı kazandığınızda, artık herhangi bir işlem yapmanız gerekmez. Bahis tutarını manuel olarak iptal etmeye karar verene veya düğüm operatörü düğümden çıkana kadar stake edilmiş olarak kalacaktır. Bir düğüm operatörü düğümünü iptal ederse, stake edilmiş tokenleriniz, hissenizi iptal etmişsiniz gibi davranacak ve ilgili kilit süresinden sonra talep edilebilecek.</p> 2.2) Bahis edilecek minimum ONT miktarı&nbsp;nedir? <p>Temmuz 2020'den bu yana 1 ONT token kadar düşük bir seviyeden bahis yapabilirsiniz. İlk stake etme sürümü 500 ONT birimi gerektiriyordu ama bu artık geçmişte&nbsp;kaldı.</p> 2.3) En iyi düğüm nasıl&nbsp;seçilir? <p>Bölüm 1'deki tüm yukarıdaki bilgilere dayanarak, en iyi ödüllerin şu anda aday düğümler tarafından sunulduğu açıktır. En iyisi nasıl seçilir? Node.ont.io’da paylaşım oranı sütunu 7 ve APY sütun 8'i kontrol etmek önemlidir. Paylaşım oranını kontrol ederken, düğümün ilk hisseleriyle ürettiği ödüllerin ne kadarının pay sahiplerine dağıtıldığının ilk% olduğunu unutmayın. Bu sayı ne kadar yüksekse o kadar iyidir, ancak düğüm tam stake etme kapasitesine ulaşmazsa, başlangıç düğüm hissesinin ne kadar büyük olduğu da önemlidir (100K’dan% 5, 10K’dan% 10'dan fazladır). Ardından hisse oranının ikinci% oranını kontrol edin. Mümkünse% 90'dan daha düşük teklif sunan düğümlerle stake etmeyi önermem. Ayrıca, yüksek oran sunan düğümlerle ilgileniyorsanız dikkatli olun. Bu taktiği genellikle yeni paydaşları çekmek için kullanırlar ve yeterli hisseyi topladıklarında ödülleri düşüreceklerdir. 90/90 veya 100/100 sunan düğümlerle bahis oynarsanız, oranı düşürüp düşürmediklerini görmek için node.ont.io’da düzenli olarak kontrol edin, böylece size daha az ödül verin. Yöneticiler düğümümüz ►CZ / SK Ontology topluluk düğümü◄gibi bazı düğümler oranımızı değiştirmemek için herkese açık bir söz&nbsp;verdi.</p> 2.4) ONG nereden&nbsp;alınır? <p>ONG jetonlarını nereden alacağınızı bilmiyorsanız, burada CMC’de ONG ticaret çiftleri sunan borsaların listesini bulabilirsiniz.

<p>Mathieu: Welcome to the SSI Orbit Podcast: a forum where we explore the ever-growing ecosystems of Self-sovereign Identity. I’m your host Mathieu Glaude.</p>
<p>In today’s conversation, I welcome Kaliya Young (often referred to as IdentityWoman) for a sneak peek at what to expect from IIW32: the 32nd iteration of the Internet Identity Workshop, which will be hosted virtually. For over 15 years, IIW has been the premier place to bring together the largest concentration of talents dedicated to designing and building identity systems that empower individuals. This episode is meant to give a high-level overview of the topics that are being discussed in the digital and decentralized identity communities in preparation for this event. Listeners of <a href="https://anchor.fm/ssi-orbit-podcast">this podcast</a> who haven’t registered yet for IIW or who are maybe on the fence about registering can get a 20% discount by applying this discount code → ‘SSIOrbit_XXXII_20’ to your purchase <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxii-32-2021a-tickets-131551119941?aff=ebdssbonlinesearch">here</a>. We look forward to seeing you all there.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here’s my conversation with Kaliya Young.</p>
<p>Kaliya, how is it going, and what’s keeping you busy these days?</p>
<p>Kaliya: Thanks Mathieu. I am the Ecosystems Director at the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative, so that’s my current main focus of work. In that role, I’ve been tapped to co-chair the interoperability working group for Good Health Pass, which is happening in the Trust over IP Foundation.</p>
 Pseudonymity and Naming on the Internet 
<p>Mathieu: Awesome, I’ve been following both of those projects; the CCI for&nbsp; —&nbsp;wow, over a year now already, and then the Good Health Pass. I definitely see a lot of momentum and excitement behind that project. I would like to go a little deeper into both of those as we go through the conversation here today. This is a quote I pulled from online: you go by the handle of ‘IdentityWoman,’ and IdentityWoman is a ‘nymwarrior’. What is a nymwarrior?</p>
<p>Kaliya: This term emerged around the time when Google created Google Plus, building on top of its email system. Google created profiles for people who had email addresses, and then early on, you could get invited into the Google Plus social network. Those early invitations went out, and they spread around. At some point, they were going to flip over to be totally public, so anybody could join once they had a critical mass. It was at that point that Google effectively decided to implement a ‘real names’ policy, and began cancelling or suspending people’s accounts, who didn’t have what we started to term WASPO-nyms: that is, a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant name. If you were ‘John Smith,’ you were fine, even if that wasn’t your real name because it looks like a real name to the algorithms. But for me, you know, ‘Kaliya IdentityWoman’ (which is my first name in real life plus my online handle) was suspended because it didn’t look like a real name. They were building a social network of people who are online, many of whom have used handles in the online space for a decade or more. The position was, “Well, that’s not real.” Except, it is real because they use it online and have done so for ten years, so stop cancelling people because they don’t match your naming algorithm, which only lets certain types of names through. It became lit; I’m sure that if you search on it today, you’ll find the ‘nym-wars.’ So, people started finding each other on Twitter and being, “what’s going on?” There was a really big fight at the time with Google around this. Folks like Tim O’Reilly got into the fray, and started saying there’s a lynch mob against Google. I was, “Timeout Tim, that’s not an appropriate term for people who are marginalized, who have different identities.” Telling a big corporation that they’re wrong, when lynching was what happened to black people in the South by white mobs; these are not equivalent, and you can’t make this. In fact, I even pointed at the example from Roots, where Kunta Kinte said, “My name is Kunta Kinte,” and the slave owner was, “No, your name’s Toby.” You know it’s not the same at all; slavery and that impact is much greater than these smaller fights we’re having about naming. But still, it’s the entity with more power saying to the other people, “No, your name can’t be Identity Woman, or Rainbow Star Flower or whatever that ‘funny’ internet handle was that you had —that’s not real.” We were talking more about this power imbalance, around who has the right to name themselves, and who gets to say what a legitimate name is.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes. There’s something extremely powerful about pseudonymity. That’s one of the things I love on Twitter today, too. You have these people with such powerful voices; I don’t know what their legal name is, and I actually don’t care, either. Your legal name: I don’t know if it’s an antiquated attribute for identifying you, but on certain things, and Google Plus is probably one of them; why can’t you be called whatever you want to be called? What’s the difference?</p>
<p>Kaliya: They came back and said,” Well, behavioural reasons.” All the community managers took the position of, “Behavior in communities isn’t managed by what you choose to call yourself.” Really, names are tools that people use to communicate about each other. What happens to be on our administrative paperwork, and where it’s appropriate to force people to share the name that’s on their administrative paperwork, is something we need to be talking about. It’s not always relevant, and in fact, can be harmful and make vulnerable people even more vulnerable, if they are required to share that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think that from the other perspective, you’re talking about being cancelled because you’re not providing a name. But people get cancelled, because they provide their names, from the other side around. So, it’s an interesting social landscape that’s been developing on the internet. You’ve been in the Digital ID space — I know you started IIW in 2005. This is a broad question, but from when you got into the space, to where we are now, how have you seen the different trends move, or what’s really changed?</p>
<p>Kaliya: My core inspiration, and the place I got started on the path of looking at digital identity, was a community called PlanetWork, which is ‘Planet’ and ‘Network’ mushed together. As a community, they did some discernment after their year 2000 conference that they hosted. They asked what was a missing piece of infrastructure needed to make the internet better for people, and for people to self-organize, to connect to each other, to make the planet, and the ecosystem and the earth that we live on better. It was a very interesting answer that they came up with: they identified a gap, and said there are no open standards for digital identity, for the representation of people in the digital realm, and that we needed open standards for this. And, if we didn’t take the time to invest in creating those open standards, if you took the current trajectory forward without those open standards, then you would end up with governments and large corporations owning everybody’s identity. They were right, right.</p>
<p>They took the paper that was written, the Augmented Social Network Whitepaper: Building Identity and Trust into the Next Generation; they shopped it around to a bunch of foundations, who didn’t understand what they were talking about. They didn’t understand the missing infrastructure piece they were naming, and didn’t understand the implications of not funding its development at the time. And here we are: Facebook kind of owns everybody’s digital representation of themselves, with bonus — Google owns a bunch of them too. Now we have <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, and it’s like Nascar with logins, with these different options, but none of them are you.</p>
<p>To be fair, OpenID and OAuth all came out of, and were developed within, the context of IIW, and they were better than everybody going to a new website and getting an entirely different identity every time. I think that there was corporate capture that happened with those standards, and I think people are very concerned about this with the next generation of open standards, so they are pushing even harder for them to be open and person-driven. Hopefully, we can have truly open standards that have less corporate capture than the first generations, but I’m really optimistic about getting usable PKI (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure#:~:text=A%20public%2Dkey%20infrastructure%20(PKI,and%20manage%20public%2Dkey%20encryption.">Public Key Infrastructure</a>) into the hands of normal people, on apps they control on their devices. That’s super exciting, and has the potential to fulfill those original visions that I was inspired by in the first place. So this keeps me motivated to help these new technologies to succeed, because I think they help to realize key aspects of that original vision, that have yet to be realized.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I definitely think the rise of mobile and other similar developments have put tools in people’s pockets to be able to <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">manage their own identity</a> attributes or all sorts of credentials. I do find it interesting; I think you had founded IIW in 2005; I’m trying to think back to when I opened my Facebook account. It was around that time too, or a bit earlier.</p>
<p>Kaliya: Facebook wasn’t founded until 2004. Sometimes I describe myself as being against Facebook before it ever existed, in the sense that we were naming this issue.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It is funny today, a lot of people have been talking about the security breach that they had — who knows when it happened — but they talked about it a week ago or so; all these accounts that have been breached. Out of 196 million users, they dropped down to 194 million users with an increase in traffic in the time, as well. It’s crazy to see the risks that go with the models that they have in place today. I think we see some really good movements in the communities we’re in, but the people that are using these weak Web 2 systems (however we want to call it) don’t seem to be impacted by this stuff.</p>
<p>Kaliya: Sure. Until we have better tools, they won’t be, because they’re pragmatic. I think we need to take this seedling infrastructure we have and grow it up, so it provides better value to a whole range of actors who today find value in a Facebook ecosystem. Part of that is around entrepreneurs building alternative social networks, who are committed to interoperability and to putting users in control in a way that Facebook has not. A great example is the work that Jim Fournier is doing with a network called Tru.net, which uses both a decentralized identifier in the infrastructure, and also a standard that they’re putting forward for adoption by others, called JLINC. JLINC allows you to see the provenance of information that you’re viewing in your social network, and they’re committed to working with other emerging alternative social network operators, to have interoperability between their platform and other people’s platforms.</p>
 Solving business issues with Open Standards 
<p>Mathieu: That’s awesome. It looks like there are two different types of ways to approach decentralized identity: you could build new platforms and compete with the existing platforms that are out there, but there’s also the existing platforms out there, who could start re-architecting themselves to be able to meet the privacy and consent-driven properties that people are looking for, and should have access to. The Digital ID space is absolutely booming, if you talk about these ID-proofing companies. On one side, there are all these verticals; I got my ID-proofing companies, I got my signature companies, I could even get into the cyberspace; I’ve been talking a lot about identity and access management companies that have been involved in IIW for all these years.</p>
<p>How do you see them going towards that space? It’s one thing to build a new platform from scratch, but what’s your view on how these existing centralized providers are approaching this? </p>
<p>Kaliya: Yes. Those entities are solving business problems that businesses have. The question is, can we solve those business problems with open standards, that make it easier for someone to take a verifiable credential from one party and share it with another, and have them believe it?</p>
<p>I think in the end, if we’re successful with a bunch of these new emerging open standards, they’re very disruptive to the existing business models of identity proofers, etc. They’re making money over the fact that the current paper-based model of document provision means that the only way to figure out whether something is true, is to go and ping large data sets that they have access to and are corralling. And then, making assertions based on those data sets, that other businesses are relying on. I believe that this is another under-reported property of the <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">verifiable credentials technology</a> that is being developed at IIW. If we are successful, we end the problem of: “if I know information about you, I can be you.” The only way that you can be you, is if you actually have the verifiable credential from an authoritative source. I’m sure we will have attacks that try and get those, but that’s different than the current attack model, which is: “I’m going to find information about you, and because I know that information, I’m going to commit fraud or try and steal things from you, because I’m convincing someone that I am you, because I know information about you. That whole set of attack surfaces goes away when you have a verifiable credentials type of infrastructure, where only the person who was issued a credential can assert those things about themselves. They can know information about you, but they can’t replay you presenting the credential, because only you have it.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I was on the phone with someone earlier today, who was calling me to ask about his email account. It was taken over, and his email is connected to a whole lot of his different accounts: his banking account, his crypto account, all sorts of things. The person was able to get in and change his recovery email, and he’s been stuck in this whole situation. There are all of these types of issues, such as you just described, that are able to happen.</p>
<p>Kaliya: To be fair, you know that people should be using two-factor authentication, or FIDO (<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/">Fast Identity Online</a>) tokens etc.&nbsp; I do think, though, if we move towards verifiable credentials and that tooling for authentication, it’s also way more secure. That’s why I knew we were onto something, once the banks started showing up. They said, “That’s really cool; that usable PKI you’re embedding in the app is way better than little owls looking back at you and SMTP messages; let’s do that!” My response was, “Yay, the banks are into this because of security properties, not because it’s good for people, and maybe we’ll get both. We’ll get ‘good for people’ and ‘more secure for the banks’, which is the win/win we want, in order to get broad market adoption.</p>
<p>Mathieu: &nbsp;Yes. These processes of authentication like 2FA or this type of thing are still very good processes. You could enable them through <a href="https://northernblock.io/">using verifiable credentials</a>, rather than using a one-time PIN or other methods that have worked for a bank before, such as getting an email with a code or a text message with a code. I probably get these every day now for different services I use, so something like verifiable credentials for a two-factor authentication could be something interesting. I’m not sure if that’s what Microsoft is going to do with an authenticator app, but it is interesting to see companies like Microsoft, who are obviously not new to the space but they’re making significant headway with verifiable credentials.</p>
 Upcoming IIW conference 
<p>So, IIW is coming up next week; it starts on Tuesday, so you must be excited about it. You must be overwhelmed with work right now; what is it looking like this year?</p>
<p>I’m much newer to the space than someone like yourself or a lot of other people that are in there. I think I attended the past two IIWs, so it’s quite new to me still. The first time I attended IIW, I just couldn’t believe the brilliance that’s in there. I absolutely loved the format; you’re not stuck to only listening to people, or to a certain agenda; you could move around and try to progress as you want. I think this ‘unconference,’ or however you label it, as a format for IIW is phenomenal, but what are you most looking forward to for this year’s IIW?</p>
<p>Kaliya: I think we were really fortunate with the pandemic kicking in last year, that we had a pathway to go virtual. My friend Lucas Chaffee had a platform he built specifically to do several different formats, but one of the formats he had in mind when he designed Kiko Chat was Open Space technology. That is what we used to co-create the agenda live on the morning of the event, so that you know where to go. We had six weeks from when we officially decided to go virtual, to be virtual. We were able to use Lucas’s platform to recreate what happens live and in person. If you haven’t been to IIW in person, we sit 250 people in a circle together, and we articulate the principles of Open Space and the ‘Law of Motion and Responsibility.’ That says that if you aren’t learning or contributing in your session, it’s your responsibility to respectfully get up and go somewhere that you are. That works in person, and we took that same format that we use in person and translated it online pretty seamlessly. The great thing about after that first virtual version, is people came to us and said, “Everything is so crazy with the pandemic, but IIW was exactly the same, and I needed that.” So, we’re very lucky that we got to translate it into the digital version and continue the vibrancy and dynamics. We even expanded it, because there were people able to come to ‘Virtual IIW’ who were unable to make it to our physical version in Mountain View. We’re planning to go back to the physical version in the fall, hopefully. We’d like to alternate between digital and in-person to capture some of the good things about being virtual that we’ve liked, but also to reconnect our community with the affordances that an in-person meeting provides that you just can’t recreate digitally.</p>
<p>Mathieu: In the spirit of inclusivity, it was great to see just how people from all over are able to actually participate and see that. I think you and the other organizers do a really good job of making it inclusive, so people have different statures could join.</p>
<p>Now that we’re a week out from IIW32, what are the biggest industry trends that you’re seeing that people are excited to discuss?</p>
<p>Kaliya: I think we’re going to have a big discussion about COVID-19 credentials. They’ve only grown in importance since they were a seedling of conversation at the beginning of the pandemic. A year ago, BBS+ was put forward as a new credential signing format, specifically JSON-LD ZKP (Linked Data Zero Knowledge Proof) with BBS+. That has grown, in terms of people’s understanding of how good it could be, and there’s significant alignment in the industry happening around it. I published a paper in January (which we can put in the show notes), articulating the choice landscape, and the different flavours of verifiable credentials, and why this new format helped to meet many different criteria that different subgroups in the community had. We want to encourage more alignment with it, so we can get real <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/02/11/cci-verifiable-credentials-flavors-and-interoperability-paper/.">interoperability</a>. Writing a standard isn’t enough to build an ecosystem of interoperability; there’s this critical step of implementing the standard, and seeing if your version of what you implemented works in software created by other people who are also conforming with the standard. I believe that’s also going to be a big topic this year, in terms of what’s next, in terms of testing and growing the pie of the systems that work well with each other. In the process, we’re building the market for all the entrepreneurs who are building on the standard. To me, every new client of every company in the ecosystem is a good thing for everyone else.</p>
<p>Mathieu: These BBS+ methods must be exciting to the COVID-19 types of projects; it seems as though they’re the ones spearheading a lot of the interoperability conversations?</p>
<p>Kaliya: Well, we’ll see; I don’t want to get into all the politics that are trying to sort themselves out behind the scenes. I think we’re all doing our best, and I think there is a goodwill effort by everybody, trying to solve for COVID use cases to get to interoperability. There are still distinct differences out there, and we’re continuing to dialogue.</p>
 Developments in Governance 
<p>Mathieu: Have you seen many discussions happening, or looking like they’re going to happen, around governance? I know that’s a very broad topic. I come from the perspective of an <a href="https://northernblock.io/services/ssi-implementation/">ecosystem solutions implementation</a> across the stack; being able to have a registry of bids, and credential schemas, and other similar topics: peer-to-peer communications, the credentialing exchange, the ecosystem rules, and governance. Have you seen a lot of advancement in that over the past years? Or, is this something that you hear conversations around, or are hoping to see at the next IIW?</p>
<p>Kaliya: I would hope that the people who are so gung-ho at Trust over IP make space to listen to people who have chosen to opt-out and not participate in that ecosystem, because there are reasons why people are doing that. I’m very hopeful that the momentum around the JSON-LD ZKP with BBS+ can grow to the extent where we aren’t having a conversation about my flavour of credentials versus your flavour versus another. It’s exhausting, and it has hurt market adoption.</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve come to understand also, is that there’s a natural split within the community. One split that continues and won’t ever go away, is the difference between permission ledgers and public ledgers, in terms of where to anchor decentralized identifiers. People simply have different philosophical anchors of which one to choose. I think they both have valid points, so we’re never not going to see people anchor DIDs on public chains, and we’re never not going to see another set of people choose to anchor on permission ledgers for their own business process reasons. One of those reasons have to do with large corporations being completely freaked out that they could be hosting a node that somebody happened to put some PII (Personal Identity Information) in some entry in a ledger three years ago, and now they’re liable under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). So, forget it; we’re controlling the whole chain. Which is fine, in terms of them meeting their business use cases and needs.</p>
<p>That’s one piece of a governance conversation that is there and won’t go away.</p>
<p>I think there’s another piece of governance, which is surfacing existing systems and business processes that people need to name and articulate more clearly. If you look at something like the <a href="https://northernblock.io/pan-canadian-trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>; it’s done an amazing job of surfacing the processes involved in creating identity documentation for both businesses and people in the first place. It’s forcing a detailed examination of the business process steps that go into creating that, getting it all clear, and then identifying, “which ones do you have?”. It’s not so much like creating ‘new’ governance, but surfacing systems and processes that were perhaps taken for granted and making what’s happening more explicit. In that way, apples and apples, and oranges and oranges, can get compared to each other.</p>
<p>For example, how does the identity business process of how British Columbia creates Citizen ID cards compare with how the Province of Quebec does it? If they’re similar enough then, Quebec can trust BC’s credentials, and BC can trust Quebec’s. That’s probably a good thing to be surfacing, and having conversations about what the meaning of different credentials are, and how the creation of those assertions is done in ways that other entities can have confidence in them.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I like the reference to the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, which we are familiar with, being here in Canada. I think the work that Joni has pushed forward through the <a href="https://diacc.ca/">DIACC</a> (Digital Identification and Authorization Council of Canada) both in the public and private sector, has helped with finding a good way to componentize the different atomic processes, or whatever you want to call it. As you said: it’s not a ‘one mould fits all’ type of thing either. If you’re aligned on the principles and certain elements underneath there, then that’s a way that you’ll definitely be able to trust credentials coming between different ecosystems, whatever they are. There are excellent developments coming out of that, going back to your ledger comment; and I think we’ve seen a lot of momentum with the non-ledger type of stuff as well.</p>
<p>We have the permission ledgers, and have the public ledgers; it’s been interesting to see advancements on both sides. It appears that the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) project is gaining a lot of momentum as well, and people seem quite interested in that. We talked a bit about the private sector: what do you see from a self-sovereign identity or decentralized identity perspective? Is there a lot of public sector or government involvement in IIW? That will help folks to know, if they’re looking to have these types of conversations.</p>
<p>Kaliya: Yes, but there could be more.&nbsp; The usual suspects are present; there’s the British Columbia guys, Tim Bouma; who else shows up that’s from government? There’s some interesting work in the states, that you know very well, with the DHS. All of those folks have been in the community for years now. I know companies all around the world, who have been talking to their own governments; whether those government folks actually show up at IIW, I don’t know. My understanding is that there are governments, or government fora, focused on digitization and digital transformation. There are conversations happening that we simply don’t hear about in the private sector, because they feel more comfortable talking to themselves. Hopefully, over time, more of those conversations will come out into more accessible fora.</p>
 The Good Health Pass Initiative 
<p>Mathieu: We touched on this earlier, and there is clearly a lot of conversation around the <a href="https://northernblock.io/patient-centric-identity-management-for-healthcare/">health credentials</a>. Would you mind giving an overview from your point of view, on what has happened with the Good Health Pass Initiative? My perception, having not been involved, since we’re not too involved in health credentials; it’s a project that started under ID 2020 and developed a relationship with Trust over IP to execute some activity. Can you shed some light there?</p>
<p>Kaliya: Yes. Your description is as good as mine in terms of those details. I think that one of the inspirations for it, was to catalyze a global conversation around critical stakeholders in international travel; specifically around test results and sharing those, because the World Health Organization only has the mandate to address vaccine credentials under international regulations. They basically said straight out,” We aren’t dealing with testing.” Okay, great, but given that countries are mandating testing to get in, somebody has to deal with it.</p>
<p>Those entities who make international travel function needed to collaborate together to figure out how there could be a common way to figure out how to get a test from a trusted lab, and share it into a Traveler Decision System. And, to support governments on the other end being able to see those results. That’s a lot of entities, who were really clear that they didn’t want to see a global system with 40 different apps, with 40 different testing lab networks, that might require a person with three flights in a day to go and get three different tests, from three different labs, with three different apps. That isn’t going to help global travel reopen; it’s going to keep it closed. There are a lot of moving pieces. Trying to solve the legitimate business need, to figure out if countries are requiring test results to get in, and airplanes are required to get that proof before they let someone on a plane to go to Country X: how is that going to happen in a way that’s as privacy-preserving as possible, empowering to the individual as possible, and reducing the headache in terms of processing and managing that information in those existing systems?</p>
<p>Mathieu: There are some governments that are mandating it. There have been some announcements; at least, the US federal government announced that they weren’t going to mandate a digital wallet or digital credentials, and some states are not doing it. However, whoever the relying parties are in these transactions…</p>
<p>Kaliya: They’re Verifiers; they’re not relying parties. It’s very important that we call them ‘Verifiers.’ Sure, they’re relying parties, but part of this language is really important. Typically, a relying party is phoning home to an identity provider, and these systems don’t do that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Hmm, I thought those terms were interchangeable; I’m coming from the space where there were banks talking about this stuff, and assuming that the Issuer /Holder /Verifier model was the same as saying Verifiers /Relying party. But, okay, I see the difference that you’re pointing out; that’s interesting.</p>
 The Impact of Culture on Architecture 
<p>Mathieu: You obviously build communities; you build communities through CCI, you’ve built communities in the identity space for many years now. Having done all this; we talked about inclusivity before, and when we talk about adoption, it’s requires thinking more and more about the role that culture plays in this area. A silly example would be an American culture versus a Chinese culture, and how different they are. What role does culture play in the adoption of this on a global scale?</p>
<p>Kaliya: Different cultures make different assumptions and agreements about how they operate.</p>
<p>One of the appealing things about the underlying architectural affordances of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, is that it aligns with core values and current architectural realities of how identity systems work within western liberal democracies.</p>
<p>I’m Canadian; I was born in British Columbia. The Province of British Columbia is the authoritative source of my birth date, because they were the administrative region where I was born. My parents filed a paper with them, and they have that on file. When I talk to government leaders who are active in the space, they want to help me get that information in a form that I can reuse and share with other people. However, they don’t want to be in the middle of every transaction I do forever where I share my birthday. They take the position,” It’s none of my business. I don’t want to know, so don’t build a system where you put me in the loop.” That is quite different from an architectural choice that was made in India, with the development of their Aadhaar system. With the fundamental underlying architectural design, as originally conceived there, every time you presented your Aadhaar number, and by extension, the core demographic information within it, such as your name and your birth date, the government would see it. That’s because it is in a ‘phone home’ authentication system; meaning, you ping the government to do the authentication, to see if the person standing in front of you is the person they claim to be, through having this particular number.</p>
<p>You know, we have identifier systems in the west for social service provision; they’re called social security numbers in the USA, and social insurance numbers in Canada. They have all sorts of different names. I’m sure that in Europe they’re the same; this number that you use to interact with the government, to pay your taxes, to receive pension benefits, to receive disability benefits, and potentially other things. That is a long-lived, indexical number connected to your real name, so that they can figure out it’s you. However, right now, at least in Canada and the United States, there’s no way to do authentication against that number, because it’s not a network endpoint. And, they don’t want it to be. So, part of the reason for innovating these decentralized identity systems, and why western liberal democracies are interested in them, is because they support people being able to prove those things about themselves, without the government being in the loop all the time. They don’t want to be in the loop.</p>
 Closing Thoughts 
<p>Mathieu: Well, Kaliya, as a last question here or a last thought; what would you tell people who are still on the fence about attending IIW, who haven’t attended it before?</p>
<p>Kaliya: Well, I’d enthusiastically invite you! IIW does cost money to attend, and if that is a barrier to you being able to participate, please reach out to us. We are really committed to accessibility. We also have rates that are for students, folks who are with startups in the developing world etc. We charge money, because it costs us money to put on the event — even the virtual event. There’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes in terms of the labour involved in creating the space, and collecting all the notes, and doing all the space creation and holding.</p>
<p>Really, it’s a little bit of the deep end; in the sense of the fact that you’re in the rooms with the people who invented this technology in the first place, but that’s a fantastic thing too. I’d encourage folks who want to explore the space to come. There are other options too: you can <a href="https://newsletter.identosphere.net/">subscribe to my newsletter</a>. Every week, I publish the ‘Identosphere’ with Infominer. We sort through all of the blogosphere and Twittersphere news, and highlight the best of what happened this week in the industry. There are a ton of webinars, and podcasts, and online resources, and it’s a really friendly community, too. Meaning, if you have questions and you’re confused, you can host a session about your confusion, and people will come and help you. The ‘un’ in unconference means several things; one, the agenda isn’t created until the day of the event, but also, other formats besides presentation are invited and encouraged, including people who are lost and confused, asking questions.</p>
<p>Mathieu: We’ll include the registration links in the show notes with Kaliya’s contact information through social as well. I will say that your Identosphere newsletter is just an amazing resource every week, so if people aren’t on that… I try to keep up to speed with stuff that’s happening; I don’t know what you do to keep up with all these different things that are happening, but, for a one-stop-shop so you don’t get overwhelmed every week with everything that’s happening, it’s the best thing to be subscribed to. I’ll link that in the show minutes, as well.</p>
<p>Subscribe here: <a href="https://newsletter.identosphere.net/">https://newsletter.identosphere.net/</a></p>
<p>Kaliya, thank you so much for doing this with me today. I very much look forward to IIW.</p>
<p>Kaliya: Thank you so much for having me. Yes, please reach out to me if you want to get connected to the community. I’m thrilled to help you find your niche amongst all of us.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thank you for listening; I hope you enjoyed the conversation as much as I did. To stay up to speed with future episode releases, please subscribe to the podcast on whatever channel you’re listening to it right now. If you have any questions or comments, please reach out to me directly. You can find me online; I’m quite active on Linkedin and Twitter, so I look forward to hearing from you. See you all next time.</p>

 The GiD Report#156 — Crypto goes mainstream <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis.

It’s finally here — Coinbase is a public&nbsp;company Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Photo: TechCrunch<p>In other words, crypto has arrived. That one of crypto’s biggest companies is trading in the biggest market at one of the biggest valuations.</p><p>It’s a huge deal, the ultimate validation.</p><p>From Satoshi’s white paper to billions of dollars of COIN trading hands on the&nbsp;NASDAQ.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/coinbase-ipo-stock.html">the&nbsp;NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote>Digital currency, once mocked as a tool for criminals and reckless speculators, is sliding into the mainstream.</blockquote><blockquote>Traditional banks are helping investors put their money into cryptocurrency funds. Companies like Tesla and Square are hoarding Bitcoin. And celebrities are leading the way in a digital-art spending spree using a technology called an&nbsp;NFT.</blockquote><blockquote>On Wednesday, digital or cryptocurrencies took their biggest step yet toward wider acceptance when Coinbase, a start-up that allows people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, went public. Coinbase shares began trading at $381 each, up 52 percent from a reference price of $250, eventually closing at $328.28. That gave the company a valuation of $85.7 billion based on all its outstanding shares, more than 10 times higher than Coinbase’s last private valuation.</blockquote><blockquote>Call it crypto’s coming-out party. Coinbase, based in San Francisco, is the first major cryptocurrency start-up to go public on a U.S. stock market. It did so at a valuation that rivaled that of Airbnb and Facebook when they went&nbsp;public.</blockquote><blockquote>Cryptocurrency advocates — many of whom expect the technology to upend the global financial system — are celebrating the watershed as vindication of their long-held belief in their cause’s potential.</blockquote><blockquote>Coinbase’s listing answers the question “Is crypto a real thing?” said Bradley Tusk, a venture capital investor whose firm, Tusk Venture Partners, backed Coinbase. “Any industry that can launch an I.P.O. of this size is without a doubt a real thing, and it’s proven by the&nbsp;market.”</blockquote><p>The WSJ also a great feature on Brian Armstrong (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coinbase-ceo-to-take-crypto-exchange-public-after-bringing-bitcoin-to-masses-11618392602">Coinbase CEO Takes Crypto Exchange Public After Bringing Bitcoin to&nbsp;Masses</a>  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd">Greg</a>:</p><blockquote>Congrats to Brian and the Coinbase team. What a journey from our YCombinator batch.</blockquote><p>[Disclaimer: Greg is a first round Coinbase investor.]</p><p>And here’s CNBC’s take (via <a href="https://global.id/coddsquad">/coddsqua</a>d):</p>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/coinbase-is-unlike-any-market-debut-wall-street-has-ever-seen-.html">Coinbase is unlike any market debut Wall Street has ever&nbsp;seen</a>  <p>And here’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-15/coinbase-direct-listing-needed-the-coin-ticker">a funny story highlighted by Matt&nbsp;Levine</a>:</p><blockquote>Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas said in an interview Wednesday morning that one of the reasons that the company picked Nasdaq was because the bourse offered the ticker symbol “COIN,” which wasn’t part of the New York Stock Exchange’s pitch.</blockquote><blockquote>“Ultimately that they had the ticker COIN, and that was a really great ticker for us to get,” Haas&nbsp;said.</blockquote> 2. But have you heard of&nbsp;FTX? <p>Coinbase is getting all the headlines, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-vegan-billionaire-disrupted-the-crypto-markets-stocks-may-be-next-11618565408">but the WSJ is paying attention</a> (via my friend&nbsp;Alan):</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-vegan-billionaire-disrupted-the-crypto-markets-stocks-may-be-next-11618565408">This Vegan Billionaire Disrupted the Crypto Markets. Stocks May Be&nbsp;Next.</a>  <p>A quick&nbsp;snippet:</p><blockquote>So far this month, FTX says it has processed some $10.7 billion of trades on an average day, up from around $900 million six months ago. That makes FTX one of the world’s top crypto exchanges, even though it only started operations in May&nbsp;2019.</blockquote><blockquote>By comparison, Coinbase — which doesn’t offer derivatives — has handled around $2.6 billion in daily trades this month, according to data provider CryptoCompare. FTX’s activity is also a drop in the bucket compared with traditional derivatives exchanges like CME Group Inc., which handles trillions of dollars of trades each&nbsp;day.</blockquote><p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;crypto:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/vs">/vs</a> — <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crypto-com-buy-bitcoin-now/id1262148500">Crypto.com — Buy Bitcoin&nbsp;Now</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a> — <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2m7OgWCnlB9y8WPUuCFDoQ?si=p2G4dYU5QbSr-Cz6lDcBIg">#9 — Economics of Self-Sovereign Identity and the Future of Cryptoeconomics with Stepan&nbsp;Gershuni</a>  <a href="https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/cryptocurrency-investors-survey/">62% of Cryptocurrency Investors Believe They’ll Get Rich — MagnifyMoney</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/13/janet-yellen-bitcoin-and-crypto-fearmongers-get-pushback-from-former-cia-director/?sh=79d4e26c9bb7">Janet Yellen, Bitcoin And Crypto Fearmongers Get Pushback From Former CIA&nbsp;Director</a>   3. Despite Coinbase success — a continued lack of regulatory clarity <p>Also highlighted by the WSJ — directly from their editorial board, in fact.

The SEC in December charged Ripple with issuing $1.3 billion in unregistered securities, based on the company’s initial offering of its currency in 2013. The agency says Ripple’s efforts to promote and profit from its product qualify the currency as a security, subject to the restrictions that govern sales of equities.</blockquote><blockquote>Yet court findings in the discovery phase of the suit have highlighted the inconsistency of the SEC’s approach. In March Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn told lawyers that Ripple “has a utility,” casting doubt on the SEC’s view that the tokens are principally a claim on future profits. And last week Judge Netburn granted Ripple access to the SEC’s discussions of bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies, which the agency considers exempt from its&nbsp;rules.</blockquote><blockquote>The SEC believes bitcoin and ether aren’t securities, in part because their developers don’t profit from their sale. But those exemptions were announced through statements from former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in 2019 and 2020, with no formal rule-making. The findings by Judge Netburn in the Ripple case suggest that the agency hasn’t set clear rules for which currencies it regulates and which it&nbsp;doesn’t.</blockquote><blockquote>This confusion poses risks for investors. Coinbase delisted Ripple after the SEC filed suit in December, prompting a selloff that wiped out more than 60% of its value. The prices of Ripple and similar currencies have since tracked with the court’s statement’s on the SEC’s case. U.S. participants in the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market are seeking clarity that the agency has declined to provide, preferring to announce its positions through individual enforcement actions.</blockquote><p>There’s really no other way to slice it. The SEC has dropped the ball on its core&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/gary-gensler-has-a-full-agenda-as-he-gets-set-to-take-over-the-sec.html">Gary Gensler has a full agenda as he gets set to take over the&nbsp;SEC</a>   4.

<p>The sun is shining, the birds are singing — it’s officially Spring.</p><p>At Magic, we’re channeling a renewed sense of energy into the product to help you achieve better performance, scalability, and security for your apps. And as you build, there are new, fun ways to connect and grow together with the developer community.</p><p>In this post, I’ll share a brief “behind the scenes” look at some key updates for this&nbsp;month:</p> 🚀 Meet the new&nbsp;homepage <p>If you’ve been to <a href="https://magic.link/">magic.link</a> recently, you might have noticed some&nbsp;changes.</p><p>A new narrative, a new look and feel — plus, a friendly ghost&nbsp;mascot!</p><p>So, why the changes? The short answer is to better capture what makes Magic truly unique and unlike other passwordless auth solutions on the&nbsp;market.</p><p>After a busy first quarter to the new year, we found ourselves at an interesting point in the roadmap: the product was maturing at a fast clip and new updates were outpacing what was communicated on the website. It was time to align the&nbsp;two.</p><p>That’s why we refreshed our homepage to showcase new features, brand ethos (say hello to Hiro, our mascot extraordinaire), robust benefits, security expertise, blockchain-based identity and auth, customers, and Magic’s overall commitment to a great developer experience.</p><p>Our goals were to highlight:</p>  Our mission  The problems Magic solves for&nbsp;devs  What differentiates Magic  <p>Rolling auth from scratch is challenging. What if you could avoid reinventing the wheel, side-step the liability of passwords, and at the same time contribute to creating a safer internet? Magic ticks all of these boxes and then&nbsp;some.</p><p>“Plug and play auth” is as simple as it sounds. Check out our <a href="https://magic.link/">new site</a> to learn about our newest features.</p> 💫 Introducing Close-up Magic&nbsp;Meetups <p>At Magic, we’re big believers in the power of community.</p><p>Our team saw an opportunity for a dedicated space where developers could sharpen both technical and soft skills, so we set out to create&nbsp;it.</p><p>In March, we started mapping out a new kind of virtual meetup series. One that’s equally fun and engaging. Monthly meetups that bring developers closer together to inspire and learn from each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Which leads us to the name. Close-up Magic is a term used to describe magic — typically card tricks or coin tricks — performed up close, as opposed to on a stage. Other than proximity to the audience, the main difference between close-up magic and stage magic is the type of skill involved. This felt like the perfect metaphor for the learning environment we’re aiming to foster: an intimate round table setting in support of up-leveling skills.</p><p>Last Thursday we launched the very first event of the series, themed Happy Hour with the Magicians. Developers gathered to discuss blockchain and dive deeper into Magic’s identity tech through a lightning convo with our CEO, Sean&nbsp;Li.</p><blockquote>“Very inspiring” — Anthony, Senior Software&nbsp;Engineer</blockquote><blockquote>“I heard from another attendee the desire to learn Solidity, the language of the Ethereum blockchain. The enthusiasm inspired me to pick it up again and start building!”</blockquote><blockquote>— Ben, Magic’s Security&nbsp;Lead</blockquote><p>We can’t wait to shape the future of these monthly meetups with you and incorporate your feedback and wish lists along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>To stay up-to-date on the upcoming line-up and happenings, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/magic_labs">Twitter</a> or subscribe to our <a href="https://magiclabs.substack.com/welcome">newsletter</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.runtheworld.today/app/invitation/24632">RSVP here in advance</a> to join the next&nbsp;meetup!</p> ⛓️ Support for Flow, a modern blockchain for&nbsp;NFTs <p>Now you can add Flow to the list of blockchains you can build decentralized apps&nbsp;on.</p><p>Flow is a fast, modern, and developer-friendly blockchain that also powers next generation apps and platforms including <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">CrypoKitties</a> and <a href="https://nbatopshot.com/">NBA TopShot</a>. Use Magic to seamlessly onboard users without passwords and tap into the power of blockchain and cryptocurrencies to unlock innovative business&nbsp;models.</p><p><a href="https://docs.magic.link/blockchains/flow">This doc</a> covers the easy steps to set up the new Flow extension.</p><p>Magic and Dapper Labs, the team behind Flow, share a vision for a crypto world. We’re excited to champion the Web 3.0 community with this new&nbsp;feature.</p> 🛡️ Coming Soon: More Privacy Features and Compliance Certifications <p>Magic has successfully completed fieldwork for a comprehensive GDPR compliance audit.</p><p>To ensure compliance with every article of the policy, you may see a few changes coming soon to grant you even more rights and strengthen our commitment to user privacy and&nbsp;respect.</p><p>This will be a big year for compliance and privacy at Magic, and we look forward to all the ways we can demonstrate our commitment to our users and our community!</p><p>As a team that 💜 developers, it’s the ultimate win-win when devs are empowered to ship faster and focus on what matters most for their users, while working in a security and privacy-focused environment.</p><p>Hope you give these updates a spin, and as always, appreciate <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ryJW-yx2LC2nZXKfTSZPS82TN8-umCIYRe3c8B_WrxU/viewform?edit_requested=true">your feedback!</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/magic-product-updates-april-edition-a3da0153f25c">Magic Product Updates: April Edition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Investment to support and accelerate development of HYPR’s True Passwordless Authentication technology</p>
      
<p>NEW YORK, NY, April 20, 2021 /BusinessWire/- <a href="https://www.hypr.com/">HYPR, The Passwordless Company</a> today announced it has raised $35 million in a Series C financing, doubling the company’s total funding to over $70 million. The investment is led by Advent International through Advent Tech, the firm’s dedicated global technology fund. Advent has significant experience in cyber technology, including recent investments in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/il/news-releases/wiz-emerges-from-stealth-with-100-million-series-a-financing-and-a-mission-to-reinvent-cloud-security-887511529.html">Wiz</a> and<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyware-announces-30m-series-b-funding-led-by-advent-international-and-ten-eleven-ventures-301248144.html"> Cyware</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>The Series C investment comes amid significant momentum for HYPR as it grows market share and the global workforce pivots to a flexible workplace model.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>HYPR will leverage the capital to accelerate its go-to-market strategy and grow its global support organization in an effort to eliminate passwords for businesses worldwide. Advent joins HYPR’s existing investors including RRE Ventures, .406 Ventures, BoldStart, Top Tier Capital, MESH, Alumni Ventures Group, Allen &amp; Co, Samsung NEXT and Mastercard.</p>
      
<p>“Removing passwords for customers and employees eliminates a critical cybersecurity vulnerability, lowers IT support costs, and improves the overall user experience,” said Ashwin Krishnan, a Principal on Advent’s technology team in New York. “HYPR is a leading player in the emerging passwordless space, and has proven its ability to deliver for a large and diverse group of customers. We are incredibly excited to partner with HYPR, and believe the company is well-positioned for continued growth.”</p>
      
<p><a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/300-billion-passwords/">An estimated 300 billion passwords</a> are used worldwide. Yet passwords remain the #1 cause of cybersecurity breaches, over 80 percent of which are due to compromised credentials. The pandemic and a swift global transition to work-from-home have expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals, highlighting the security risk, high costs, and user friction caused by passwords and password-based multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>
      
<p>HYPR’s True Passwordless MFA technology has made it easy for businesses to go passwordless by combining the convenience of a smartphone with the security of a smart card. The company emphasizes user experience and takes a standards-based approach to empower IT and security teams to eliminate phishing, fraud, and friction.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>“The shift to remote work has propelled passwords to the top of every security organization’s list of priorities. As the sophistication and volume of cyber-attacks grows, we’re seeing unprecedented urgency for a solution to the password problem,” said George Avetisov, HYPR Co-Founder and CEO. “We are thrilled to partner with Advent to truly accelerate the elimination of passwords. This investment will double the size of our team and expand our product delivery as we empower companies across the globe to go passwordless.”</p>
      
<p>Since announcing its Series B funding in October 2019, HYPR has grown its annual recurring revenue (ARR) by more than 300 percent, driven by key milestones including:</p>
      
  More than doubling HYPR’s customer base of global brands such as Norwegian Airlines, Point72, Rakuten, Otis Worldwide, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, CVS Health, Fiserv, and City National Bank;  Delivering passwordless MFA to more than 20 verticals, including financial services, energy, automotive, healthcare, education, and government;  Deploying workforce login solutions at scale across a diverse array of customers, ranging from 50-person firms to enterprises with 300,000 employees and hundreds of millions of customers;  Surpassing more than 100 million licenses sold for the company’s customer authentication solution, spurred by a steep rise in fraud and PSD2 regulations; and  Expanding the<a href="https://www.hypr.com/partners/"> HYPR Velocity Partner Program</a> with a founding network of 30 industry leading experts, including solution resellers, system integrators, and technology partners.  
      
<p>“When we partnered as a first check investor in HYPR, the phrase “passwordless” was relatively unknown. Today the space has heated up tremendously as enterprises scramble to eliminate passwords, especially in light of the pandemic,” said Ed Sim, Founder and Managing Partner of BOLDStart Ventures. “The HYPR team saw where the puck was heading and we couldn’t be prouder of what they’ve built or more excited about the path forward with Advent, an ideal partner given their cybersecurity experience.”</p>
      
<p>HYPR is headquartered in New York City, with teams in Boston, California, London, and Tokyo. HYPR intends to double the global headcount, with hiring ongoing in every department.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>About HYPR</p>
      
<p>HYPR is the leader in Passwordless Multi-factor Authentication.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>The HYPR Cloud Platform makes it easy to eliminate passwords and deliver lightning-fast login experiences that users love. With HYPR, businesses are finally able to stop phishing, reduce fraud, and enable unrivaled security for employees and customers across the globe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is with joy and excitement that we announce that the 3rd and final round of the Pre-IEO sale of the MUI MetaBlock mainnet coin — MetaMUI has been completed. This happened within yet another record-breaking time of 2 minutes, effectively breaking the previously set record which happened in 4 minutes. We can easily call the entire 3 rounds of the Pre-IEO sales an outstanding success, as it has been consistent recording-breaking from start to&nbsp;finish.</p><p>This wouldn’t be remotely possible without the support of the ever-present community who have been there from the very first round till to last. The final round which went live at 8:00 Am Estonian time, saw all 6,000,000 (six million) available MetaMUI coins sold almost in an instant. In all fairness, the <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-pre-ieo-sale-introducing-reservation-feature-9c940fa79648">Reservation Feature</a> played a key role as several community members deposited their crypto assets (BTC, USDT, ETH) ahead of time which guaranteed their participation in the final round of the MetaMUI&nbsp;sale.</p><p>Next Steps: We are currently in advance collaborations with leading exchanges working towards the listing of the MetaMUI coins, with the popular crypto pairs. This is to enable the trading of our mainnet coins making them more accessible to the entire global community, and rewarding our loyal community with the opportunity to trade our&nbsp;coins.</p><p>In the past couple of weeks, the SWN Global team have secured proactive partnerships with reputable global bodies, such as the <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/the-partnership-between-digital-economy-incubation-center-and-sovereign-wallet-network-803c8e30cec0">Digital Economy Incubation Center</a> which is a corporation with IT PARK Uzbekistan. A partnership that will see SWN Global work to implement blockchain-based e-government related projects/solutions in Uzbekistan.</p><p>We are also in deep discussions with leading financial institutions and governments in the development of their Central Bank Digital Currency(CBDC), Digital Stock Exchange(DSE) and Cross-Border Payment(CBPM) with the MUI MetaBlockchain, which remains the world’s first finance-specific hybrid blockchain platform, based on self-sovereign identity. This is our belief that these interactions will bring about more value to the MUI MetaBlockchain ecosystem once development starts.</p> Fulfilling The Purpose of the Pre-IEO&nbsp;sale <p>At the start of the Pre-IEO rounds, we stated the purpose of the sale in a previous <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-pre-ieo-sale-announcement-d8841875b0ca">Medium article</a> which is to increase SWN global development efforts in the creation of an ideal blockchain-based platform for Central Bank Digital Currency and Digital Stock Exchange creation. The total raised funds will be used to further establish the project road map and features described in our whitepaper found here: <a href="https://sovereignwallet-network.github.io/whitepaper/">https://sovereignwallet-network.github.io/whitepaper/</a></p><p>We are in a strong position to establish ourselves as a leading enterprise blockchain, and our whitepaper showcases a clear vision for establishing that goal. Our team has been actively working on this, and we are ready to utilize the full potential of our technology to impact the global&nbsp;markets.</p><p>A big THANK YOU to our loyal community, as the SWN Global team and management deeply appreciate your continued support. From the mainnet launch till the last round of the Pre-IEO sale, it was the MUI Community support all the way.

 Zero-Knowledge Proofs — The&nbsp;Basics <p>The last few years have seen a big jump in the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and rightly so, given the many benefits it offers over traditional cryptographic methods.</p><p>Let’s look at some different applications and scenarios where ZKPs are being implemented to give you an idea of their future potential and more importantly, to enthuse you to think of the different areas where they can be implemented.</p><p>But before that, a touch on the&nbsp;basics.</p> A Brief Explanation of Zero-Knowledge Proofs <p>At the most fundamental level, a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic protocol where one entity can prove its identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p><p>When you say that an entity has an identity, what you mean is that the entity has a series of claims that are used to uniquely identify it. Breaking it down further, we can say that this process comprises of two&nbsp;steps,</p>  Creating a claim, where each claim is a subset that contributes to making an individual unique. Some examples of claims are date of birth, passport number, driver’s license, Social Security Number, or any other government-ID that belongs only to an entity and can be used solely to identify&nbsp;it.  Proving the claim — A means by which this claim is proven without the actual information.  <p>So, you have two parties to the transaction — a prover and a verifier. The prover is the entity that is claiming while the verifier is the entity that wants to know whether the claim is authentic.</p><p>If you dig deeper here, you’ll notice that these claims are not information about the entity per se, rather it is a need for some proof of the prover’s claims. So, it is enough if the prover can send some data to the verifier to prove the claim without having to give the actual information.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. A prover wants to prove to a verifier that she is over 21 years old. In an interactive environment, she simply walks into a store and buys some alcohol. That’s enough for the verifier to know that she is over 21 years old without knowing her exact&nbsp;age.</p><p>Here, two entities are interacting directly, all that the prover has to do is perform a series of actions in front of the verifier to prove a&nbsp;claim.</p><p>But, what happens in a non-interactive environment?</p><p>The prover has to deliver claims in such a way that they can be verified independently by the verifier, and without sending the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that can allow the verifier to “know” the&nbsp;prover.</p><p>At the most basic level, let’s say that the prover decides to electronically send (email/text/message) her age in the form of an algebraic equation, 7(x+3), where x is a positive integer. When the verifier solves the equation, the value can be anything, but more than 21. Regardless of the “x” value chosen by the verifier, it proves that she is over 21 years. Clearly, the prover has sent the values in such a way that she tells the verifier of her eligibility for the services offered without revealing her exact&nbsp;age.</p><p>But think about it for a moment. Just because she sends an equation, it doesn’t really mean she must be over 21 years. She can just be a smart 12-year-old!</p><p>So, this brings up the need for another entity — someone of authority who can assert that the prover’s claims are right. In the above example, a parent or guardian can vouch that the girl is over 21 years, and it should suffice as the adult takes the responsibility for any legal action, if the girl is less than 21 years of&nbsp;age.</p><p>But what about real-life scenarios? Who takes the responsibility to back the claims of the&nbsp;prover?</p><p>An issuer.</p><p>So now,there are three entities to every&nbsp;claim.</p>  Issuer — An independent third party entity that collates the holder’s claims, verifies the same and creates an identity representation (a ZKP that validates the claims without giving&nbsp;PII)  Holder — The entity that owns/makes the claims and wants to prove it. In our above example, the claim is that the holder is over 21 years&nbsp;old.  Verifier — The entity that verifies the&nbsp;claim  <p>In such a setup, every claim made by the holder is backed up by the issuer, and only the information that the verifier needs is sent to that entity. This way, the verifier knows that the ZKP is a valid one because it has been digitally signed by the issuer, an entity that is authorized to prove the&nbsp;claim.</p><p>Going back to our age example, the holder claims she is more than 21 years old. Her claim is validated by an issuer, which is, let’s say, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Since this issuer had generated the license, it has all the information needed to verify the age of the holder. So, it sends a credential that simply says that the holder is more than 21 years&nbsp;old.</p><p>The holder, in turn, sends this credential to the verifier. Now, the verifier sees the digital signature of the issuer and since this is a trustable source, the verifier accepts the holder’s claim and gives the holder access to its services.</p><p>Here’s how a ZKP would&nbsp;look:</p><p>As you can see, there are no specific details about the person and all that it does is verifies that the holder is over 21 years old using the “ageOver” field in the&nbsp;claim.</p><p>This idea can be extended across many fields, especially the ones that deal with sensitive information. And that’s exactly what we’ll talk about next in our&nbsp;series.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs — Part 1: The Basics</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Tokeny Solutions and Polygon have partnered, allowing asset issuers to easily tokenize compliant securities in a cost-effective and scalable way. Tokeny Solutions provides technology for securities issuers to tokenize their assets and Polygon is a layer 2 protocol building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Ethereum’s smart contract deployment and transaction fees have always been difficult for financial institutions to comprehend. These fees have varied greatly over time, depending on the actions performed and the price of the cryptocurrency (ETH), an asset many institutions are unable to have on their balance sheet.</p>
<p>With the delay of Ethereum 2, the cost has got even higher, closing the door to many projects that wanted to target a large audience of investors, or those that foresaw many management transactions or transfers between token holders.</p>
<p>As a result of the partnership between Tokeny Solutions and Polygon, asset issuers can continue to rely on the security, resilience and ecosystem of Ethereum, whilst reducing gas prices by over 10000 times. Gas fees become so low that they no longer handicap the adoption of security tokens. Alongside this, transaction speeds dramatically improve to under three seconds, greatly facilitating token transfers between investors.</p>

		 
	 
    Polygon’s layer 2 solution brings the efficiency whereas the T-REX protocol enforces the compliance for security token ownership. Now, issuers can easily migrate their operations onto Ethereum and offer a secondary market for a fraction of the cost. By reducing the fees, new segments of asset issuers are opened as it becomes more commercially viable to projects fractionalizing expensive assets, targeting retail investors, or issuing microloans, loyalty tokens and stablecoins.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions       Tokeny’s T-REX solution has been a game changer for firms looking to issue security tokens. Polygon’s high performance and low cost infrastructure will bring a new level of scalability to the existing tech stack and give issuers access to the Ethereum ecosystem at a fraction of the cost. This will allow Tokeny’s customers to offer new solutions and build projects which were previously not possible. We are excited to partner with Tokeny and contribute to their growing presence in the blockchain space.  Arjun KalsyVP Growth at Polygon    
	 
		 
			<p>Tokeny Solutions has recently released the details of the first compliant liquidity solution for security tokens in Europe, T-REX Billboard, which enables investors to participate in an active secondary market for private securities. With this announcement with Polygon, investors can now transfer with one another at a significantly reduced cost, and further improve the liquidity of private market securities.</p>

<p>The Simplicity of Passwordless Authentication With The Security of Non-custodial Public Key Infrastructure.</p><p>Today we’re excited to debut <a href="https://openlogin.com/">OpenLogin</a>, the newest product in our line up of PKI and authentication tools and services, powered by the Torus Key Infrastructure. OpenLogin improves on passwordless authentication, both in terms of UX, privacy and security. Here are the highlights:</p>  Device native biometrics: Familiar Face/TouchID logins to your application.  Social Account SSO, &amp; Passwordless flows: Users can register via Google, Twitter, Github, and email verification.  Hassle-free Data Management: Manage the most sensitive data flows, user encrypt sensitive data, setup for GDPR, CCPA, CPRA compliance.  Non-custodial PKI Architecture: Secured on a mixture of user devices and authentication methods, the architecture makes it impossible to have conventional data breaches.  Customizable and custom logins: So that we blend right into your application.  Integratable in 10 minutes: That’s&nbsp;it!  <p>OpenLogin is available today through the newly unified Torus SDK. Head over to our <a href="https://docs.tor.us/open-login/get-started">documentation</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p> Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) today secures a lot of the&nbsp;web… <p>Since its inception, cryptographic keys have been rapidly adopted to secure many parts of the internet. Today Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) is used for securing almost everything from serving our websites through HTTPS to our end-to-end encrypted iMessages. It is also the foundation for the blockchain ecosystem, which has only popularized the usage of PKI’s further, now as a form of financial ownership. At its essence, PKI provides strong security and privacy guarantees through two functions; encryption, the ability to message only to defined recipients, and attestation, to be able to digitally sign or make a claim as the key owner. The latter being very similar to what we need for online authentication.</p> And it’s coming for user authentication <p>Authentication today inherits problems from the username-password account model that started when web clients first cropped up. While it served its function, passwords had their issues, being just a simple string they were easily guessable and with the millions of web applications being developed, each one of them created different accounts for a user. Solutions like OAuth (i.e. Google Login) made the experience better but both early integrators and providers of these services, unfortunately, exploited access to users’ data and captured far more information than they often needed. Beyond misuse of data by the holding entities themselves, these data pools also created honey pots for external hackers and nefarious actors resulting in <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html">many</a>, <a href="https://bgr.com/2021/02/05/data-breach-email-and-passwords-leaked-compilation-of-many-breaches/">many</a>, <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/data-breach-statistics/">many</a> data breaches to date. With just a simple digital signature, PKI presents us with a clear opportunity to replace passwords altogether and secure the data dynamically between applications and&nbsp;users.</p> OpenLogin is PKI with Face/TouchID and Passwordless Authentication Your&nbsp;Way <p>OpenLogin is the first authentication suite to combine the simplicity of passwordless authentication with the security of non-custodial public key infrastructure (PKI). It brings the ease of passwordless, SSO, biometric authentication (WebAuthN) to any native mobile or web applications. OpenLogin makes crypto-friendly FaceID or FingerprintID possible. These user experiences are fast, familiar, and can help you convert more users at&nbsp;signup.</p><p>While each of these features is exciting, the most important detail to highlight is that each of these implementations is non-custodial.</p> Non-custodial Public Key Infrastructure means no data&nbsp;breaches <p>Torus is the only authentication platform that handles accounts in a non-custodial manner. Private keys that are analogous with accounts are generated and stored on a mixture of user devices and nodes on the Torus Key Infrastructure — they are only ever re-composable by the user. The user is always in complete control and the infrastructure is completely open-source.</p><p>This architecture circumvents the data honeypot issue that occurs with traditional account structures by removing data pools altogether, both on the infrastructure and application side:</p> On the infrastructure side <p>User accounts are represented via cryptographic keys secured across user devices and authentication systems, data encrypted only by their account. No central server to hack, meaning the risk of a data breach is virtually zero.</p> On the application side <p>With the ability to user encrypt data, because no personally identifiable information is stored on application servers, the risk of a data leak on the application side also is not possible. An attack on application servers would capture a user encrypted random string of numbers, not a user’s name, email, password or any other personable information.</p> It also means better management of user data and privacy guarantees <p>Also, instead of simply obscuring usernames, emails or passwords, or passing them on to another custodian (ahem, Amazon), using a PKI means developers get better privacy guarantees and more control over the data they collect and handle. OpenLogin doesn’t force applications to capture, handle, or secure usernames, emails, or even passwords (it also goes without saying that if data is never collected, breaches can never happen…).</p><p>Our one-of-a-kind PKI makes OpenLogin an easy choice for developers building applications that touch or handle sensitive data. It makes it easy to manage data flows, encrypt user data, and comply with GDPR, CCPA, CPRA regulations without sacrificing user experience.</p><p>OpenLogin even secures your application data upwards acting as a proxy, when you use social login. Preventing the login provider from tracking the application you’re on, similar to Apple login’s&nbsp;proxy.</p> Non-custodial PKI means digital user-sovereignty and a more open&nbsp;internet <p>Non-custodial PKI is an important step towards empowering the digital individual with self-sovereignty. Instead of login providers attesting for users, key pairs enable users to digitally sign that “I am me”, a building block for secure and private interactions on the web, from decentralized identity to digital ownership. Blockchain has popularized keys for financial use cases, and with OpenLogin we hope to bring the same guarantees to user authentication.</p> Get Started <p>OpenLogin is incredibly simple to implement.

 Shyft Network Telegram AMA — RECAP <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to the first official Shyft Network&nbsp;AMA.</p><p>It has been quite a ride so far and we are very excited for what’s in store for Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>So, why don’t we start by introducing the co-founder team that will be participating today.</p><p>Chris Forrester and Bruce Silcoff, please give the community a short intro, who you are, what role you play and, more importantly, why</p><p>Bruce Silcoff:</p><p>My name is Bruce Silcoff and I am a Co-Founder of Shyft, Head of Enterprise and Global Services, and CEO of&nbsp;PerseID.</p><p>I am a serial entrepreneur with a 30+ year proven track record of success across more than 25 businesses. I have always been focused on incubating game-changing technology solutions that solve real world problems. I am currently consumed by all disruptive blockchain solutions.</p><p>Before joining the management team at Shyft, I was a pioneer in the loyalty industry, managing some of the world’s most recognized reward programs with over 300 million customers from over 100 countries. Loyalty programs involve alternative currencies and are all about big data. As such we were doing innovative things like digital wallets and predictive modelling long before ApplePay and AI were made&nbsp;popular.</p><p>I was first attracted to Shyft as a seed investor because I recognized the potential behind the pioneering vision to use blockchain technology as a more efficient and secure KYC/AML solution. As I learned more about blockchain and its transformative power, I knew that the world was headed for a paradigm SHYFT and I wanted to be at the leading edge of this next industrial revolution…so I joined the company full time and am now a proud member of Team&nbsp;Shyft!</p><p>I bring value to the company by leveraging my experience, thought leadership, strategic guidance and an expansive network for collaborative partnership opportunities.</p><p>Chris Forrester:</p><p>Hi everyone&nbsp;:) I’m Chris, a co-founder and acting CTO of the Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Day to day, I’m the one building the tech, designs, diagrams out, helping strategize, and helping the other engineers get the best results possible from any given scenario.</p><p>Juan Aja:</p><p>Awesome, for those of you who don’t know me, I’m Juan, a co-founder and army of one, managing multiple tasks for Shyft Network including marketing, communications and operations.</p><p>My background is in law and business, I practiced corporate and securities law before changing paths and breaking into blockchain.</p><p>Why? because I believe, at my core, that blockchain is a path to enabling people to take ownership of their own wealth. That type of freedom is invaluable.</p><p>So, we are going to do a round of questions. We’ll open the chat briefly so the community can post their questions. The team will select seven questions and respond. If we have time after that, we’ll do the second round of 4–5 questions.</p><p>I also want to remind everyone that we cannot comment on price and listing, so please stick to Shyft Network as a transformative technology 😁</p><p>Also, very important, we’ll select the top 5 questions for a total price of $200 USDT/C reward to be divided among them, so make them&nbsp;count!</p> FIRST ROUND OF COMMUNITY QUESTIONS: <blockquote>🅡 Tom:<br>Do you plan on partnering with more governments on top of the government of&nbsp;Bermuda?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>Yes. Our plan is to show and sell our DiD framework to other jurisdictions by demonstrating a solution that has been deployed and actually works. Bermuda is the first of hopefully many jurisdictions.</p><blockquote>Richie Boy: <br>What do you see as the best outcome and network adoption for&nbsp;Shyft?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja: <br>So, there are a number of best-case scenarios here:</p><p>1. DeFi. Thanks to Shyft Network, institutional players step in, now confident that they can trace sources of funds and know that they are not enabling money laundering or financing terrorism. This brings about a new wave of decentralized financial services and products. More capital = better options and&nbsp;funding.</p><p>2. VASPs are compliant and using Shyft Network for all their KYC/AML. After seeing the effectiveness that the industry has on enabling users to do more with their wealth, governments finally understand that blockchain is a technology built to improve the lives of individuals.</p><p>3. Incredible new use cases are built on the platform, e.g. Digital Identity, Notarial services, digital rights management, all enabling businesses and users to finally work as GLOBAL citizens.</p><p>Bruce Silcoff: This functionality of the Network is intended to facilitate entirely new data marketplaces that empower individual users through an opt-in consent framework that protects their personally identifiable data. By building a more secure and efficient “data superhighway” for interoperable data exchange, the best outcome for network adoption would be rapid scaling by bringing together high volume data users with large holders of data (i.e. networks). That is why strategic partnerships with sector leaders of the industry, exchanges/vasp’s and with governments and their populations make sense as they will help us scale the network&nbsp;fast.</p><blockquote>Bart E:<br>Hello, I see there are a number of other groups working in this area. What partnerships have you made that make you believe SHYFT will be used universally? As opposed to other ventures.</blockquote><p>Chris Forrester:<br>Our work with the exchanges via FATF-required regulatory processes (the “Virtual Asset Service Providers”) gives Shyft’s technology and public blockchain infrastructure the demand requirement for continual progression.</p><p>Given our team’s product cycle (VASPs with our Veriscope product, and government-vetted digital identity solutions like Perseid, we believe we have enough top-down product cycles with major partners to service the network for&nbsp;years.</p><blockquote>Reinout Wijnholds ✤:</blockquote><blockquote>Hi there! Happy to be&nbsp;here.</blockquote><blockquote>So, the way I see Shyft is that it tries to bring a connection from already registered KYC information to another platform, so you’d not have to give up all the information at all the companies. Is this correct? If so, I see that blockpass has a similar vision, how would Shyft network be better than&nbsp;them?</blockquote><p>Chris Forrester:<br>Yes, much like how current O-Auth solutions function (google et al.) what needs to happen is an equivalent “log in” event to any transactional purpose. Whether it’s participating in a legitimate complaint activity like sales, exchanges, swaps, and (in specific jurisdictions) ultimately people can extend the Shyft platform as regulation evolves to incorporate new requirements of how assets are&nbsp;moved.</p><p>Our primary advantage is that we can incorporate other’s oraculized services into this routing network, with opt-in at the very top of it so that the user, at the end of the day, is in charge of their relationships and not the other way&nbsp;around</p><blockquote>Master Yi:</blockquote><blockquote>Today, the community figured out that this wallet moved the token to gate.io. As we believe that this exchange is unofficial. And then, the token moving out from gate.io and sell immediately on Uniswap. Can you clarify for the community about these suspicious transactions?</blockquote><p>Chris Forrester:<br>Hi, great question and as always transparency is important — so this move was originally said by me to be happening a couple of days ago. We are striving to be 100% transparent preemptively, and so far we’ve hit that mark. We’ll keep doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>The answer to this question: Any liquidity that has moved in this respect, was to partnered ecosystem professionals who are working on distributing liquidity in order to meet incoming demand requirements.</p><blockquote>Tim S:</blockquote><blockquote>Has Shyft had any direct contact with regulators in the US, and in particular the incoming chair of the&nbsp;SEC?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>Shyft has taken a collaborative approach to drive success. To ensure adoption and validity, we have to be in ongoing dialogue either directly or indirectly with regulators like the SEC, OECD, FATF, etc.. to make sure that our solution(s) are compliant.</p><blockquote>Philippe 🇧🇪🇧🇷:</blockquote><blockquote>Could you elaborate a bit on current and planned partnerships and community partners, and how it will add value to the Shyft proposition?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>For sure. We are currently focusing on four main verticals:</p><p>1. VASPs that are affected by the Travel Rule. These are exchanges, and other service providers that will have to deal with regulation;<br>2. DeFI, a longer play as DeFi is still somewhat in the early stages. Working with platforms that enable DeFi applications;<br>3. Governments. As Bruce said above, we are working on the deployment of a Digital Identity solution for Bermuda, once the product is deployed and proven, we plan on taking it to other jurisdictions, and<br>4. Infrastructure that expands capabilities of the Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><blockquote>Master Yi:</blockquote><blockquote>Exchanges have partnerships with Shyft — do they use shyft network as a solution for KYC? If not, when and how can they use&nbsp;it?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>We are first working with exchanges to deliver our Veriscope solution enabling them to comply with FATF’s new Travel Rule. KYC/AML and other products/solutions will also be made available to them in&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>Philippe 🇧🇪🇧🇷:</blockquote><blockquote>What is the next big milestone after Mainnet&nbsp;Launch?</blockquote><p>Chris Forrester:<br>That’s a great question&nbsp;-</p><p>So there are a few things that will be happening in the next weeks on the product side, and they’re all excited for the community.</p><p>The first will be a specific interaction point w/ metamask UI to have an extra reward from playing AMM LP liquidity up. We’ll have more details very soon but anyone that is currently providing liquidity should be eligible. This may happen before mainnet&nbsp;launch!</p><p>The second will be an incredible offer to *anyone with any erc20 stablecoin liquidity of specific well-known types*, to receive SHFT token rewards simply by taking a zero-risk 1:1 pegged movement of your existing assets into a wrapped version with opt-in compliance features. We’ll be releasing details on this amazing program shortly after mainnet launch has occurred!</p><p>Of note — we may give the community winners &amp; those that *submitted all the documentation but simply did not win the lottery for the whitelist* a chance at early usage/rewards from&nbsp;these!</p><blockquote>Sol M:<br>I love the name Shyft. It’s catchy, can you give some insight on why you went with that name, and how you plan to use the name and brand to enhance marketing?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>Thank you. So do we! While founders may have their own reasons why they like and chose the name Shyft… I like it because it best reflects what we are doing: Creating a paradigm Shyft in the way data is managed…and even the way we spell the word shift&nbsp;:)</p><blockquote>Dan:</blockquote><blockquote>Without market adoption, don’t you think that it is a bit premature introducing your own blockchain?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>Not at all. The enhancements that Chris and her team have built, the products and target customers, the technology itself, all of them require very specific security and resilience features. The scope of what we are building here requires its own infrastructure from the&nbsp;get-go.</p><blockquote>youri:</blockquote><blockquote>Nobody knows Shyft right now, when is marketing starting?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>We started building Shyft more than three years ago, but we had one thing very clear: build first, market later. That’s why we flew under the radar for so long. There are thousands of projects out there doing a ton of marketing on just a whitepaper. We decided not to do that, and now, Shyft Network is almost&nbsp;live.</p><p>I also wouldn’t say that “nobody” knows us, we have communities in &gt;5 languages, generating more than a million impressions per month for the past three months (when marketing started ramping up). And there’s a lot more to come. My co-founders have been hosted on the industry’s top podcasts and our press releases go out on top&nbsp;media.</p><blockquote>Bart E:</blockquote><blockquote>Thanks for answering our questions. You’ve outlined payments of SHFT will be needed to access the SHYFT network. Will this be enough to propel the token forward, or will you introduce other methods to draw prospective investors to the&nbsp;token?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>It all comes down to the basic economics of demand and supply. We are focused on the demand side by building or attracting viable and revenue-generating business use cases for our protocol. The more users we bring to the ecosystem, the more transactions happen, the more SHFT tokens are needed to pay for those transactions.</p><blockquote>Golden Ape:</blockquote><blockquote>Hello team, love what you&nbsp;do!</blockquote><blockquote>What is the plan for NFTs, do you see an application or a play in that&nbsp;sector?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>There is a play for NFTs. But that’s a bit further down the&nbsp;line…</p><blockquote>Peyman:</blockquote><blockquote>What’s your stake program&nbsp;plan?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>We will be releasing a blog post on this soon (not in the next few weeks though, we have mainnet and other partnerships to discuss).</p><blockquote>Reinout Wijnholds ✤:</blockquote><blockquote>How are you planning on getting Shyft out there in the world. A successful project has to be seen by others. Do you have new partnerships in&nbsp;mind?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>We have a growing BD team and it will be, along with product and marketing, one of the key activities that Shyft Network Inc. will focus on post-mainnet launch.</p><p>We are focused on building an ecosystem of VASPs, tech integrations, and developers.</p><blockquote>Base:</blockquote><blockquote>Give us an announcement u said we should expect something 😊</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>We are committed to and always hoping to share any and all good news with our loyal community of supporters. As such, we hope to share news related to technology advancements and milestones, strategic partnership signing, industry events (i.e. hackathons, conferences) and anything else deemed worthwhile.</p><p>Juan Aja:<br>We are still on track for mainnet in April. Testing has gone incredibly well and everything is coming together.</p><blockquote>youri:</blockquote><blockquote>Is there any competitor with shyft for the same use&nbsp;case?</blockquote><p>Juan Aja:<br>There are some that do small pieces of what Shyft is capable of doing, the reality is that they CAN operate and interact with SHYFT. Shyft is not a product, it’s a framework.</p><blockquote>Kras:</blockquote><blockquote>Do you plan to focus on marketing as well, in order to make Shyft more popular among the crypto&nbsp;world?</blockquote><p>Bruce Silcoff:<br>Up until recently, we have been focused on taking a whitepaper vision and making it a reality. Now that we have accomplished this, our amazing marketing team has started to aggressively spread the gospel through multiple social mediums. We recognize the importance of a strong community and are committed to growing it virally by sharing exciting accomplishments and interacting in manners such as this or conferences once things return to&nbsp;normal.</p><blockquote>🅡 Tom:</blockquote><blockquote>As you know there has been a lot of confusion regarding the Shyft token economics, and despite the very good medium articles you wrote about it. People have a hard time making distinctions between the active circulating supply (actually trading in exchanges), and the circulating supply that is used by the ecosystem and therefore not really circulating. Could you give us an estimation of what would be the active circulating supply tradable on exchange) in 4 or 5&nbsp;months.</blockquote><p>Chris Forrester:<br>Hi, so there are technical 193m tokens in the circulating supply based on the initial schedules.</p><p>I’d like to take a moment to just describe and entwine a bit with my previous response about the various community-reward sub-products we’ll be releasing shortly — these were engineered with an expectation of a specific reward-for-work.</p><p>If that specific reward means more now than before, fewer tokens will be entering the market, because the reward rate can be reflexive relative to the work performed.</p><p>So these numbers are *maximums* but depending on reward cycles may be significantly less in token amounts during a specific time period.<br>For reference, the *absolute maximum supply* of the aforementioned community-reward programs were ~5.5% and ~4.5% of the network respectively, over a 15 and 10 year time period. At this point, the number of tokens for said rewards is vastly overestimated in the distribution number I just&nbsp;gave.</p><p>Juan Aja:</p><p>Ok, so we are wrapping up the AMA. Thank you very much everyone for participating.</p> AMA Winners ($200&nbsp;USDT/C) <p>Thank you all for your questions; we were very happy with the results of the AMA and will organize more in the near future.

             April 2021   
	 
		 
			<p>This week could go down as a watershed moment for the crypto industry. Coinbase, a digital asset marketplace (DAM) for cryptocurrencies, listed on the Nasdaq just yesterday. When Netscape IPO’d in 1995 it was the beginning of the ‘dot-com’ boom, and a spate of other like-minded companies went public. What does this mean for the digital asset industry?</p>
<p>The news is undoubtedly positive for the rest of the blockchain industry,&nbsp;Coinbase was one of the first Digital Asset Marketplaces (DAM)&nbsp;to emerge as a trusted platform. It won’t be the last. Other types of marketplaces have also accelerated recently. As we recently saw with the emergence of NFTs, a number of asset specific marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible grew in tandem. Decentralized lending marketplaces have also emerged such as Aave and Compound.&nbsp;The next wave will be for security tokens.&nbsp;Now that the technology is ready, the missing piece is a recognized financial institution launching its own digital asset marketplace.</p>
<p>Indeed,&nbsp;the industry needs a credible entity to aggregate an audience of issuers and investors in a trusted and digital environment.&nbsp;These web platforms, powered by banks, asset managers and broker dealers, will help digitize capital markets by facilitating the discovery of investment opportunities. In turn, this will accelerate the qualification and subscription of investors, reducing management costs by digitally controlling securities, and ultimately improving liquidity.</p>
<p>All of this will become possible thanks to the use of a shared IT infrastructure, the blockchain, where all participants can manage and transfer assets digitally, under the control of securities issuers and marketplace operators. Using the same infrastructure creates significant network effects, where entities bringing trust will aggregate the main transactions volumes.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/">the Billboard release last week</a>,&nbsp;the first secondary market solution for tokenized securities available in Europe, we now propose an end-to-end solution for marketplace operators.</p>

					 <p>Of the 1,000+ organizations who’ve used Trinsic since we launched the world’s first <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) platform 1.5 years ago, a large subset are building “trust ecosystems”, or networks of organizations and people that can share trustworthy data in a standardized and privacy-respecting way. While Trinsic’s platform has always served as a scalable, easy-to-implement way for these trust ecosystems to incorporate the technical standards required, organizations building trust ecosystems had to solve other problems themselves, including developing ecosystem governance and building tools to facilitate adoption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is why we are excited to announce Trinsic Ecosystems, our enterprise-grade product for building Trust over IP ecosystems. Coined a “trust ecosystem in a box”, Trinsic Ecosystems is the only product that combines the technology and governance into a single solution to scale a verifiable credential ecosystem. Over the last year, we’ve worked hands-on with a set of customers building trust ecosystems, which have collectively achieved adoption of over 100,000 end-users. Now, we’re offering Trinsic Ecosystems to select additional customers as capacity allows—<a>join the waitlist</a> to be notified.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The key to creating a trust ecosystem 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A helpful model called the “<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-the-verifiable-credentials-model/">trust triangle</a>” is a good start to understanding how digital trust can be established, but issuers, verifiers, and holders won’t spontaneously create organic trust ecosystems. For years, industry nonprofits like the Sovrin Foundation and the Trust over IP Foundation have referred to a fourth party, a “<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/98/2020/05/toip_050520_primer.pdf">governance authority</a>“, which could develop a governance framework for an ecosystem. <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/">A year ago</a>, we took that one step further and introduced the concept of a “Provider”. Today, we propose driving that model all the way through to its logical conclusion by proposing that this fourth participant become a core part of the trust triangle.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A trust ecosystem needs three things to be successful: interoperable technology, trustworthy governance, and tools for adoption. Trinsic Ecosystems is designed to provide these three components in a fully-integrated, programmatic platform, built specifically for providers.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Interoperable technology 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In order for ecosystems to share and authenticate data seamlessly, standardized data models and formats must be utilized. Trinsic Ecosystems leverages the Trinsic Platform, a modular, technology-agnostic platform that allows providers to choose the tech stack they’ll build their ecosystem on—whether it’s using JSON-LD verifiable credentials that leverage existing PKI infrastructure, or ZKP-enabled credentials on the Sovrin blockchain, or other options coming soon on our roadmap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the standards and protocols evolve rapidly in the decentralized identity market, Trinsic stays abreast of changes and works to ensure continued interoperability so that you can focus on building your trust ecosystem.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Governance as code 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Developing governance for a trust ecosystem used to mean sitting in working groups in industry consortiums and drafting language through committees and Google docs. While that model still has its place, it’s wholly incomplete unless the software can effectively enforce the governance rules. Instead of making governance a purely legal construct, providers can program it into their ecosystems using Trinsic. Governance-as-code can answer the following questions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Who are the ecosystem participants, and what are their roles?: Providers vet and admit participants into their ecosystem. These participants are automatically added to a Trust over IP-compliant Trust Registry, which allows all parties to know who to trust. Providers can be interoperable with other ecosystems by incorporating other Trust Registries into their own.  What kind of data will be exchanged?: Providers determine what kind of digital credentials (ID cards, health credentials, etc.) will be issued and verified in their ecosystem. This ensures authorized issuers can issue important credentials and prevents phishing and coercion from unauthorized verifiers as well.  How will credentials be bound to customer identity, and how will access be granted?: Trinsic makes it easy to deliver wallets to end-users via browser, mobile, desktop, SMS, or in-person, while enabling cross-device syncing and offline capabilities. Providers can evaluate the trade-off between low-friction onboarding methods with strong identity binding and configure the solution that’s best for them.

			 Getting adoption from organizations 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Once an ecosystem is configured, providers need to onboard participants like issuers and verifiers. Trinsic Ecosystems comes with an API that’s extremely easy for any issuer or verifier to integrate and can be white-labeled with the name of the provider. In addition to the API, ecosystem participants can use the Trinsic Studio, a white-labeled web dashboard.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 A frictionless consumer wallet experience 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Current standalone digital wallets introduce friction and sometimes frustration for end users. The user experience of downloading an app, configuring it, scanning QR codes, accepting various prompts—all to get their first credential—is less than ideal. Cloud wallets can address this, but they’re usually build for web-first experiences, not mobile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Embedding wallet functionality into existing applications people know and love is consistently the favorite way for end-users to access their credentials. But these users also expect production-grade capabilities such as cross-device syncing, backup &amp; recovery, strong security, and offline capabilities. Developers love Trinsic for its ease of integration, allowing you to provide the tools needed for adoption in your ecosystem.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Enterprise-grade scaling 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In order for customers to adopt a solution, they must know it’s scalable. Trinsic Ecosystems supports various standard technology implementations, each with varied scalability. The most scalable options support hundreds of millions of verifications per day and thousands of credentials issued per second. That’s orders of magnitudes more scalable than other options.</p>

<p>Welcome dear Ontologists to the ultimate staking guide! This article should serve as a place to find answers to all your staking questions for you to get on the road to a successful staking experience. This article is prepared by your Telegram admin &amp; Ontology Harbinger <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Dumont</a>, and should be considered as living document, so it is always up-to-date.</p> Part 1:&nbsp;Theory  1.1) What is&nbsp;staking? <p>Staking is the process of delegating your tokens to node. To put it simply, it's process where you lock your ONT tokens to earn ONG rewards. You will never lose your staked ONT tokens, because nodes do not ever hold or manage staked tokens. The only risk may be the staking lock period, which may not be suitable for active traders or short term holders. If a node operator cancels their node, your staked tokens will behave as if you had canceled your stake, and will be available to claim after the respective lock&nbsp;period.</p> 1.2) What are block and consensus rounds? <p>A block is a fundamental part of blockchain which stores information about transactions. At Ontology, production of 1 block takes from 1 second to 30 seconds, which means, that if someone performs a transaction every second, the block will be produced every second. For comparison, production of 1 bitcoin block takes approx. 10 minutes. This shows how ultra-fast the Ontology blockchain is- it has almost instant transactions. If no transactions appear for 30 seconds, an empty block is produced to keep consensus rounds flowing while giving it finite duration. It is set that 1 consensus round consists of 60 000 blocks. Through simple calculation means consensus round duration is from 16,66 hours to 20,83 days. So the higher the traffic, the faster the rounds. Currently the average duration of a consensus round is approx. 7 days. To track rounds use <a href="http://node.ont.io/stake">node.ont.io/stake</a> which displays the start/end times of the last 5 rounds as well as an approx. time until the end of the current&nbsp;round.</p> 1.3) What role consensus rounds play in the&nbsp;staking? <p>Staking is dependent on consensus rounds. So how do they work? Each staking event or change happens when a consensus round ends. That means, for example, if you submit your ONT stake during round 139, it will become active and locked when round 139 ends and it will then start generating ONG rewards. Until then, your stake is not active, hence it does not generate ONG rewards. Same applies when you decide to cancel your stake. If you cancel your stake during round 139, it will stay locked until round 139 (or 140) ends, depending on the node type. Moreover, respective ONG rewards are claimable by stakers after each consensus round&nbsp;ends.</p> 1.4) Node&nbsp;types <p>There are 2 node types, consensus nodes and candidate nodes. Full list and ranking of nodes is available at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>. From an ONT staker point of view the main differences are:</p>  consensus nodes (rank top 15): lock period of current round + 1 full round, lower rewards, distribute foundation bonus (top 7), rarely change reward distribution ratio  candidate nodes (rank 16+): lock period of current round only, higher rewards, do not distribute foundation bonus, can change reward distribution ratio more&nbsp;often  <p>For most stakers, it is better to stake for candidate nodes, because they have higher rewards and shorter lock period after cancelling your&nbsp;stake.</p> 1.5) Where do the staking rewards come&nbsp;from? <p>There are 3 ONG rewards for ONT stakers. I’ve broken down which node types distribute these rewards to&nbsp;stakers:</p>  transaction fees collected during consensus round (both node&nbsp;types)  released ONG based on release model (both node types) — read more about this in point 4&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/strengthening-ontologys-governance-and-staking-economic-model-245faf02107a">(here)</a>  foundation bonus (top 7 consensus nodes&nbsp;only)   1.6) Why do candidate nodes have better&nbsp;rewards? <p>Consensus nodes and candidate nodes split the rewards (transaction fees and released ONG) 50/50. Currently there is approximately 167,7m ONT at consensus nodes while only 25,1m ONT at candidate nodes. Due to the fact that candidate nodes currently have much less ONT tokens in staking/nodes and they distribute the same amount of rewards as consensus nodes, their rewards per 1 ONT are much&nbsp;higher.</p> 1.7) Are there any special&nbsp;nodes? <p>Nodes can, of course, decide to use different ways of rewarding their stakers. For instance, they can distribute their own token, or some airdrop. Currently there is only one such node, Sesameseed. They distribute all staking rewards using their special SEED token. In this case, your staking reward isn’t ONG, it is SEED token. Read more about that in the <a href="https://medium.com/sesameseedorg/sesameseed-is-now-operating-on-ontology-f2a97378bf44">article</a>. In the past, the MovieBloc node also used to distribute to stakers extra rewards in the form of MBL tokens, but that has&nbsp;ended.</p> 1.8) What is the lock&nbsp;period? <p>Lock period is time you need to wait until your ONT tokens are unlocked from staking. Consensus nodes have 1 full round extra lock period, while candidate nodes have lock period until end of current consensus round. Example: You cancel stake at consensus node during round 110. That means your ONT tokens will be unlocked and ready to claim when round 111 ends. If you cancel stake at candidate node during round 110, your ONT tokens will be claimable when round 110 ends. If you want to be flexible, it is better to stake with candidate nodes, because lock periods are much&nbsp;shorter.</p> 1.9) How to understand data at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>? <p>There are 2 lists — Top 15 nodes are consensus nodes and the rest are candidate nodes. Let’s explain the meaning of all the&nbsp;columns.</p>Screenshot from node.ont.io website<p>a) Total stake: user stake (tokens staked by individual stakers)+ node&nbsp;stake</p><p>b) Node stake: amount of ONT which node operator locked at his node as initial stake when creating the&nbsp;node</p><p>c) Fee sharing ratio: Basically, imagine the node ONT tokens split into 2 parts, the node’s initial stake as first part while second part are user stake. Popular ratio can be 10%/90%. The first figure (10%) stands for how much of the rewards, which the node receives for their initial node stake, they distribute to stakers. The second figure (90%), stands for how much of the rewards, which the node receives for user staked tokens, they distribute to stakers. Example: (node initial stake 10k ONT, user stake 100K ONT, ratio 10%/90%, reward per 1 ONT are lets say 0.01 ONG) In this hypothetical case, node receives for 10k initial stake 100 ONG from which 10% he gives evenly to stakers and for 100K user stake node receives 1000 ONG from which 90% he gives evenly to stakers. Sum: Stakers share 910 ONG in total, while node operator keeps 190 ONG. If the ratio was 0%/85% that would mean the stakers share is 850 ONG and the node operator keeps 250&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>d) Annualized yield: (APY) represents real time dynamic value of expected yearly rewards for current stakers for next consensus round. It’s calculated in real time based on multiple factors, such as total amount of ONT in staking and nodes, sharing ratio set by node operator, real time market price of ONT and ONG tokens, etc. You can see with price volatility how APY dynamically changes. For example, if the price of ONG goes up 100% and ONT stays at the same value the staking APY would double. New nodes can display crazy numbers like 1000000% APY, but its only because they have very low size of user stake, such as 1 ONT token. When more stakes are added, rewards will drop to normal values very quickly. It is a side effect of real time calculation of APY. To calculate your approximate returns, you can use a <a href="https://node.ont.io/calculator/node">calculator.</a></p><p>e) Reached stake cap: Node operator can set a maximum size of 10x allowed user stake of his initial node stake. Reached stake cap means how much of the max user stake capacity node currently has. Example: A node with 10K initial node stake can accept a maximum of 100K user stakes. In order to create room for more stakers, they would need to increase their initial node stake. If they were to add another 5k ONT to their initial node stake, their node can accept an additional 50k user stake,&nbsp;etc.</p> Part 2:&nbsp;Practice  2.1) How to&nbsp;stake? <p>Altough there are third-party options, to get the highest rewards I recommend using an official Ontology wallet such as <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO </a>mobile or <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet</a> for PC. Step-by-step guidelines for both wallets on how to stake your tokens can be found directly at <a href="http://node.ont.io/stake">node.ont.io/stake</a>.</p><p>Once you have ONT tokens in your wallet, you will also need ONG tokens to pay for gas fees. To submit staking you need 0.05 ONG, to claim first rewards also 0.05 ONG, same for canceling stake and claiming unlocked tokens. I recommend to always have 1 ONG in your wallet to pay the gas fees. Don’t send all ONG to exchanges, because you will not be able to make any transactions without 0.05&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>Once you stake your ONT tokens, there is no action required anymore. It will stay staked until you decide to cancel the stake manually or the node operator quit the node. If a node operator cancels their node, your staked tokens will behave as if you had canceled your stake, and will be available to claim after the respective lock&nbsp;period.</p> 2.2) What is the minimal amount of ONT to&nbsp;stake? <p>You can stake from as low as 1 ONT token since July 2020. First staking version required 500 ONT units but that is history&nbsp;now.</p> 2.3) How to select best&nbsp;node? <p>Based on all above information in part 1, it is clear that best rewards are currently offered by candidate nodes. How to pick the best? It is essential to check the sharing ratio column 7 and APY column 8 at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>. When checking the sharing ratio, keep in mind that first % is how much of the rewards, which the node generates by their initial stake, they distribute to stakers. The higher that number the better, but if the node does not reach full staking capacity, it is also important how big their initial node stake is (5% from 100K is more than 10% from 10K). Then check the second % of share ratio. I would not recommend staking with nodes offering lower than 90%, if possible. Also be careful if you stake with nodes offering high ratio. They often use this tactic to attract new stakers and once they collect enough stake, they will drop the rewards. In case you stake with nodes that offer 90/90 or 100/100, check regularly at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a> whether to see if they lowered the ratio, thus giving you fewer rewards. Some nodes like our admins node ►CZ/SK Ontology community node◄ made a public promise to not change our ratio. It can be good to know who is the node operator when selecting a node for staking. Read the article about our node&nbsp;<a href="https://dumontiskooo.medium.com/be-smart-maximize-your-staking-potential-with-ontology-telegram-admins-node-96a2b81d2dbf">here.</a></p> 2.4) Where to get&nbsp;ONG? <p>If you do not know where to get ONG tokens, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ontology-gas/markets/">here at CMC </a>you can find the list of exchanges that offer ONG trading pairs. The most popular is definitely <a href="https://accounts.binance.cc/en/register?ref=27915785">Binance</a>. In case you have your ONT tokens in ONTO Wallet and have no ONG for fees, you can use this guide to use the fee-less swap for 1 ONT to ONG at market rate — <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/assets/swapping-ont-for-ong">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/assets/swapping-ont-for-ong</a>. Lastly, you can also ask somebody to donate a few ONG to get started, if the above options are not available to&nbsp;you.</p> 2.5) When will I get rewards for staking and how to&nbsp;claim? <p>You will get rewards after each fully staked consensus round, for example, you stake during round 110, you will get first rewards for round 111 when round 111 ends. The rewards balance updates once the round ends. Then you can either claim your rewards or keep accumulating. There is no need to claim after each&nbsp;round.</p> 2.6) What to do with ONG&nbsp;tokens? <p>This depends on everyone’s personal strategy, some possibilities are:</p>  HODL ONG tokens for possible future higher price appreciation  Sell ONG for ONT, and keep increasing your staking&nbsp;position  Sell ONG tokens for different tokens/projects  Provide ONG tokens as liquidity for example at <a href="http://wing.finance">wing.finance</a> or <a href="http://ontology.unifiprotocol.com">ontology.unifiprotocol.com</a>   2.7) When will ONT tokens be unlocked after canceling your&nbsp;stake? <p>Read section 1.8 of this article to learn when your tokens will be unlocked. Estimated duration of current round, plus duration of previous rounds you can find at <a href="http://node.ont.io/stake">node.ont.io/stake</a></p> ENJOY STAKING! <p>If you have any questions, or to report missing or wrong content, or if you want to tip my wallet to buy me a cup of coffee, please reach me on <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Twitter.</a> See&nbsp;you!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ultimate-ontology-staking-guide-e70c44330429">Ultimate Ontology Staking Guide</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the beginning, AERGO selected the best advisors from the financial, technical, and the crypto world. These advisors helped to launch the AERGO project and set the tone for future directions.</p><p>AERGO has made great strides in 2020 and the momentum is carrying into 2021. Now it is not about launching the platform, rather getting corporations and consumers to adopt the platform. There are a lot of projects that Blocko, closest partner, utilized AERGO to production in many of the large corporate customers, such as Hyundai, Shinhan Bank, Lotte Cards, and many more. We have consumer applications around NFT and credential certifications with CCCV and CRISPY&nbsp;WHALES.</p><p>Now is the time to recruit new advisors that will help AERGO penetrate the everyday services and companies. In the next few months we will select advisors who are experts and influencers in their own industry. We have a clear vision and reason for selecting our advisors, the collaboration with the advisors will bring meaningful outcomes to&nbsp;AERGO.</p><p>It is our pleasure to announce our latest advisor Dr. Min Sun Park. Dr. Park is the founder and the director of The Clean Clinic (<a href="http://www.thecleanclinic.com/">http://www.thecleanclinic.com/</a>). Dr. Park holds a PHD in Nephrology and specializes in internal medicine and Hemodialysis. New to blockchain, Dr. Park has been studying and sees a place for blockchain in the medical field. Her clinic caters to many patients daily and soon will be an administerer for Covid19 vaccines. Dr. Park is allowing AERGO to explore real applications and deploy proof of concepts right in her clinic. This is a huge step in using real data to create solutions on the AERGO platform. Dr. Park will advocate in the medical industry the use of blockchain and evangelize AERGO.</p><p>We are very lucky to have such an enthusiastic advisor in the medical industry. Some may just discuss and theorize, but our new approach in selecting the next generation of advisors will allow AERGO to execute real life applications. Dr. Park is the first of many relevant advisors that will advance AERGO to the next&nbsp;level.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-advisors-the-next-generation-9694de8352b8">AERGO Advisors- The Next Generation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As I pored over <a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_/status/1379858946446462977">the most recent dev updates</a>, I struggled to find a cohesive story to share. There’s no one thing I can point to and say “See, this is what’s happened since the last Dev Pulse.” Just a lot of small updates. And then I realised — that is the message. Right now we’re making consistent, steady progress. Components are being optimised and rewritten, bugs are being found, core apps are seeing accelerated development. For those who would rather not read a tweet stream, here are the major points:</p>  HPOS, the HoloPort operating system, has seen a version bump of Holochain that’ll make integration of all the upcoming improvements a lot faster. This has involved a bit of work updating the Holo hosting components — Chaperone/Envoy (the parts that connect the user to their chosen host) and the HoloPort/Holochain API.  One of the upcoming improvements is a new proxy server, which is substantially faster than the previous one. The devs are currently working through a bug in which gossip is sometimes slower than before, and then it'll go to testing.  Another improvement is a new database layer built on <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. It's is unoptimised and currently slower than the current one built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database">LMDB</a>; our expectation is that it will enable optimisations that make it as fast or faster, as well as new Holochain features (such as sharding) that make the entire network more efficient.  There are now low-level components that install hosted hApps onto HoloPorts (previously the hApps were hard-coded).  DeepKey, our distributed public key infrastructure application, is in <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/branches/active">active development</a>. It features the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/blob/main/zomes/deepkey/src/change_rule/validate.rs">most</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/blob/main/zomes/deepkey/src/keyset_root/validate.rs">complex</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/blob/2021-03-24-key-registration/zomes/deepkey/src/key_registration/validate.rs">validation</a> code of any hApp we know of, and requires rigorous testing. So we’ve introduced a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/674">mocking framework</a> that lets you <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/blob/2021-03-17-keyset-mock/zomes/deepkey/src/change_rule/validate.rs#L291-L326">unit-test</a> any of your functions that use the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.100/hdk/index.html#modules">host API</a>.  Elemental Chat’s registration process is getting support for joining codes, so we can open it up to the wider world of the web while maintaining a manageable number of alpha testers. This feature will be available to any Holo-hosted hApp that needs ‘<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#membrane-proof">membrane proofs</a>’.  Rigorous testing of the Elemental Chat registration process has revealed a few bugs in the way Holochain handles cell creation.  <p>That last bullet is an interesting one, and I think it might help you understand just a bit more about what’s going on under the hood if I try to explain where those bugs are coming from.</p><p>The bugs we’re seeing are all about setting up a <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#cell">‘cell’</a> for a new web user on their assigned HoloPort. A cell is a combination of an app binary (or <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#dna">DNA</a>) plus an <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#agent-id">agent ID</a>, and every agent who wants to use the app must have one running. (In fact, if there are no cells — no users actively using the app — the app can’t really be said to exist.) The cell is how you (or rather, the UI on your computer) interact with your own data in your <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#source-chain">source chain</a> and others’ data from the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#distributed-hash-table-dht">DHT</a>.</p> Preserving your agency <p>As you probably know, Holo hosting is a compromise between the full P2P, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#agent-centric">agent-centric</a> world of Holochain and the centralised world of the web. But one thing we refused to compromise was your agency, which is most powerfully expressed in your ability to choose what goes into your source chain. That source chain is a public record of the things you’ve done in the app, and you don’t want anyone else messing around with it.</p><p>In order to preserve agency at this level, a HoloPort should never be able to write to your source chain, even if it wanted to. You see, every source chain entry has to be signed by your <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#public-key-cryptography">private key</a>, which is a secret component of your agent ID. The signature has to cryptographically check out against your public key (which appeared in element #3 of your source chain). And that private key is generated and safely stored in your browser every time you log in. That’s what protects you from being impersonated by a rogue HoloPort.</p><p>The way Holochain apps work, when you want to perform an action (say, publish a tweet) your UI calls a function in the cell, which ‘stages’ a few writes to the source chain. Then the Holochain runtime validates those writes against the DNA’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#validation-function">validation rules</a>, creates a signature for each of them using your private key, and writes them to storage.</p><p>But this creates a bit of a problem if your private key is on your machine and your cell is on a HoloPort. So the HoloPort has to send a signing request back to your browser, consisting of all the source chain writes it wants you to sign. This happens in a separate HTTP cycle.</p><p>Now there’s another problem: there’s a very thin window of time, between making a function call and signing the writes, where you might just close your browser and scuttle your HoloPort’s attempt to get those writes approved. If that happens during registration, where your HoloPort is trying to write your Elemental Chat invite code and public key to your source chain (the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#genesis-elements">genesis elements</a>), it can’t actually create a valid cell for you.</p><p>So the Holo dev team is working on addressing that edge case. There are two parts to this: one is to fix an issue where the Holochain conductor locks up on failed validation (that’s just a common bug with an engineering solution <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/holo-nixpkgs/pull/790">on the way</a>), and the other is to recover gracefully when the genesis elements can’t get signed on first try.</p> Keeping bad actors out of the network <p>With Holochain, every application (or rather, every DNA within every <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#dna-bundle">hApp bundle</a>) enjoys its own isolated network with its own separate store of data (its <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#distributed-hash-table-dht">DHT</a>). And sometimes it makes sense to restrict access to that network.</p><p>For this we have the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#membrane-proof">‘membrane proof’</a>, an element near the beginning of your source chain, that supplies some sort of evidence that you should belong to the network you’re trying to join. Depending on the app, it could be a simple invite code, or it could be something complex such as a cryptographic certificate signed by three existing members. This membrane proof is something you supply when you start up your cell, and it’s validated by your initial <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#bootstrapping">bootstrap</a> peers before they let you access the rest of the network and its data.</p><p>Elemental Chat is one of those applications; it requires an invite code on signup. The Holo single-sign-on dialog has a field you can paste your invite code into; this gets passed on to your assigned HoloPort.</p><p>But what happens when you get the invite code wrong? The validator network should reject you before you even get the chance to take a look at the data in the DHT. This is tricky, because you’re supposed to self-validate before joining — that prevents you from publishing bad data. But if validating the invite code requires access to DHT data, you might not be able to self-validate!</p><p>This chicken-and-egg problem has sparked a series of discussions about the best way to handle membrane proof validation. It’s an example of the sorts of engineering challenges the dev team face regularly, challenges in which they have to consider the impact on user experience while maintaining commitment to a ‘correct’ design that ensures data integrity. (I love observing their conversations; it makes me feel smart but also gives me a sobering appreciation for how much I still have to learn about Holochain’s inner workings.)</p><p>The first step is to fix a bug that locks up Holochain when the Elemental Chat invite code is invalid. As with the previous section, this is just a routine engineering matter. The more important step, currently being worked on in parallel to the bugfix, is to identify the most sensible design for membrane proof validation — one that is easy for developers to understand and use, ensures correctness, and minimises unpleasant user experience.</p><p>The most likely candidate design involves a three-step process:</p>  The agent’s cell calls a basic sanity check callback on the membrane proof; this can do things like check for correct structure or catch typos.  The agent’s cell tries to bootstrap into the network and publish their genesis entries; selected peers validate the membrane proof properly, potentially using DHT data in the process.  The agent detects whether they’ve successfully been granted access to the network; if they haven’t, they destroy their cell and try again with a new agent ID (and possibly a new membrane proof, depending on how the app’s membrane protection is designed).  <p>The goal of this process is to catch as many classes of honest mistakes as possible before you try to join the network, while still allowing the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#immune-system">immune system</a> to identify truly bad actors and giving you a chance to try again if you’re mistakenly identified as one yourself.</p> So what does this mean for hosted Elemental chat? <p>By now you’re probably wondering whether that long-awaited <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">milestone</a>, hosted Elemental chat for web users, is being delayed.</p><p>Nope! This is all an expected part of the development cycle. When theory meets the real world, there’s always a process of adjusting the two to match each other. I’m glad to see it happening; it means we’re identifying all the weird edge cases that tend to hide when it’s all just theory. And as we deal with each edge case, it’s just going to make Holo-hosted apps (and Holochain in general) that much better.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@christianlue?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Christian Lue</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/broken-glass?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>As part of the GAIA-X 4 Future Mobility Project, the collaboration will allow corporate and individual users of mobility services to monetize their data while preserving their&nbsp;privacy</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is joining forces with <a href="http://datarella.com">Datarella</a> to expand the Open Data Economy. Their first project will be under the umbrella of <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/">GAIA-X</a>, the European Association for Data &amp; Cloud, as part of the GAIA-X 4 Future Mobility Project, which aims at bringing cloud applications to autonomous &amp; networked vehicles.</p><p>The project’s overall goal will be the creation of a decentralized ecosystem of data &amp; services that allows autonomous &amp; networked vehicles to integrate into smart infrastructures and third-party services, following GAIA-X’s design principles. With mutual trust as its core concept, its stated goal will be achieving data sovereignty.</p><blockquote>Our deep belief is for data to be treated as an asset. By tapping into underutilized data from mobility IoT sensors, AI can uncover mobility patterns and optimize services / reduce waste. Machines can speak to each other and algorithms can make optimizations — all in real-time. Ocean can tokenize mobility data from devices, thereby creating an opportunity for these tokens to be used as instruments in DeFi projects. This is one of the many ways in which we enable data owners to share in the value their data&nbsp;creates.</blockquote><blockquote>Razvan Olteanu, COO of Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Different market actors will price data differently, depending on the method of data generation, data quality, and its utility to the potential buyer. Ocean Market allows for dynamic pricing and thus for optimal value generation for data generators and data curators, in a privacy-preserving manner.</p><p>This project will use Datarella’s Enterprise Blockchain Solutions which prominently features Ocean Protocol technology in its stack. This will serve as the foundational, underlying protocol for digital business transformation with converging technologies such as AI and autonomous machines. Datarella’s future mobility solutions are fueled by blockchain technology, real-time decentralized data management, transparency and GDPR compliance. Given the natural synergies between Ocean and Datarella, this partnership is the first of many that will drive enterprise adoption of Ocean Protocol technology in Datarella’s client&nbsp;base.</p><blockquote>For Datarella, technology is an instrument to increase the quality of living, by supporting human beings in all kinds of professional and private activities. The growing complexity and diversity of our ecosystem require technological infrastructures that facilitate collaboration and cooperation. By planning, developing and implementing blockchain solutions worldwide, Datarella meets this requirement: in the fields of Finance, Supply Chain, and Mobility, we enable industry participants to join forces and create sustainable, crisis-proof business&nbsp;models.</blockquote><blockquote>Michael Reuter, CEO of Datarella</blockquote><p>Ocean Protocol (BigchainDB) is a Day 1 Member of GAIA-X Association AISBL, an international non-profit organisation established to achieve the GAIA-X project goals for the development of an efficient, competitive, secure and trustworthy federation of data infrastructure and service providers for Europe — fostering digital sovereignty of European cloud service&nbsp;users.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability. OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">oceanprotocol.com</a> to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://blockfolio.com/coin/OCEAN_3">Blockfolio</a> | <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8TXwmWWAE9TZO0yTBHB3A">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ocean_protocol">Reddit</a> | <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram Chat</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">Discord</a></p> About Datarella <p>Datarella GmbH is an established provider of Enterprise Blockchain Solutions.

<p>Using Helm Charts to set up the Epirus Chain Explorer and connect it to a running Quorum&nbsp;network.</p><p>Some weeks ago we published an <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/quorum-kubernetes-templates-6cda506a6887">article</a> in which we refer to one of our <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/quorum-raft-helm-template/tree/main">GitHub projects</a> that you can use to deploy a quorum network with a dynamic amount of nodes to your Kubernetes cluster. In this article, I will describe how to set up our newest addition to the Helm Chart — the Epirus block explorer.</p> Why we use&nbsp;Epirus <p>If you come across the task to choose a block explorer in 2021 you will most likely have 2–3 viable solutions of which some are licensed and some are free to use. Most Ethereum Clients will most likely favor <a href="https://blockscout.com/poa/sokol/">BlockScout</a>, an open-source block explorer with a wide variety of features. But, if it comes to quorum-based networks we discovered some quirks that do now align well with BlockScout. One example would be the BlockScout having <a href="https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/issues/3294">problems parsing rafts block timestamp</a> which is in nanoseconds instead of seconds. We discovered that those kinds of problems often arise with open-sourced explorers in combination with quorum-based networks. This could be due to the enterprise nature of quorum which ultimately could lead to fewer open-source contributions.</p><blockquote>Based on those discoveries we decided to stick with the explorer that is covering most of quorums peculiarities and is also referred to in the official quorum documentation — <a href="https://www.web3labs.com/epirus-explorer">Epirus</a>.</blockquote> How to deploy the&nbsp;Explorer <p>To deploy the Epirus Explorer to your cluster adjust the epirus values in the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/quorum-raft-helm-template/blob/main/quorum/values.yaml">values.yaml file</a>. Enable the ingress value to make it accessible locally or adjust the node value to change to which node Epirus will connect&nbsp;to.</p><p>After adjusting these values simply run helm install — if you don't have a running cluster — or helm upgrade if you already deployed a cluster on your machine to deploy/upgrade the&nbsp;charts.</p> helm install nnodes quorum -n quorum-network                       helm upgrade nnodes quorum -n quorum-network  Accessing the&nbsp;UI <p>After a successful deployment of the explorer, we can access the UI using the Cluster’s IP. Run the following command to get the IP and go to &lt;cluster-ip&gt;/dashboard.</p> kubectl cluster-info <p>If everything deployed and started successfully you should be welcomed by the Epirus Dashboard. Navigate to the different tabs on the left to get information on contracts, transactions, blocks, and the network&nbsp;itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> based in Stuttgart is a provider of crypto-economy solutions.</p><p>51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of Blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/epirus-chain-explorer-for-quorum-2695ef417dbc">Epirus Chain Explorer for Quorum</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 1. Update on Canada’s Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (Tim Bouma) 
<p>• Video Link: <a href="https://youtu.be/WAvjFuJqEYw">https://youtu.be/WAvjFuJqEYw</a><br>
• Guest: <a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma">https://twitter.com/trbouma</a></p>
<p>I’m excited because we just put the finishing touches on the use case chapter for the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">self-sovereign identity book</a> that Drummond Reed will be talking about later.&nbsp;The title of the chapter is “Canada: Enabling Self-sovereign Identity,” and we’ve got substantive information in there.</p>
<p>There are about 10 or 12 pages of content. I’ll walk you through some of the things that we’ve been going through in the Canadian Public Sector, and I’ll connect it back to this product that you see on the screen.</p>
<p>The PCTF model.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/">https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/</a></p>
<p>We’ve been looking at self-sovereign identity for a long time in terms of what the technologies are and what the model is. Things are still evolving.</p>
<p>In the early days of identity management, we had more of a program-centric point of view. First, we shifted it to a user-centric point of view, and now we’re moving to a self-sovereign point of view. We’ve learned a great deal over the years, if not the decades, and we’ve been able to come up with a policy approach or a Pan-Canadian approach that doesn’t necessarily lock us into any particular technology.</p>
<p>In fact, when we started in earnest on the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, self-sovereign identity wasn’t even a term that existed yet. It might have existed in certain quarters, but it was certainly something that we weren’t aware of.</p>
<p>We began to get familiar with the concepts, and we followed very closely with what Drummond has been doing in the self-sovereign community. We’re actively ingesting those concepts into the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework.</p>
<p>Because we’re the Public Sector, we’ve also had to pay very close attention to many legacy systems, centralized systems, that is, the Federated systems. They’re not going away anytime soon, so we have to come up with an approach that’s a synthesis that enables those systems to come together effectively. This is the current status of what we’ve been calling the ‘public sector profile’ of the Pan-Canadian Trust framework.</p>

Definition:
<p>It’s a model of agreed-upon concepts, definitions of processes and conformance criteria. Equally important is an analytical approach that enables us to do a detailed assessment of other jurisdictions, such as other sectors, so we can accept trusted digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing that’s happened behind the scenes is our active work with the Government of Canada over the past ten years. In 2009, we introduced our first policy instrument: the directive on identity management. Ten years later, in 2019, we revised it. When we updated the directive, we added several new concepts, such as trusted digital identity and trust frameworks. The additions have enabled us to accept self-sovereign identity or <a href="https://northernblock.io/">trusted digital identity</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve been taking those ideas and making sure they fit seamlessly into the policy framework that we’ve been developing. That way, we can truly be ready for the future and not be locked into the past. This approach is proving itself out.</p>
<p>You may not be aware: as of February 10th, we have the province of British Columbia integrated into the federal programs within the Canada Revenue Agency. We also have the example of the province of Alberta, which is integrated into the My Service Canada account and accepting the trusted digital identities. I spoke earlier about traditional legacy human integrations: Now, we’re setting the stage for enabling <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">digital wallets</a> and the notion of self-sovereign identity, so an individual can present their trusted digital identity to be consumed by the federal government.</p>
<p>We’ve been conceptualizing to help us fit this together. I’m showing you a block diagram here: we have this all up on <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/">GitHub</a>, so you can read about it, along with formal definitions. What we’re calling the normative core of the model is that we formally define what we call Identity Domains, Foundational Identity, and Contextual Identity. We formalize this notion of digital representations, the identity of individuals and organizations, and businesses. We’re looking at relationships.</p>
<p>We defined many atomic processes; that’s the required detail that enabled us to do the conformity assessments and evaluate dependencies on other organizations or other jurisdictions. We can apply that against the conformance criteria and qualifiers. It’s really a conformity assessment framework. Now, we have the ability to do the due diligence to accept a Province as an issuer of claims, to use some of the lingo in self-sovereign identity. Quite frankly, digital identity or trusted digital identity is simply a very specific use case of the broader case of verifiable credentials and self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>The other part is the Mutual Recognition Process. We go through from the bottom to the top: mapping the processes, aligning them to other frameworks. We’re starting to have conversations with the <a href="https://www.eid.as/">eIDAS</a>, what we call the digital nations.</p>
<p>These are other countries with whom we can start mutual recognition, have a formal assessment, and an acceptance process.</p>
<p>There’s a notion of digital ecosystem roles and supporting infrastructure. We know that this has to work with existing investments and existing infrastructure, and also has to fit into institutional frameworks. So, we’ve spent a lot of effort on formally defining this.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/version-1-1-of-the-pan-canadian-trust-framework-is-now-available-feacc883d190">https://trbouma.medium.com/version-1-1-of-the-pan-canadian-trust-framework-is-now-available-feacc883d190</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Model of Verifiable Credentials</a> and self-sovereign identity, you’re probably familiar with the roles of issuer, holder and verifier.&nbsp; We’ve mapped that out more fully with the idea of Subject and Claims. We’ve also added another box at the bottom, which we’re calling “Methods.” What we’ve learned is that you need to trust an entire system. That’s more than just a single organization; it’s more than a blockchain; it’s more than a database. It’s a set of methods through which you can register and confirm, but also make sure that everything is correct and nothing has been changed. I wanted to show that in the diagram. We found that we can take this model and we can map authoritative parties, relying parties, and service providers. We do have a mapping in the trust framework.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing that we’ve learned is that we’re making a clear separation between what we’ve been calling the “conveyance network”: that is, processes that actually convey the proofs versus those that issue and verify the proofs. Now we know where the infrastructure players can fit in. It doesn’t matter whether it’s centralized, federated or blockchain, or completely decentralized. We know how to box those things in the middle to actually convey the proofs. Our primary concern is making sure that whatever gets issued onto that network, we actually trust in the first place. And then when it gets verified, it hasn’t changed since. We have a nice, clear separation now.</p>
<p>We’ve also been working with Drummond to make sure that we’re mapping with the notion of four layers in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> stack, and this is where we’ve mapped to the model of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Normative Core and the Mutual Recognition set up the layer of Governance Frameworks when mapped to the stack. It’s not a formal governance framework per se, when viewed with the larger picture of legislation, regulation, and formal agreements between jurisdictions. It fits in very nicely, a little below there.</p>
<p>Layer 3, the Credential Exchange, basically that encompasses the Digital Ecosystem Roles that Drummond will be talking about a little bit later.</p>
<p>All the aspects of the bottom two layers of the stack, DIDComm and DID Registries, fit into the notion of Supporting Infrastructure.</p>
<p>It’s not directly within the scope of the PCTF, but we see the massive potential of these emerging technologies. We also understand that we have to effectively support traditional technologies, such as SAML integrations, and OpenID Connect. So, we’re making sure that we can actually migrate to the new platforms without burning the old platforms down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that this has to fit into the larger context of making sure we meet our digital service delivery level requirements, the user needs, and so on.</p>
<p>We’re not reinventing privacy and security; we already have a privacy impact assessment/security assessment authorization. We know there are several interoperability standards, and we’re not redefining those things; in fact, we’re leveraging that. Coming back to the province of BC during the assessment process, that was only one of eight work streams that were involved in actually on-boarding a Province. There were also communications, agreements, the privacy impacts assessments, technical integrations, security assessment, and there was an overall governance stream.</p>
<p>This shows how everything fits together. I know it’s a bit of a mile-a-minute here, but returning to the chapter that we had written, I’ll just read some of the statements that we made. We said:</p>
<p>“Trust Frameworks such as PCTF and self-sovereign identity are parts of a larger global picture. Domestically and internationally, there is a new and emerging global equal system incorporating a mixture of new technologies and legacy systems. It is anticipated that these technologies and approaches will co-exist just for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p>As I said, we have assessed and accepted integration from the province of Alberta and the Province of BC. They used traditional integration methods, but we certainly see how we could actually integrate the <a href="https://www.aceprogram.ca/">Alberta Credentials Ecosystem</a> and also the <a href="https://vonx.io/">British Columbia Verifiable Organizations Network</a>. There are other activities that BC is doing, activities taking place in Ontario and globally as well.</p>
<p>We’re actively pursuing SSI. It’s still too early to predict the future. That’s one thing that we’ve learned, we’ve got to keep our options open as much as possible. With what I’ve shown here, the PCTF is a tool to help relate SSI into the government context, and to drive the hard task of the institutional change needed to better serve Canadians. Honestly, the hard part is dealing with all the legal folks and the policy folks. You don’t see that on the surface, but that’s where a lot of the hard work resides. We see this approach encouraging new institutional relationships that can leverage self-sovereign identity. If we do it right, it’s going to become pervasive, and it’s going to create a better digital ecosystem.</p>
 2. Update from Joni Brennan, President of the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) 
 Digital Identity in Canada 
<p>Mathieu: I think that gets you much closer to a user-centric scenario that is security-by-design, and privacy-by-design. All of these experiences that we’re striving for, come from having the ability to be selective about what you’re sharing or not sharing, and from the ability to be selective about your personas, as you mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Moving on, I appreciate the overview here of Digital ID as a whole, but now, I’d like to look at Digital ID from a Canadian perspective. You would have great visibility into this, at both a federal and provincial level — it’s apparent that many of the government bodies here in Canada are investing significantly into their digital identity strategies. They’re working hard to fully revamp the architecture and accelerate the progress towards some of these goals that we’ve been talking about here.</p>
<p>How do you see digital identity in Canada, and how does it compare to what’s happening in other countries or regions like the European Union? I think there’s a lot of innovation and leadership happening in Canada. How do you compare the digital identity progression in Canada to what you’re seeing in the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, there is. That’s a great question, and I would say it’s also a particularly interesting question to me, as an immigrant from New Jersey to Canada. From that perspective, feeling the cultural differences of how particular regions might look at things, and also being someone who’s worked in the space in a global landscape — I would say there are times when we’re not always good at calling out the places where we are moving forward. There are times when we are also falling behind, so there’s not a singular perfect answer. If we get into levels of assurance, we’ll talk about the importance of having more defined scorecards to measure progress. Where we are, and how we’re doing — it very much depends on what kind of question we’re asking.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, DIACC (Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada) put out a white paper titled “Building Canada’s Digital Future”. The white paper outlined that the opportunity for the public and private sectors to come together in Canada, and to put an economic-benefits-for-all approach at the forefront of the economy, is important for everyone. Regardless of whether you’re an individual or a business owner, or you’re a government entity, the economy matters to all of us. So let’s put the economy, and benefits-for-all first. Then, let’s put public and private together under that umbrella to collaborate, and to develop an approach forward. That kernel right there is world-leading, I would argue. Until I got to Canada and joined DIACC, I hadn’t seen any organization or region take that very specific approach. I think that’s unique. In many other countries around the world that I visited (New Zealand for example), they have very clearly stated that that was fascinating and inspiring to them. I’ve since seen many other regions around the world start to move towards using that kind of economic lens, and I think that’s fantastic.</p>
 <a></a> European Union Progress 
<p>These entities are even going as far as the eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) program. eIDAS is instantiated to enable benefits delivery, so we have trust point anchors across each of the European member states. That means we can ensure that people can get access to their insurance or their service delivery. From the government side, a single market for that eIDAS wouldn’t be able to build in that type of broad economic private sector lens.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Angela Merkel of Germany gave a speech where she spoke about the importance of these systems; for a single digital market for economic growth that benefits everyone. The next version of eIDAS deeply considers the question of how we bring in both sides of this picture. In other words, bringing public capabilities and private capabilities into the same ecosystem. Using that framing, I’d say we were way ahead in looking at that as a collaborative effort. Recognizing that people are at the center and that they make transactions, whether they’re transacting with the government or whether they’re transacting with business. So we’re way ahead there.</p>
 <a></a> Challenges in Canada 
<p>There’s also a tendency to look to our friends in Estonia. Which is great, there’s lots to learn there. We should always be looking at what’s happening around the world, but we have to also recognize that we’re a federated country. Our healthcare system is a great example. People say “Oh, Canadian public health care”. Well actually, it’s provincial public health care. There are 14 different entities providing health care services; not a singular one. Identity works in the same way, so we have to be able to pick and choose the things that work for us, and organize them in a way that works with our federated governance and our culture as well. We have our own cultural uniqueness in terms of what people are looking for, and what they aren’t. What we’ve seen on the digital identity front is that it will typically be done in a top-down, federal governmental approach. It’s handled in a very singular approach and solves a particular need. There are places where we are behind, even in that top-down, “How do I transact with government” approach. We’re not as far along as we’d like to be.</p>
<p>When it comes to that economic view, I think we’re quite ahead. Is it an easy path? No, it’s not an easy path. You’re bringing together players that have different cultures, and different priorities. Maybe the priorities are similar, but they’re organized in different ways and different working styles. So, it’s fascinating to be in DIACC where we have peers, partners, and competitors working together. We have healthy collaboration and healthy tension — whether that’s across public sector actors, private sector actors, or the collective as a whole. We’re quite ahead in the sense of the collaborative, the vision, and the view, and in the way that we’ve crafted our framework for that purpose and for some of the specific use cases. We’re behind on that journey and we need to get moving, but ultimately I do think that we’re in a good position because we’ve looked at this all the way through. However, if we don’t have the political priority from different levels of government (federal, provincial, and territorial), we are not going to be able to excel the way that we need to. If we don’t have a common data approach, and common data strategy where people’s data is concerned, we’re not going to be able to leverage all the acceleration that’s happened. It’s not a simple answer.</p>
 <a></a> Digital Wallet Opportunities 
<p>Looking at identity in the context of banking or the financial sector, we have lots of collaboration happening there. We’re either on pace or ahead in terms of how the financial sector is collaborating, depending on where and how you’re comparing When we look at the matter from the public sector perspective, the provinces and the territories are all in different places. So I think there’s a real opportunity for them to come together and be clear about the kind of ecosystem that’s needed. For example, the number of credentials that will be available in each of the provinces could drive a market. If we knew the numbers on how many credentials we need in play going forward, it would help digital wallet designers and the direction that they’re taking. I think there’s a real opportunity there.</p>
<p>Also related to this question: you asked earlier about how the distributed ecosystem looks to someone who’s been doing this for at least 20 years. I think that we have to be careful. We have to recognize that there is a global landscape on the technologies. The governance and the policy are going to be very local in focus. When we try to form global governance and policy, we have to recognize all the complexities that come into play. When it comes to the technology, it’s not exactly the same space. So, I think that if Canada were to try to technically control the solution so tightly for digital wallets as an example, we might find ourselves in a place where we’re not going to be able to interact with ecosystems around the world. We have to be watching, and contributing, and consuming, and paying attention, and incorporating what’s happening on a global landscape.</p>
<p>I’ll give you an example: there’s not a unified standard for digital wallets yet. There’s barely even a collection of standards around digital wallets. That’s a space that needs to play out in the ecosystem before we can make any kind of statements or decisions about what the technology should look like. We can certainly have principles, and we can certainly have guidance that needs to play out further. From my perspective, I would say when we look at data models such as the Verifiable Credentials of the W3C (WorldWide Web Consortium), and particularly JSON LD; this is a place where we’re seeing global momentum towards this data model. It’s not the only data model, but we are seeing momentum there. So we’re suggesting that if we can ask questions such as “Hey, what’s happening with W3C on that data model?”, that’s important.</p>
<p>We need to pay attention to that. We need to have systems ready for that because that could be an initiative that’s building towards a global convergence and consensus. Where we’re not seeing that global consensus or convergence, we can’t run to try to tighten things down. We might end up in a place where we’ll have to reverse engineer. In that case, we’ll lose funds and we’ll lose time, so we have to stay very agile.</p>
 <a></a> Moving Forward 
<p>Yeah, it is a complex landscape. Pieces are moving forward, and when we think about what we’re doing in Canada and in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAvjFuJqEYw">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> as well, I like to think that it’s really additive. What do I mean by “additive”? I remember very clearly the development of the Security Assertion Markup Language, SAML. I also remember very clearly the emergence of OpenID and OpenID Connect, and I recall people claiming “Oh, SAML is dead, now SAML is over”. Well, SAML is not over, and it’s not going to be over any time soon. Neither is OpenID going to be over anytime soon. If you look at something like the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance protocols, the UAF and the U2F, and the web tokens, the FIDO Alliance would say “Kill the password”.</p>
<p>I think that’s something we can all get behind. But I think rumors of the password’s death are very hasty, because I think we’re probably going to have passwords for quite some time still. I think we’re going to see the slow demise of passwords eventually, but they’re not going to go away overnight. When we think about technology and the way that we move forward, we also have to think about Canada being ahead or behind. We definitely have to think about the ecosystem as being additive, recognizing that many technologies will be in play. We have to have structures that can handle and verify when and how those technologies are used, and what governance is overlaid. We also need to be able to slice through on the things that are important to help us move forward. I believe whether you’re talking about self-sovereign identity, or you’re talking about classic federation, what’s important for all of those is access to verified and verifiable data.</p>
<p>We need to keep our focus there and recognize that interoperability in 2021 is not necessarily what interoperability looked like in 2010. It’s not: “Let’s all use the same spec, and all design the same way, and now we’re all interoperable”. Interoperability now needs to address different networks, different architectures, different technologies, and different governance.</p>
<p>Now, can we consume the same data, can we take that data and make it usable in our ecosystem? I think you have to take a scorecard look at it, versus a singular kind of position. It’s complex, and it’s a moving target.</p>
<p>Mathieu: There’s a lot to unpack out of that journey! Where to start?</p>
<p>I think we hear this all the time — Estonia gets thrown out there as a successful program, with the discussion being “Why don’t you implement this?”. As you mentioned, based on Canada, and the way Canada is structured — it’s just so different. We’re unique compared to anywhere else. For that matter, every place has its unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Joni: It’s quite interesting to see some top-down initiatives happening. We’re seeing them in Germany too, where they had meetings at the end of last year to emphasize the importance of the digital identity strategy. I think it’s awesome that these countries are realizing numbers that the DIACC put out as well. There’s not an insignificant percentage of a country’s GDP that could be gained in value from a proper digital identity strategy. That’s even more important in emerging economies. I recognize and appreciate that we need to set principles, but we can’t simply jump into anything. We’re going to shoot ourselves in the foot if we do that, and it isn’t just local. It’s a global concern and I think the one thing to remember, is that no one solution fits the whole thing, collaboration is needed.</p>
<p>Every different group of people brings different tools that are part of the same overall toolkit, but they all need to be able to work together to take us to the next stage. With the Pan-Canadian trust framework and the principles coming out of that, and the collaboration between the public and the private sector, this is really what you’re trying to achieve here in Canada. Everyone needs to be working together, and then you could agree to disagree on certain things. However, everyone needs to agree on certain sets of principles.</p>
 <a></a> Interoperability and the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework 
<p>Mathieu: The last topic I wanted to address follows our discussion about ecosystem collaboration. You mentioned interoperability. How are you and the DIACC pushing to make interoperability a reality in 2021, or at least in the next few years?</p>
<p>Joni: That’s a great question and I believe we do have some degree of interoperability already. We see some networks that are sharing information today. I think we have building blocks in place, and pieces of the solution, and I think we have a ton of goodwill, and passionate people and passionate organizations. It’s about focusing and supercharging on what’s important; collaborating, and working together.</p>
<p>With the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF), it’s been a very interesting and special journey. Different orders of government, as well as private sector players, are sitting together at the virtual table, and we’re having many public consultation periods. We received over 4,000 comments, from at least five countries around the world. We’re being very open and collaborative, but still creating a safe governance space for different partners to work together. It’s been quite a journey, and we are in the process right now of alpha testing the framework. We’re not alpha testing solutions, because what we want to do here is to validate and make sure the framework behaves the way we thought it was going to, and the way that we specified it. If that’s the case, it is going to provide value on the interoperability front.</p>
 <a></a> Framework Principles 
<p>When we look at the principles of the way the framework is built, one of the things that was so challenging and exciting is that it’s not built for a singular model. It’s built in a way that must be applicable to classic federation models, or for authentication hubs, and for all those pre-existing systems. It’s also built to be able to bend and flex for hybrids across multiple ecosystems and networks, such as:</p>
 <a></a> – Distributed identity ecosystems, 
 <a></a> – Permission distributed identity ecosystems, 
 <a></a> – Trusted networks, and 
 <a></a> – Trusted operator networks. 
<p>This holds true, all the way to very distributed, very open, self-sovereign networks that may have fewer controls in terms of how participants engage in that ecosystem. It’s always easier if you start with a common picture. For example, “This is what a house looks like. We’re all going to design for this house”. It’s a lot easier if you start with a clear picture: it might be a house, it might be a tent, it might be a lean-to. You have to find your way through, and recognize how you can approach the design in a way that achieves à la carte functionality, as well as combined utility for all the pieces.</p>
<p>The way that we worked through that was with a very component-based approach. We could have a specific component for credentials, a particular component for authentication, a component for verifying a person or verifying an organization. We have a privacy component, but we also have privacy built-in to every single piece of the framework. One way to deal with a wicked problem is to componentize. That’s what we did, so we can fix one piece and not tussle with all of the others if there’s no reason to do so. That approach also enables organizations to come and pull off-the-shelf for the piece that’s most important to their requirements.</p>
 <a></a> Current Status 
<p>Right now, we are alpha testing the framework with different kinds of actors, both public and private, and with assessors. Through this process, we’re going to learn what may need to change, and what may not need to change. We’re going to get real knowledge there. I will say that what we’re seeing already, is that DIACC and our priorities are really driven by members. Our members are experts in digital identity. While some organizations focus on every piece of the puzzle and the ecosystem, we are truly focused on that horizontal of “identity”. The approach cuts across all the different verticals, and so we are driven by those member experts and their experience-based priorities. One item that the members were calling for, is a digital wallet component for the PCTF. They’re actively working now on what that could look like. Since we’re using that component approach, we’re very likely to add other components as we move forward in this framework, as the ecosystem demands.</p>
<p>We have a timed review process for how those components may need to adjust over time. So, this is all exciting. We’re kicking the tires on version one. The group is already demanding functionalities around a digital wallet, and working out what those principles look like. The framework contains our defined processes for different features and capabilities. There are notions of levels of assurance, that are tied in or identified. The framework also works by reference, in terms of calling out specific technologies. For example, it may be calling out where you should use particular encryption, or what technologies would be acceptable in which instances.</p>
 <a></a> Trust Networks 
<p>Our next stage in the roadmap is to launch the certification program for the PCTF, which is called “Voilà Verified”. The Voilà Verified program will launch at the end of 2021. Once that’s in place, then organizations will be able to pull pieces off of the shelf, and work through our process with recognized information security auditors in a laboratory. We need to recognize the information security auditors, to provide verification that the organization has been following the processes, the procedures, and the governance that have been defined. Then, we can review in a laboratory setting, from the perspective of how the code was actually implemented, and validate that it was implemented as specified. So, you need those two pieces of the puzzle.</p>
<p>We’re excited about that program, and the organizations who are alpha testing the PCTF right now are all DIACC members. What’s great about that, is the participants get real operational knowledge by going through the materials that we’ve prepared. They get strategic information and operational knowledge by going through that internally. They also get a view on where they might be, in terms of being able to achieve that trust mark or not. When we do launch the program, I would suspect that the organizations that have done alpha testing are probably going to be further down the line, or they’ll have a good idea in terms of their ability to earn a trust mark or not. So our roadmap requires launching that program at the end of 2021 and expanding it in 2022.</p>
<p>I would also predict that we’re likely to have what we call “profiles” or “schemes”. That is, we have the base Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, and if we have a particular network or a particular community, they may say “Well, okay, we have the base.” We’re not loosening the rigor on the base, but we might add on top of the base. A given player might say, “These are the pieces that are important to us, so for network x, then profile x or scheme x is the one that we’re using”. I think we’ll see different flavors of how a trust mark is applied, and the utility that particular trust mark provides.</p>
 <a></a> Verification and Certification 
<p>The other thing that we’re contemplating with regard to interoperability, is having a pathway for what we’ll call “network interoperability” or network verification. What I mean by that, is: if you’re working in the ecosystem of a trusted operator or a trusted network operator, or even a classic federation operator, there’s a specific set of agreements. Those agreements might dictate “These are the things that we have to follow”, and so you may need a certification to get in that virtual door.</p>
<p>In the very open, <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">self-sovereign identity ecosystem</a>, there are no requirements to have specific certifications to be a part of a given network. So, that might be more of a market differentiator, in terms of wallets or organizations that display that trust mark. Yeah, we’re being very flexible and agile about the way the PCTF is applied, and the potential to apply it in these different models. Not all models are built the same, and we have to be able to work in that environment because that is the reality of what the ecosystem looks like. We don’t foresee a singular model anytime soon, so we have to plan for that vibrancy, and we have to plan for that diversity.</p>
<p>I think we do see some interoperability now. We’ll see more “verified interoperability”, that addresses both the technology and the code. We’ll also see interoperability in terms of the policies and the processes that are being applied. We’ll see that with the Voilà Verified program, beginning at the end of 2021, and then growing through 2022.</p>

			<p>Digital Asset Marketplaces provide a complete framework for their users. They act as a trusted intermediary between issuers and investors by proposing a set of tools and services to facilitate transactions between the different players. These tools can be made directly available to the users, and/or additional services can be provided in order to enhance the customer experience.</p>
 Who are the stakeholders? 
<p>The principal objective of an online marketplace is to connect several players. When it comes to an investment-related marketplace, the main players are issuers, investors, the marketplace operator, and possibly other service providers.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Investors 
<p>Investors are looking for quality investment products. A DAM is first and foremost a central, easily accessible venue where they can discover financial securities. They want direct access to information in order to assess investment opportunities, expected benefits and associated risks. Ideally, the marketplace, knowing the investor’s profile, only offers them products they are eligible to subscribe for.</p>
<p>Services required for investors:</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 Issuers 
<p>For issuers, the main goal of a marketplace is to reach an audience. If the issuer already has a regular customer base, they can decide to become the operator of its own marketplace by offering a website where its investors can discover and subscribe to one or more of its projects. More generally, issuers can also come into contact with larger marketplace operators who can aggregate several issuers and their investment products, offering a greater choice to their users.</p>
<p>Services required for issuers:</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 Marketplace Operator 
<p>The operator of the marketplace is the entity and team that provides the solutions and services to investors and issuers. The operator helps the latter to work in a safe environment through the application of a robust governance policy and the clear definition of rules and responsibilities that apply to the marketplace. For example, the operator will conduct its due diligence on the projects listed on the platform, provide software where Issuers can enter their offering information and documents, control the access to this information by verifying the information of the Investors and so on.</p>
<p>The main role of the marketplace operator is to enter into a cycle where supply brings demand and more demand brings more supply, all within the context in which their service improves through networking effects. The marketplace aggregates an audience by helping its users with the curation of content and products proposed on the platform.</p>
<p>Services required for the operator:</p>

 25+ Use Cases of Verifiable Credentials <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable credentials</a> are the next frontier in the world of digital identity and security. They address many of the concerns we face today with regards to our documents and identities.</p><p>But since it is a relatively new technology, there are gaps in connecting it to real-world scenarios, and his article aims to bridge this gap. The use-cases that we have come up with are some potential areas where VCs can be&nbsp;used.</p><p>It is aimed to give insights on the unlimited potential of VCs across every sphere of our life. Specifically, we hope that business leaders, entrepreneurs, and developers will use this article as a guide to create some breakthrough solutions that will benefit the society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>So, let’s jump into the use-cases and before that, a brief introduction on the three parties involved in VC-based transactions.</p> Issuer <p>An issuer is an entity that is authorized to issue a credential. These issuers are typically government organizations, healthcare centers, banks and financial institutions, schools and universities, and possibly even organizations that provide proof of employment.</p><p>These entities use a combination of methods such as digital signatures and custom schemas to prove that they are competent to issue a credential.</p> Holder <p>A holder is someone who is the owner of the credential and has complete control over how it can be managed, with whom these credentials can be shared, or revoked. Holders are typically individuals or organizations.</p><p>Since the holder is the owner of the credential, the onus is on this entity to create a verifiable presentation, which is the compilation of data sent by one or more issuers in a machine-verifiable format that adheres to the existing standards.</p> Verifier <p>A verifier is an entity that verifies a credential and ensures that it comes from a competent issuer, is tamper-proof, and is still relevant (not expired or revoked). A verifier takes the verifiable presentation from the holder to determine its authenticity.</p> VC Use-Case#1: Employment Endorsements <p>VCs can be used to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">verify current and past employment</a> and is a safe way to share them with prospective employers and entities who need this information.</p>  Issuer — Employers, job search sites, payroll providers, and startups like <a href="https://www.goodworker.in/">GoodWorker</a> that verify a user’s work experience.

 ShareRing Joins Good Health Pass, “Creating a Blueprint for Interoperable Digital Health Pass Systems” 



<p>We are pleased to announce ShareRing has joined Good Health Pass Collaborative as a working group contributor!</p>



<p>Launched by ID2020 in February, the Good Health Pass Collaborative is an open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative, bringing together leading companies and organizations from the technology, health, and travel sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its members are creating a blueprint for interoperable digital health pass systems and building a safe path to restore international travel and restart the global economy as the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Various efforts are currently underway to develop digital health credentials systems — both vaccination and test certificates — for international travel. Yet, despite this race to market, it is unlikely that a single solution will be implemented universally — or even across the entire travel industry. Thus, it is critical that solutions are designed from the onset to be interoperable — both with one another and across institutional and geographic borders.<br></p>



<p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is not intended to supplant existing efforts but rather to help weave them together, fill gaps where they may exist, and facilitate collaboration among a new ecosystem of stakeholders, many of whom have never worked together before.</p>



<blockquote><p>“We are delighted to welcome ShareRing to the Good Health Pass Collaborative,” said head of advocacy and communications, Ethan Veneklasen. “Our contributors are working hard to ensure that the principles and standards we develop through this process will make it possible for globally interoperable digital health passes to serve the needs of the individuals and institutions that rely on them, while simultaneously protecting core values such as privacy, civil liberties, and equity.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Our CEO Tim Bos praises the “yeoman’s work” of the Good Health Pass Collaborative:</p>



<blockquote><p>“ShareRing is deeply proud to become a working group contributor for this singularly important effort in the interest of international public health.”</p><p>“The COVID-19 virus is unlikely to go away anytime soon – as many scientists project it will become endemic, possibly requiring yearly boosters. The need for digital health pass systems thus may likely only grow as more people get vaccinated, as they may subsequently require booster shots.”</p><p>“Far too many voices worldwide have already been stilled by this virus, and so many other voices are now crying out desperately for economic relief.&nbsp; The Good Health Pass Collaborative is already doing yeoman’s work to help the world to quickly find its collective voice on a crucial technological solution.”</p></blockquote>

   At&nbsp;first glance it looks like Google is turning over a new leaf.

<p>At&nbsp;first glance it looks like Google is turning over a new leaf. The tech giant has&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/">announced</a>&nbsp;it will no longer track&nbsp;third party&nbsp;cookies&nbsp;on&nbsp;Chrome&nbsp;and it won’t help build another way of tracking users’ browsing history for targeted advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of&nbsp;third party&nbsp;cookies,&nbsp;Google&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/">categorize users into groups</a>&nbsp;known as&nbsp;Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoCs), based on&nbsp;consumer&nbsp;type&nbsp;and&nbsp;habits,&nbsp;interests and&nbsp;preferences,&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;let advertisers target those groups&nbsp;or&nbsp;FLoCs&nbsp;instead of individuals.&nbsp;It’s the centrepiece of Google’s new “Privacy Sandbox”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the face of it, Google is prioritizing privacy and trying to claw back trust, while throwing the ad industry, which relies on data amassed&nbsp;via&nbsp;Google, under the proverbial bus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But can a leopard really change its spots?&nbsp;</p>



<p>No.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google&nbsp;knows&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers are fed up</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a>, and regulators are&nbsp;currently&nbsp;investigating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-faces-third-antitrust-lawsuit-for-allegedly-manipulating-searches-to-stifle-competition/">three separate&nbsp;antitrust&nbsp;allegations</a>&nbsp;against&nbsp;it.&nbsp;It certainly needs some positive optics.&nbsp;But&nbsp;this&nbsp;new play for privacy&nbsp;is&nbsp;nothing but a&nbsp;smokescreen concealing the fact the tech giant&nbsp;will remain largely unaffected by the new rules.&nbsp;As they note over at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/3/22311460/google-cookie-ban-search-ads-tracking">Recode</a>: “A third&nbsp;party cookie ban won’t hurt the search giant’s healthy first&nbsp;party data ad business.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest tell is that&nbsp;its&nbsp;FLoCs&nbsp;proposal does not apply to mobile phones&nbsp;that use&nbsp;Google’s Android operating system, where Google&nbsp;maintains&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;identifiers for each user&nbsp;and gives those identifiers&nbsp;to advertisers.&nbsp;Since globally&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/#:~:text=Android%20maintained%20its%20position%20as,of%20the%20global%20market%20share.">71.93 percent</a>&nbsp;of mobiles run Android and mobile internet use is now at&nbsp;<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet">54.46 percent</a>&nbsp;and growing,&nbsp;excluding Android mobile phones&nbsp;from the&nbsp;new&nbsp;setup&nbsp;drastically&nbsp;dilutes&nbsp;Google’sprofessed desire to abandon ad&nbsp;tracking.&nbsp;Of course, one bit of good news for Apple iPhone users is the iOS 14 update stops cross-app tracking, which will limit Google’s influence on their devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more,&nbsp;Google will continue to let advertisers target&nbsp;users&nbsp;via&nbsp;the&nbsp;email&nbsp;addresses it stores,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&nbsp;will&nbsp;continue to target ads&nbsp;using first party data from its own billions of users on&nbsp;YouTube, Gmail and Chrome.Remember,&nbsp;Chrome has 65 percent market share worldwide, and most of Google’s revenue comes from&nbsp;ads on Google Search.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;Glueck,&nbsp;Executive VP of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/google-privacy-sandbox-030721.html">Oracle</a>&nbsp;points out&nbsp;in&nbsp;his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/google-privacy-sandbox-030721.html">article</a>&nbsp;“With dominance over both the browser and the mobile OS, Google no longer needs cookies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, the&nbsp;FLoC&nbsp;groupings&nbsp;are&nbsp;so&nbsp;dynamic&nbsp;and defining&nbsp;they will&nbsp;eventually reveal the&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;within them.&nbsp;Individuals will be tracked and have their&nbsp;data&nbsp;assigned to so many different&nbsp;FLoCs&nbsp;over time that eventually a simple generated list will&nbsp;distil down to reveal the&nbsp;actual individual. Same, same but different, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We like how&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/google-privacy-sandbox-030721.html">Ken&nbsp;Gluek</a>&nbsp;sums up Google’s smokescreen attempt at a privacy-first future:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What Google doesn’t really say is that effectively none of Google’s own privacy invasive practices are changing. Chrome will still monitor every web site and action a logged-in consumer takes on the web. Android will still collect your precise geolocation, your movements, and your app usage, while surreptitiously mapping every Wi-Fi base station and Bluetooth beacon on the planet. Google search will still catalogue every desire and query no matter how intimate, while the array of Google’s own first-party analytic and&nbsp;advertising cookies will collect more data than the now banned third-party cookies ever would have. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> Introducing Intelligent Data Management Cloud (IDMC) as a Comprehensive, Cloud-Native, and Cloud-First Approach to Data Management 
<p>Data is the new gold, the new oil, or whatever. In the cloud, you only own the data, but not the applications, systems, or networks anymore. Data is essential for Digital Transformation. There is so much data that is sprawling that it is hard to keep control of it. And, within the SaaS and PaaS tenants, data is what belongs to the tenant. Many organizations fail in managing this data sprawl and implement appropriate Data Governance.</p>
 Data Is Ubiquitous: Supporting the Reality of Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Environments 
<p>Data is everywhere. It resides in many different places. Protecting, governing, managing, and, last but not least, using data requires the ability to have comprehensive management across the entire breadth of tools, data lakes, databases, etc. involved. Informatica uses the claim of “cloud-first, multi-hybrid” for describing this scenario and their new solution, IDMC, the Informatica Intelligent Data Management Cloud. It is about supporting the cloud-first strategies, but also the fact that most organizations face both multi-cloud and hybrid environments. It is about having solutions that help to get a grip on data, regardless of where it resides, and about leveraging the potential and value of that data for the sake of the business.</p>
<p>Informatica IDMC is the successor of Informatica IDP (Intelligent Data Platform), delivered via the IICS (Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services). It is a cloud-native implementation of a very wide range of services for handling virtually any aspect of the broader Data Management field, from Data Discovery to delivering a 360-degree view of the data. Informatica has integrated more than 250 services into this new offering.</p>
 The Target: One Cloud to Manage all Data, Across all Clouds and Beyond 
<p>Informatica positions IDMC as one of the central clouds, such as Infrastructure Clouds (like AWS, Azure, GCP, and others), Application Clouds with their platform approach (such as Salesforce, ServiceNow, Oracle, SAP, and others), and other types of clouds delivering the foundation for critical business and IT capabilities.</p>
<p>Informatica places IDMC in the center, like a spider in the web – the cloud that helps to manage the data from all other clouds. Considering the essential role of data for the success of businesses, this is a valid perspective.</p>
 The Need for Data Management and Governance 
<p>There is, without any doubt, a need for reclaiming control of corporate data. Most organizations today don’t know (exactly) which data they have and where it resides. This is a challenge for both utilizing the data (“the new gold”) and for compliance and data security. Thus, an approach that helps in getting a grip on data is essential.</p>
<p>With the IDMC, Informatica positions itself as the one-stop-shop solution that delivers all the services around Data Management from a single source. And Informatica delivers these solutions in an integrated, cloud-first platform built on modern microservices-based architecture. That makes Informatica IDMC a product that raises the bar in the broader Data Management market and is worth further analysis. While such complex, integrated solutions also come with their own challenges (does someone really need 260 different services?), IDMC’s modular approach allows customers to pick the parts they want to focus on first.</p>
<p>Independent of specific products, organizations must invest in the field of Data Management and Data Governance to leverage the value of the data they own and to mitigate the risk of failing in data management and security. Informatica’s IDMC is of specific interest for large organizations looking for a centralized, comprehensive solution covering a range of deployment models and integrations to existing data.</p>

It will possibly reach $7.6 trillion in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>If you’ve ever applied for a bank loan, you’ll know that these traditional credit scoring systems and in-depth identity verification processes work together. These include proof of address and a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/how-verifiable-digital-identity-will-protect-your-post-pandemic-privacy/">copy of a passport or official identification</a>.</p><p>Now, Europe’s Open Banking initiative, PSD2, is set to bring credit scoring into the 21st century. It will make it possible for lenders and borrowers to access a full picture of an individual’s financial history in real-time.</p><p>Its introduction into financial services systems will revolutionize the loan process. It will increase speed, accuracy, and more importantly, financial inclusion.</p> DeFi lending still in its early&nbsp;stages <p>In comparison to this highly sophisticated system, lending and borrowing in the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/wef-speakers-defi-could-follow-fintechs-integration-model/">DeFi industry is still in its nascency.</a></p><p>However, as we know, over the past 12 months it’s grown at an incredible rate. Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi as of March 2021 stands at $39.7 billion, according to <a href="https://defipulse.com/">DeFi&nbsp;Pulse</a>.</p><p>What’s more, it is lending that makes up for the largest segment of that market. The DeFi lending market sits at $17.8 billion. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/decentralized-exchanges/">Decentralized exchanges</a> follow closely behind at $15.6&nbsp;billion.</p><p>What the DeFi industry has been missing is a credit scoring system that provides a full picture of an individual’s varied crypto assets across different wallets and&nbsp;chains.</p><p>To increase trust and reputation when it comes to lending and borrowing through DeFi, we need a system that supports cross-chain interaction and verifiable credentials.</p><p>By connecting user identities with personal accounts, users can <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fear-exchanges-that-dont-ask-for-information/">bind their digital assets and contact addresses</a> making it easy for the correct due diligence to take&nbsp;place.</p><p>Crypto credit scores will allow lenders to view the borrower’s eligibility. However, they will also help them to avoid over-collateralization when looking to borrow assets. They will have the ability to put their positive credit scores to use and to access more rewarding opportunities.</p> A picture of assets needed for DeFi and traditional merger <p>As the DeFi industry progresses to merge with traditional financial systems, there will need to be an evaluation of on-chain and off-chain assets.</p><p>To create a trusted merger between these two worlds, a full picture of traditional and digital holdings and history needs to be made available.</p><p>This will further bolster the benefits of legislation like Europe’s PSD2. It will provide a more rounded, integrated look at asset holdings and histories, including crypto assets, in real-time.</p><p>However, as we’ve seen with any new technology that deals with highly sensitive data, we must be cautious.</p> Privacy and security must be put&nbsp;first <p>Any decentralized credit scoring system applied to DeFi lending and borrowing needs to put user privacy and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/">security</a> first. We cannot ask individuals to give up their data sovereignty in exchange for a well-working DeFi lending&nbsp;system.</p><p>Decentralized <a href="https://beincrypto.com/microsoft-launches-identity-platform-on-bitcoins-blockchain/">digital identity systems</a> can help immensely here. By coupling decentralized credit scoring with a decentralized digital identity system, no one party will hold full control over an individual’s financial data.</p><p>The buck will stop with the individual. The World Economic Forum has been promoting these kinds of digital identity solutions for a long time. In addition, the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework?utm_source=Benedict%27s+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=05e1fbe6a6-Benedict%27s+newsletter_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_4999ca107f-05e1fbe6a6-71071201">endorsed</a> their use universally as the cornerstone of future economies.</p><p>If DeFi is serious about going mainstream and further nurturing relationships with institutional players, a reliable means for evaluating risk in a timely, accurate manner while permitting the same level of due diligence is integral.</p><p>In addition, for the DeFi industry wants to win the trust of mainstream finance, it’s imperative that it stays humble to its users. It must also avoid the mistakes many disruptors in big tech have made in recent&nbsp;years.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

<p></p>                                    <p>Improving Supply Chain Management is key for the efficiency of resources, economics and time. We enhance all the advantages of ERP systems and IoT solutions, using the scalable, immutable and secure benefits of a global data ledger.</p>
<p>The Product Provenance module will enable you to create a digital representative of each item or batch in the supply chain that follows the whereabouts throughout its complete lifecycle; we call that a Digital Twin, and a smart one.</p>
<p>Now you can securely add powerful and immutable data and thus create your own customized Library. You choose which data you want to share, and who can access this data.</p>
              FOLLOWING EXAMPLES OF DATA CAN BE ADDED:   <p>Temperature<br>
Volume<br>
Weight<br>
Dimensions<br>
Location<br>
Production methods<br>
Energy consumption<br>
Water consumption<br>
CO2<br>
Certificates<br>
Files<br>
Images<br>
Videos</p>
            <p>When moving items from one stakeholder to the other it is necessary to be able to transfer ownership of data. This feature is built-in to our system and will ensure you know exactly when and which items have left your responsibility and are handed over to the next actor in the global supply chain. All concerned selected information and documents will automatically and securely be transferred to the new owner.</p>
<p>Now we come to the split phase. We told you it was a Smart Digital Twin, let’s elaborate on that. Digital Twins can be split into several Child Twins; they each inherit all important information and documentation from their Parent. Parent items can be split and packaged into thousands of separate items and continue their way in the supply chain, each accompanied by all relevant data.</p>
<p>When split, then merge. You can create new Twins by merging 2 or more Digital Twins. When you add other ingredients to a Twin you merge and create a new product that holds all the attached data and information of the parent and becomes a new Smart Digital Twin.</p>
<p>All the history and data for each of these components is now available for you to be proved, viewed and analyzed. We provide a user-friendly way for you to view the complete Product DNA Tree of the raw materials of this specific product.</p>
                        <p>You are now ready to share this in-depth information either as a private secure link, or as a public link for anyone to see. The public link can be scanned through a printed QR code or via an RFID that is incorporated in a product. When your customers or consumers scan the QR code or the RFID with their smartphone, you can show and prove the detailed history about the product they choose to purchase.</p>
<p>Another feature we added to this module is the ability to chat and communicate directly between all actors involved. No more excessive emails or text messages, not to mention the delays, costs and confusion they are causing. You can now exchange important queries, updates and urgent matters regarding specific assets, products or items all the way through a product’s life cycle. Imagine how easy and efficient this auditable trail will be for all actors involved.</p>
<p>The Product Provenance module can be used via a desktop or mobile application. Management can direct asset flows, manage ownership transfers and receive instant KPI.&nbsp; Field personnel can easily and securely add and report important information that cannot be collected automatically via IoT sensors or API integrations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine what this could mean to you, as the creator and owner of this collected information, when you choose to sell this information and to what price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s connect and set up a time for a <a href="https://unisot.com/request-a-demo/">personalized demo</a>, where we can show why and how easy we can improve the supply chain management for your company.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/ashford">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>Cloud, AI software, and voice recognition firm Nuance is Microsoft’s latest strategic acquisition aimed at putting the tech giant in a strong position to shape healthcare and workplace applications of the future. Microsoft has agreed to acquire Nuance for around $19bn and the deal is expected to close before the end of 2021.</p>
 First Focus on Healthcare 
<p>The acquisition has the potential to put Microsoft at the forefront of workplace innovation due to Nuance’s AI software expertise focusing on voice recognition, stemming from core algorithms developed in the early 1980s by the founders of Dragon Systems.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise that Microsoft plans to use the acquisition to deepen its support for the healthcare industry, given Nuance’s experience in this sector and the fact that Nuance’s Dragon speech to text systems have specialized in healthcare to cater for the scope and accuracy needed to cope with medical terminology. Nuance's clinical speech recognition offerings include the Dragon Ambient eXperience, Dragon Medical One, and PowerScribe One for radiology reporting.</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare in 2020 as part of its industry-specific cloud strategy, and the acquisition of Nuance means that it can now add voice recognition technologies to support the growing electronic healthcare records (EHR) market.</p>
<p>The healthcare sector is ripe for the application of AI technologies because of its position in a complex landscape of highly innovative research on patient care and treatments, continually streamlined business operations, social and economic pressures, and current events.</p>
 AI in Healthcare 
<p>In <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80266/emerging-technologies-fostering-digital-business-innovation-healthcare/" title="recent research">recent research</a>, fellow KuppingerCole analyst Anne Bailey notes that AI-based products can be found in four categories: Community Health Initiatives, Image Classification-Assisted Diagnosis, AI-Powered Analytics for Improving Clinical Workflows, and AI-Powered Analytics for Hospital Management.</p>
<p>“AI can be highly suitable in products that improve patient care and improve hospital workflows and can be a strong data processing tool to leverage data-driven insights across the sector,” she says.</p>
<p>The research also notes that trends in the healthcare industry that include precision healthcare, AI-powered diagnostics, and data interoperability will be disruptive to both patient care and to business operations.</p>
<p>Use cases for artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry include chatbots, assistance for adherence to treatment plans, image-classification for diagnosis, AI-powered analytics for improving hospital workflows, and voice recognition, of course, for improved patient experience and security.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft, the acquisition is expected to double its total addressable market (TAM) among healthcare, taking the company’s TAM in healthcare to nearly $500bn.</p>
 Beyond Healthcare 
<p>The acquisition, however, has a much wider focus than healthcare alone, particularly in terms of combining cloud, voice recognition, and other AI technologies. Microsoft undoubtedly sees the potential of expanding Nuance’s capabilities in healthcare to other industry sectors.</p>
<p>Microsoft recognizes Nuance as a pioneer in the real-world application of enterprise AI, and plans to integrate Nuance voice recognition software with its enterprise and collaboration software, which has the potential to change the way people work.</p>
<p>Microsoft also has plans to integrate Nuance with its AI technologies, which again has the potential of changing the way people work by enabling conversations to be converted into machine-readable text, which can then be analyzed using AI, giving healthcare providers and other professionals more time to focus on more important things.</p>
<p>Microsoft also sees the potential for changing the way people work by combining Nuance’s interactive voice response (IVR) software with Microsoft cloud. This can be applied across any industry to augment Dynamics 365 enterprise software and Teams collaboration with new AI capabilities and voice biometrics features to improve security and reduce fraud.</p>
<p>For more information about adopting emerging technologies, see related KuppingCole research focusing on the <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80265/emerging-technologies-fostering-digital-business-innovation-utilities-energy/" title="utilities and energy">utilities and energy</a>, and the <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80264/emerging-technologies-fostering-digital-business-innovation-finance-industry/" title="finance">finance</a> industries.</p>
 Conversational AI 
<p>Microsoft has long recognized the importance of voice recognition, investing in developing its own Cortana voice recognition technology in the early 2000s and in acquiring conversational AI startup Semantic Machines in 2018, but the acquisition of Nuance will take its voice recognition capabilities to an even higher level.</p>
<p>From its origins at Dragon Systems, Nuance has been a voice recognition expert. What sets it apart is the combination of mature voice recognition technology with conversational AI, which is very valuable with enormous potential for future enterprise applications. Microsoft hopes to capitalize on Nuance’s long legacy in conversational AI to compete with the likes of Amazon, Apple, IBM, and others developing consumer and business applications based on the technology.</p>
<p>Conversation AI technology is expected to grow, and could potentially revolutionize the way humans interact with technology and hence fundamentally alter the way they work. Conversational AI is yet another example of how AI technologies are able to augment human capabilities to boost efficiency, increase productivity, and free up time for more important and strategic activities.</p>
<p>For more information on Conversational AI, see this Market Compass on <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80384/conversational-ai-building-platforms/" title="Conversational AI Building Platforms">Conversational AI Building Platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Given that some conversational AI technologies are already available in the market and the likelihood of a lot more appearing on the market in the wake of Microsoft’s acquisition of Nuance, organizations should start thinking about how these technologies could be best used to benefit their businesses. As with all emerging technologies, the best and logical place to start is by identifying the most beneficial use cases for your business and work from there.</p>

 An Appeal for Supply Chain Agility — Powered by Verifiable Credentials Ever Given — Wikimedia Commons<p>The Suez Canal debacle had a massive impact on global supply chains — estimated at <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/explained-how-much-did-suez-canal-blockage-cost-world-trade-1785062-2021-03-30#:~:text=Since%20the%20Japanese%2Downed%20ship,estimated%20at%20roughly%20%2454%20billion">&gt;$9B in financial hits each day the Ever Given was stuck, totaling at nearly $54B in losses in stalled cargo shipments alone.</a> And it’s no secret that the canal, which sees <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/suez-canal-ship-freed-how-the-moon-helped-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=After%20nearly%20six%20days%20lodged,the%20canal%20authority%20told%20Reuters.">&gt;12% of global trade </a>move through it annually, dealt an especially brutal blow to the oil and gas industry while blocked (given it <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/commodities/explained-how-the-suez-canal-blockage-impacts-different-industries-8720821.htm">represents the primary shipping channel for nearly 10% of gas and 8% of natural&nbsp;gas).</a></p><p>While the Ever Given itself was a container ship, likely loaded with finished goods versus raw materials or commodities, the situation has already — and will continue to — have a massive negative impact on totally unrelated industries…for months to come. <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/shipping/032521-suez-canal-blockage-may-heighten-price-pressures-in-steel-metals-sources">Here’s an example of the resulting impact on steel and aluminum prices</a>; this had related impact again to oil and gas (steel pipes flow oil) as well as infrastructure and…finished goods (like cars). And the costs continue to climb as the drama unfolds with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/13/ever-given-seized-egypt/">port authorities and insurers battling over what’s owed to&nbsp;who.</a></p><p>Transmute is a software company — a verifiable credentials as a service company to be exact — and we’ve been focused specifically on the credentials involved in moving steel assets around the globe alongside our <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/interoperability-is-not-a-choice-387d57c6dc32">customers at DHS SVIP and CBP</a> for the last couple years now. Now, there’s no “silver bullet” for mitigating the fiscal impact of the Ever Given on global trade, and ships who arrived the day it got stuck or shortly after certainly faced a tough decision — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/business/suez-canal-blocked-ship.html">sail around the Cape of Africa for up to ~$800K [fuel costs alone] + ~26 days to trip or wait it out at an up to $30K per day demurrage expense</a> [without knowing it’d only be stuck for 6 days or ~$180,000].</p><p>So what if you’re a shipping manager and you can make this decision faster? Or, make the call before your ship arrives at the canal? [Some did make this decision, by the way]. What if your goods are stuck on the Ever Given — do you wait it out? Switching suppliers is costly, and you’ve likely got existing contracts in place for much of the cargo. Even if you could fulfill existing contracts and demand on time with a new supplier, what do you do with the delayed cargo expense? What if you’re unsure whether you can sell the duplicate and delayed goods when they reach their originally intended destination?</p><p>Well, verifiable credentials — a special kind of digital document that’s cryptographically provable, timestamped and anchored to an immutable ledger at the very moment in time it’s created — can give companies the kind of data needed to make these sorts of decisions. With use over time for trade data, verifiable credentials build a natural reputation for all the things the trade documents are about: suppliers, products, contracts, ports, regulations, tariffs, time between supply chain handoff points,&nbsp;etc.</p><blockquote>This type of structured data is of such high integrity that supply chain operators can rely on it and feel empowered to make decisions based on&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>What I’m hoping comes from this global trade disaster is a change in the way supply chain operators make critical decisions. Supply chains of the future will be powered by verifiable credentials, which seamlessly bridge all the data silos that exist today — whether software-created silos or even the paper-based manual, offline&nbsp;silos.</p><p>Today, it’s possible to move from a static, critical chain style of management where we often find ourselves in a reactive position to supply chains that look more like an octopus. High integrity data about suppliers and products enables proactive, dynamic decision making in anticipation of and in real time response to shifts in the market — ultimately capturing more revenue opportunities and mitigating risk at the same&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/takeaways-from-the-suez-canal-crisis-971f7404b058">Takeaways from the Suez Canal Crisis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Gordian Work 

<p>Our advances on Gordian were linked to a large-scale transition in the meaning of the Gordian system. Prior to 2021, we were offering a variety of applications, but we were simultaneously working with companies to create specifications. This created a real tension. Now that we’ve seen the beginnings of adoption of our best practices, we’ve been able to change the focus of our applications from being consumer-focused to being exemplars for other companies to study. In Q2, we expect this to mature into a Gordian Seal™ program that denotes companies who are producing products that follow the Gordian principles and our best practices. Like similar projects such as the FIDO Alliance, we expect the Gordian Seal to make it easier for everyone in the blockchain ecosystem to work together, creating  bizdev and interoperability opportunities.</p>

<p>Gordian Testing. Blockchain Commons now has three iOS reference apps available for public beta testing via Apple’s Testflight: <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/sJTaoUsM">Gordian Cosigner</a>, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/0LIl6H1h">Gordian Guardian</a>, and <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8">Guardian Wallet</a>. Wallet was our original app, recently updated to support the newest Lifehash and <code>crypto-request</code> features; Cosigner is the companion signing app that we introduced last quarter; and Guardian is our newest release, a key-storage tool for iOS. As reference apps, these projects are mainly meant as exemplars, demonstrating the best practices and principles suggested by the Gordian architecture as well as exemplifying how multiple apps can interact through Airgaps and Universal Resources (URs). See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TosqR8a2OXg">our video</a> for a real-life example of Gordian Cosigner, Guardian, and Wallet working together to securely create a multisig account and sign a PSBT, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU">this video</a> that demonstrates AirGap signing between LetheKit and Gordian Cosigner.</p>

<p>Independent Recovery. We are already working to split a new app, “Gordian Recovery”, off of Gordian Guardian. One of our best practices for the Gordian system demands that a user can recover funds from a Gordian-approved wallet even if the company producing it disappears. Gordian Recovery will provide one way to do so, allowing a user to independently use the app to recover and sweep funds held in a multisig wallet, no matter the status of the wallet manufacturer. At its debut, we expect Gordian Recovery to support at least three different companies with their own multisig hardware or software wallet systems. Generally, Guardian Recovery, like Gordian Cosigner, demonstrates how Blockchain Commons will interact with the wallet ecosystem by providing not just specifications, best practices, and references, but also complementary apps that can support third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Keytool Updates. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli">keytool CLI (command-line interface) app</a> also received major upgrades in Q1. We expanded it to support the new UR (Universal Resource) <code>crypto-request</code> and <code>crypto-response</code> features that add support for arbitrary requests. This is a first step in moving away from the <code>m/48'</code> derivation used by current hardware wallets for multisig, which often results in master or cosigner xpub reuse and thus a risk to privacy. This means that we now have the infrastructure to demonstrate different solutions to the problems of <code>m/48'</code>xpub reuse, but there’s still a lot of legacy use cases that need to be resolved. (We also reviewed one solution for the <code>m/48'</code> derivation problem and found it unnecessarily complex, so: onward.)</p>

<p>Lifehash Improvements. Most of the Gordian specifications that we’ve created while working with our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> focus on interoperability, particularly moving data across airgaps. Lifehash is something else: it’s a user-interface specification meant to give users trust in the continuity of cryptocurrency accounts without having to depend on reading text addresses, which aren’t user-intuitive. Instead, Lifehash creates unique, colored icons for each account that remain consistent over time. This quarter, we adjusted the colors used by Lifehash so that they look better in black &amp; white printing, and simultaneously experimented with dithering on the 200x200 LetheKit display, to ensure that we could display meaningful information on a worst-case small black &amp; white display.</p>

 

<p></p>

 

<p></p>

 

<p>Lethekit Updates. The DIY <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit/">LetheKit</a> has been our prime reference for testing hardware implementations of our Gordian best practices. Not only did we test it out with dithered Lifehashes last quarter, but we also were able to use its display to test out animated QRs for transferring PSBTs. It worked! (Albeit, slowly.) See also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU">this video</a> of LetheKit exporting derived keys to Gordian Signer.</p>

<p>Gordian Adoption. Finally, as noted, we’re very happy to see continued adoption of Gordian. Last quarter, we talked about all of the software and library development being done by wallet companies. This quarter, we’re seeing more companies committing to including SSKRs (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction), URs (Universal Resources), and other Gordian features in their wallets. <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a> has been expanding its capabilities, while <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a> was the newest to announce their integration of some UR features, including animated PSBTs. Foundation and Sparrow have both been working with us for a while: we’re thrilled to see both hardware and software wallet companies incorporating Blockchain Commons specifications! We’re also aware of two more software-wallet companies who haven’t made announcements yet, and we’ve been extensively working with a third company to produce a Gordian-approved wallet that entirely matches our principles and best practices and adds on some great UI besides. We can now announce that third company is Bitmark …</p>

<p>Autonomy Architecting. Blockchain Commons has been working with Bitmark to design Autonomy, a bitcoin wallet and digital assets manager. Their goal is to make it easy for families to gain independence and preserve generational wealth. Autonomy combines a mobile app with your own dedicated full node running privately in the cloud. We used a partitioned architecture (keys across app+node) and a personal recovery network (using SSKR) to remove all single points of failure. When you transact, everything is multisig between your app and full node. Any single key can fail and you won’t lose your funds. Nothing else like this currently exists in the market.</p>

 Other Advances 

<p>Here’s some details on our other major projects:</p>

<p>Multisig Documents. This quarter, we released our first major expansion to our #SmartCustody tutorials since 2019: a 10,000-word document on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">Designing Multisig for Independence &amp; Resilience</a>. The state of multisig wasn’t sufficiently advanced to provide specific advice when we originally wrote #SmartCustody, so we’re now happy to include it by breaking down the design of multisig addresses into theoretical, transactional, operational, and functional elements and providing design patterns and examples to help you put those elements together. Want to know why Blockchain Commons is today focused on multisig technology and how to create them to meet your own needs? It’s all here.</p>

<p>DID Recommendation. We’ve been working with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a> since it was incubated at early <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting-the-Web-of-Trust workshops</a>, and co-authored by Blockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen. We’re thrilled that it’s now a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Candidate Recommendation</a>. There might still be revisions and new candidates, but this is the beginning of the last stage in creating an official internet standard for decentralized identity on the internet.</p>

<p>DID Method Expansion. Meanwhile, Blockchain Commons is doing its own work on DIDs, with a new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/did-method-onion">did:onion method implementation</a>. We’re happy to say that <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce Systems</a> is already considering it for their DID resolver. We’re also considering returning to work on our own <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">BTCR DID method</a>, which was one of the first DID methods, but has gotten somewhat out of date with recent updates to Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Apt Packages. We have produced apt packages for installing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli">seedtool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli">keytool</a> for use with Debian and Tails OSes. This is a first step in providing support tools for human-rights activists, which we expect to get more emphasis in our work in Q3.</p>

<p>Legislative Work. Finally, Christopher Allen’s work with legislatures multiplied last quarter. In Wyoming, he led efforts that resulted in the <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">Wyoming Digital Identity Act</a>, which includes a specific definition of digital identity that works toward the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">principles of self-sovereign identity</a>. Work on a private-key-protection bill was less successful, as it had to be withdrawn after being spoiled by an amendment. Christopher has also recently testified before legislatures in <a href="https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/testimony/HIBL-3024-20210208-5787-F-ALLEN_CHRISTOPHER.pdf">North Dakota</a> and Nevada. This is all crucial work because actual engineering will ultimately be limited and directed by what states legislate, so we want to make sure the laws fit the technology and the needs of the individual.</p>

<p>Intern Search. We’re thrilled that our Summer 2021 internship program has been sponsored by the <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1366880813845909506">Humans Rights Foundation</a>. We’ve thus put out <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/32">a call for interns</a>, and we’re expanding our usual development work to also include direct support for activists, who need help to maintain their privacy in potentially hostile regimes. However, to really support activists requires knowing what they need. So, we’re also considering working with interns to do research and conduct interviews to create user engagement models for activists. This would be similar to the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira model</a> from RWOT. If you are interested in having developers work with or mentor blockchain interns, want to suggest intern projects, or even have engineers who might be interested in working on Blockchain Commons projects briefly during the summer, <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">please mail us</a>.</p>

<p>Taproot &amp; Schnorr First Steps. We may see a major upgrade for Bitcoin as soon as this fall, if Speedy Trial is approved for Taproot and Schnorr. The first will increase privacy for #SmartCustody features such as timelocks and multisig, while the second will allow aggregated multisig, which offer several advantages over traditional ECDSA signatures. Our brand-new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign CLI</a> app provides the first experimental support for Schnorr signatures leveraging the Taproot/Schnorr BIPS, but independent from <code>bitcoind</code>. More to come as we ramp up to this expansion.</p>

 Supporting the Future 

<p>We’ve laid out our initial roadmap for the next two cycles of Blockchain Commons efforts, covering spring and summer. Important topics includes finalizing our Gordian Seal program, solving problems with xpub reuse in Bitcon multisig, supporting and advancing SSKR (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction) for not just cryptographic seeds but other data, continuing to support and advance URs (Universal Resources) with encrypted and/or signed CBOR, and architecting a new QuickConnect 2.0 for initiating TorGap-based services between peers. If you’d like to know more about our roadmap, especially if you considering becoming a sustaining sponsor or to sponsor a specific project on our roadmap, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us directly</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to support our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can continue to work new specifications, architectures, reference applications, and reference libraries to be used by the whole community, please become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor</a>. You can alternatively make a one-time bitcoin donation at our <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">BTCPay</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to our sustaining sponsors, Bitmark and Blockchainbird, our new project sponsor Human Rights Foundation(@HRF), as well as our GitHub monthly sponsors, who include Flip Abignale (@flip-btcmag), Dario (@mytwocentimes), Foundation Devices (@Foundation-Devices), Adrian Gropper (@agropper), Eric Kuhn (@erickuhn19), Trent McConaghy (@trentmc), Mark S.

  <p>Defining strategies on governance, risk management, compliance, security, and identity beyond the SAP silo</p>
<p>Business applications are under change. While some remain on-premises and in traditional architectures, others have shifted to the cloud – and several of these being provided by specialist vendors such as Workday or Salesforce. The established vendors such as SAP also are changing their platforms, applications, and delivery models, while also acquiring SaaS vendors such as SuccessFactors and Ariba. The days of homogeneous, vendor-focused, one-stop-shopping business applications are past. Most organizations are dealing with a heterogeneous landscape of business applications, regarding both vendors and deployment models. While this raises the more fundamental questions whether IT organizations that still have a SAP unit are still reflecting today’s reality, or should undergo fundamental change, there is an ever more pressing need for delivering governance, risk management, compliance, security, and identity for all types of business applications and beyond to other parts of the IT services such as ESM/ITSM (Enterprise/IT Service Management) and newly born digital services.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger will look at this evolution and discuss what to change and how to balance depth of capabilities for certain environments with the need for a broad support of heterogeneous (business) applications</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/balancing-sap-security-2021-04-14-kuppinger"></a>

  <p>Companies are under attack. More and more attacks result in costly and/or high-profile security breaches.</p>
<p>The world is currently experiencing a wave of digital transformation, that brings with it not only new levels of complexities such as these, but also offers opportunities for organizations to strengthen their cyber resiliency. Accenture, together with strategic partner Onapsis, have developed an integrated approach to deliver security by design to our clients, at any phase of their digital SAP transformation journeys. This Accenture methodology has embedded security concepts as an integral part of the overarching solution – therefore enabling clients to better understand their respective security implications and opportunities in order to effectively “transform”.</p>
<p>In this keynote, Accenture leader Britta Simms, responsible for SAP Platform Security in Europe, will present this joint approach to achieving integrated security by design, as part of the S/4 transformation lifecycle.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/balancing-sap-security-2021-04-14-simms"></a>

  <p>Cyber-attacks can have severe consequences when it comes to SAP S/4HANA applications.</p>
<p>These attacks increasingly focus on the company’s application layer and use privileged user accounts. Unfortunately, many security departments see the SAP application layer as a “black box,” and they view the security of SAP applications as the responsibility of their Basis or SAP application colleagues, leaving these applications at risk. Securing an SAP S/4HANA business application environment involves more than roles and authorizations.</p>
<p>The loss of sensitive data can lead to severe penalties, damages reputation, and endanger the overall business of businesses within minutes.</p>
<p>This session helps SAP decision makers (CIOs, CFOs, and CISOs) and IT operations managers successfully meet these challenges and secure their SAP landscapes.</p>
 
 The session first looks at how security frameworks can help lay the foundation for a strong security strategy. 
 It then walks through SAP’s portfolio of security and compliance solutions through the lens of the Cybersecurity Framework provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) — a framework that is widely used for establishing standard security guidelines and best practices within organizations — to provide SAP customers with a toolkit for creating a comprehensive security strategy that meets their unique and varied needs. 
 Lastly, it explains how to control the activities with a security infrastructure to meet compliance and business requirements and to provide insight that helps those at the C level make better decisions.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mathieu: Okay, we’re on. Hi Jim, how’s it going?</p>
<p>Jim: I’m well, sir. How are you today?</p>
<p>Mathieu: Doing well, thanks. Before getting into all of the cool stuff that you’re doing at Lumedic and the different communities that you’re working in, I’d like to start this conversation by taking a step back to understand how you got into healthcare. It doesn’t seem as if you got into it just yesterday, so would you mind giving some background of how you got into the healthcare space?</p>
<p>Jim: Sure, absolutely. I want to be clear that I characterize my healthcare involvement as around health IT. I don’t have the privilege of being in healthcare like many frontline workers and doctors and nurses but have come into it as a technologist, going back about 12 years ago.</p>
<p>I’ve been in technology and the public sector for a little over 20 years. During my time in the public sector and public sector consulting in Washington DC, I got more involved with federal agencies in healthcare, in federal health IT, and in data efforts. I used that opportunity to work for <a href="https://www.himss.org/">HIMSS, the Health Information and Management System Society</a>. HIMSS is the world’s largest cause-based non-profit, specifically focused on healthcare technology and the use of technology for patient empowerment and patient engagement. I spent a year and a half with them as the senior director for interoperability and standards.</p>
<p>I left that job to go back into public sector consulting, supporting the State of Vermont with implementing systems as part of the Affordable Care Act. Then, I moved into another small company supporting a large enterprise software development initiative with the Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA). Following that, I worked for another small company in Maryland with a focus on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of US HHS (Health and Human Services). I stayed involved with HL7 and several other standards groups and consortia. I began working with <a href="https://www.lumedic.io/">Lumedic</a> in January of this year, specifically focused on digital identity standards, especially in self-sovereign identity, and also continuing to work in HL7. Lumedic is part of Providence Health Systems, and we play a very active role in several HL7 initiatives for health IT and data exchange. It’s very complementary to the work we’re doing with groups like <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>Mathieu: For those who aren’t familiar with HL7, like me, what is it?</p>
<p>Jim: Sure. HL7 is an international body; HL stands for Health Level Seven. I apologize for not remembering exactly when they got started, but they’ve been around for several decades. They have various international working groups and focus areas that are using standard schemas (very similar to W3C and others) to develop health data standards for interoperable health data in healthcare systems.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
<p>Mathieu: There are other organizations as well; FHIR, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Healthcare_Interoperability_Resources">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource</a>, is another one that you’re a part of. Or, at least, when you were part of HIMSS, was that a part of that too?</p>
<p>Jim: Oh. I’m glad you mentioned that. FHIR fast health information resources is, in fact, the latest JSON-based iteration of technology that HL7 has developed over the last six or seven years. The development of health standards has been iterative. Going back to the data standards and the way data was organized and used in the client-server environment; all of that has changed with web services, and with APIs, and cloud services and the internet, etcetera. Health data standards have changed as well. FHIR fast health information resources is the latest iteration for being able to capture health data from electronic health care records and make it available through web services.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Got it; thanks for the breakdown. There’s a newer act a little more recently, but I’ll just take a step back before getting to it. There was a nice representation that Michael Nash from your team put together, showing the progress of healthcare. As it started in its pre-digital era, you started to get different standards and legislation like HIPAA. Then, you started to get more digital standards and high-tech standards as the paper era moved into the digital era. Closer to today, with the 21st Century Cures Act coming into place, moving from the digital era towards more the patient era. How have you viewed that whole evolution in healthcare, and how has the 21st Century Cures Act aligned with what you guys are doing or what you’re thinking?</p>
<p>Jim: Mike Nash, our CEO, has espoused this vision, which I think is outstanding; about the healthcare in the US coming into the patient era, and how Lumedic is part of the patient era now. To walk through that evolution that you articulated; like so many other industries, we moved from paper to digital over the course of the last couple of decades.</p>
<p>Healthcare records had historically been big, thick binders of paper and faxes and notes, which would still persist today. There was a change in regulatory focus to take into account the fact that healthcare records have been more and more transitioning into the world of digital and digital records — electronic healthcare records systems. That prompted a law in 1996, called the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HIPAA was ground-breaking in its obviousness in saying that number one, your healthcare data should be able to go wherever you want it to go; and number two, healthcare systems were responsible for how they manage, safeguard, and distribute electronic health information, which we called EHI or PHI (protected health information). Everyone appreciates the fact that the law helped to clarify and articulate that data should be available to you, wherever you need it to be, that it could be transferable, and most importantly, there are protections behind it.</p>
<p>However, it still had an organizational ‘silo’ feel to it, and that traditional client-server view. Since that time in 1996, more and more things are available through the internet, mobile apps, and electronic systems. Then, you have various middleware and patient engagement experience platforms, and use of third-party apps, and health and fitness apps. If anything, I think the term I use now is the ‘ubiquitousness’ of healthcare data; your healthcare data should be ubiquitous, in terms of your ability to get it and to combine it with other information that you’re collecting. It should be ubiquitous in its presentation and ability to be used at different places. That’s where we’re getting to with the patient era. That is: you, as the patient, have the technology, and we have the architectures to empower you to be able to collect your data and use it as you see fit. That is quite a cultural change.</p>
<p>Your ability to get access to that data, and be able to use that data as you see fit, has oftentimes been questionable just because of healthcare silos. But, we’re now at a point where the architecture and the technology no longer restrict that sort of silo of data, and you should be able to take advantage of it and use apps to do so. That is a thematic undercurrent to everything that we do with Lumedic, but in particular around the Lumedic Connect identity platform.</p>
<p>Mathieu: HIPAA provides guidance for health information exchange between organizations, which is still valid with the 21st Century Cures Act. It’s a component that fits within that act; the act makes it increasingly possible for more patient-driven, or patient-owned models, is that correct?</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a great point. The 21st Century Cures Act, as suggested when it passed in the 21st Century, goes into effect in 2021. In many ways, it layers on top of HIPAA, and I think you bring up a good point that’s worth clarifying. HIPAA was passed in 1996. In 2010 you had HITECH, the Health Information Technology for economy and community health. HITECH added another layer to HIPAA in terms of recognizing health information and promoting the use of electronic health care records. Now, you have the 21st Century Cures Act; there are many good summaries out there that your listeners can find for the 21st Century Cures Act. The most important aspect is how it takes such a broader message and regulatory guideline around the availability of health information; something called patient access APIs. This offers subsequent modification to things like the HIPAA privacy rule and others, that help to bolster the underlying message that patients should access their own information.</p>
<p>Mathieu: So, if we look at a Patient-Centric ID or the patient era moving forward; why is that the solution to fix the problems? I’m assuming there’s a lot of problems that are related; you’ve described a few of them, such as the siloed view of data and the lack of interoperability and stuff like that. What are the major benefits of Patient ID that you guys are excited about?</p>
<p>Jim: I’d say that there are a couple of things; on its surface, one can be excited about the principles of privacy-preserving architectures, and building in the concepts of self-sovereign identity. You know, the things that you and I, and other folks in the identity standards world are excited about: to allow people to control their own information, and help control how their information is shared. Even more than that, if the information is controlled by the individual and by the patients, they’re now empowered to control where that information goes.</p>
<p>I often use an analogy that culturally, healthcare in some ways is still like going to see the tribal shaman 10 000 years ago: I show up at a healthcare environment; some doctor says that there’s some issue. Maybe I understand it, or maybe I don’t, which is a patient health literacy issue. Maybe I have access to the data, or maybe he or she magically presents a lab result and says, “Hey, this is the issue, and now you have to go and do this, this, and this.” These are three other things that you’re being told to do, that change when you now have the individual able to manage how their data is collected and how their data is disseminated — how they do things in the healthcare environment with a healthcare organization. I think it now allows them to be empowered to make decisions about, “Well, I’m not only going to see this doctor here, but I’m also going to see this other doctor. When I do see this doctor, these are the things that I think they need to know about me, but I shouldn’t have to consent to share my entire life history with them if I don’t feel it’s relevant. If I’m going to a back specialist, for example, do they need to know something about substance abuse, that may or may not have anything to do with that.</p>
<p>How do I, as a patient, get more involved with how my health information moves around, in a way that I’ve never been involved in before, whether it was paper or digital.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s another interesting aspect to that; you definitely have the privacy-preserving aspects to the whole story here, but I think we’re seeing in health care and health technology that we’re getting more and more opportunities to use different methods for health data inputs. Whether it’s wearables, whether it’s going for different specialized treatments or scans or activities like that; being at the center and having control of that, and being able to amalgamate all of that information for yourself at the center. That all goes along with the whole big data story, where there are tons of opportunities to use more and more data in healthcare today. It’s probably another benefit of having this patient-centric identity management model.</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a wonderful analogy, and I’d add to it as well. I’m sure you’ve read quite a bit about the use of AI in healthcare, and AI services and chatbots, and that sort of thing. The more that you have the ability to collect your own information, and use that in support of tools such as an AI-driven application, for instance, then the more things can be customized to you or built on what we call evidence-based medicine (EBM) as a framework for decision making.</p>
<p>There’s a proliferation of health apps and advancements in technologies that allow you to monitor your own heart rate at home, and that assist you with medication adherence and how you take medication—gathering that information in your own app, having that information available to you as part of your own data, as part of clinical decision making, and deciding where your data is really where the 21st Century is going. As we discussed, the 21st Century Cures Act is your ability to get that information, to work with information from mobile apps and health applications, and then decide how that information is shared and controlled. The consent belongs to you.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Got it. We’ve been hearing more about the work you’re doing through different communities like the Trust over IP. Lumedic is an organization that was existing before, but was purchased by Providence Health Systems a few years ago. Would you mind making a distinction between those two organizations, and what both of them are up to?</p>
<p>Jim: Absolutely. Providence Health Systems is the ninth-largest healthcare system in the USA, and they are a not-for-profit Catholic hospital system located in Seattle. They support seven states under that banner. As part of Providence Health Systems, they have a for-profit portfolio of companies called Tegria. One of the companies under the Tegria portfolio is Lumedic. As you mentioned, Lumedic was acquired independently a couple of years ago, to be added to that portfolio to support new tech startups and health innovations within that portfolio, under the umbrella of a large major health care system. To add on top of that, Providence has its own digital innovation group, and they coordinate with a venture fund. It gives them a broad base of involvement for identifying healthcare technology solutions that obviously advance their mission for care delivery in the states that they support.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Within Lumedic, do you have the opportunity to leverage the ecosystem of different companies or different resources that Providence has assembled, or that Tegria has under their portfolio?</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a great point, and one I’m not afraid to advertise. As you know, there are lots and lots of health tech companies out there. Very few of them have the opportunity to daily participate in and interact directly with a health care system, beyond a traditional customer-vendor relationship; not only that, but a health care system of the size and scope of Providence. I consider myself to be very fortunate that I get to work alongside senior Providence healthcare professionals and leaders as part of what we’re doing in advancing the field. Specifically, we’ve created the Lumedic Exchange, which is a voluntary organization of stakeholders from other healthcare organizations, but including Providence. The Exchange focus is on developing use cases and workflows around this <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials/">concept of verifiable credentials</a>. That gives us the opportunity to tap into not only folks who are technically part of Providence Health Systems, but Providence itself has jurisdiction over the State of Oregon, and it’s got other systems in California. This gives a tremendous degree of variety and organizational diversity, each representing different healthcare organization perspectives as part of this development work. There are very few health tech companies that can offer that sort of background and diversity, in terms of their solution development and application.</p>
<p>Mathieu: What was the vision behind the Lumedic Exchange? It makes sense to have some sort of ecosystem or consortium, governing the health apps, or the data, or the different systems and what people are using. Is that the idea behind the Lumedic Exchange?</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a great question. I know we haven’t talked about it too much besides the references to the Trust over IP Foundation, but the Lumedic Connect product is based entirely on the Trust over IP Foundation <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">framework for managing decentralized identity</a>, and using the W3C (WorldWide Web Consortium) verifiable credential model.</p>
<p>If you think about what that verifiable credential trust triangle model looks like; between the issuer, the credential holder, and the credential verifier — what type of business processes and use cases are there, for using that verifiable credential in healthcare use cases? Despite what we could bring to the table for technical knowledge and engineering to develop the Lumedic Connect product as a small company, or even in conjunction with Providence Health, we couldn’t necessarily come up with every use case by ourselves. Nor could we get industry buy-in for a use case of how a verifiable credential could be used in a healthcare scenario, without the participation of as many healthcare organizations as possible. So, we created the Lumedic Exchange to allow healthcare organizations to join for free and participate in that process to get educated about verifiable credentials, and contribute their perspective. For example, if I have a patient coming in for an x-ray, and they have their insurance through Blue Cross/Blue Shield, what needs to go into a verifiable credential? What’s the registration process? How do I tie that credential to the imaging system and to the image? How does it work with their insurance eligibility and registration? That sort of thing.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I always worry about the education gap with any new technologies, but is it clicking with the health providers that are coming into the Lumedic Exchange? Are they really seeing the value of <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">portable digital verifiable credentials</a>?</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a great question. I would like to say that they see the value of it, but it is a brand new effort. We launched around November of last year. Of course, launching anything last year in the pandemic obviously complicates some of the messaging. What I can say is that we have strong participation from several folks in the payer community, from Mastercard, identity services from other representatives in Providence, and from HireRight, the human resources information company. They are consistently participating in a couple of the workgroups we’ve stood up, plus some new ones that are addressing various issues for credentials. So, I’m very optimistic that the momentum is going to build this year. I think both membership contributions and value will all be built as the year goes on.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It seems like the one opportunity, or one of the good things with COVID (if there’s any of them), driving the push towards more and more digitization. The use of proof-of-vaccines; that’s one of the first use cases that it seems you’re focused on.</p>
<p>Jim: Yes, and I like the way you paraphrase that; both fortunately and unfortunately. It’s terribly unfortunate that we have such a human toll and tragedy concerning the pandemic. On the other hand, it has prompted consideration and forced changes in business models, in ways that we’ve talked about and never been able to do. They are now a reality; whether it’s telework and now the adoption of telehealth and virtual care. In many ways, the substance around a health pass or vaccination credential was there before, and it’s something we’ve been working on as an underlying technology with Lumedic Connect and for Providence for a couple of years. However, fortunately, or unfortunately, the foundation of vaccination coverage and a vaccination credential serves as a foundation for really demonstrating a use case, in one of the most positive and fast moving ways.</p>
<p>Mathieu: People definitely understand that when they see it, and it has been interesting.</p>
<p>I remember early last year when we were in the early days of COVID, with the COVID credentials initiative starting and a lot of different efforts, trying to look at a way to use these new technologies for good, without sacrificing privacy, or any ethical considerations, and so on. Although this stuff could excite you, is there stuff that scares you about the COVID? There seem to be a lot of different COVID projects that are going on right now.</p>
<p>Jim: Absolutely. Of course, I’ll be quick to point out ours as being one of the best, but I do so in the context that the vaccination credential use case is but one of many use cases that we’re looking at, as part of the broader aspect of managing patient health information that we’ve been talking about so far, when you called out things like HIPAA and the 21st Century Cures Act.</p>
<p>You’re right, unfortunately. There are several prominent cases going on right now, or several prominent industry applications, where privacy seems like a real concern. It’s understandably very difficult for a consumer to look at these different things, and be told, “Oh, don’t worry, it’s on the blockchain.” That’s somehow supposed to mean something in terms of privacy, without underlying what a governance framework is, or what an inherent privacy-preserving architecture is. We were aiming for all of that first and foremost, even before dealing with vaccination credentials, and so that’s built on it too. In working with things like the Good Health Pass Collaborative, we’re trying to come up with that type of Good Housekeeping/UL seal of approval that shows that this credential application and mobile application have taken into account key considerations for privacy, security, interoperability, a trust framework, and so on. This would enable consumers to know that you can trust and appreciate that these apps are only working on your behalf and that they’re not representing either corporate surveillance of healthcare or some other government intrusion into your health information.</p>
<p>Mathieu: There’s a lot of good work happening, as you mentioned, at the Good Health Pass Collaborative. With the trust models or trust frameworks that you’ve been working on within the Lumedic Exchange, is there a lot of overlap there? Have you been able to contribute to that?</p>
<p>Jim: I think you make a great point; it’s entirely collaborative. If you think about the things that we’re working through in terms of privacy, and interoperability, and trust frameworks in the Good Health Pass Collaborative; while called into focus around the issue of vaccination credentials, they also pertain across the board to any other healthcare information factor. As you mentioned, there are lots of good companies in the COVID Credentials Initiative (CCI) and lots of work there; but, of course, as an organization, they’re focused on COVID credentials. Ours is a focus on health information credentials, patient-centric identity management first, with COVID credentials being a natural overlay to that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: There’s a need for trust models or trust frameworks across different industries or ecosystems. We see many developments taking place in the financial sector; that’s the area in which we work a little more. How do you describe a trust model or trust framework to someone? It’s a new concept, that wasn’t necessarily there with traditional architected systems.</p>
<p>Jim: You’re right, it is very new. When you’re advancing this model of trust, first and foremost and speaking as a Chief Trust Officer, I of course spend some time explaining what a Chief Trust Officer is. I emphasize to them that previous roles for chief this, and chief that, whether it was a Chief Information Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Data Officer; all those roles highlighted how organizations were taking a new organizational leadership around that particular concept. That is, how important information was, or how important data was. Now, we feel we’re in the era where trust has to be called out as something that is an organizational value, an organizational effort. So, with that in mind, you need a trust framework.</p>
<p>When asked how I look at a trust framework, or a trust assessment framework: digital trust is considered to be an embodiment of all the ongoing activities and areas of security and privacy, and data management or data governance. That activity manifests itself as some way that parties who may, or may not, know or like each other, can agree upon trusting each other. That generally represents a combination of things that we’re already familiar with, such as ISO standards, or GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), or in financial services, GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) and other financial securities. Acts that combine together, and lay out some way that organizations can attest, or be certified, to say, “I’m following security standards; I have security in place; I’m following privacy standards.”</p>
<p>There is a right-to-privacy for the users; there’s a right to protect their data, and a right to be forgotten. All of that is serving as a framework to be able to say, “Can I now trust that the rules in this organization, combined with the rules in that organization, will allow me to use this credential as a model to identify me?” Despite the fact that you may not know everything about me, we both agree that we’re following these rules together, and you can trust that I can do this. Or, more importantly, that I can trust you, that you can have my information, or that we can have some sort of transaction or relationship together.</p>
<p>Which, when you think about it, is the heart of where blockchain, and Bitcoin and everything started. Even in anonymous, almost adversarial, relationships, you could have rules for how transactions took place, so that two people could conduct a financial transaction without ever knowing each other. Everyone agreed to what that was, and that was, in fact, really a trust assurance framework. It was engineered into the Bitcoin code and the way in which Bitcoin operates. That serves as a foundation, to then extend that to verifiable credentials, and saying, “I present a credential that comes from someone you trust, or an organization that’s trusted. That serves as the basis for our transaction together, without having to collect and store a bunch of other information.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I remember some years ago, when blockchain was supposed to be used for everything. In the early days of <a href="https://northernblock.io/">decentralized identity management</a>, a lot of the thinking was, “Hey, let’s just throw everything on-chain.” I think we realized pretty quickly, that definitely does not hold up; you can’t put personal information on-chain. I’m definitely happy with the evolution that we’ve seen, with off-chain secure communication with verifiable credentials, and using pretty cool cryptography and protocols to allow that to happen. Does the Lumedic ecosystem publish its own trust framework, and does it use a specific blockchain as a utility to write information that’s pertinent to issuers and certain credential information?</p>
<p>Jim: Yes, and first of all, let me say I think your summary was beautiful! As someone who has been in blockchain and healthcare for about four years, I translate it from a Dilbert cartoon: blockchain is like radioactivity; you can use it for good or evil, and you don’t want to get any of it on you. I believe a lot of people had a vision about it; to simply use blockchain like bitcoin, and somehow it’s all anonymous. When, in fact, blockchain does a beautiful job of being able to eliminate anonymity, and being able to trace and associate transactions with a specific person, with specific information. However, when you abstract it out between on-chain and off-chain as you’re suggesting, then you have a new way to be able to enforce privacy, especially with the principles of decentralized identifiers. We are built on a combination of the Hyperledger Indy/Aries framework and part of the Sovrin Network. So, you have those principles and trust framework associated with Sovrin and SSI, as part of the framework for the Hyperledger Indy/Aries network or software components that we’re using. To your question; yes, the Lumedic Exchange is developing its own trust framework and own credential rules, which we intend to publish. They’re developed by the working groups, and published on our <a href="https://www.lumedic.io/lumedic-exchange">lumedicexchange.org</a> website to be available as examples for anyone.</p>
<p>We see that the most important things to do first, are culturalization, education, and adoption. We won’t necessarily be the only solution for this, although we’d obviously like to help all the patients in America. However, truly understanding it and moving it forward as a concept for how patient information should be managed, is probably the most important thing first and foremost. Therefore, we’ll publicly share all of the trust framework and governance framework documentation we develop out of the exchange. That will allow people to build upon it, and when the next thing comes along — whether it’s KERI, or Hedera Hashgraph, or the next version of Hyperledger Indy/Aries — we’ll have a framework to help support that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s awesome. Similar to the rest of the community, it’s great to see you guys participate. I know you’re passionate about participating in different organizations; whether it’s the Trust over IP, ID2020, or other ones. Going back to that nice illustration that Mike Nash had put together; that starts at the paper era. Well, definitely not the elimination of the paper era, as we’re talking more and more about today. This technology needs to be accessible to people, and it needs to fit the different cultures and the different ways of using it.</p>
<p>Jim: Absolutely. Your commentary drives me to another point too, which is this idea of patient-centric, and patient empowerment, and consumerism. I know that’s on Mike’s graphic as well, that we have to take into account the gradual but steady building of consumerism and healthcare, in a way that hasn’t existed before. By virtue of making this technology accessible, consumers can take advantage of it as part of doing their business of daily life.</p>
<p>You know, the use of faxes and the use of paper records have still continued to persist. Nothing makes me want to stick a pencil in my eye faster than when I see an advertisement for a secure cloud-based fax platform. I’d say, “Fantastic. What a great job hedging over the cart path, and I’m going to go buy another horse.” It’s not advancing where technology can go, to help consumers and empower patients. There’s a great deal of that effort going on within HL7, of course, which is why I’m excited to make it a complementary effort. There are so many folks around the US and around the globe, who are working HL7 to advance more effective ways to exchange health information. We advance other standards from the global community around identity, to be able to make it a patient-centric way of managing that.</p>
<p>It’s nothing short of revolutionary. “Revolutionary” means that there are winners and losers, and you hope that the most important winner, of course, is the patient.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes: with the understanding, as you said perfectly, that there’s not going to be one winner — you need to be able to play within the ecosystem and add the value that you’re good at adding. It’s not that you can simply replicate the siloed models that are there today; that’s not the evolution or revolution that we’re looking for here. I’ll post Mike’s illustration in the show notes for this podcast. We’ve referred to it a couple of times, and I think it’s a great overview of the different eras within healthcare.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mike Nash, Lumedic</p>
<p>Within the Lumedic Exchange, there are different organizations that are part of this, and there are different working groups that are happening. What’s being worked on?</p>
<p>Jim: Let me highlight probably my most exciting working group, which is Health Equity. We’ve set out to try and get about seven working groups up and running. We have an Identity working group, who are looking at things like identity attributes, and binding things I’m sure you’re familiar with. These are issues that are a fundamental block-and-tackling for how verifiable credentials work. We have another working group around Registration and Eligibility, which starts to tie in the actual workflow of a patient registration process in a healthcare system, into the use of a verifiable credential. We’re also looking at some very specific healthcare opportunities, for things like skilled nursing facility, and for imaging and pharmacy applications.</p>
<p>In our Health Equity and Population Health working group, I got excited about it because I spent a lot of time working on another concept called “Social Determinants Of Health,” or SDOH. In healthcare, that concept has a lot of conversation going on. This deals with looking into non-clinical factors that make up your healthcare aspects and your lifestyle. As someone said, social determinants of health are our health factors, no matter what. We tend to look at them for things like housing security, economic security, and food security. These are social factors that weigh-in, for whoever is being considered as part of the clinical analysis. It’s not information that your doctor historically has gathered or that you typically see in a clinical record. But, we understand these factors more and more as being a critical consideration. If you live in an area where it’s challenging to get affordable housing, that’s going to factor into impacts on clinical care and your ability to get to the doctor, and just have a place to live.</p>
<p>That translates into points of digital information about you that are separate from what you have in your health care record, but have to be considered. Where should they be considered, better than in a platform that you control for where that information is available and then shared with your health care provider? Conversely, there are things about your healthcare information that may need to be taken into account when you’re being provided housing, or for mental health, or for food security. However, that doesn’t mean that you’re giving consent to everyone that you meet, to have total access to your health care record.</p>
<p>There are all of these various factors and determinants that are looked at for modern healthcare: those are sources of digital information that only the individual concerned can control. So, we’re looking at how these factors of health equity and social determinants of health get considered from a verifiable credential standpoint. How do I tie together some of the work being done in HL7, and things like the Gravity Project for social determinants of health, into the identity model that we have in using a verifiable credential? Probably most importantly, how do we ensure that using verifiable credentials doesn’t create a problem for digital health equity (the so-called digital divide), but in some way, maybe even helps to mitigate or improve health equity problems that we’re seeing in digital health right now?</p>
<p>Mathieu: Are these layers that one would see if they’re <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallets-and-internationalizing-ssi-products/">using a digital wallet</a>? There could be an agent in your wallet, like your Lumedic Connect, that is able to process this the right way. I’ve seen it differently in different use cases, where we start talking less about credentials, but more about capabilities and skills. And so, you have this translation layer; is that something that would be similar to the health equity stuff?</p>
<p>Jim: Absolutely. That’s a wonderful observation, because, for us, this effort doesn’t stop with just the credential. The patient era is about patient empowerment. I mentioned before about AI and other tools you can use; I think that there’s nothing more important than continued advancement of the presentation layer, of that user experience. So much of this is just under the covers.</p>
<p>I joke around in the blockchain and healthcare community, to say, “The first rule of blockchain, is to stop talking about blockchain.” What you’re really talking about is, what is it in the decentralized application that improves things? We have to have applications that elderly Medicare recipients can understand how to use, as easily as a 25-year-old millennial Javascript developer. Specifically, in the world of healthcare: what can be done about healthcare terms and diagnosis and treatment plans that are not only easy to understand, but can translate into things from a user experience or an engagement platform, that work with the patient to keep them informed, to help them make decisions, and at the same time, help safeguard their data and the ability to share data and provide consent.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Are there new revenue opportunities, too? Are these conversations that come up with different people within the ecosystem? You mentioned that you got to talk about the value or the benefits, rather than just saying ‘blockchain’ or just talking about the technology. I’ve been seeing this for a while now, where this is great. Once I establish myself; let’s say I’m a healthcare provider, or let’s say I’m an insurance company, let’s say I’m a lab; these are all participants that would fit within the Lumedic Exchange. Do you work with them to define what the revenue models are? Are there concerns about, “Hey, what if my credentials are reusable, and shareable, and stuff like that — do I potentially lose on future revenue? Are these issues and topics that you guys talk about?</p>
<p>Jim: You know, I can’t say that we’ve had some of those specific conversations. But, I think some of what you’re alluding to is really important; the general concern overall that so many healthcare applications are just another form of surveillance capitalism. And, saying, “Hey, what a great application to help you manage your health care,” only to find out that you’re putting all of your personal data in it, and they’re doing something with it behind the scenes. That’s clearly not something we want to have as a problem.</p>
<p>I think that in general, as you mentioned the concept of verifiable credentials and using your patient identity, we all need to be cognizant of ways that you don’t inadvertently create that surveillance capitalism, or find new ways to construe information that becomes restrictive. Nobody wants to be able to have their healthcare data present a situation for an insurance company to pass judgment on not covering them or to raise their rates. Are there ways that healthcare information is anonymous around decision-making, or anonymized, that allow you to protect your identity, limit bias or unethical approaches, and at the same time, advance how that information is used for effective quality measures or quality metrics?</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s interesting. There’s something strong about having selective disclosure. But also, beyond that, being able to control your image or your persona, and not needing to necessarily divulge all the information about yourself so that you’re not completely exposing yourself to everyone and everywhere, basically, along the surveillance capitalism lines that you just said there. As a patient, if I’m now using Lumedic Connect, I have some credentials on there. I’m able to use different services and stuff like that that you’ll have on there. But, when I show up to a doctor’s office, and they’re still using their traditional systems in there; whether it’s an EHR or whatever it is, is that how it works? Is it that I show up at my doctor’s office, I scan a QR code, and I give them consent, and I transfer certain data to their system?</p>
<p>Jim: Yes, that is the long-term vision, for sure. You’re right; those are areas that our working groups are still sorting through to understand the specific mechanics. It is being approached with the idea that you would have, basically, a QR code presented. A QR code-reader has the fundamental interface point for everyone to consider. It could be Near Field Communications (NFC) or Bluetooth as we build upon it. However, that initial point of registration, and leveraging that QR code, is where our conversations are starting, that is correct.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Got it. I saw something posted that it’s being tested internally within the Providence system. This is being piloted; it’s being tested, it’s being used, as we speak.</p>
<p>Jim: Yes, it’s being piloted and tested around the vaccination credential first, because that’s obviously the use case; the other ones are in development. I would mention again, the opportunity that we’re afforded with Providence Health Systems is a landscape of 85 million patients and 120 000 caregivers. So, we have a very broad and diverse landscape in healthcare, to be able to leverage “in our own backyard,” which will help you know demonstrate efficacy for health care overall. It’s not merely a single clinic, in one single town someplace; which makes it very exciting to show the depth of development that’s possible.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Awesome. The other projects I’ve seen in the healthcare space have been more from the doctor, or the physician side of things. I know you collaborate with NHS, and I’ve heard conversations with them before. Is there collaboration with them, too? </p>
<p>Although, they’re touching the other side within the larger ecosystem; everyone needs to be plugged in.</p>
<p>Jim: That’s a great question. We don’t actually collaborate with NHS in the UK at the moment. I’ve had the pleasure to meet some colleagues there and talk with them a bit, but our focus is on the US. The US is so large, and so diverse in terms of what we’re trying to address; I’d welcome the chance to work with the NHS in the future, but we want to conquer US healthcare first.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That makes sense. In closing, Jim, what’s on the roadmap? What should people expect from Lumedic for the rest of 2021? How could people help out?</p>
<p>Jim: A couple of key points: our work with the Good Health Pass Collaborative, as well as internally with Lumedic, will continue to advance what a secure, privacy-preserving vaccination credential is like; if, in fact, people are called upon to need it for travel, and return to work, and so on.</p>
<p>We’re building upon that to help improve and revolutionize the registration workflow, which potentially saves patients a whole bunch of time and preserves their privacy as well; it can be tremendously efficient on the part of the healthcare systems, too. Also, continued growth and participation in the Lumedic Exchange; to define new use cases, new proofs-of-concept, and being able to advance this verifiable credential patient information platform concept that much further in 2021 and into 2022.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I love the vision towards the patient era. I think you guys are at the forefront, and I look forward to keeping a close eye on what’s happening, and the progress that’s going to be happening this year and over the next few years.</p>
<p>Jim, thank you very much for doing this with me today.</p>
<p>Jim: Thank you, Mathieu. It’s been a pleasure, and I look forward to you keeping me honest in our developments, my friend.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, Germany has become more open to innovative remote identity verification methods within the online gambling sector. These are welcome developments, and IDnow actively supports operators to meet their Know Your Customer (KYC) obligations with seamless and secure options.</p>
<p>Protecting minors from adult media content and adult entertainment has always been a top priority in Germany through the Protection of Young Persons Act (Jugendschutzgesetz – JuSchG) and the German Interstate Treaty on Gambling (ISTG), the latest being the ISTG 2021 effective July 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Licensing requirements for online gambling operators in Germany are stringent. For example, advertisements for online gambling offerings are allowed but with specific restrictions. In particular, advertising cannot be aimed towards minors; they cannot be presented as a way to solve financial problems, and there are strict limitations that ban broadcasting, or online advertising between 9 am and 6 pm when minors might be exposed. This is where strict identity verification requirements (Age Verification or AV) of players kick in to help protect minors from accessing such content and entering online gambling platforms.</p>
<p></p>


 
   
     
                                <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/new-german-gambling-regulation/">For everything there is to know about the new german regulation, read our new guide!</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 

<p>Convenient solutions</p>
<p>Some operators have gone about enforcing AV requirements by following treaty guidelines, whereas other operators have chosen not to follow regulatory requirements and offer simple AV methods where the player picks games according to age and plays accordingly. Other operators have chosen to simply not offer certain adult games in strictly regulated markets like Germany. The solutions are simple, and service providers like IDnow are able to offer products that are compliant and easy to use.</p>
<p>To date, identity verification requirements for gambling operators fall under the German Anti-Money Laundering Act (AML Act) as well as the Interstate Gambling Treaty. The guidelines on “permissible” remote AV methods come from the Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz (KJM), the Commission for the Protection of Minors. The KJM permits online gambling operators a choice of innovative remote methods legally by evaluating whether such systems meet technical and security requirements. Once a method has been evaluated to “satisfactorily” perform an AV, an operator is able to select the appropriate service. The remote method should enable the player’s ID document to be validated and must perform a comparison of the user’s biometric data.</p>
<p>IDnow, which began offering remote identity verification according to the strictest regulatory requirements under German AML law, was one of the first remote identity providers to receive a positive evaluation for both its Videoident and Autoident products to meet AV requirements securely. Document verification is a combination of checks being performed, which includes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) check of the Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ&nbsp;-the two lines at the bottom of the passport), with&nbsp;Selfie Comparison + Liveness Detection&nbsp;(selfie of the player).</p>
<p>All players entering an online gambling site must be age verified and operators who choose to use remote KYC methods ought to ensure they have been evaluated and approved by the KJM, such as IDnow product solutions which are available 24/7. Some of the biggest operators in the gambling world rely on compliant AV methods accepted in Germany to kick in responsible gambling. One of the biggest concerns that have come up for operators time and time again is the ability to offer a seamless user experience from verifying and onboarding players without any friction while ensuring that safe and responsible players are converted into regular customers. A top priority is to create a safe space for players and operators. IDnow is committed to helping operators maintain legal AV requirements and ensure high conversion rates. </p>

  NFTs have great potential for provable scarcity and ownership, yet the lack 
of a verifiable identity layer limits the fulfilment of this potential. 
This article presents a case of NFT fraud and copyright infringement, and 
describes how self-sovereign identity (SSI) can be the solution to verify 
the origin and legitimacy of an NFT and its linked object.

<blockquote>
<p>In this article, we first highlight the great potential that NFTs have in terms of provable scarcity and ownership, as well as an important shortcoming that is limiting the fulfillment of this potential: the lack of a verifiable identity layer. We describe how this lack of verifiable identity not only limits the use of NFTs for provable scarcity and ownership – it opens the gates for fraud and scams. Finally, we describe how self-sovereign identity (SSI) can be the solution to verify the origin and legitimacy of an NFT and its linked object, and we invite you to join Gimly and bitcoin artist Petek<a href="https://twitter.com/RadarRayne">@RaydarRayne</a> on our journey to fulfill the potential of NFTs for digital and physical artists alike.

 Non-fungible tokens: the basics 
<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are provably unique digital assets. They cannot be duplicated or divided creating digital scarcity. NFT's contain information that link a digital or physical object, and are recorded in smart contracts on decentralized blockchain networks which makes the record mathematically tamperproof. Ownership of an NFT is provably unique which is why investors and collectors are excited for this new digital format allowing them to have trustworthy collectables in the digital space. Under the hood, NFTs are actually software programs that exist on decentralised blockchains like <a href="https://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en">Ethereum</a> which give them their unique trust properties. Learn more about NFTs <a href="https://coincentral.com/nfts-non-fungible-tokens">here</a>.</p>
<p>This works very well with on-chain virtual objects that live on the blockchain which can be provably and uniquely linked to the NFT. Some good examples of this are digital cats on <a href="https://coincentral.com/nfts-non-fungible-tokens">Cryptokitties</a>, trading cards on <a href="https://rarepepewallet.com">Pepecard</a>, virtual land on <a href="https://decentraland.org">Decentraland</a> and video game items on <a href="https://ultra.io">Ultra</a>. </p>
<p>However, when we want to issue NFTs representing a physical or digital object that is not on the blockchain – such as a piece of art – we run into problems. Because the NFT and its object are not immutably linked, important questions arise about what it is that the NFT conveys ownership over. And is the creator of the NFT even authorized to convey such ownership? What is the legitimacy of the NFT and the creator of the NFT in the first place?</p>

 The identity problem 
<p>Petek <a href="https://twitter.com/RadarRayne">@RadarRayne</a>, a Bitcoin artist well-known for her <a href="https://www.petek.co.uk">artwork</a> representing the stock-to-flow model in collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD">PlanB</a>, recently found herself asking exactly these questions. A few weeks ago, she discovered that rarible.com listed an NFT falsely representing one of her latest prints in the limited series <a href="https://www.petek.co.uk/product-page/the-fourth-turning-s2f-print-limited-edition-of-200">"The Fourth Turning"</a>. This NFT was created by a scammer and was not actually backed by any of her artwork. It had nothing to do with Petek's art and was a serious infringement of her copyrights! So she asked herself: how could this happen? </p>
<p>Most blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are pseudo-anonymous. Accounts on the blockchain do not reveal any information about the identity that controls them. Anyone could take a screenshot from Peteks website, and NFT her artwork. There is no reliable way for the potential buyer to verify the origin and the legitimacy of the NFT creator. A buyer would need to visit Petek's website and even reach out in person to verify whether the NFT is legitimate.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in this case some of Petek's clients indeed reached out to her and Petek was able to have the NFT listing removed. But surely, there will be many more similar cases where such fraud is not detected in time. </p>
<p>This example deals with a physical piece of art, but the lack of a verifiable identity at the origin of an NFT is equally problematic for digital art. The lack of NFT verifiability also leads to intellectual property &amp; copyright infringements. Of course, it is possible to trace back the chain of custody to the creator's public address and see if similar artwork from the same artist is created using that address. But an instant and fool-proof manner to verify the legitimacy of an NFTs creator is lacking none the less. Without such verification built into the NFT, an NFT proves ownership only over that NFT itself, and nothing more.</p>
 Self-sovereign identity: verifying the origin and legitimacy of an NFT and the linked object 
<p>This is exactly the problem that self-sovereign identity (SSI) solves! SSI is a new set of standards that guide a new identity architecture for the Internet. With a focus on privacy, security interoperability, SSI applications use public key cryptography in consertion with public blockchains to create persistent identities with private and selective disclosure of information for people (and more generally, identity information for all kinds of entities - organizations, objects, IoT devices and more).</p>
<p>Because SSI is built for blockchain-based identities, it is the perfect solution to bring identity to NFTs! SSI applications enables the creator or artist to proveably sign off that a digital or physical asset was created by them. Buyers can then verifiably check they are indeed purchasing an NFT that was created by the artist.</p>
<p>Without this, NFTs of the future should not be considered legitimate, unless people don't mind them being "backed by thin air". SSI is what lends NFTs the "value beyond the token itself" immutably, and cryptographically connected to said asset in perpetuity.</p>
 Learn more about SSI and IoT with non-fungible tokens 
<p>We are currently consulting with Petek on how we can future proof her artwork from being scammed by offering SSI-backed NFTs with value that is also connected to the actual artwork through "artist approved" verification methods and proveable ownership with our <a href="https://www.gimly.io/blog/gimly-in-essif-ssi-and-nfc-smartcards">self-sovereign identity NFC chips</a>.</p>

The intelligence report published by UNDP Bhutan can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bt.undp.org/content/bhutan/en/home/library/intelligenc-report-systems-approach-to-youth-unemployment-in-bhutan.html">here</a>.</blockquote><p>*This blog includes a link to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0">glossary</a> which defines the terms&nbsp;used.</p> Introduction  Bhutan in transition <p>Bhutan, a country of roughly 760,000 people and one of the very few <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/carbon-negative-country-sustainability">carbon-negative countries</a> in the world, faces unique challenges in designing a viable and sustainable employment market for its growing youth population. With more than <a href="https://www.nsb.gov.bt/publications/census-report/">half the population below the median age of 27</a>, it is experiencing an unprecedented demographic bulge that is projected to <a href="https://www.nsb.gov.bt/download/5006/">increase further</a> in the next couple of decades. To make matters worse, youth unemployment rates have remained consistently high over the past decades, with the highest record in 2018 when it reached <a href="https://kuenselonline.com/youth-unemployment-rate-drops-to-11-9/#:~:text=The%20Labour%20Force%20Survey%20Report,was%2012.3%20percent%20in%202017">15.7 percent</a>. Now that COVID-19 has impeded major industries such as hospitality and tourism, the economic shocks have hit young people the hardest. According to the Rapid Socio-Economic Impact Assessment on Bhutan’s Tourism Sector conducted in April 2020, the pandemic has impacted over 50,000 young people working in the tourism and hospitality sector. They made up <a href="https://thebhutanese.bt/druk-gyalpos-relief-kidu-to-be-continued-beyond-the-3rd-phase/">50% of the welfare applications received in&nbsp;2020</a>.</p><p>These demographic and economic shifts prompt questions about how Bhutan’s economy and society may develop in the 21st century, and within this, what the future of work would look like. The pandemic, while posing several challenges, also presented opportunities to redefine the country’s employment scenario with many educated, experienced Bhutanese diasporas returning home from abroad. In the midst of huge technological leaps taking place globally, there is a growing demand for new markets and business models, new jobs, the reshaping of old industries and the re-definition of work itself in Bhutan as well. Central to this is the need to unleash human potential — creating capabilities in the system for innovation, purpose, shared value creation, and the realisation of new&nbsp;futures.</p> Systems approach to youth employment — a methodology for collective sensemaking  How can we think beyond job markets, and expand our understanding of the employment issue? <p>Too often, unemployment is viewed as a supply-demand problem, where solutions are designed to trigger job creation (increasing supply) or job training (increasing employability and fulfilling demand). But what if that is not enough? The persistence of the problem in Bhutan, and elsewhere, confirms that intervening in the job market alone does not provide a sustainable solution. The behaviour of the individual, and the social and economic environments that the labour market is embedded in — are shaped by numerous interconnected factors such as, the availability of social protection, parental influence, changing expectations, stigma of certain professions, access to digital infrastructure, and so on. The sum of their complex interdependencies we call — a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A2:B2">system (or systems)</a>. This is how we — <a href="https://www.bt.undp.org/content/bhutan/en/home/about-us.html">UNDP Bhutan</a> and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> — approached Bhutan’s youth employment issue in this 3-month project. The challenge for us was to find a methodology that would allow us to build an awareness of the systemic nature of the issue at stake, and to broaden our horizons in order to imagine new solutions.</p>Figure 1. Layering and communicating complexity through systems&nbsp;mapping How can we understand and embrace complexity? <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A3:B3">Complexity</a> begets complexity for <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01405730">wicked problems</a>. An attempt at analysing the intricacies of systems — the pain points, underlying drivers, risks, and numerous interconnected factors — can easily become overwhelming for one person. Moreover, if we have ten people attempting to do the same, we would probably end up with ten different versions of the analysis. So, how do we prevent ourselves from getting lost in this vast web of interdependencies? How do we do this collectively? How do we build a shared comprehension that can steer us towards the coveted solution&nbsp;space?</p><p>Through extensive engagement with multiple stakeholders, UNDP Bhutan and Dark Matter Labs experimented with the methodology of participatory <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A5:B5">systems mapping</a> as a process of engagement — creating a shared language and comprehension. More importantly, the systems map that we collectively developed, functioned — and still functions — as a critical storytelling tool that represents the diverse interests and experiences of the people involved in the process. Below, we share some key learnings from this&nbsp;process.</p> Complexity vs. Simplicity <p>Using data collected from <a href="https://undp-bhutan.exposure.co/looking-beyond-statistics-for-stories">prior research</a> (which involved desk research and interviews) and ideas generated through <a href="https://undp-ric.medium.com/youth-employment-why-business-as-usual-wont-cut-it-63551751df59">stakeholder workshops</a>, we mapped the connections between factors — each representing a problem — that influence individuals’ options and behaviors regarding work: from family background to market conditions, and global and regional forces. To organise and process the vast number of nodes (factors) and their connections, we created a classification system using the following domains.</p>Figure 2. Classification system for nodes, using contextual and direct&nbsp;domains<p>As we mapped the connections, we realised that the more connections there were, the more challenging it was to make sense of the data. Multiple layers of lines not only made it difficult to track connections visually, but also to see patterns and hierarchies. However, privileging simplicity might risk simplification — leaving out details and erasing the nuances that make the map authentic. So, the challenge was twofold: we needed to create a visual solution that could communicate complexity without sacrificing legibility, and devise a narrative solution that could preserve — and would allow us to exfoliate — the layers of complexity.</p><p>We did the latter by highlighting a series of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A6:B6">micro-narratives</a> that each represent a critical issue that contributes to the challenge of youth unemployment in Bhutan. Each narrative comprises a cluster of nodes (pain points) and takes into account the weight of the connections (which is determined by the number of connected nodes). Superimposed on the map itself, these micro-narratives provide an entry point into the critical issues, and allow zooming in at the numerous branching connections.</p>Figure 3. Micro-narratives composed of multiple interconnected nodes Navigating complex&nbsp;systems <p>A map is not merely a representation of a place (in this case, a system), it serves a function of navigation. Just as geographic coordinates give you a sense of location, and terrain data informs your direction — a systems map helps to orient ourselves; to find direction and make better decisions. The micro-narratives are one layer of information, the domain classifications are another. These layers were designed not to simplify information, but to provide entry points from where the full complexity of the system can be explored. And, because this is an open-ended map that has been validated and iterated constantly through the stakeholder workshops, the narratives also provoke and invite further engagement and augmentation.</p> Perspectives from within the&nbsp;system <p>While drawing inspiration from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics">system dynamics model</a> which sees the world as a complex system of feedback loops, our approach to systems mapping diverged in its method and purpose. The participatory — as opposed to the technical — approach to systems mapping invites multiple stakeholders, experts and non-experts alike, to map their knowledge, experience, and perspectives onto a collective map. Rather than the map itself, it is the process of co-creation, of collective reflection and discussion, that leads to a shared comprehension of the problem at hand. Often, it is easy to interpret the systems map as something factual, providing a holistic overview of the system from a distance. Systems maps crafted through the participatory process may not serve such an objective function. Instead, they can demonstrate the collective insights gathered from those within the&nbsp;system.</p>Figure 4. Identifying “opportunity domains”, highlighting possible interventions across the whole&nbsp;system. New possibilities of sensemaking in the digital&nbsp;age <p>During the process of mapping and synthesising, we used digital tools such as <a href="https://graphcommons.com/">Graph Commons</a> and <a href="https://kumu.io/">Kumu</a> that played a vital role in supporting human synthesis and discovering insights. By interacting with machine-generated clusters and correlations, we became more aware of the human biases involved in creating connections and causal relationships. For example, due to the nuances of language: the way in which a node was described had an effect on how we drew connections, and thus required continuous crafting and validation. The digital tools and algorithms helped us in this process and contributed to the visualisation and compounding of our very human <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A4:B4">sensemaking</a> efforts by highlighting and weighting the connections we had&nbsp;made.</p>Figure 5. Process of ‘human’ and ‘machine’ sensemaking<p>We are aware of the growing number of tools and technologies that support our human sensemaking capacity, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis">factor analysis</a>, <a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/creative-network-science-graph-commons-neo4j-graphconnect/">network analysis</a> and many more. Perhaps through these new methods of combining human and machine analysis, while acknowledging the limitations and possibilities of both, we could arrive at a more nuanced and plural understanding of the&nbsp;system.</p> The opportunity space — creating <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A9:B9">horizontal capacities</a> for innovation  Building a portfolio of experiments across the&nbsp;system <p>Complex systems require a variety of different actors: citizens, civil society organisations, research organisations, entrepreneurs/local businesses and governments working in coalition to build transformative, long-term visions, and diverse solutions. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A8:B8">portfolio approach</a> enables us to create a network of experiments — for collective learning, hypothesising, testing and validating across different sites. It can reduce information asymmetries and allow different actors to share and manage risks in the real world. The catalyst for change may not come from one organisation or one single intervention. Instead, it can emerge in the form of portfolios, and networks of portfolios, owned and developed by multiple organisations invested in and committed to the same&nbsp;mission.</p> Every actor in the system can create their solutions <p>The portfolio approach brings into perspective the possibilities of a dynamic innovation mechanism, where the number of experiments multiplies by the number of actors involved, and interventions can generate positive change across different parts of the system, simultaneously. It leads to a number of critical questions as well. How can we ensure that these experiments are not carried out in silos? How can we facilitate actors to organise around shared missions? How can ownership be distributed, equitably, regardless of the power dynamics within the system? How can we create the conditions for deep system awareness, and facilitate learning between actors? These questions prompt us to think about the capacities and capabilities that could be built into the system to enable the matters of the&nbsp;“how”.</p><p>The framework for the portfolio of experiments that we designed, partly reflects these concerns:</p>Figure 6. A framework for a portfolio of experiments developed in order to identify investment gaps. Ideas from participants from the systems map workshops were mapped on to the framework.<p>In the Y axis, we categorise types of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x6Awex3zcSGRgIcmd6SblNd5K5T6idjFbJikv7-Mr0/edit#gid=0&amp;range=A7:B7">experiments</a>, ranging from governance and regulatory, to financing and cultural experiments. On the X axis, capacities are defined according to scale — ranging from individual, collective, to system capacities. Instead of seeing the experiments as direct solutions to tackle the problem (a form of product innovation), this new framework prompts us to ask what the experiments can catalyse in terms of building the capacities to innovate from within the system. Does it contribute to building individual capacities — a sense of agency, awareness, ability to imagine, and collaborate? And does it contribute to our collective capacities of shared sensemaking, decision making, generating political will and legitimacy? And/or is it about building the infrastructure and mechanisms at the system level for shared accountability, shared data, knowledge, financial structures, and metrics that could help us prioritise and measure the success of our interventions?</p><p>These perspectives and questions provide a glimpse into the potentials of shifting the focus from a service/product centred innovation (emphasis on the what) to a capacity/capability centred approach (touching upon the how) where every actor in the system can innovate and build their solutions/portfolios towards long-term transitions. It also brings to attention the role of backbone organisations such as UNDP and its partners in facilitating and provoking systems change. Perhaps a first step towards this shift is cultivating and refining the methods to build deep system awareness, allowing us to explore freely, digest, validate, and socialise the complexity of the&nbsp;system.</p> Next steps <p>Moving forward, UNDP Bhutan and Gross National Happiness Commission (GNHC) will continue the process of co-creating a portfolio of experiments with relevant stakeholders in Bhutan and beyond. Experiments will be led by different actors, but with a common portfolio logic and a common framework to support collective intelligence; as well as the capacity to support continuous learning, testing and experimentation.

<p>For our Thursday Tech Talk on April 8th, 2021, we were joined by Tienson Qin, creator of LogSeq. LogSeq is "a privacy-first, open-source platform for knowledge sharing and management".</p><p>The first fun surprise is that Tienson used LogSeq itself for the presentation. You can <a href="https://tiensonqin.github.io/#/page/introduction%20to%20logseq">find the content on Tienson's page</a>.</p><blockquote>The long-term goal is to help children and more people to connect their thoughts with the past and the future<br><br>— <a href="https://twitter.com/tiensonqin">@TiensonQin</a></blockquote><p>LogSeq was started in February 2020. Not as a "clone" of anything, but inspired by <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a>, Emacs <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>, <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam Research</a>, and more.</p><p>The logo is very basic – and the community is working on some upgraded designs – but it's meant to represent footprints in the sand: the marks you make in your life, gathering and sharing knowledge.</p><p>Supports both Markdown and Org-mode formats in the browser. You don't have to learn Emacs and you can still have all of the power of Org mode.</p><p>Doesn't quite have all of the features of Org mode implemented...yet! [1]</p><p>Tienson showed us the <a href="https://web.dev/file-system-access/">File System Access API</a>: currently a Chrome only browser API that allows for reading and writing from local file systems. This means being able to mix and match editing files in Emacs, with LogSeq editing files from the browser, or any combination. </p><p>LogSeq is written in ClojureScript, plus OCaml and DataScript, because Tienson didn't have any JavaScript experience but did have lots of experience with Clojure:</p><blockquote><p>From his background <a href="https://twitter.com/tiensonqin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tiensonqin</a> didn't have JavaScript experience, but rather Clojure. So, built using ClojureScript for the front end, plus OCaml and DataScript <a href="https://t.co/CxDqz4saG6">pic.twitter.com/CxDqz4saG6</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1380321684092149761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>We got lots of demos of the query system. Uses <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript">DataScript</a> for "raw" queries, as well as some built in LogSeq query syntax. Everything is customizable by the user, and editable from directly within LogSeq itself.</p><p>Tienson is working on this full time, and has a small team of other developers working on it too. There are 111 contributors on Open Collective, and LogSeq also supports two of their downstream dependencies:</p>  <a href="https://opencollective.com/excalidraw">excalidraw</a>: a virtual whiteboard for sketching hand-drawn like diagrams  <a href="https://opencollective.com/babashka">babashka:</a> a native scripting environment for Clojure  <p>It was very inspiring to hear from Tienson. Several times he referenced sharing knowledge and making it available to his daughter, and making LogSeq open source, privacy preserving, and available for years to come.</p><blockquote><p>So awesome to hear from <a href="https://twitter.com/tiensonqin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tiensonqin</a> about his wish for his daughter and others to keep building and sharing knowledge graphs and between all PKM tools. <a href="https://t.co/EX93tMsv6f">pic.twitter.com/EX93tMsv6f</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1380324467512012800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>As part of the final wrap up, a LogSeq user Hilary mainly just wanted to say thanks to Tienson, which was awesome to hear:</p><blockquote>No questions here, I just wanted to say that I’ve been using logseq for a while now and I love it - I’m not much of a developer, just a normal user keeping track of a lot of meetings, tasks, notes, and writing projects for work - and wanted to say thanks, Tienson, you are doing an awesome job.</blockquote><p>We're definitely interested in seeing if we can add Fission webnative support for LogSeq, so that files can be synced and optionally encrypted, without having to have a Github account.</p> Resources   Use the app right in your browser <a href="https://logseq.com">logseq.com</a>  Visit the documentation <a href="https://logseq.github.io">logseq.github.io</a>, especially the <a href="https://logseq.github.io/#/page/new%20to%20logseq%3F">New to LogSeq</a> section  Source code in <a href="https://github.com/logseq/logseq">Github logseq/logseq</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/logseq/logseq/releases">releases of the desktop Electron app</a>  Feature requests and forum discussion <a href="https://discuss.logseq.com/">discuss.logseq.com</a>  Sponsor on <a href="https://opencollective.com/logseq">OpenCollective</a>  Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/KpN4eHY">Discord chat</a>  Follow the project on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/logseq">@LogSeq</a> and Tienson <a href="https://twitter.com/tiensonqin">@tiensonqin</a>  <p>[1] We had some discussion live around how long Emacs has been around. 1976 was when Emacs created, Emacs Lisp came along in 1985, and Org mode <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/History-and-Acknowledgments.html">started relatively recently in 2003 "out of frustration over the user interface of the Emacs Outline mode"</a>.</p> <p>Sign up for more Thursday Tech Talks like this one on the <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">Fission events page »</a></p>

 À la suite d’un piratage, les conséquences peuvent être dramatiques… Sécuriser efficacement son site web sans non plus devenir « parano » est donc essentiel. D’autant plus au travers du contexte sanitaire actuel, où le nombre d’entreprises évoluant vers la digitalisation augmente de jour en jour. Ce phénomène induit par conséquent une croissance considérable des risques de piratage.

				  Sécuriser les accès de mes sites web en 3 leçons  
			   
				
				
				  Mardi 27 Avril – 10h30  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Selon une étude menée par OWASP, l’une des failles de sécurité les plus importantes aujourd’hui (classée en deuxième position) est la mauvaise sécurisation des accès administrateurs et utilisateurs. En parallèle et grâce à PT Security, on sait aujourd’hui que les hackers peuvent prendre le contrôle de 9 sites sur 10 analysés en passant pas les accès utilisateurs, et peut-être que le vôtre en fait partie.</p>
<p>L’objectif de ce Webinar est tout d’abord de vous faire prendre conscience des risques encourus à cause de quelques maladresses, et de vous montrer comment sécuriser simplement vos accès administrateurs et utilisateurs afin de garder une longueur-d’avance sur les cyber-attaquants.</p>

 BLOKCHAIN PER LA RACCOLTA DEI RIFIUTI<br><br> 
 
<p>IL TRACCIAMENTO DEI RIFIUTI ATTRAVERSO LA BLOCKCHAIN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<p><br>La tecnologia Blockchain può efficacemente essere impiegata per&nbsp; tracciare in modo certificato la raccolta, il trasporto e lo smaltimento di rifiuti.</p>
<p>In questo processo sono considerate le fasi che partono dall’immissione dell’ordine, di lavoro notarizzandone la conformità ed evitando la corruttibilità, attraverso l’utilizzo di un servizio che la tecnologia Blockchain fornisce nativamente: gli Smart Contract.</p>
<p>Attraverso l'utilizzo di&nbsp; Smart Contract, &nbsp;si va a verificare la congruenza del dato inserito ad ogni passaggio dell’attività eseguendo dei controlli specifici, caso per caso, e garantendo incorruttibilità ed eliminando ogni rischio di contraffazione e anomalia.</p>
<p><br>TRASPARENZA DELLA GESTIONE RIFIUTI ATTRAVERSO LA PIATTAFORMA<br>BLOKI<br><br></p>
 <br> 
<p><br><br>GESTIONE RIFIUTI 4.0<br><br></p>
<p>Il Digitale fornisce ormai da tempo nuovi strumenti per le imprese, dove la tecnologia e la digitalizzazione dei processi hanno portato&nbsp; novità incredibili per migliorare la gestione rifiuti.</p>
<p>Termini come Blockchain, IOT, Machine Learning e ‘Intelligenza Artificiale‘ sono sempre più utilizzate nel settore dei rifiuti. Queste tecnologie &nbsp;saranno sempre più presenti in futuro garantendo migliori prestazioni dell’organizzazione e performance più efficaci in ogni passaggio della gestione del rifiuto, a partire dalla profilazione iniziale di una nuova attività &nbsp;fino alla gestione della tariffazione puntuale. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Affidarsi alla Blockchain è un passaggio chiave; integrata con i sistemi gestionali permette di certificare e rendere disponibili, in modo non alterabile, dati, informazioni, tempistiche e processi. Permette prestazioni più veloci, minori costi di trattamento e più sicurezza e garanzia di sostenibilità e conformità.</p>
<p>Analizziamo un caso specifico. Il D.lgs. n. 22/1997 (cosiddetto decreto Ronchi) e successivamente il D.lgs. n.152/2006 hanno introdotto 3 strumenti fondamentali:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>· il Formulario di Identificazione dei Rifiuti (FIR)</p>
<p>· il Registro di Carico e Scarico dei Rifiuti</p>
<p>· il Modello Unico di Dichiarazione ambientale (MUD)</p>
<p>La scelta di utilizzare Bloki integrato nella piattaforma gestionale per certificare dati relativi ai processi interni di trattamento rifiuti è quindi motivata dalla possibilità di avere l’archiviazione e l’accesso certificato ai documenti sopra citati direttamente sulla Blockchain. Oltre questo, ogni singola operazione sarà dotata di marca temporale precisa ed immutabile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LA PIATTAFORMA &nbsp;BLOKI</p>
<p>VANTAGGI<br><br></p>
 
 La piattaforma introduce diversi vantaggi per gli operatori: 
 &nbsp;presenza di backup delle informazioni che non è legato alla propria struttura di archiviazione, ma che si trova Bloki,&nbsp; un registro distribuito su diversi nodi (server)&nbsp;facilità nelle verifiche da parte di auditor o enti di controllo, che potranno reperire le informazioni relative ai trattamenti dell’Azienda direttamente dalla Blockchain BLOKI, grazie alle caratteristiche di immutabilità e incensurabilità delle informazioni inserite 
 miglioramento dell’immagine e della reputation aziendale trasmettendo una maggior fiducia, data dalla scelta di potere condividere le proprie informazioni in un modo totalmente trasparente 
 
  
<p><br>TIPOLOGIE DI RIFIUTI<br><br></p>
<p>Grazie alla propria flessibilità, &nbsp;BLOKI &nbsp;riesce a gestire ogni &nbsp;tipologia di rifiuto e di processo. Il Tracciamento Certificato dei Rifiuti prevede che BLOKI supporti le fasi operative che possono essere schematizzate come di seguito:</p>
 
<p>Ricezione della richiesta attività e apertura task<br>Definizione e Apposizione identificativo lotto<br>Certificazione delle varie fasi di passaggio del Task<br>Chiusura del Task</p>

Today, there is endless hype about the enormous economic potential of data. That is why the UK Government is developing a National Data Strategy. Yet most debate (and therefore decision-making) about it demonstrates a deep misunderstanding of where this value lies and how it can be unleashed. For a National Data Strategy to be successful, it has to get its underlying economic logic&nbsp;right.</p> Cost plus versus cost&nbsp;out <p>Currently, nearly every Government proposal and policy relating to data (including personal data) treats data as a corporate asset that the organisation has invested in. The organisation therefore needs to earn a return on this investment (it is assumed). Like any other product, data needs to be sold (or rented) for a margin. The entire focus is on measuring and the potential size of ‘the market for data’, the supposed value of different bits of data in this market, and how to enable this market to work better. It’s all about <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-curse-of-monetisation-c636da32ef08">monetisation of&nbsp;data</a>.</p><p>At first glance, this seems logical. After all, if organisations have invested a lot of time and money creating data assets, it’s only sensible that they should find a way to cover these costs. What this misses, however, is the opportunity to take cost out of the system as a whole — to move it to a different cost baseline — where new ways of sharing and using data pay for themselves many times over without anyone having the need to sell or ‘monetise’ anything.</p><p>Henry Ford’s mass production moving assembly line is a good example of the immense opportunities opened up by such system-wide ‘cost out’ approaches.</p><p>Before the moving assembly line, cars were extraordinarily expensive items, made painstakingly by craftspeople who made each component separately. Because each component was hand made and therefore slightly different, to assemble them into a working machine, they had to re-work every component to make it&nbsp;fit.</p><p>This required exquisite skill. The ability to do it well was a key source of the craftsperson’s added value. But it was also incredibly expensive. By relying on standardised components, Ford’s production lines eliminated the need for this rework. And by bringing each component to the worker when they needed it, his moving assembly line eliminated unnecessary time spent searching for, travelling to, or waiting for parts to arrive — thus reducing another layer of effort and speeding up&nbsp;outputs.</p><p>When Henry Ford first experimented with his ‘cost out’ moving assembly line, people were astonished by the efficiency gains it delivered. Before the experiment, it took 29 workers 15 minutes to make a magneto (which helps start ignition). After the experiment it took 14 workers 5 minutes: an 85% leap in productivity. Similar productivity gains followed as he applied the same methods to the rest of the car. Car output soared from 68,773 in 1912 to 735,020 in 1917. The price of his cars fell by 90%. Nobody had seen just how much waste was embedded into how the old system worked. The waste was previously invisible to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Given the extensive pollution, congestion and occasional carnage caused by the motor car, many people might say it ended up being more of a curse than a blessing. But we are not talking about the merits of the car itself here. We are talking about economic principles that powered an entire industrial revolution.</p><p>The moving assembly line eliminated huge amounts of waste that were embedded into every sinew of how the previous system worked: the waste caused by the need to rework every component and by poor logistics which meant that the right things could not get to the right people at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>Personal data stores apply the same economic logic to transform the costs of producing data driven services. <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">Verified attributes</a> are the digital equivalents of Henry Ford’s standardised parts. By enabling one organisation to instantly re-use data verified by another organisation they eliminate the need for vast amounts of duplicated effort and rework (re-creating each data point from scratch or checking its details, provenance etc).</p><p>And by enabling individuals to hold these verified attributes in readiness, and to share them safely and efficiently with service providers when they need to be used, personal data stores act as data logistics engines bringing the right data components to the right places at the right time (the equivalent of Henry Ford’s moving assembly&nbsp;line).</p><p>Our early experiments are showing similar efficiency and productivity gains to those realised by Henry Ford. There is now an opportunity to create order of magnitude reductions in the costs of providing data-driven services (initially in the public sector). Just to be clear: by order of magnitude reductions in costs, we don’t mean five or even ten per cent here or there but a complete system that is five or ten times more efficient.</p> When dogs don’t&nbsp;bark <p>In one of his famous detective stories Sherlock Holmes notices something crucial that no one else had: he notices something that hadn’t happened.</p><p>Humans are hard-wired to notice things that happen. But it’s very difficult to become aware of things that are not happening — things that could or should be happening but&nbsp;aren’t.</p><p>This happened with the motor car. Before Henry Ford’s revolution, the idea that owning and using a motor car would become a mass market open to ordinary people was literally laughable — when Ford suggested it was possible, people laughed at him. They said there was no demand for it. They were right. But the reason why there was ‘no demand’ was because cars were prohibitively expensive. The dog wasn’t barking. People weren’t noticing something that wasn’t happening: making cars affordable.</p><p>When Ford made his breakthrough, the dog started barking. Instead of being an exclusive, privileged plaything of the very rich, motorised mobility was democratised. Result? Society was transformed as people started driving to work, to shops, to leisure destinations and to new homes in newly created suburbs. The 20th century mass ‘consumer / car economy’ was built on this breakthrough.</p><p>Online search is another example. Before Google, very few people conducted searches for information because doing so was so prohibitively expensive in terms of time and effort. Another non-barking dog. Then Google made search very easy, and now most people conduct searches dozens of times a day, spawning a vast new market apparently out of thin&nbsp;air.</p><p>Waking the data&nbsp;dog</p><p>Today, it’s commonly said that individuals don’t want to manage their data. “There is no demand for it,” we are told again and again. But that’s because, under the current system, it’s prohibitively expensive in terms of time and effort to do so. How many people want to invest precious time, effort (and sometimes money) finding, collecting and presenting the information they need to get stuff done: filling in forms; proving facts about themselves; trying to join the dots created by organisations that work in isolated silos? No wonder they do it as little as possible. Until the opportunity to do things differently is presented to them, helping people handle their data better remains another non-barking dog.</p><p>By applying those same principles of standardised parts and improved logistics — by waking that dog — personal data stores have the potential to democratise how society uses personal data, spreading the benefits to every citizen. Just like ‘the great car economy’, the way services are created and delivered will be transformed while making new ones possible — services that enable citizens to use their data to organise and manage their lives much better, to make and implement better decisions and to undertake associated administration across every aspect of their lives (money, home, education and career, travel, leisure etc)&nbsp;… all at a fraction of the previous cost and effort currently involved.</p><p>Everything we’ve written in our last five blogs has been focused on waking the 21st century dog of low cost, high quality, mass produced, privacy protecting, personalised, data driven services. Yet, time and time again we are told ‘there is no demand’ for a new personal data logistics infrastructure that empowers citizens with their data, just as Ford empowered citizens with mobility.</p><p>Why is this? Because they haven’t noticed that the dog is not barking. Their attention is focused on the current system as it is, not what it could be. They are simply not seeing the huge amounts of waste embedded in its workings (or if they do, they undertake ‘red tape reduction’ initiatives that reproduce the very causes of that waste) because they are not looking at the connections between the parts, only at how to improve the efficiency of each part in splendid isolation. They have not learned the lessons of mass production.</p> A positive feedback&nbsp;loop <p>All the really big service and quality of life breakthroughs of the past 100 years — including the provision of universal running water, sewerage, electricity, education and health services — have two things in common. First, they were first and foremost infrastructure projects, making something essential universally available at low cost. Second, they directly improved individuals’ lives and, at the same time, they also improved society’s health and resilience and the efficiency and productivity of the economy as a whole. They combined personal and public&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>Providing every citizen with their own personal data store — another case of universal service provision — follows this pattern. The way it achieves this combined benefit is order-of-magnitude reductions in the friction, effort, risks and costs individuals and service providers incur when attempting to collect, store, share and use personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>In a post-Covid world trying hard to ‘build back better’ the need for infrastructure that enables verified data about people to be shared while protecting their privacy has never been more apparent. Government today has a once in a generation opportunity to do something truly transformative and rebuild in a way that benefits everyone. This is what the National Strategy for Personal Data can and should be aiming&nbsp;for.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-transformational-potential-of-personal-data-da47f666713e">Hidden in Plain Sight — the Transformational Potential of Personal Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

         SETTORE LOGISTICA E SUPPLY CHAIN<p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>L’efficienza è uno dei più importanti fattori di competitività sul mercato.</p><p>La costante ricerca di agilità da parte delle aziende e il loro desiderio di arrivare sul mercato col prodotto giusto, di qualità e nei tempi stabiliti si scontra con l’assenza di visibilità end-to-end e un disomogeneo livello organizzativo e di&nbsp;digitalizzazione delle aziende coinvolte.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>   <br>   <p><br>La logistica è l'insieme delle attività organizzative, &nbsp;gestionali e operative che governano nell'azienda e nella filiera &nbsp;i flussi di materiali e delle relative informazioni nella rete delle imprese, &nbsp;dalle origini presso i fornitori fino alla consegna dei prodotti finiti ai clienti e al servizio post-vendita .&nbsp; In quanto tale, è una delle funzioni chiave all’interno dell’azienda. In un’ottica che vede l’organizzazione aziendale come un sistema aperto interagente con l’ambiente esterno, la logistica rappresenta l’insieme delle modalità attraverso cui l’impresa recepisce gli input (di varia natura, sia materiali che informativi), e distribuisce gli output prodotti verso i sistemi di vendita. Si può affermare senza dubbio che la logistica definisce l’identità dell’azienda e il modo in cui essa viene identificata sia da coloro che sono a monte nella filiera produttiva, sia da coloro che sono a valle, fino ad arrivare appunto ai consumatori.</p>  <br>BLOCKCHAIN VANTAGGI<p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>La Blockchain da&nbsp; risposte a molte delle criticità che interessano questo settore (carente tracciabilità dei prodotti, difficile attribuzione delle responsabilità, difficile integrazione operativa, &nbsp;possibilità di frode e compliance normativa difficilmente dimostrabile) costituendone la base per dar vita ad una catena del valore fondata sui principi di trasparenza, sicurezza e tracciabilità.</p><p>La Blockchain, coordinata con piattaforme di sensoristica e oracoli per massimizzare l’efficienza delle reti più estese, si pone come fondamento della trust economy e vede nelle catene di distribuzione uno dei primi ambiti di applicazione.</p>  <br>L’UTILIZZO DELLA BLCKCHAIN<p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>risponde alla risoluzione della visibilità end-to-end, che riguardi tutti i processi offrendo la massima capacità informativa</p>  <p>garantisce la sicurezza del dato e dei processi (dati di produzione, tracciabilità dei componenti, spostamenti dei materiali, la logistica, lo stock, conformità normativa e rispetto degli standard di qualità) a favore di tutti gli stakeholder</p>  <p>genera una gestione della supply chain resiliente</p>  <p>introduce la semplificazione in ogni passaggio di processo</p>

 Tramite la rete blockchiain di Bloki garantire l'integrità dei dati, memorizzando un'unica versione immutabile della verità. Bloki e Sanistory gestiscono in modo semplice le attività di sanificazione &nbsp;tra&nbsp; i partecipanti alla rete&nbsp; i quali possono collaborare con la fiducia, in quanto si scambiano informazioni controllando l'accesso ai dati.<br><br>Ottenere la piena tracciabilità<br><br>Man mano che le informazioni ( bollettini, certificati, report, analisi, foto ecc.)&nbsp; attraverso &nbsp;la supply chain, vengono registrati in Bloki-Sanistory, si viene a creare una &nbsp;traccia di verifica, che implica che si può risalire alle origini di un evento, organizzato in sequenza e corredato con data e ora. Questo aiuta a ridurre la contraffazione&nbsp; di quell'evento e i partecipanti &nbsp;possono localizzare il dato &nbsp;in pochi secondi, in modo da poter rispondere rapidamente. 
 &nbsp; 
  
  
 <br>Acquisire nuovi aspetti di efficienza e operativa 
 
 Dalla risoluzione delle controversie all'attivazione delle fasi successive nelle transazioni della supply chain.&nbsp; I contratti intelligenti di Bloki possono automatizzare i processi per una maggiore velocità ed efficienza e &nbsp;intervengono automaticamente quando vengono soddisfatte le condizioni stabilite. 
 &nbsp; 
  
 
 &nbsp;<br>Tecnologia per supportare le tue esigenze 
 ​Oggi chi lavora nel settore della sanificazione rispettando i protocolli sanitari, ricoprono &nbsp;ruoli essenziali nella nostra società.&nbsp;Eqr&nbsp;Lab&nbsp;si impegna a fornire agli operatori del settore &nbsp;strumenti e servizi pensati per ottenere più &nbsp; intuizione dai dati &nbsp;e per semplificare le attività di condivisione.Cerchiamo di aiutare le organizzazioni a raggiungere i loro obiettivi in termini di efficienza, resistenza e affidabilità, in modo da soddisfare le esigenze delle comunità.

 CERTEZZA DEI PROCESSI DICHIARATI 
 
 &nbsp; 
 SMALTIMENTO 
 La registrazione in Blockchain&nbsp;Bloki&nbsp;del corretto protocollo per lo smaltimento&nbsp; dei rifiuti edili, passando dal corretto trasporto al centro di raccolta e smaltimento autorizzato al formulario di identificazione dei rifiuti. 
 ​ 
  
 <br>PROGETTO 
 I Processi di progettazione, autorizzativi, realizzativi, di collaudo, di agibilità ecc possono essere certificati&nbsp; in modo aggregato&nbsp; e condivisi secondo le diverse competenze (Società imprese, progettisti, uffici, collaudatori) in maniera brillante dalla Blockchain e dagli&nbsp;Smarct Contract di Bloki.<br><br> 
  
 <br>MATERIALI 
 La provenienza e &nbsp;la qualità dei materiali usati. 
 Per ogni tipologia di materiale la sua specifica disciplina e qualificazione, e il possesso del benestare di tutte le conformità e l'idoneità tecniche. Il tutto registrato in Blockchain&nbsp;Bloki&nbsp;in modalità sicura, marcata temporalmente e di&nbsp; facile e semplice accessibilità. 
 Tutti i materiali possono essere tracciati e rintracciati dal momento della produzione fino alla consegna finale in cantiere. Ciò significa che un documento di dati non manipolabile verrebbe memorizzato e gestito per l’intero ciclo di vita del materiale, caratterizzando&nbsp; una profonda trasparenza.<br><br> 
  
 <br>COSTRUZIONE 
 anche la fase di costruzione è caratterizzata da questa continua &nbsp;registrazione non manipolabile che concatenata a tutte le altre registrazioni crea un'unica transazione e una catena di valore, che oltre al valore della fiducia passa anche attraverso al valore economico. Uno su tutti il tracciamento dei prodotti di scarto&nbsp;&nbsp;che nell’edilizia costituisce un problema&nbsp; sia economico che ambientale. Una gestione tramite blockchain&nbsp;Bloki&nbsp;, lungo tutto il ciclo di vita, creerebbe un registro dei residui che potrebbero essere riutilizzati. Efficienza questa gemellata dalla responsabilità della persona impiegata all'uso dei materiali.<br><br> 
  
 <br>VENDITA 
 Infine se la fiducia intesa come valore viene collegata al concetto di catena – tale da creare una cosiddetta catena della fiducia – si ottiene quella realtà (e quindi non più aspettativa) – sempre sotto il controllo delle parti che concorrono a una transazione – che prende il nome di catena del valore.<br><br> 
<p>CONCLUSIONE</p>
<p>Le caratteristiche tecniche e funzionali delle Blockchain si calano positivamente nel settore delle costruzioni e delle manutenzioni degli immobili e delle opere immobiliari.</p>
<p>I Processi di progettazione, autorizzativi, realizzativi, di collaudo, di agibilità ecc possono essere certificati&nbsp; in modo aggregato&nbsp; e condivisi secondo le diverse competenze (Società imprese, progettisti, uffici, collaudatori) in maniera brillante dalla Blockchain e dagli Smarct Contract di Bloki.</p>
<p>Dal momento in cui l’opera è ‘pensata’ al momento in cui comincia a essere utilizzata e anche successivamente durante la vita utile (manutenzioni correttive e preventive),&nbsp; la Blockchain Bloki è in grado di certificare dati, informazioni e processi in modalità sicura, marcata temporalmente, semplice e accessibile.<br><br></p>
<p>I. A. E.</p>
<p>INTELLIGENZA ARTIFICIALE EDILE</p>
  
 
  
 
<p><br>VANTAGGI</p>
 
 I vantaggi di&nbsp;Bloki&nbsp;per chi progetta e costruisce, per&nbsp; gli uffici competenti e per i proprietari e locatari sono notevoli: 
 • Risparmio dei costi<br>• Migliore qualità delle opere<br>• Ottimizzazione delle informazioni e dei processi<br>• Verificabilità e tracciabilità<br>• Supporto alla Responsabilizzazione, alla Compliance e al Tracciamento delle vicende giuridiche, finanziarie e urbanistiche degli immobili, in particolare di quelli interessati da vicende giudiziarie.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is exploring a digital euro. Early October 2020, the ECB Governing Council released a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/Report_on_a_digital_euro~4d7268b458.en.pdf" title="whitepaper">whitepaper</a> discussing its initial research on such a project. One of the ECB’s clearest and most repeated messages is that a digital euro will not replace cash, but complement it. A digital euro is meant to facilitate electronic payments, while cash would remain a valid form of payment and the primary form of value storage.</p>
 The European Central Bank’s Exploration of a Digital Euro 
<p>This exploratory paper comes as a direct result of a digitalized economy whose momentum is ever growing because of new technologies, <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb80303/psd2-new-business-opportunities-and-risks/" title="legislation">legislation</a> meant to increase the competitiveness of digital competitors, and traction that digital currency projects are gaining around the world. Despite the changing world, and the changing needs and expectations of individuals, businesses, and other economic actors, a digital euro is not meant to upend the current monetary system. The paper is a painstakingly methodical exploration of how-to architect, legislate, and standardize a digital euro to maintain financial stability and preserve the ECB’s capacity to influence monetary policy.</p>
<p>The paper itself is a proactive effort from the ECB, dedicating time and resources towards determining the opportunities, risks, and costs of adopting a digital euro. This is also apparent in the scenarios that would motivate the ECB to pursue a digital euro project, the majority of them being a proactive step to maintaining competitiveness, improving efficiencies, and increase the stability of the monetary system.</p>
<p></p>




<p>Scenario</p>


<p>Proactive</p>


<p>Reactive</p>




<p>A digital euro would foster the digitalization of the European economy</p>


<p>x</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Decline of cash payments</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>x</p>




<p>A different form of money – digital currencies issued by other central banks, decentralized organizations, or private companies – becomes a credible alternative to the euro</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>x</p>




<p>A digital euro would be necessary or beneficial to strengthen European monetary policy</p>


<p>x</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>If a digital euro would mitigate the negative effects that a cyber incident, natural disaster, or other extreme event would have on payment services</p>


<p>x</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Adopting a digital euro causes the euro to gain international relevance</p>


<p>x</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Adopting a digital euro improves overall costs and ecological footprint of monetary and payment systems</p>


<p>x</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a charitable view of the ECB, whose digital euro project is still in the proof-of-concept stage with the decision whether to formally launch it being made earliest in mid-2021. This means that in the time it will take to methodically prepare a digital euro project – as it should, this is not a project to leap into lightly – the ECB may fall into a reactive position, as cash payments continue to decline and other currency options become more prominent and potentially challenge the euro.</p>
 The New Way to Exchange Value 
<p>The ECB whitepaper explores the possible architectures that a digital euro could be built on, letting the decision be shaped by solution requirements such as privacy, user access to the digital currency, or protecting its use for payments rather than investment. The architecture question will be the focus of the ECB’s future research, though we can predict that it will likely follow a centralized infrastructure with access facilitated by supervised intermediary banks. Decentralized architectures are part of the conversation, but options such as distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are relatively untested to the scale that the ECB would require and pose higher risks to the stability and security of the Eurosystem. The overall risk-adverse tone of the report and self-determined requirements that the back-end infrastructure of any digital euro project should be controlled by the central bank indicates a preference for known and/or centralized solutions, though many of the active central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects around the world are working with DLTs.</p>
<p>The interest the ECB is showing for alternative payment methods indicates two things: that the ECB has a desire to be a leader in shaping the future of payments, and that their decision whether or not to pursue a digital euro will have a strong influence on the emerging use cases for the digital exchange of value between parties. This is not simply a digital payment, but the digital exchange of a request accompanied by trusted identity, resulting in the receipt of value. For example, the user of a carsharing service unlocks the car door with a one-time key issued to their mobile app. Or a hotel booking automatically issues room keys and admission to the building upon payment. Or the owner of an electric vehicle agrees to sell back reserve power to the grid. These are use cases where a digital transaction does not end with the successful transfer of money, but where payment is the trigger for the exchange of value, making the transaction a two-way process.</p>
 Decentralized: How and Why? 
<p>The next months will be an interesting time of research and inquiry: Which of the global CBDC projects will succeed, and will it become the standard architecture of digital currencies? Will CBDCs be able to fulfill the future of two-way digital transactions to exchange value? Or is it only possible if they operate on a decentralized architecture? And how will the ECB’s goal of preserving the intermediary roles of banks in monetary system interplay decentralized payment systems, whose major outcome is to disintermediate?</p>
<p>We believe the future of payments and the exchange of value will be use-case driven. Grassroots solutions will emerge for particular use cases like carsharing to fill the time until major institutions develop their proposals and standards. There will be stiff competition to establish the platforms, architectures, and methods that gather a critical mass. And we will continually be surprised at the new use cases for the digital exchange of value.</p>
<p>Stay up to date on CBDC and the future of value exchange with our research, and join the conversation at our events.</p>

				 <p>Dans une dynamique de réussite, Unikname s’engage à fournir l’ensemble des éléments nécessaires à la présentation de la solution. Il s’agit d’un kit partenaire, un pack clé-en-main composé de supports marketing, commerciaux et de la documentation technique accessibles depuis le dashboard Unikname.</p>

				  L’engagement du Partenaire Alliance  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>La mission du Partenaire est de prendre en charge l’intégration – la formation – le support et le maintien de la solution Unikname Connect chez son client. Et oui, rejoindre le Programme Alliance c’est devenir Partenaire Intégrateur Certifié Unikname. Vous êtes donc autonome dans la gestion du projet de A à Z !</p>
<p>Identique au Programme Open, vous devez au préalable être &nbsp;utilisateur de la solution Unikname, et l’utiliser sur vos propres environnements. Vous êtes libre de prendre l’abonnement qui vous convient le mieux, même si nous vous recommandons de souscrire au Pack Agency, qui vous permet de <a href="https://www.unikname.com/agences-web-securite-compte-administrateur/">gérer les sites ou applicatons web de vos clients</a>. À vous de voir !</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>L’une des caractéristiques de ce partenariat est que vous contribuez à <a href="https://help.unikname.com/5-security/securing-the-uns-network.html">la sécurisation du réseau UNS Network </a>! Pour rappel, la solution d’authentification Unikname repose sur la technologie de la blockchain UNS Network, maintenue aujourd’hui par 23 délégués.&nbsp;Contribuer à la sécurité de ce système consiste finalement à mettre à disposition une partie de l’un de vos serveurs au réseau. Pour en savoir plus sur vos implications, contactez nos équipes à <a href="mailto:emarketing@unikname.com">emarketing@unikname.com</a></p>
<p>C’est aussi une bonne manière d’intégrer la communauté active des utilisateurs de la solution et de participer à l’évolution du produit.</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Absorbez votre abonnement Unikname dès la première vente !  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Vendre des abonnements Unikname c’est bien, mais vous pouvez aller encore plus loin et gonfler vos revenus aisément. Quelques exemples de services sur lesquels vous pouvez facturer votre client final :</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Intégration et Maintenance  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Partons du principe que dans le deal convenu entre vous et votre client soit compris la maintenance du site web. Saisissez cette opportunité en proposant à votre client un complément de service : la gestion et la maintenance de la solution Unikname.</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Formation des équipes  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Autre contexte, imaginons que vous travaillez sur un projet interne à une organisation au travers duquel de nombreuses personnes vont être amenées à utiliser un identifiant Unikname. Vous pouvez dans ce cas, organiser une session de formation auprès des futures équipes utilisatrices ! Même si la solution est simple à prendre en main, présenter l’intérêt de la solution Unikname Connect et accompagner les utilisateurs dans cette transition est parfois utile. Alors n’hésitez pas !</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Design de la page de connexion  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Voici un autre exemple pour gagner de l’argent facilement ! Vous êtes une agence web avec des compétences graphiques et votre client souhaite installer Unikname sur son interface web ou sa boutique en ligne. Proposez dans ce cas là, la personnalisation graphique de l’espace de connexion aux couleurs de l’entreprise. Vous avez également le possibilité d’animer cette page au gré des saisons, comme Unikname tente de le faire sur sa propre interface de connexion.</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Développement de vos propres extensions  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Vous êtes un éditeur de logiciel ou une agence web évoluant sur des environnements techniques différents en fonction des besoins de vos clients. Dans le cadre d’une demande client ou de votre propre intérêt, vous pouvez développer l’extention qui permet d’implémenter Unikname sur un environnement sur lequel la solution n’est pas encore disponible ! L’occasion d’en tirer exclusivement des revenus et d’élargir le périmètre d’utilisation de la solution.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Microsoft announced on April 5, 2020 that its Azure AD Verifiable Credentials is now in public preview. This solution enables organizations to design and issue verifiable credentials to their users, be it enterprises issuing employment credentials to their employees, universities enrolling students or issuing diplomas, governments issuing passports, ID cards, and countless other uses. This is an exciting step to meaningfully give agency back to individuals to securely hold and exchange their identity data online and in the physical world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" title="Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> are a critical technological component to Microsoft’s solution. While there are many DID protocols, the viability of such an ambitious decentralized identity project required a scalable, independent and decentralized network. ION is the result. ION is an open source, public, and permissionless network that underpins Microsoft’s decentralized identity projects. ION is a <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80301/demystifying-the-blockchain-what-makes-a-blockchain-useful-to-a-firm/" title="sidetree">sidetree</a> on Bitcoin mainnet, enabling anyone to generate and anchor DIDs in the public preview of Azure AD Verifiable Credentials. ION was designed by Microsoft team members in collaboration with members of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and from Transmute, SecureKey, Mattr, Consensys, and others.</p>
 From Concept to Adoption 
<p>The concept to use decentralized solutions for issuing, holding, and exchanging identity data has been viable for about 5 years now. We have seen proof of concepts, short term projects, pitches, and customers beginning to adopt working decentralized identity solutions. These have mostly been user-facing, targeting the general public with self-sovereign wallets to hold credentials, onboard their own credentials, and exchange in peer-to-peer networks. These products functioned, but stagnated without the ability to use these credentials to access many different types of services. But in the last year, momentum has picked up for solutions designed for enterprise usage to address IAM needs. And these products, Microsoft's own included, have matured to the point that widespread adoption just might be on the horizon.</p>
<p>There were many roadblocks that prevented mass adoption, and we are interested to see if Azure AD's Verifiable Credentials will dismantle them.</p>
 
 Integrations with directory services and authentication sources must be part of a solution. These are integral parts to an enterprise's IAM architecture, and even if an identity credential is held by an individual, it must be able to interoperate with the system. 
 Easy adoption in widely used systems: decentralized identity started out as a solution to be adopted based on moral principle. To reach mass adoption, it must be chosen by enterprises and organizations of all types not because it is philosophically admirable, <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/bc80050/decentralized-identity/" title="but because it makes sense">but because it makes sense</a>. While the security and privacy benefits for the individual are very clear, it must have connectors to widely used systems across many sectors. 
 Common standards must be used to create compatibility between different systems. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/" title="Verifiable Credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> are both foundational standards that enable decentralized identity solutions to remain independent of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority, and still be sharable in a trustworthy fashion. DIDComm is another emerging standard to watch out for. Read this <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80064/decentralized-identity-blockchain-id-self-sovereign-identity-solutions/" title="Market Compass">Market Compass</a> for more information on the decentralized identity space. 
 Use for employee credential issuance as well as consumer: CIAM evolved out of IAM. If enterprises begin using decentralized identity solutions for their employees and partners, there will likely be a natural overflow to CIAM if those solutions are successful. Issuing credentials for an enterprise's own use within its own ecosystem is also a less overwhelming scenario (although issuing credentials to consumers may end up being a very similar process with decentralized solutions). Additionally, employee mobility and completing remote onboarding of new employees are very compelling use cases that can lower risk and expense for enterprises. 
 The link to <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80521/providers-of-verified-identity/" title="identity verification">identity verification</a> is essential for mass adoption. The only way an enterprise can trust a credential that is issued by an unknown issuer, which the user holds on their own device, is if there is an additional verification. On top of the cryptographic verifications that accompany decentralized identity solutions, incorporating identity verification into decentralized identity solutions is a powerful way to verify in real time that the holder of a credential is indeed the one being described in the credential. 
 
 Is Mass Adoption Possible Now<a></a>? 
<p>The chances are better now than they have ever been. It's been a long journey since blockchain first became a buzzword, but it has evolved and matured into an entirely different beast, one where blockchain is still present but does not feature proximately.</p>
<p>Enterprises are also not alone when first dipping their toes into the decentralized identity space. The appeal of using a decentralized identity solution that is already compatible with existing infrastructure – Azure AD and Microsoft Authenticator, for example – is not insignificant. Microsoft is putting together a partner ecosystem of identity verification providers that give global functionality. And the list of customer references shows viability in education, health, and government sectors around the world.</p>
<p>The chances for mass adoption are higher because the use cases are more relevant, the solutions more mature, and the foundational pieces – such as identity verification – are being established. 2021 will be a decisive year for decentralized identity, perhaps for the better.</p>

<p>The last four months have gone by in a flash and the token migration that began on the 8th of December 2020 is now complete. As can be seen on <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xe5dada80aa6477e85d09747f2842f7993d0df71c?a=0x0cf75f808479c9e7d61c78f65e997b605160b0aa">Etherscan</a>, almost 963 million ERC20 tokens have been sent to the vault address. As per our <a href="https://www.dock.io/token?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=dock-token-migration-is-now-complete">token release schedule</a>, 150M of these tokens will be released as emission rewards for validators on the Dock mainnet, and to fund the treasury, during the life of the network. This will put the circulating supply of Dock’s mainnet token at <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/explorer">circa 850M</a>. </p><p>In summary, a total of 962.8M tokens (of the 1B total supply) have been migrated which equates to 96.28% of all tokens. </p><p>Exchanges were heavily involved at different stages of the migration. &nbsp;At the time of writing Dock mainnet token trading is facilitated on:</p>  Binance  Gate  Huobi  Kucoin  HotBit  <p>Now what?</p><p>With the significant milestone of the migration now complete, the network and the entire Dock ecosystem can start to benefit from the tokens utility, and of course the significantly reduced and stable fees afforded by the Dock blockchain. As a point of interest, transfers on Dock start at 2.07 tokens, increasing for larger amounts. </p><p>As a reminder, Dock’s mainnet token plays a key role in the network, it provides:</p>  An integrated payment mechanism for performing network operations including: the creation of decentralized identities (DIDs), issuing credentials, creating schemas and more.  Emission rewards for validators who provide their resources to the network by producing blocks and confirming transactions.  Decentralized governance, as detailed in our earlier <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-future-in-decentralized-governance/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=dock-token-migration-is-now-complete">post on governance</a>, DOCK will be utilized to manage changes to the network. How the mainnet is run and by whom will be decided on by voting, and Dock tokens will be the mechanism by which members of the network will vote. This functionality will become more apparent as Dock moves to Proof of Stake later this quarter.  <p>Wallets and explorers</p><p>Moving to Dock’s own blockchain has of course required the community to switch to using new wallets. The current solutions are available <a href="https://docs.dock.io/help-center/help-center/wallets-and-account-creation">here</a> as are instructions on how to set each wallet up. The Dock team have also raised a pull request with hardware wallet <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger</a> and have spoken with their integrations team. As soon as the request has been reviewed and merged, the Ledger Nano S will support DOCK. It is worth noting that discussions with their integration team have revealed that due to a high workload it could be a few months before they support DOCK. </p><p>Another change for the community has been the switch to the Polkadot-based <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/explorer">explorer</a>. While functional, it is recognised that this doesn’t have all the features that some community members would like to see. We’re happy to confirm that the mainnet will be supported by a new explorer and it is anticipated in the coming weeks that we’ll be making this publicly available.

 Paying 
<p>A year ago, we started <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-and-bitcoin/">integrating</a> Bitcoin into Urbit to be an OS-level primitive for money. Our initial objective: build a payments wallet, equally sovereign and ergonomic. The first public version, releasing this month, will have a broad set of capabilities including ship-to-ship payments, hardware wallet support, and full node integration. We’ll be unveiling this wallet on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/276741426/">April 27th</a>. Do join us.</p>
<p>Things only accelerate from here. Our next objective, to integrate Lightning Network capability, is now an <a href="https://gist.github.com/timlucmiptev/53ef1d290e55ea2fa25d9df681c32695">active bounty</a> and open for applicants. Early on, we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvRVHMbrcY">recognized</a> the congruence and compatibility between the Urbit and Lightning networks. Routing Lightning payments is an obvious business model for Urbit providers, one that can even nucleate new features onto Lightning itself. What we’re ultimately driving at is fully-sovereign Bitcoin usage, with the UX of the Cash App.</p>
 Being Paid 
<blockquote>
<p>And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being paid,—what will compare with it? </p>
<p>Herman Melville</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a good wallet is only half the equation for a holistic P2P commercial experience. Interfaces for selling goods and services is the other half. While we don’t part with our Bitcoin <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/everyones-a-scammer/">easily</a>, two initial markets appear logical and attractive: content and Urbit-native services.</p>
<p>First, digital cottage industry, the “creator economy”, is blossoming. Streaming, podcasting, and writing on platforms like Youtube, Patreon, and Substack has been big business <a href="https://otherlife.co/barbarians-past-the-gate/">lately</a>. What fintech did to “unbundle the banks", we will now do to media monopolies and their centralized distribution platforms. With the introduction of Urbit payments, you can syndicate, distribute, and monetize your media on Urbit. By selling access to a private group containing content, digital creatives can begin doing this today.</p>
<p>Second, Urbit-native <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/providers/">service providers</a> are now operating at scale. Companies offering Urbit hosting, onboarding, Urbit IDs, and software now communicate with their customers directly on the network. A basic set of commercial tools will make their processes more efficient.  Storefront interfaces, paywalls, CRM, and reputation tools will replace the ad-hoc assemblages they currently use.</p>
<p>The Urbit Foundation is soliciting contributors to this project through Urbit Grants. If you’re interested in working on any of these components <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/create">send us a proposal</a>.</p>
 An Ocean 
<p>After honing our commercial tools on these use-cases, we’ll sail into a blue ocean. On the horizon: beautiful products, deployable at scale, built with the robust primitives of Urbit OS. Extensibility is Urbit’s promise to middle-men: every Web2.0 service they use to scalp us will find its P2P analog on Urbit. We invite developers and entrepreneurs of all stripes to join in the feeding frenzy. Ideas are constantly nucleating in <a>Urbitcoiners</a> and <a>Urbit Community</a>.</p>

  <p>Hi everyone and welcome to chapter 14 of 2020! It’s been a little while since we talked about standards for passwordless so we’re excited to tell you about some new enhancements and features in FIDO2 land that you'll start seeing in the wild in the next few months!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
 Specification Status 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) Level 2</a> specification is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Process-20200915/#RecsCR">Candidate Recommendation</a> at the W3C. "Level 2" essentially means major version number 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The version 2.1 of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20201208/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20201208.html">Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)</a> specification is a Release Draft at the FIDO Alliance. This means the spec is in a public review period before final publication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new draft versions are on their way to becoming the next wave of FIDO functionality (as of the writing of this blog, we support Level 1 of WebAuthn and CTAP version 2.0). We think you might want to hear about what we think is especially fun about WebAuthn L2 and CTAP 2.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enterprise Attestation (EA) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enterprise Attestation is a new feature coming as part of WebAuthn L2 and CTAP 2.1 that enables binding of an authenticator to an account using a persistent identifier, similar to a smart card today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO privacy standards require that "a FIDO device does not have a global identifier within a particular website" and "a FIDO device must not have a global identifier visible across websites". EA is designed to be used exclusively in enterprise-like environments where a trust relationship exists between devices and/or browsers and the relying party via management and/or policy. If EA is requested by a Relying Partying (RP) and the OS/browser is operating outside an enterprise context (personal browser profile, unmanaged device, etc), the browser is expected to prompt the user for consent and provide a clear warning about the potential for tracking via the persistent identifier being shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authenticators can be configured to support Vendor-facilitated and/or Platform-managed Enterprise Attestation. Vendor-facilitated EA involves an authenticator vendor hardcoding a list of Relying Party IDs (RP IDs) into the authenticator firmware as part of manufacturing. This list is immutable (aka non-updateable). An enterprise attestation is only provided to RPs in that list. Platform-managed EA involves an RP ID list delivered via enterprise policy (ex: managed browser policy, mobile application management (MAM), mobile device management (MDM) and is enforced by the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spec reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20201208/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20201208.html#sctn-feature-descriptions-enterp-attstn">CTAP 2.1 - Section 7.1: Enterprise Attestation</a><br><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#enum-attestation-convey">WebAuthn L2 - Section 5.4.7: Attestation Conveyance Preference</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Authenticator Credential Management and Bio Enrollment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credential Management is part of CTAP 2.1 and allows management of discoverable credentials (aka resident keys) on an authenticator. Management can occur via a browser, an OS settings panel, an app or a CLI tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of how the Credential Management capability is baked into Chrome 88 on macOS (chrome://settings/securityKeys). Here I can manage my PIN, view discoverable credentials, add and remove fingerprints (assuming the authenticator has a fingerprint reader!) and factory reset my authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking on "Sign-in data" shows the discoverable credentials on the authenticator and allows me to remove them. This security key has an Azure AD account and an identity for use with <a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/">SSH</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bio Enrollment allows the browser, client, or OS to aid in configuring biometrics on authenticators that support them. This security key has one finger enrolled. I can either remove the existing finger or add more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of authenticator credential management via a CLI tool, <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/">ykman</a> from Yubico.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Set Minimum PIN Length and Force Change PIN 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CTAP 2.1 allows an enterprise to require a minimum PIN length on the authenticator. If the existing PIN does not meet the requirements, a change PIN flow can be initiated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An authenticator can also be configured with a one-time use PIN that must be changed on first use. This is an additional layer of protection when an authenticator is pre-provisioned by an administrator and then needs to be sent to an end user. The temporary PIN can be communicated to the end user out of band. We see this being used in conjunction with Enterprise Attestation to create a strong relationship between an authenticator and a user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Always Require User Verification (AlwaysUV) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AlwaysUV is part of CTAP 2.1 and allows the user to configure their authenticator to always prompt for user verification (PIN, biometric, etc), even when the Relying Party does not ask for it. This adds an extra layer of protection by ensuring all credentials on the authenticator require the same verification method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spec reference:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Virtual Authenticator DevTool 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one is not tied to updates of either specification but we love it and wanted to share! Chrome and Edge (version 87+) now include a virtual authenticator as part of DevTools. It started as a Chromium extension back in 2019 and is now native! Oh, and the <a href="https://github.com/google/virtual-authenticators-tab">code is on Github</a>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a great tool for testing, debugging and learning! Try it with one of the awesome WebAuthn test sites: <a href="https://webauthnsample.azurewebsites.net/">Microsoft WebAuthn Sample App</a>, <a href="https://webauthn.io/">WebAuthn.io</a>, <a href="https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn-technical/registration">Yubico WebAuthn Demo</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access the tool, open Developer Tools ( <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts">F12 or Option + Command</a><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts">+ I</a> ), click the Menu icon on the top right (…) then More tools and WebAuthn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling the virtual authenticator environment will allow you to create a new authenticator by picking a protocol (CTAP2 or U2F), transport (USB, Bluetooth, NFC or internal), resident key (discoverable) and user verification support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As new credentials are created, you’ll see them listed and the sign count will increase as the credential is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to know more? Here’s an amazing blog by <a href="https://twitter.com/nsatragno">Nina Satragno</a> from the Chrome team over at Google who created this amazing DevTool!</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/webauthn-tab">How we built the Chrome DevTools WebAuthn tab</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Wrap Up 
<p>That rounds out the major features we believe will have the most impact. Here’s a few other enhancements and features that are important to mention!</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-iframe-guidance">cross-origin iFrame usage</a> 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-apple-anonymous-attestation">Apple’s anonymous platform attestation format</a> 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-large-blob-extension">Large blob storage extension</a> to support storing a small chunk of encrypted data with a credential to support use cases like SSH certificates 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’d like to hear more about any of these enhancements/features (or anything else identity related, let's be honest), leave us a note in the comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have suddenly become rather popular. I don’t exactly know why now is their time — maybe it’s because <a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/nft-celebrity-non-fungible-tokens-crypto-grimes-paris-hilton/">celebrities are beginning to sell them</a>, or maybe it’s because recent price increases of BTC and ETH have given hodlers a lot of new money to play with. Whatever the cause, the world is taking notice. And not just the crypto world — traditional auction house Christie’s recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/most-expensive-nft-ever-sold-auctions-for-over-60-million.html">sold an NFT for $69 million USD</a>.</p> What is an NFT? <p>If you don’t know what an NFT is, it’s a record that tracks ownership of some special digital object, from its creation to its current owner. This record lives on a blockchain or other distributed ledger. The object, on the other hand, lives somewhere else, usually a traditional web server or decentralised file storage system. It might be a piece of digital art, an <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">algorithmically generated cat</a>, an item of <a href="https://market.decentraland.org/">digital clothing</a> for your favourite virtual world, or (my favourite, on account of its subtle-yet-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania">undeniable</a> comment on the nature of crypto-trading) a tulip. That can <a href="https://ethertulips.com/">fight other tulips</a>.</p><p>The important thing to know is that, unlike normal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility">‘fungible’</a> crypto-tokens such as ETH, each NFT represents ownership of something special, unique, one-of-a-kind.</p><p>There’s a funny thing about that one-of-a-kind something. Because it’s a digital object, it can be cheaply copied and shared a zillion times, and there’s not much the owner can do about it.</p><p>But surprisingly, that’s what makes it so valuable.</p> What’s really interesting about an NFT? <p>If you buy a painting from a famous artist, you can do a few things with it. You can stick it in a vault where nobody can damage (or enjoy) it. Or you can put it in your living room to impress all your dinner party guests with. (As long as they’re in your bubble or you’ve all gotten vaccinated already.)</p><p>Or you can put it up in a public place where everyone can enjoy it. Something unexpected is about to happen now: the more people get to see it, the more famous it becomes, which makes it even more valuable. Think about Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa; it’s estimated to be worth <a href="https://www.reference.com/world-view/much-mona-lisa-worth-today-ea19afd66638ea57">$1 billion</a>, and the fact that anybody can print up a copy for their living room hasn’t hurt its value one bit. But the distinction of owning the original — now that’s something special, something that people might be willing to drop a billion on.</p><p>Digital art is even easier to copy than the Mona Lisa. So far this has been seen as a threat; music, film, and software companies have fought hard against piracy. That’s because their business models have centred around restricting who can access the things they produce, then charging for access. At the beginning of the internet age, this suddenly became nearly impossible to enforce.</p><p>What if we could do for digital art what art galleries did for physical art? What if we decoupled ownership from possession in a way that safely ensured that creators could make a respectable living? What if digital art became more valuable the more freely it was copied and enjoyed? And while we’re at it, could digital tech be used to eliminate (or reduce) the middlemen and let more of the revenue reach the people who do the work to inspire, challenge, and delight us?</p><p>According to the website <a href="https://cryptomedia.wtf/">cryptomedia.wtf</a>, this is exactly the sort of opportunity that NFTs hold. Reading this manifesto, I do really wonder if they might just upend the revenue strategy of content producers, allowing them to let go of artificial scarcity and profit from abundance. Could this be an example of a bridge from the extractive economics of the past into a cooperative economics that many of us are hoping for?</p> Why blockchain? <p>In order to do NFTs, we need some sort of registry that records the creation of art pieces, along with subsequent ownership transfers, so people can’t try to sell things they didn’t own. It’d be nice if this registry were publicly auditable — oh, and tamper-resistant, which implies that it shouldn’t be controlled by any particular organisation. And since it’s a piece of software, maybe it could automate ownership transfers and payments too. You can probably see now why blockchain technology is such a good match for NFTs.</p> Could we do NFTs on Holochain? <p>Yup!</p> How? <p>We talked to a couple of Holochain’s core devs about this, and while they came up with different designs, they all agreed that it wouldn’t be hard to do. You only need one simple rule, a ‘pass-the-ball’ rule, where you only get to pass the NFT to someone else if someone passed it to you (or you created it in the first place). They described this rule as ‘transitive’ — as long as it’s applied to every ball-passing event, it’s guaranteed to be correct all the way back to the object’s creation event.</p><p>Some people think you have to add some additional consensus to manage scarcity of NFTs, but in Holochain, every element on every user’s chain is already guaranteed to be unique, and you don’t get scarcer than that. You just need to track the history of who the unique thing has been transferred to.</p><p>I find all this easy to understand, because Holochain is modelled on the idea of person-to-person interactions — and we all understand how those work. Holochain adds some extra magic to prevent cheating. I won’t go into much detail, except to say two things:</p>  Every time you pass the ball, you need to ask a few people to witness the act. But you don’t get to choose who witnesses it, which helps keep you honest.  If someone passes the ball to you, you’re probably going to want to make sure they aren’t cheating. So this NFT app should let you check with a few prior witnesses to make sure the ball wasn’t secretly passed to someone else already.   Why Holochain instead of blockchain? <p>Plenty of reasons:</p>  Cost. Because Holochain apps are so resource-efficient, there’s no need to charge a transaction fee.  Ethics. A lot of smart people have already investigated <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6">blockchain’s</a> <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(19)30255-7">ecological</a> <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/">impact</a>, claiming that we can’t really afford to be adopting this kind of technology right now. A Holochain NFT app, by contrast, would be light enough to run on the basic devices its users already own.  Developer efficiency. Blockchain NFTs require a couple different stacks for payment, ownership, storage, and UI. With Holochain, those functions could all be integrated into one stack.  User experience. Not only are crypto wallets really confusing for the average user, but the disconnect between components has caused <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdj79/peoples-expensive-nfts-keep-vanishing-this-is-why">real losses for NFT art collectors</a>. I don’t think I need to explain why this is a serious problem. Better component integration means a safer — and nicer — experience for everyone.  Scalability. Holochain apps don’t use global consensus and they run on user devices. That means they <a href="https://qz.com/1145833/cryptokitties-is-causing-ethereum-network-congestion/">scale with the number of people</a> using them.  Accountability. People have already been selling things they don’t control the rights to. An NFT app on Holochain could leverage some of the <a href="https://hackmd.io/Y4QSGqn6T_amCvHv6T9f6A">identity tools we're building</a>.  <p>Put together, all of these things could mean greater adoption for NFTs — as well as massive new opportunities unlocked by the efficiency, cheapness, and versatility of a future Holochain-based NFT platform.</p>

 Build a PoC with Affinidi in 1 Evening — Driving License as a Verifiable Credential <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/protecting-your-drivers-license-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-25d22aeac05b">This article</a> explains the importance of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for Driving License while <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">this article</a> gives you an insight into what Verifiable Credentials are, in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>As a continuation of the above articles, we’re now moving to the next step, which is the actual implementation. This article explains how you can build a Proof of Concept VC based application in one evening ⏰&nbsp;😱</p> STEP 1: <p>As a first step, get a react project template of your choice. Check out <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started">https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started</a> to get the react boilerplate in one command. Create three repos, one each for the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-issuer">issuer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-holder">holder</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-verifier">verifier</a> apps. (You can also use any other tech stack of your interest though in this article, we use&nbsp;react).</p> STEP 2: <p>Moving on, get the API access key and API key hash to access the Affinidi APIs from <a href="https://apikey.affinidi.com/?source=vcms-api-sandbox">https://apikey.affinidi.com/?source=vcms-api-sandbox</a> and add in&nbsp;.env file in your react&nbsp;app.</p> // .env file<br>REACT_APP_API_KEY=<br>REACT_APP_API_KEY_HASH=<br>REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=  STEP 3: <p>Now, the user(Issuer/Holder/Verifier) can do the sign up using <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/SignUp">link</a> and login using <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/Login">link</a>. On the issuer side, both the applicant and the issuer can log in, but they get to see different dashboards after they&nbsp;login.</p><p>The applicant logs in and fills the form and submits it to get VC(Verifiable Credential) for their Driving&nbsp;License.</p><p>When the issuer logs in, the list of all applied forms will be shown, and the issuer now checks the applications and issues a VC for the same. Issuing the VC involves two APIs: <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/BuildUnsigned">creating an unsigned VC</a> and <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/SignCredential">signing the credential</a>.</p> STEP 4: <p>Once the VC is signed, it can be saved to the issuer’s wallet using this <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/StoreCredentials">API</a> and shared using the credential share <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/ShareCredential">API</a> that creates a shareable link with expiry date and QR code(it contains the shareable link URL). This link can be sent to the applicant via email or as a QR code to the applicant.</p> STEP 5: <p>Finally, when the holders/applicants click the link, they are redirected to their respective wallet app and prompted to store or reject the VC. Once the user accepts the request, the VC is stored to their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/StoreCredentials">wallet</a>.</p> STEP 6: <p>The holder is able to see the <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/GetCredentials">list of all VC</a> stored in their&nbsp;wallet</p> STEP 7: <p>Let’s say, the holder wants to rent a car from a Car Rental Company(Verifier). To prove the authenticity of the holder’s VC and to avoid its misuse, the holder shares the VC with the verifier. There are a series of handshakes that happen to safely transfer the VC from the holder to the verifier as&nbsp;follows.</p><p>The car rental company has displayed a <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk/tree/master/sdk/core#initiate-credential-share-request">link</a> with a JWT token generated from the SDK. This JWT token has the list of encoded credentials required for the&nbsp;share.</p> STEP 8: <p>The link in the above image redirects to the wallet application with Token Request in the query parameter. The holder accepts the request to share the VC to the car rental&nbsp;company.</p> STEP 9: <p>One or more VCs are combined to form a Verifiable Presentation. Also, the VCs present inside the Verifiable Presentation are not the actual VCs, and are intended to avoid misusing the VC. At the same time, it also has the necessary information to prove the authenticity of VC as it has a Response Token(JWT token with Verifiable Presentation encoded in it). This is generated by the holder like this <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-holder/blob/master/src/containers/CredentialShareModal.js#L29">code sample</a> and shared to the verifier through the encrypted <a href="https://affinidi-messages.dev.affinity-project.org/api-docs/#/Message/SendMessage">messaging service</a>, similar to this <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-holder/blob/master/src/containers/CredentialShareModal.js#L33">code&nbsp;sample</a>.</p> STEP 10: <p>When the verifier logs into the account, the list of submitted applications can be seen through the <a href="https://affinidi-messages.dev.affinity-project.org/api-docs/#/Message/PullMyMessages">messaging service</a> like the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-verifier/blob/master/src/containers/MessageListener.tsx#L80">code sample</a> and validates the Verifiable Presentation from the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk/tree/master/sdk/core#validate-holder-response-on-share-request">Response Token</a>, similar to the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-drivinglicense-verifier/blob/master/src/containers/CredentialShareResponse.tsx#L27">code sample</a>. On verification, the request is approved for a car&nbsp;rental.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sridharan-jayabal/">Sridharan Jayabal</a></p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">How to implement driving license use case using Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 On-Demand Employment Endorsements — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials <p>For most of us, our first job is always special as it gives us a glimpse of how the next few decades could be. But tracking the responsibilities and roles in your first and subsequent jobs are not easy and more importantly, getting someone to verify them can be a challenge, especially if you’ve worked in an industry with high attrition rates. Platforms like LinkedIn may state your past background with some degree of social vetting but are certainly not fool-proof!</p><p>Fast forward a few years, and you may end up in a situation where the proof of experience from your first job is needed! Verifiable credentials can be your savior&nbsp;here.</p><p>To get an idea of what these are, feel free to read this <a href="https://medium.com/affinidi/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">101 post on&nbsp;VCs</a>.</p> How Can Verifiable Credentials Get an Employment Endorsement? <p>Let’s say, John has applied for a Post-grad program in digital marketing at the ABC university, but it requires work experience in a related field. John had been a salesman ten years ago and wanted to share this experience with University ABC in the form of a verifiable credential without the need for any additional verification.</p><p>So, how can he do&nbsp;that?</p><p>As with any VC, there are three parties involved here&nbsp;too.</p>  Issuer — Employers, job search sites, payroll providers, and startups like <a href="https://www.goodworker.in/">GoodWorker</a> that empower seasonal workers and employers, one verified credential at a time. It matches employers with a large network of trustworthy and verified profiles of skilled workers, at a fraction of the cost, and allows workers to take control of their job search, with direct access to trustworthy employers.  Holder — John  Verifier — University ABC  <p>As a first step, John logs into the issuer’s portal, and submits his personal details like his name and the month and year of employment. After verifying John’s credentials, the issuer looks through his work records, and sends a verifiable credential in the form of a QR code detailing John’s period of employment and his role as a salesman. In turn, John scans this QR code and stores these details in his digital&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Next, he creates a verifiable presentation with the information that University ABC wants, and shares it with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Here is a sample VC that checks the past employment of John as a salesman.</p><p>{</p><p>‘@type’: [‘Person’, ‘PersonE’, ‘EmploymentPerson’],</p><p>givenName: ‘John’,</p><p>familyName: ‘Jones’,</p><p>birthDate: ‘1984–06–01’,</p><p>gender: ‘male’,</p><p>telephone: ‘’,</p><p>‘@type’: [‘Salary’],</p><p>gross: {</p><p>‘@type’: ‘MonetaryAmount’,</p><p>value: 10000,</p><p>currency: ‘INR’,</p><p>},</p><p>net: {</p><p>‘@type’: ‘MonetaryAmount’,</p><p>value: 8000,</p><p>currency: ‘INR’,</p><p>},</p><p>frequency: ‘Monthly’,</p><p>},</p><p>startDate: ‘2018–06–01T00:00:00.000Z’,</p><p>endDate: ‘2018–12–01T00:00:00.000Z’,</p><p>roleName: ‘Sales&nbsp;Rep’,</p><p>reference: {</p><p>‘@type’: ‘ContactPoint’,</p><p>telephone: ‘380504112171’,</p><p>name: ‘Oleksandr Kravets’,</p><p>image: {</p><p>‘@type’: ‘ImageObject’,</p><p>uploadDate: ‘…’,</p><p>url: ‘https://goodworker.in/private/WORKER_ID/assets/EMPLOYMENT_EXPERIENCE_ID.jpg', // OR base64 encoded&nbsp;image</p><p>},</p><p>},</p><p>skills: [‘Selling software’, ‘Engaging customers’],</p><p>employmentTerms: {// need to add this new&nbsp;type},</p><p>worksFor: {</p><p>‘@type’: [‘Organization’, ‘OrganizationE’],</p><p>name: ‘SRW&nbsp;Tools’,</p><p>location: ‘3, WICEL., MIDC, Andheri East, Mumbai, Maharashtra, 400093,&nbsp;India’,</p><p>industry: ‘Software tool&nbsp;maker’,</p><p>department: {// can be another Organization}</p><p>},</p><p>},</p><p>}</p><p>Finally, the university examines John’s verifiable presentation and learns about his experience as a salesman. This makes him eligible for the post-grad program and coupled with his admission test results, he gets the admit he’d always&nbsp;wanted!</p><p>Sounds simple,&nbsp;right?</p><p>The obvious advantage of VCs is that they are readily available and accessible. Imagine if you have to go to your first company and search through the physical records in a dusty storage room (No, we aren’t talking about Flintstones here!!).</p><p>Since these VCs are immutable and tamper-proof, the verifier could access authentic information that helped its decision-making process. In all, a win-win situation for everyone!</p><p>Overall, VCs are a huge leap forward in the world of ever-changing technology as it is a hassle-free way of sharing personal information securely and quickly with explicit consent of the owner of that information.</p><p>At Affinidi, we’re working to build an ecosystem that would help developers and companies create such interesting VC-based applications.</p><p>To learn more about what we do, drop a line at <a href="mailto:contact@affinidi.com">info@affinidi.com</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">On-Demand Employment Endorsements — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Monthly Roundup for Holo &amp; Holochain — March&nbsp;Edition March Edition <p>Welcome to our monthly roundup — March edition, as always I’m bringing you the scoop of the month. If you have been reading the regular updates we share in Telegram or Twitter, you probably already know that we’ve now got a working Elemental Chat application and that we are hard at work preparing the Holochain and Holo infrastructure so that we can release it to all hosts. We are almost there! The big news this month was Holo being granted a patent for Holochain Distributed App Framework.</p><p>If you’re wondering what exactly we’ve been working on at Holo and Holochain this past month — the wait is over! Let’s jump right&nbsp;in.</p> Press Release: U.S. Patent granted for Holochain Distributed App Framework <p>In a big step forward for the P2P web, Holo Limited was granted a US patent for the rrDHT networking innovations within Holochain. rrDHT is a peer-to-peer networking design implemented in Holochain that describes a system of nodes communicating according to a relaxed, agent-centric distributed hash&nbsp;table.</p><p>Read the full Press Release: <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">U.S. Patent granted for Holochain Distributed App Framework</a></p> How rrDHT Works: A Tech Deep&nbsp;Dive <p>Unpacking the technology behind Holochain’s secure P2P networking. This week we got word that a <a href="https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10951697">patent</a> we submitted to the USPTO was approved.

The most visible changes are in the UI of Elemental Chat, our demo app. Users now have ‘identicons’ beside their name; these auto-generated avatars are based on their actual agent ID in the Holochain network and can’t be forged. This is important because usernames are just labels; you can set yours to anything you like, even someone else’s name. If you’re talking to a friend and suddenly their identicon looks slightly different, there’s a good chance someone is trying to impersonate your&nbsp;friend.</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 93— <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/elemental-chat-gets-freshened-up/">Elemental Chat Gets Freshened Up</a></p> Decentralized Next-level Collaboration Apps with&nbsp;Syn <p>My passion for Holochain has always been sourced in upgrading our collective intelligence, which means making it easier and more joyful to collaborate together.

We are actually ahead of where we expected to be in some ways. While it is taking a while to complete infrastructure testing because that is one of the most complex aspects of our work, we have been able to move many other activities forward.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>I’ve been in IT long enough to remember when business applications were home-grown and written in COBOL. In the early stages of my career, I even gave computer classes on the standard algorithms for good COBOL programming, such as sorting and grouping.</p>
<p>In the more than three decades since, I’ve seen SAP R/3 being discussed as the revolutionary approach for business applications, moving these from mainframes into client/server models. I’ve seen the emergence of the first SaaS applications, with some such as Salesforce or Ariba still being around. I’ve seen the broader adoption of the cloud for critical business workloads, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud. And, I have also seen GRC (Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance) become mandatory for organizations.</p>
 The hybrid reality of today’s business applications 
<p>For many, if not most organizations, the landscape of business applications has changed over the past year. With the advent of SaaS services, there are typically more vendors for the various business applications than there were a few years ago, and with the shift to the cloud, most organizations have ended up with a hybrid infrastructure. This makes managing such applications and providing GRC solutions for these environments more complex, starting with enforcing consistent identities, access controls, and SoD controls (Segregation of Duties) across these applications.</p>
<p>To further complicate things, other IT services are evolving towards becoming business applications. &nbsp;ITSM (IT Service Management) solutions, for example, are morphing into ESM (Enterprise Service Management) solutions with central platforms for workflows and services that support several lines of business, well beyond IT.</p>
 A challenge of breadth versus depth 
<p>GRC and, within that, access control, are about finding the right balance between breadth and depth. In rather monolithic landscapes of business applications, there is logic in using a highly specialized solution. In hybrid, heterogeneous landscapes, however, there often isn’t a single GRC solution that covers all the business applications and services anymore. Some deliver depth, such as for the traditional SAP ERP solutions, while others provide breadth, starting with standard IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) solutions. There is no simple answer, and for many organizations, there won’t be a single solution.</p>
<p>This challenge is further complicated by organizational and ownership issues. Traditional SAP Access Control runs on SAP and commonly is owned by the SAP team. But how should the organization look in a world of hybrid and heterogeneous business applications? Is there still room for an SAP silo? Who should own what? CIOs, CISOs, and CROs (the Chief Risk Officers) must rethink the way GRC and access control are implemented for today’s ecosystems of business applications. This starts with revising the organizational structure and responsibilities.</p>

 After a massively successful IDO on Polkastarter, the roadmap is laid out and the team is ready and excited to work towards&nbsp;it. <p>We started Shyft Network with the view that one day our ecosystem would require critical infrastructure to ensure its stability. Now, more than three years later, that day has come; as international regulatory guidance begins to take shape, we begin to introduce infrastructure that aims to solve global challenges faced by ecosystem participants.</p><p>The Shyft Network roadmap spans multiple years, but is not limited to our roadmap alone; rather, the future development of Shyft will also be dependent on where our industry goes, and the challenges that present themselves across institutional adoption and regulatory guidance.</p><p>The goal of introducing Shyft Network into the space is to provide a response framework that we, as an ecosystem, can build on and use to provide more options and create new systems that help us better comply with evolving regulations.</p><blockquote>Shyft Network is meant to act as a layer 1 federated side chain, a smart contract tooling infrastructure, and a general purpose protocol that provides adaptability and optionality into&nbsp;systems.</blockquote><p>Shyft Network also has general-purpose use cases that were built alongside its architecture in order to provide solutions to global problems. These use cases define the intent of why we built the Shyft Network. Although these are mission driven use cases, they do not limit the extent to which this infrastructure can be used to build other systems, and as we now deliver this infrastructure to the global ecosystem, we hope to work alongside the community as we all carry it forward into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>We’ve had so much interest from third-party developers, protocols, companies, enterprises, governments and more looking to implement Shyft Network and its aggregation infrastructure. Once the Node Federation takes control of the network, the network company, Shyft Network Inc., will help to provide resources and support to aid new parties entering the&nbsp;project.</p> Stage 1 — Launch <p>The initial deployment of Shyft Network smart-contracts on Ethereum is where this project begins to enter the open world and goes into the hands of users; with it, we initialize our core KYC contracts, and enable proof-of-concept of our flagship use cases. Shortly after, the node federation takes over and Shyft Network’s mainnet is deployed. Stage 1 is the culmination of more than three years of development, planning and execution. We survived crypto-winter and proved to our supporters and community that our project is stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p> What can the Shyft Network community expect?   The SHFT Token ready for use on digital identity, verification and KYC concepts.  VASPs who we partnered with enter a second round and are now integrating into Veriscope, the global exchange and institution-governed solution to the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.  The deployment of community incentivization structures, i.e., yield wrapping, liquidity bootstrapping and DAO enablement.  The creation of the Node Federation as an essential component of Shyft Network’s push towards decentralization   March 24th, 2021: Ethereum &lt;&gt; Shyft Network version 1.0&nbsp;launch   The deployment of the first of the Shyft Network Core KYC contracts; this enables trust anchoring, compliant liquidity pool development, coalition and identity creation, and cross chain bridged asset and identity routing architecture to be possible.  This deployment will focus infrastructure towards the integration of decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, and existing Ethereum dapps for compliant, opt-in primitives.  The importance of this infrastructure is that it creates a fundamental development apparatus and initial base structure so that the Defi ecosystem can begin to build FATF compliant endpoints into existing ecosystem utilities and platforms.   April 2021 — Shyft Network launches the Federated Mainnet (Layer 1 consensus nodes will now carry the protocol&nbsp;forward)   The Shyft Network mainnet is live and the Node Federation takes over the protocol and carries it forward. This is a major milestone in the decentralization of the Shyft&nbsp;Network.  Once the Node Federation takes over the protocol, the Shyft Network team becomes another member of the community, and will work with partners and new applications to aid in providing developer tools and resources to new entrants. It will also launch educational marketing campaigns to increase awareness of the network and its capabilities.  VASPS that have been leading governance on Shyft Network through Veriscope, as well as national identity systems and other institutional use cases, will be able to use the attestation infrastructure on the Shyft Network Virtual Machine (SVM). The globally distributed federation will now be active, and support for Travel Rule complying entities globally will now be live for utilization and deployment. Identity use cases and entity to entity data sharing requirements will initially take place on the Shyft Network Layer 1 until data portability and synthetic asset transmission into corresponding Shyft Network contracts on other chains is complete.  ChainBridge technology, developed in collaboration with Chainsafe, will be deployed between the Shyft Network and Ethereum to support cross asset transmission and minimal cross-smart-contracts operations. This will not link coalitions or data use cases, attestations will not be routable at this stage, only asset transmission.   Stage 2 — Expansion <p>Additional use cases, e.g., our PerseID Government ID project, will be deployed. The Shyft Network team will also start a community and industry wide education and promotion campaign to bring in new partnerships and developers into the ecosystem.</p> What can the Shyft Network community expect?   Staking on the Shyft Network goes&nbsp;live.  More incentives in the form of community DAOs and&nbsp;grants.  Technological improvements on the Shyft Network protocol.  Ecosystem expansion: external use cases and third-party developer use cases begin to deploy and scale the&nbsp;network.  <p>Disclaimer: The plans, dates and other statements contained in this roadmap are an estimation only, are subject to change based on various factors and circumstances, and there are no assurances that they can be fulfilled</p> Q2 2021   Staking on Shyft Network goes live. Additional community token-based metagames &amp; AMM incentivization is released. The goal is to improve token distribution and prepare the network for scalability and resilience. As an enhancement of Veriscope, the federation initiates discussions and prototypes of opt-in compliance products designed for decentralized finance; compliant DeFi will begin to take shape and aim to enter a new era of mass adoption and user empowerment.  LP Reward Program is released on Ethereum, allowing a whitelisted subset of participants to get SHFT token rewards for applying their liquidity to specific SHFT:asset pairs on Ethereum’s AMMs. We will be expanding this program and notifying the community on the construction of additional purely-compliant LP&nbsp;pools.  Another major milestone for Shyft Network is the launch of “Perseid” Government ID Project; the PerseID team has been working with the Government of Bermuda for years and are very proud to deliver technology that aims at improving the life of their citizens. Once launched, the PerseID and Shyft Network teams will look to deploy public grassroots &amp; government-wide marketing campaigns aimed at expanding this particular use&nbsp;case.  Federation improvements &amp; Shyft Runtime Inflation DAO’s: One of Shyft Network’s core pillars is effective decentralization, and will further promote federation-wide technology improvements to integrate with Shyft Community DAOs. Runtime inflation DAO’s are aimed at creating a solid developer base and the incentive structures that will help it flourish.

 <a></a>Introduction: Music and SSI 
<p>Mathieu: Many different people have spoken to me about some of the work that you and the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">Human Colossus Foundation</a> are doing: both within the foundation and also with different community initiatives over the past little while. I have been quite interested in the work you’re doing, and I’m looking forward to just going a little deeper into this with you today. Thanks for doing this.</p>
<p>When I started looking into your background and how you got into what you’re doing now, it seems that early on in your career, you had a passion with a lot of interest and activity in the music industry. </p>
<p>Paul: Yes, I’ve always had a bit of a dual career in music and the pharmaceutical industry. Like a lot of people in the music industry, sometimes you need a second job to keep your passion going. My crux was the pharmaceutical industry, but yes, the music industry. We’ll take it back a step: my degree at university was in I.T. Right after university, I did an audio engineering degree in London and learned how to work with the big mixing desks in recording studios. From there, I started working for a couple of recording studios, getting to understand the trade as an audio engineer. I fell into private events through my music industry career. I ended up doing showcases at the Gibson showroom for international artists travelling into the U.K. Gibson Guitars had some showrooms in London, so whenever anyone decent was coming through, I’d put on a showcase for the U.K. music industry, which would usually kick off their U.K. tour.</p>
<p>One of the artists that came through was an Indian artist called Raghu Dixit, who was actually the highest selling independent artist in India (outside of Bollywood). I put on one of these showcases for him, and through that, I ended up co-managing him for a while. That kept me busy. I got to fly around the world a little bit with him, but it was that journey that started getting me into the data space at the same time. I created a platform called the International Music Community, where the idea was to introduce up-and-coming artists to music industry professionals, but using data to build those algorithms. For an artist, we’d get all their social media traffic, put that into an algorithm, and then hook them up with industry professionals who had worked with artists of a similar level. It was an interesting space. We ended up white-labelling that platform and a lot of the music industry conferences really liked it. As you can imagine, you’ve got the president of Warner Brothers or something on a panel at a conference, and they don’t want to be bombarded with contacts from baby artists. Through this tiering thing that we’d built within the platform, I was able to protect the identity of the music professionals at the high end. But at the same time, they could look down into the filter to find the up-and-coming artists that they were looking for. So that got me into the data space in music. At the same time, I’d always had this parallel career in the pharmaceutical industry in data management and statistical analysis. That was paying the bills as I was doing all of the music stuff.</p>
<p>I suppose that’s how I became so interested in semantics. That’s how it all started; my journey into SSI was through that algorithm development within the music platform. I wanted a way of authenticating when an industry professional said that they worked with Rod Stewart or something like that. I wanted some way of authenticating that information, and that’s how I got into SSI, decentralized authentication, and key management, etcetera.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s super interesting! As you were explaining your marketplace solution of connecting up-and-coming artists or musicians with labels and so forth, right away, my head went to credentials, and showing proofs, and just doing matchmaking. With the way the platform had been built, but before self-sovereign identity, you could see the next evolution of the platform growing into its own ecosystem solution, potentially using verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Paul: Exactly. The platform was an incredibly federated platform when I built it because I didn’t know that SSI existed. So as soon as I found that ecosystem, I tore up the rulebook and said, “This isn’t going to work; I have to rebuild it.”</p>
 <a></a>SSI and Pharma 
<p>Mathieu: At the same time, you were definitely solving significant problems with the way it was built, and I’m sure it still does. Now that this type of thing is possible, we could explore all these new business opportunities with this. At least, that’s what gets me excited every day, when I get up and look at the self-sovereign identity stuff.</p>
<p>Working in pharma, it seems like big data is just crucial to that field. Big data and identity management are at the core. Is that what got you thinking more about the data structures? In pharma, I need to have very solid data inputs. But, if I want to be able to share results and across multiple parties, especially for clinical testing, that got you thinking about the structure of data a lot more, am I right?</p>
<p>Paul: Yes, absolutely. One of the first jobs I had in the pharmaceutical industry was actually data entry. They had these clinical report forms which were all handwritten, and I’d have to enter that into the system. In those days it was very dodgy: you’d have all sorts of doctor’s notes and comments, and you’re entering all of that, which is obviously full of P.I. information and dangerous data. It wasn’t nearly as strict as it is now, but yes, it did get me thinking about semantics very early. Obviously, for all those free form text fields; bringing in predefined entries and putting some structure around data is necessary, so that it becomes useful for machine-reading and analytics. One of the pain points with clinical data capture is that when you work on two sister trials and you’re trying to aggregate that data together at the end of the process, it was always little things that would break that pooling process. For example, maybe the same attribute had different formatting in each study, or the length of the attribute was different in each study — when you aggregated it, the data would truncate. These are pain points that are still going on today in the pharmaceutical industry. That’s where I started delving hard into semantics, and trying to find new ways of capturing data: different architectures, all that sort of stuff, to try and get some of those pain points ironed out.</p>
<p>Mathieu: A long time ago, I spent some time working in a clinic. We conducted clinical trials and later, staged trials on patients who would come in for the trials. I did all sorts of different stuff in this clinic, but I was more on the input side. I was managing the operation, the intake of the drug that was being administered, and the blood sampling and the testing. Because I was more on the input side of things, it wasn’t on the data and the analysis side of things. It seems that’s how you’re looking at the inputs and semantics: it’s the two sides of this. How do you describe inputs and semantics to someone?</p>
 <a></a>Semantics and Inputs 
<p>Paul: The easiest way to think about it is: inputs are what is being inputted into a digital system or ecosystem. Semantics are what is providing context and meaning to the information that’s being entered into a system. Those are the two main differences. Another way to look at it, would be data entry versus data capture. When you just say ‘pure data entry,’ that’s the keys that you enter on your keyboard into a system. But really, to bring anything in any context or meaning, it relies on data capture; when you enter something and you need to capture it into a schema structure or something like that. That’s where you have all your formatting and your predefined entries, your human-readable labels, the context, the metadata of the schema, and all that sort of stuff. All of that rich information that brings contextual meaning to the data, that’s been inputted. The data inputs are on one side, the input side. You want to know that the data has come from an authenticable source, whereas on the input side, it’s more about making sure that the context and the semantics around the data — those constructs are immutable. So that way, any actor who is interacting with any of those objects knows that the data capture structures are the same for everybody.</p>
<p>Mathieu: You had a nice illustration diagram of semantics and inputs; you started splitting everything up into both of them. Does this go all the way down?</p>
<p>If you’re looking at the different inputs through credentials, does that push all the way through to attributes? Does that push all the way through to deeper objects?</p>
<p>It definitely seems that in the self-sovereign identity space, and entering with that mindset if these things are needed — you must have realized pretty quickly that for this to actually take off, there’s a lot of this infrastructure that needs to be in place.</p>
<p>Paul: Yes. As soon as you’re talking about <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">a decentralized ecosystem</a>, you are looking at a lot of innovation to enable that whole space to work. One suggestion that I would say to people is that you’ve almost got to treat the entire data economy as one company. Within a company, you would have a data analyst group or something similar, plus perhaps other groups that are more geared towards marketing or whatever. These sorts of differences within an organization work quite well, but as soon as you go into a decentralized space, it’s more challenging. Where do you categorize things in a totally decentralized space, so that you have communication throughout the entire data ecosystem? For that model that you’re talking about, I think the official term for it is “the model of identifier states.” At the Human Colossus Foundation, we call it the rugby ball model because of the shape of it.</p>
<p>I built that model because I thought the decentralized identity folks were overlooking semantics. Obviously, with my data management background, I wanted to get a model for them to understand the importance of semantics. When you talk about decentralized key management solutions, you’re really only looking at half of the puzzle. That puzzle is all about making sure that data comes from an authentic source. Regarding all the immutable semantics and stuff, that’s the other half of the model. I call that the semantics domain. That’s been fun; it took a little while to get down to the nitty-gritty of the dualism between every component within each half of that model. For instance, when you talk about an attribute in a schema on the input side, that’s a claim within a credential. Essentially, the input side is about real data, and the semantic side is about the constructs that were used to put context into those data inputs.</p>
<p>Mathieu: You’re involved in many different communities; we’ve seen each other in the different working groups, and you run your own working group in the Trust over I.P. movement. How does this model fit into the Trust over I.P. stack? There are different types of organizations or people that are playing at different levels in the Trust server I.P. stack. For example, you could have people just playing in Layer One: they’re building public identity utilities. You could have other companies, like the company I represent, that are playing more at the top layers: we’re trying to enable ecosystem solutions to be built. However, just as there is a governance layer across the stack, what you’re bringing here, through inputs and semantics, needs to be taken into consideration across the stack. How does that fit into the whole picture? </p>
<p>Paul: It’s just a different vantage point; it’s still a full ecosystem. With the dual-stack at Trust over I.P., you’re looking at governance versus technology across the four layers that you mentioned, from utility at Layer One, right up to the ecosystems at Layer Four. That gives you a fairly big picture of a data economy, but only from a perspective of governance versus technology. The inputs and semantics group is just a different vantage point — thinking more about what is entered into a system. and the meaning of the data that you’re capturing and stuff like that. It’s still a totally full model, but it’s complementary to the dual-stack. I’d suggest that data entry and data capture is valid for all four layers, and at each layer, it’s really about how you’re capturing that data. It’s not so much about what you’re capturing at the time; it’s thinking a little bit beyond that. For example, with all the vaccine stuff; it’s great if your apps can work for contact tracing and all that sort of stuff. But the way that I think about data is, “Okay, in the pandemic, you have the World Health Organization; how can we make this data useful for their processes and the analytics at their end?” That would enable them to get some real-time analytics to see how the pandemic is responding. I think there’s always a broader context than some developers sometimes think.</p>
 <a></a>Human Colossus Foundation &amp; KERI 
<p>Mathieu: You approached this through the Human Colossus Foundation; what were your steps to forming this? What was your journey of starting this organization, and why have you structured it the way you’ve structured it?</p>
<p>Paul: The foundation started because of Overlays Capture Architecture at the time. The foundation was founded by three of us: myself, Robert Mitwicki, and Philippe Page. The idea of it really kicked off when I met Robert. Robert’s a deep stack developer, but he’s an interesting developer — he’s always got a very broad perspective on the things that he’s building. We hit it off immediately when I showed him the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/cjzegoi58xgpfzwxyrqlroy48dihwz">Overlays Capture Architecture</a> (OCA). Initially, we had built an innovation hub at a proprietary company called Dativa, but we soon realized while we were building our OCA and that environment that it had to be open source. By that time, we’d also started developing a model called the “Master Mouse Model,” which is a conceptual model of what a dynamic data economy would look like. That was all spearheaded through the characteristics of Overlays Capture Architecture. Really, the reason we built the foundation was we knew that OCA was going to be an important part. We knew that what they were doing with SSI, and in Hyperledger Aries and Hyperledger Indy, was an important space for authentic provenance chains. It was about taking these different parts, and trying to have a foundation where we could knit some of these components together without having to disrupt too much of what was going on in those communities. We could do it within our own foundation. Everything we build is totally open source. As soon as we’ve done a proof of concept or we’ve knitted some components together for the benefit of the economy, then we can showcase that, and people can simply pick up those components and integrate them into their own solutions.</p>
<p>Mathieu: For the work that’s being produced by the foundation (like the overlays capture architecture, which was the starting point): is it all very use-case-oriented, or is it more generic frameworks that only need to be customized?</p>
<p>Paul: No, they’re totally generic everything; one of the components we’re developing at the moment is a trusted digital assistant. That would be a deeper component into the stack than a traditional digital wallet. You’re probably aware of KERI; have you come across KERI, the <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a>?</p>
<p>Mathieu: In the seminar you threw, you had Sam Smith, who was involved in this. We were personally quite excited. We’re excited about KERI, but we’re also excited about the network of networks concept, so those fit in nicely together.</p>
<p>Paul: KERI is a very interesting architecture, because, with a data ecosystem, you can really go two different ways. You can have your Root of Trust being a node on the network, whether that’s Sovrin, or Ethereum, or Bitcoin, or whatever that provides a Root of Trust. What KERI promises to enable — and I say ‘promises’, because it’s still being developed as we speak — you could change your Root of Trust because it’s a ledger-less solution. Your Root of Trust could be what we call a trusted digital assistant, which is a component on your mobile phone. The importance of doing it that way, is because you avoid all this potential network lock-in. That is, when some people are building on Hyperledger fabric and others on Ethereum and the like, you could potentially get into these interoperability issues with the way DIDs are, currently. With the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifiers</a>, you have this method space that usually gives you the location of where the identifier is housed. So, if it’s a DID:SOV, that suggests it’s on the Sovrin network. There’s something like 87 different methods, so it’s not great for interoperability.</p>
<p>What KERI allows, is if you have the identifier as a component on your mobile phone, then you can suddenly interact with any network: you’re not locked into those networks. That’s a really interesting technology that we’re going to be delving hard into at the Human Colossus Foundation, for sure.</p>
<p>Mathieu: My perspective on the evolution of the self-sovereign identity stack, is that we’re at a point where there needs to be a lot more intelligence built into agents to create more value.</p>
<p>With your digital assistant utilizing KERI, is that a way to say you’re basically enabling a smarter agent, that fits the real-world business processes?</p>
<p>Paul: Yes, exactly. The advantage of it is that we’re not stopping people from building on any blockchain networks, but at the same time, we’re not reliant on that, as well. If I could describe the ‘trusted digital assistant’ in a short sentence, I’d call it an API plug-in gateway, into a dynamic data economy. Today, a browser is really your way into the internet. The way for individual citizens to get into the decentralized dynamic data economy, is through this component on your mobile device. So, you can think of it as a personal browser, if you like.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes. That truly is being open source. Whether I’m the ‘good health pass’ or if I’m some ecosystem solution, I could choose to incorporate this into my stack. That gives you all of the context and all of the other benefits that you need to have. If I need to worry about privacy, or user experience, this could fuel a lot of these benefits that we talk about every day in SSI.</p>
<p>Paul: Absolutely. I think that there are three main domains that you really need to decentralize: one is obviously the decentralized key management, the second is decentralized semantics, and then the last one is decentralized governance. I think the governance piece is maybe where KERI can help, because you’re not necessarily locked into those networks. I believe that can help a lot to decentralize governance. For instance, if I’m at border control in the U.K., or China, or any of those different countries, you can’t expect them to all be using the same network. By introducing KERI, it gets you out of those potential network lock-in issues. When we say ‘decentralized governance’, I think it sits in that sort of space.</p>
 <a></a>Working Groups within Trust over IP 
<p>Mathieu: You’ve chosen the Trust over I.P. as a good home to conduct certain work with the community. Would you mind describing what’s going on right now within the Trust over I.P., inside the inputs and semantics working group?</p>
<p>Paul: You can think of the inputs and semantics working group as the innovation hub of Trust over I.P. You don’t have to be an identity network, that is, an SS-Identity network. If you’re coming into the space and you have an identity solution of whatever kind, we can look at that within the inputs and semantics group. We would try to knit it together into a proof-of-concept or pilot, without disrupting some of the businesses that are already developing strong <a href="https://northernblock.io/services/ssi-implementation/">SSI solutions</a> within the dual-stack, as it stands. I think there’s a little bit more freedom in the inputs and semantics working group for people to work on brand new solutions.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Is it more new solutions, or do you see a mix? There are so many solutions that exist in the market today. I’m sure you could talk about so many things that go on in pharma, for example. You’re working on helping entrepreneurs or helping new ecosystems, but is it a mix of both that come through there?</p>
<p>Paul: It’s absolutely a mix of both. You’ll get people who want to set up new ecosystems, but maybe they’re sometimes working with some legacy solutions. They want to figure out how to deconstruct what they’ve done to make it more decentralized. All of those issues can come into the inputs and semantics group. At the same time, we’re also looking at new solutions such as semantic containers. Some of the transient portability solutions can also fit into inputs and semantics, and we see how we can work them into moving data around in a safe and secure manner.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s such a cool space. I was looking into it: as you said, there are task forces on storage and portability; there’s privacy, and risk, and notice, and consent.</p>
<p>There are so many things that need to be thought of from the user experience standpoint, or from the business case standpoint: to figure out what to show, what not to show, and how certain functions should work. You’re able to absorb that, and build it into the models.</p>
<p>Paul: Probably one area that needs strengthening up a little bit, is the user experience side of things. There is a human experience working group that is set up at Trust over I.P. It’s not housed in the inputs and semantics group, but it’s a very new group, so I don’t think they’re totally up and running yet. It’ll be interesting to see what comes out of that task force.</p>
<p>Mathieu: For just a simple example of what you mentioned earlier in the pharma segment: the dates can get screwed up in different formats. Being in Canada, that happens very easily if dates are written in English and in French — you write it in one format if it’s in English, and another format if it’s in French, so there’s a mismatch, to begin with. That’s a simple user experience example where, if you want to internationalize a solution, or if you want to make it applicable, it needs to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>I would love to hear more on how you thought about general user experience overall, but it seems like the structure that you’re building and bringing up enables contextualization to happen inside of the actual wallets, and apps and systems that are being used by end-users.</p>
<p>Paul: The semantics part is very interesting. I think we’ve stumbled across a really nice architecture, in that it doesn’t matter what language you want your credential to resolve in, or your predefined entries; they can all be resolving in your mother tongue. Everything in OCA is a layer, so depending on the country that you’re in, we can easily swap in a layer here and there, rather than rebuilding the entire schema structure. With you being a Canadian, you’ll be interested in this: I’ve been building a COVID-19 vaccination specification for the COVID-19 credentials initiative group. It’s an OCA-formatted spreadsheet, if you like. I showed it to the Canadian guys, and I had both Canadian French and English as some overlays. They asked, “Could you build some overlays for the Indigenous communities in Canada, like the Inuit?” I said, “Yeah, I think so.” Then, I had to google Inuit, because I have no idea — I’ve never seen the language before. It looks almost like hieroglyphics or something, and I thought, “I don’t think this is UTF-8 compliant.” Interestingly, with Overlays Capture Architecture, the character set encoding is a separate layer altogether. So, for an interesting character set such as what the Inuit use, you can just change the character setting encoding overlay, and then rebuild all the human-readable labels, and all the predefined entries, and everything in their language. The idea is that when you resolve that on your mobile phone, it comes through as a form. The whole form can be structured in their language, so it’s great. If you’re travelling and you don’t speak a language, you can enter everything in your own language. If the guy at border control only knows Russian, for example, all you have to do is hit a little scroll-down at the top from English to Russian, and the whole credential form changes into their language. It’s a really cool architecture, and we’re super proud of it.</p>
 <a></a>Managing Privacy 
<p>Mathieu: I won’t lie, it was heavy the first time I started looking into it; there are so many layers. I think the fact that you’ve been able to componentize it like that, makes it very easy to swap-in/ swap-out what you’re trying to do, based on your use case. I don’t know if it would be the masking layer, but if we’re talking about selective disclosure or privacy, there’s another layer in there that addresses that too, right?</p>
<p>Paul: Yes. If you look at data management as a three-step process: from data collection, data capture, data exchange… that second step of data capture is really important, because that’s where you rebuild the semantics for the data exchange. In that way, when it’s gone out the other end, if you like, it’s all beautiful for machine learning, etcetera. Some of the overlays that you use in that second stage, the capture stage, are really things like your human-readable labels, your predefined entries, or your formats. Some of the overlays that you might use on the exchange side might differ, so that’s what we’re looking at at the moment. When you talk about a masking overlay, that requires additional processing on perhaps certain attributes that you flagged in the schema base. Some of that masking might be more suited for the data exchange side, rather than the data capture side as a secondary process. We’re looking into all those nuances at the moment. I think that OCA has enough flexibility to be very granular on which overlays are used at, what stage of the data life cycle.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That makes sense. You touched on this earlier when we were talking about KERI being interesting for governance, because you’re not locked into a specific utility. Thinking about privacy, and governance around whatever needs to go into an ecosystem solution; this is where ecosystem builders would be able to integrate this architecture, and to be able to create the rule-set based on this, right?</p>
<p>Paul:  Yes, absolutely. The privacy folks are almost a totally different community in themselves. When I talk about the ‘Master Mouse Model,’ which is our vision of a dynamic data economy, what we talk about is really the data layer. However, there’s actually an entirely new layer that goes on top of that, which is the jurisdictional layer. For example, is a company compliant with jurisdictional law to be able to operate within that sort of economy?</p>
<p>When you talk about services: are those services authenticated by a jurisdictional authority? Are they allowed to perform those services? Those sorts of legal things are almost like a different ecosystem altogether. When I was talking about the ‘trusted digital assistant’, that’s really where you’d have APIs from that jurisdictional layer, plugging into your trusted digital assistant. That way, you know that when you’re looking for certain services, they’re already legal and they’ve been authorized properly. Obviously, it shouldn’t be up to the human being to decide whether something’s authorized or not; that’s a legal component.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes. So, in a COVID credentials or vaccination credentials use case, based on the jurisdiction you’re in, you don’t want to allow anyone to breach privacy or share PII. It’s all built into the system based on the jurisdiction: if I’m in Canada, or in a specific province in Canada, versus if I’m in a U.S. state, or if I’m in France or wherever, you could have this built right in.</p>
<p>What other use cases do you find interesting in what you see now? You came from the media/music space, you have a lot of experience in pharma, you’ve been spending a lot of time with the COVID projects: what do you find super interesting, or where are you spending most of your time right now?</p>
<p>Paul:  There are a couple of interesting things that we’re looking into. One of the projects that we built at the Human Colossus Foundation was a digital immunization passport. We haven’t pushed it that hard, because it’s actually working on brand new technologies that are not standards yet. I think there’s going to be a second wave of digital immunization passports; the first wave that goes out might come across a few issues with governance and all that sort of stuff. We’re sitting in on discussions about the next generation of immunization passports. One of the interesting things in that solution was trying to cryptographically link verifiable credentials to semantic containers.</p>
<p>Our view of a credential is that it should allow you to do something. When you have a credential on your mobile phone, you can show it to border control. They can see, “Oh, you’ve got a green tick mark; you’re good to go.” All of the sensitive health information data that sits behind that, we’ve been storing that in what we call a semantic container. That’s where the holder of the data can give access to that container using a token, and there is obviously a cryptographic link between the container and the credential. What’s interesting is that the credential’s great for saying,” Yes, this data has come from an authentic source.” Essentially, by cryptographically tying that credential to the container, you can say that anything in that container has been authenticated by me, and that has some interesting properties.</p>
<p>When you’re talking about the music industry, I think that for music publishers it could be really interesting. They’ve always had trouble with people copying MP3s and giving it to their friends; the artist doesn’t make any money. However, if you put an MP3 in a container and you’ve got a verifiable credential saying, “Yes, this container has been authenticated by AC/DC or whoever the band is”, then you can track it very well, using these decentralized technologies. So, if anybody is accessing that MP3; firstly, they need a token from, let’s say, the publisher acting on behalf of the band. That would probably be a good way to do it, because there’s always a provenance chain, back to where it came from. There’s an interesting technology that we’ve been looking at, called Digital Water-marking. Basically, it just changes the composition a tiny bit of the digital asset within the container. So, if somebody leaks that for any reason, without proper authorization to do it, you can track who leaked it. That’s super cool: it’s more of a defensive approach to data sharing. I think with all these things: the more protection you can have, the better. That’s just another method that we’re looking at, for how to stop illegal data sharing.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Is a good analogy that a credential is like a recipe item, but without a semantic container? That’s the meal; you’re able to put everything in together, you could take it from different places, and just have it as its own package.</p>
<p>Paul:  Yes, you can think of it exactly like that. It’s a bundle of information; so it could be a usage policy, plus a huge audio file, plus a couple of attachments — that can all be put into a container. The credential is saying that everything in that container is authentic; you can take a cryptographic hash of the contents of the container, and also a cryptographic hash of the data capture structure that was used to capture that data. If either of those two items changes, the hash basically breaks, and then the credential is automatically nulled.</p>
<p>When you have a UPS package or something like that, the package is the container and the thing that you’ve signed to get the package; that’s your credential. That’s your way of authenticating that it’s yours, all under your control.</p>
 <a></a>Community Activities 
<p>Mathieu: All of this work, and thinking, and pilots, and effort: you’re bringing all this to the Trust over I.P., and you seem to be working with Sovrin. Is it more specifically on the UX or guardianship side of things? Are you also involved with Kantara?</p>
<p>Paul: Yes, I’m involved in all of those communities in varying capacities. I work with the MyData community, all about personal data. I set up the ‘MyData Health’ thematic group over there, so it’s really about making sure that that health data is treated properly throughout the data life cycle; that’s one thing I do. For the COVID-19 credentials initiative, I run the schema task force there. We’re basically creating schema specifications for COVID-19 tests: that includes test reports, test certificates, vaccine reports, vaccine certificates, those sorts of things. At Sovrin, I lead the communications team. So, whenever you see blog posts going out from Sovrin, it’s usually pulled into our group. We’ll vet it, and make sure that it’s accurate and supportive of the community. And then, with Kantara, I work very closely with the ‘notice and consent’ group over there. Notice and consent is totally not my expertise, but I know how important that piece is to the whole ecosystem, so I’m trying my best to learn as much as I can. There are some amazing people in that space, who have as much knowledge in their space as I do in semantics. I’m totally in awe of those guys, as well.</p>
<p>Mathieu: For the different communities advocating for trusted data, or self-sovereign identity, or <a href="https://northernblock.io/">decentralized identity</a>, however you call it; I think everyone has the same ethos of what we’re trying to do, and the community is amazing. Everyone is trying to help each other out; everyone’s trying to give. Honestly, we’re very fortunate to work with these types of people every day. It’s just amazing; it’s very motivating.</p>
<p>Paul: Absolutely. You’re dealing with people who have 25 years of identity experience, and 25 years of consent, and getting these people to the same table to agree on what a dynamic data economy should look like. I’m totally blown away by the level of knowledge.</p>
<p>Mathieu: To close, where could you use help? How could people help you to keep pushing the dynamic data economy forward, and all these things forward?</p>
<p>Paul: It’s very much a cross-community effort, really. The Human Colossus Foundation is pretty much as agnostic as you like; we don’t really have an agenda. We talk to all the communities, and we try hard to make sure that everybody has a place at the dinner table to put their objectives forward, for the good of the economy.</p>
<p>Moving forward, if anybody’s really interested in this space, I would suggest that the inputs and semantics working group within Trust over I.P. is a great place to join. You’ll get a very broad perspective on the economy from a lot of specialists all working together. For a quick fix on a lot of information, that’s a great place to go. At Trust over I.P., looking at the dual stack, there’s also space for governance across the governance stack, and also new technologies in the technology stack. I think Trust over I.P. is a great space to join. When it was first set up, there were a few murmurings that this is just Sovrin, rebranded. In reality, it’s much broader than that. Sovrin is a utility for self-sovereign identity and will probably always be seen as the genesis point of that whole ecosystem, but Trust over I.P. goes much broader than that. It’s self-sovereign identity, but it’s also decentralized consent, semantics, ecosystems — it’s a much broader space. The reason I say that is because for anybody that is uneasy about SSI or has any doubts about it: just go into Trust over I.P., and there will be a space for your expertise, for sure.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Agreed. Paul, thank you very much for doing this with me. It was a great conversation. I’m sure people are going to find this quite interesting and want to go a little deeper into the stack that you guys are bringing forward. I know this is an area that I’m quite interested in going into a lot deeper, so thank you for doing this!</p>
<p>Paul: My pleasure, thanks for having me; I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>It’s a sad reality that Web 2.0&nbsp;and social media&nbsp;have&nbsp;made it easier for&nbsp;<a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/defining-online-harassment-a-glossary-of-terms/">online abuse</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rightsforpeace.org/hate-speech#:~:text=Speech%20that%20is%20simply%20offensive,religion%2C%20ethnicity%20or%20other%20factors.">hate speech</a>&nbsp;to flourish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/07/11/online-harassment-2017/">2017 Pew Research</a>&nbsp;revealed 41 percent of Americans had&nbsp;been harassed online and 66 percent hadwitnessed&nbsp;abuse of others.&nbsp;Updated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">2021</a>&nbsp;data show&nbsp;roughly the same&nbsp;rates of abuse but&nbsp;more severe&nbsp;abusive encounters,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;physical threats, stalking and sexual harassment.&nbsp;Significantly,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">75&nbsp;percent</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;the most recent encounters for those affected happened on social media platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We all know online abuse can be&nbsp;incredibly damaging&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/07/11/online-harassment-2017/">Pew</a>&nbsp;puts it like this: “In its milder forms,&nbsp;[online&nbsp;abuse]&nbsp;creates a layer of negativity that people must sift through as they navigate their daily routines online. At its most severe, it can compromise users’ privacy, force them to choose when and where to participate online, or even pose a threat to their physical safety.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For years solutions to this growing problem have&nbsp;largely&nbsp;centred on&nbsp;ridding the internet of anonymity—forcing people to&nbsp;reveal their real names and identities&nbsp;when they engage online.&nbsp;But as&nbsp;Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>,&nbsp;recently pointed out on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lock and Code&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/podcast/2021/03/defending-online-anonymity-and-speech-with-eva-galperin-lock-and-code-s02e03/">Malware Bytes</a> podcast,&nbsp;removing anonymity&nbsp;unacceptably risks&nbsp;exposing the world’s most vulnerable populations.&nbsp;And that’s where we start to see that anonymity isn’t all evil for its shielding of malicious actors&nbsp;(a common charge); it’s also&nbsp;an essential protection&nbsp;for those who need it most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms Galperin says: “Being able to speak anonymously is extremely important for people in vulnerable populations, for people with unpopular opinions, for minorities, for women, for anybody whose identity is non-standard.”&nbsp;Included in that, she says, are survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, whistleblowers, and human rights activists working against oppressive governments.&nbsp;For these&nbsp;people, anonymity&nbsp;can be&nbsp;essential because,&nbsp;she&nbsp;says, “the systems are not there to protect vulnerable communities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms Galperin points out anonymous speech and pseudonyms are “an extremely important tool for people who want to speak truth to power.” Journalists can do more dangerous reporting;&nbsp;whistleblowers&nbsp;can lift the lid on corporate malfeasance and so on.&nbsp;For&nbsp;domestic abuse survivors,&nbsp;anonymity allows vital sharing of experiences.&nbsp;“Often speech is the only outlet survivors have because often abuse is difficult to prove … and accusations often come a long time after the abuse. Getting legal action or even action by police on sexual abuse is incredibly difficult.” She says this action often doesn’t result in consequences for the abuser that are proportional to what they’ve done,&nbsp;“so all survivors can do is tell their stories.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we remove anonymity online,&nbsp;we remove that vital outlet.&nbsp;“Not only will they not be able to tell their stories, they also won’t be able to continue hiding from their abusers. One major concern is ‘how am I going to continue my life online without continuing to be harassed by [my] abuser’?&nbsp;Starting new&nbsp;social media, getting a new phone …&nbsp;having a pseudonym, hiding …&nbsp;are&nbsp;all important to these communities,” Ms Galperin says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms Galperin says using real identities online won’t make the internet a safer place&nbsp;for anyone.&nbsp;She argues many people happily post harassing content under their own names all the time so&nbsp;revealing their identitywouldn’t deter their behavior.&nbsp;Further,&nbsp;users&nbsp;need to be able to compartmentalize their&nbsp;personal and professional lives&nbsp;so they can express themselves&nbsp;safely&nbsp;in different forums. Ms Galperin says: “We don’t have one single incorporated identity. We’re often different people to co-workers, school friends, church etc. That’s fine.&nbsp;But jumbling all those identities together&nbsp;[to use a single, real online identity]&nbsp;can result in really negative consequences.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another&nbsp;long mooted solution&nbsp;to online abuse&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;abandon&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230">S. 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a>, which&nbsp;protects companies that publish or republish third party content&nbsp;and,&nbsp;as Ms Galperin points out,&nbsp;“has enabled social media platforms and our current media environment to thrive.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>CDA 230&nbsp;says&nbsp;“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider”&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">47 U.S.C. § 230</a>).&nbsp;This means, any platform that allows users to post content online (e.g.&nbsp;Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok),&nbsp;is&nbsp;not legally responsible for that content.&nbsp;They don’t have to&nbsp;take down&nbsp;defamatory/abusive/inflammatory&nbsp;content (except where content is copyrighted) and they can’t be sued for what others say on their platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People see&nbsp;[CDA 230]&nbsp;as problematic, because they think&nbsp;[removing ]it would rein in Big Tech and&nbsp;social media&nbsp;companies … but it is not a special law just for SM companies.&nbsp;These protections are essential to everyone and to competitors to Facebook, Twitter etc. Getting rid of it is not going to help.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, Ms Galperin points out that “issues&nbsp;with CDA&nbsp;230 are really issues with&nbsp;the First&nbsp;Amendment.”&nbsp;When&nbsp;you&nbsp;engage&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;platform, it’s not your free speech rights that apply, it’s the platform’s. This means the platform owners&nbsp;can say&nbsp;what they want and remove whatever content they want.&nbsp;Abolishing&nbsp;CDA 230 won’t matter because platform owners can still apply their rights under&nbsp;the&nbsp;First&nbsp;Amendment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Most of our speech online now takes place on platforms controlled by someone else. Companies are entirely within their free speech rights to edit, ban, leave out whatever they want. Users’ rights are largely limited.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a nutshell, if we&nbsp;change the laws and&nbsp;make companies, particularly Big Tech,&nbsp;liable for their users’ content,&nbsp;they&nbsp;could&nbsp;become&nbsp;“extremely cautious and hyper moderated”, and again this removes one of the few safe outlets vulnerable people have to express their experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Survivors need to publish their story on someone else’s platform.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;often the only option survivors have for anything even vaguely resembling justice&nbsp;…&nbsp;Then if there’s no CDA&nbsp;230&nbsp;…&nbsp;now the survivor is completely silenced,”&nbsp;Ms Galperin said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As&nbsp;Lock and Code&nbsp;podcaster&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/podcast/2021/03/defending-online-anonymity-and-speech-with-eva-galperin-lock-and-code-s02e03/">David Ruiz</a>&nbsp;asked:&nbsp;So if&nbsp;using real names and changing the law won’t work, what will?&nbsp;What&nbsp;would make the internet a&nbsp;safer space for survivors?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms Galperin says it’s about makers of tools and platforms taking responsibility&nbsp;for their products’ effects on vulnerable users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Primarily the onus for&nbsp;making&nbsp;safe platforms is on the makers of platforms&nbsp;and the onus for safer tools and IoT objects is on their makers … I encourage them to&nbsp;think about how their&nbsp;tool will be used for harassment, how&nbsp;this tool&nbsp;will be used by&nbsp;a&nbsp;domestic abuser,&nbsp;to&nbsp;think about empowering the user to get away from someone they used to trust&nbsp;who also used to use this tool with them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, she points to messaging: “One&nbsp;of the&nbsp;most important&nbsp;things&nbsp;is if you have a way of sending messages through your platform please make it possible for people not to use their real names. Ideally make it possible so they don’t have to hand over their&nbsp;phone number&nbsp;…&nbsp;and to block other users or mute certain keywords. If you give the power to the user, they can decide what is harassment and what is abuse and&nbsp;it really&nbsp;takes&nbsp;the&nbsp;onus off&nbsp;the&nbsp;makers&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;platform to be judge, jury and executioner&nbsp;for every&nbsp;communication that somebody&nbsp;has online.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re already seeing a lot of positive movement in making it better for users&nbsp;online. Ms Galperin points to&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;like EFF&nbsp;and&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;Bytes, and we’d add&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/01/anonyome-labs-sudo-safe-program-supports-at-risk-users/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;to the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Anonyome Labs, our solutions help mitigate tech-facilitated violence and abuse. We empower people to be able to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. We provide survivors and those at risk of harassment, violence and abuse, real and effective tools for protecting their personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2020, we proudly became a partner of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/anonyome-labs-joins-global-fight-against-stalkerware/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>, a global working group uniting advocacy groups, software developers, security firms, victims and survivors, in the fight to protect consumers against stalkerware and to eliminate abusive technology and software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also growing our own safety initiative, known as&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/01/anonyome-labs-sudo-safe-program-supports-at-risk-users/">Sudo Safe</a>. Through Sudo Safe, we partner with organizations that promote safe use of the Internet as well as those organizations that support at-risk people who may have a specific need for privacy and security in their life. Our goal is to support at-risk users, and to be a privacy resource for organizations supporting their members.&nbsp;Sudo Safe encourages the use of our privacy and cyber safety app,&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, to help people keep their personally identifiable information private.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>OneTrust, provider of data privacy, security, and governance solutions has announced that it will acquire Convercent, an enterprise GRC solution with an ethics and compliance portal. Slotting itself as a strategic acquisition, the two companies will be aligning and merging their products to actualize trust for the enterprise. The deal is intended to be finalized in mid-April.</p>
 Expanding the ways to build trust 
<p>Building trust is a multifaceted task that encompasses the relationships an organization has with all stakeholders. OneTrust works with a trust framework where establishing trust and assessing risk of third-party vendors is at the foundation. There are also compulsory elements of trust like maintaining adequate security and compliance. The relational aspect of trust is powerfully influenced by transparency, ensuring privacy, and taking measurable action on environmental and social issues. The acquisition bolsters OneTrust’s activities in the third-party due diligence and GRC domains, and helps to make progress for new products: OneTrust Ethics and OneTrust ESG.</p>
<p>Third-party risk solutions are becoming ever more urgent, especially those that support supply chain management and accounting for supplier risk. COVID-19 showed the massive impacts on supply chains, which is only the most recent and most visible example of how unforeseen disruptions to a supply chain can wreak havoc. Pressures to manage vendor relationships come both from regional initiatives, such as the German<a href="https://lieferkettengesetz.de/" title="Lieferkettengesetz"> Lieferkettengesetz</a>, and from large enterprises that can put stringent requirements on their suppliers. There is a clear and growing market for such vendor risk management solutions.</p>
<p>To communicate and operationalize the trust reputation of a company, OneTrust Ethics is intended to function like a privacy portal. It will handle the communications, ethics policies, requests, and even gamification of taking ethical action. This could be employee facing as a centralized, standardized, and private way of handling ethics cases, as well as being vendor or customer facing as well.</p>
<p>OneTrust ESG is a groundbreaking product aiming to standardize reporting on environmental, social, and governance initiatives. This product will begin by assisting in reporting specific environmental initiatives, like when an enterprise makes a net zero carbon emission pledge. The product will assist in normalizing data from utility bills, collaborate with remediation providers, and work to provide transparent and standardized reporting the initiative’s progress. This product will eventually expand to cover other environmental and social initiatives like empowering diversity in the workplace. While it is a conservative approach towards measuring corporate ESG initiatives, simply providing support in standardizing reporting is a huge step forward.</p>
<p>Both of these are timely additions because corporations are under regulatory pressure and intense public scrutiny to protect whistleblowers, demonstrate meaningful action in diversity or sexual harassment cases, and show commitment to environmental causes. Contributions to establish metrics and define reasonable expectations of enterprises to create public value come from entities like the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_IBC_Measuring_Stakeholder_Capitalism_Report_2020.pdf" title="World Economic Forum">World Economic Forum</a> and nonprofits such as <a href="https://yourpublicvalue.org/principles/" title="Your Public Value">Your Public Value</a>. OneTrust joins the effort by striving to provide resources for transparent reporting and internal structures to mitigate risk.</p>
 Focus on growth 
<p>OneTrust has seen rapid growth overall of its original portfolio consisting of privacy, preference, GRC, and third-party risk management solutions. There will be continued development to expand the privacy platform to stay current with the increasing global privacy regulations. Convercent’s ethics and compliance solutions will be a recipient of this growth, with particular focus on R&amp;D and customer support.</p>

<p>Benjamin Cox (Ben) was a lawyer and a working partner at an up-and-coming law firm in New York City. He was born in the inner city of NYC and had worked his way to this position.</p><p>At the same time, he had been sensing fatigue and a lack of interest in his work over the last few months. Today, in particular, he was not ready for work at all and decided to call in sick. Bored, he simply darted out of his apartment, took his car, and decided to go on a&nbsp;drive.</p><p>12 hours&nbsp;later…..</p><p>Ben was still driving. He was somewhere in Georgia and he booked into a hotel and spent the night contemplating his future. The next day, instead of driving back to NYC, he kept going in the other direction.</p><p>He had finally taken the plunge! Though there were many uncertainties, he knew he could handle it all as he had the emotional strength and more importantly, he had his verifiable credentials that could help him anywhere.</p><p>He got behind the wheels and started driving again. By the end of the day, he reached Houston! That night, the Houston Rockets were taking on the New York Knicks, and for the first time, he cheered for Rockets as he wanted to break away from the shackles of his life in NYC and anything that even remotely connected him to this&nbsp;city.</p><p>The next day dawned and Ben decided to go further south and drove right past the Mexican border between El Paso and Juarez. When he was asked to show his ID, he quickly turned to the <a href="https://medium.com/affinidi/protecting-your-drivers-license-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-25d22aeac05b">driver’s license verifiable credentials</a>. All that he had to do was share the verifiable presentation from his digital wallet to the border authorities, who in turn, checked for its validity and authenticity. Since these verifiable credentials were tamper-proof, the authorities had no qualms about his identity or the authenticity of his VCs, and approved his entry. So, just like that, Ben breezed into&nbsp;Mexico.</p><p>The next morning, the same story, and more driving! A couple of days later, he reached Cancun and decided to stay there for a few&nbsp;days.</p><p>While relaxing on the seaside one afternoon, he started feeling a bit nauseous, so he headed back to the hotel. As he was mulling over the possibilities, he realized he hadn’t been taking his regular meds for high blood pressure. He went to the local clinic to get a prescription for his restricted blood pressure drug. But the authorities there weren’t forthcoming to give the prescription, so Ben shared his <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/accessing-medical-records-anywhere-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-81a248f9b746">medical condition verifiable credentials</a> that proved his medical condition and his use of the drug. These VCs proved to be a life-saver as he was able to get a prescription for the restricted drug even in a different country!&nbsp;.</p><p>A week later, he decided it was time to decide what he really wanted to&nbsp;do.</p><p>He had no clue what, but it was definitely not back to NYC and the firm. With such thoughts, he picked up the local paper, and his eyes fell on an advertisement for an English-speaking guide in the small town of Barra de&nbsp;Potosi.</p><p>With a smile, Ben drove down to Barra and met the hotel manager at the Laguna de Potosi, the only hotel in this town of about 400 residents. Since it was a tourist town where hundreds of Americans landed each year to enjoy the watersports, the hotel was looking for a guide to talk to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Though Ben was over-qualified and his weekly pay was a pittance compared to what he was earning at NYC, he accepted it with all his heart! But there was a problem! To employ him, the hotel had to submit his ID and some proof that made him eligible for this&nbsp;job.</p><p>Verifiable credentials came to Ben’s rescue again as he dug through his digital wallet to find an English teaching <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">employment verifiable credential</a> he had done many years ago when he was a sophomore in college. He shared the verifiable credentials of his first job with the local labor department, and the officer was able to verify it based on the schema. This was deemed to be sufficient for the job and Ben started his new career as an English&nbsp;guide.</p><p>A week later, it was time for his pay and the hotel wanted to pay him through a bank account to avoid tax penalties. So, Ben had to open a bank account. But the bank manager wanted a ton of documents and all that Ben had to do was share his <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/opening-a-bank-account-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-53ea478b5414">verifiable credentials with the bank manager</a>. Ben created a verifiable presentation that contained all the documents that the bank wanted and shared this presentation with the bank manager. In turn, the manager checked the identity of the issuer and the validity of the documents, and opened the bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>Ben settled into a life of peace, solitude, and freedom. His law firm had given up searching for him and had moved on. Ben lived the rest of his life at Barra de Potosi, the magical place where he truly found&nbsp;himself.</p><p>So, what do you think is the reason for Ben’s serendipity? A stroke of luck?&nbsp;Destiny?</p><p>The real reason is verifiable credentials as it came in handy every step of the way. He had complete control over his credentials and could share it with just the entities he wanted to. Also, he had no plan and it would’ve been impossible to move seamlessly across international borders without his&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Think about it for a moment. No physical documents at all, but a simple and secure self-sovereign identity that Ben had complete control over. More importantly, look at the interoperability and flexibility as Ben could use them in different situations and across multiple platforms.</p><p>That’s the true power of&nbsp;VCs!</p><p>Do you think he could have changed his life so drastically without his VCs? What about your life? How can VCs help&nbsp;you?</p><p>Imagine the endless possibilities it can create for people and the society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>This is undoubtedly the future — a world of secure and portable credentials that individuals can control completely.</p><p>Are you ready to be a part of this&nbsp;future?</p><p>We have the building blocks on which you can build any VC-based application that you think will benefit everyone.

  <p>Gimly has built a full draft of the EOSIO <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralised Identifier</a> (DID) method specification. This specification guides the implementation of DIDs on EOSIO powered blockchains.</p>

<p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are an important part of the <a href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) technology stack. The DID is the lowest level on top of which other identity components such as <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (personal information or information about organisations and other entities) can be built. Using the SSI tech stack allows applications to use an interoperable identity that is driven by a well curated set of privacy and security knowledge. Using an SSI architecture brings privacy and security to digital human identity, and significantly removes technical and legal friction for governments, enterprise and SMEs.</p> DID:EOSIO specification

 The GiD Report#154 — Digital identity is cool now (Big Tech is&nbsp;not) <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-153-the-age-of-the-digital-wallet-has-arrived-76e32a1aba69">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Digital identity is cool&nbsp;now  Athletes as Storytellers (via&nbsp;Greg)  The New Yorker explains Clubhouse  Microsoft wants to buy&nbsp;Discord  No one trusts Big&nbsp;Tech  Facebook’s massive data&nbsp;breach  This week in&nbsp;NFTs  Tweet of the week (digital wallet edition&nbsp;w/CZ)  Stuff happens   1. Digital identity is cool&nbsp;now. <p>Got a text from a friend this morning about the latest craze — a new platform called <a href="https://y.at/control-center">y.at</a> — let me know if you’d like an invite to check it&nbsp;out.</p><p>In a nutshell, Yat wants to turn unique emoji combos into universal identifiers:</p><blockquote>Yat lets you use emojis as your universal username and identity on the internet. Imagine being known as 🔥🐍 or 🤖👻👑 instead of coffeequeen98 or jake.smith2438@gmail.com.</blockquote><blockquote>By owning a Yat — let’s say 🌊🔱🌴 — it’s yours forever. You are the ~only~ one on earth who owns these&nbsp;emojis.</blockquote><blockquote>The possibilities are endless with Yat. You can receive payments, use it on your socials, and eventually much more. Your Yat can be used as a link like this: https://y.at/🌊🔱🌴 (click it to see it!) and automatically redirect visitors to any website you&nbsp;want.</blockquote><p>Now, it’s unclear to me how natural or intuitive it is to associate people with emojis — but it’d be easy to dismiss me as a boomer. (The fact that the platform is selling off emoji combos based on their own internal score for rarity makes it feel like a bit of a short term cash grab. Although my friend did buy his own emoji real estate for $120, apparently.)</p><blockquote>“I don’t know, man. It seems like a low risk/high reward thing. People are hype on it! I’m just trying to be an early adopter. It’s called an investment, my&nbsp;dude.”</blockquote><p>At the very least, there’s a compelling narrative here about digital identity — how it’s becoming more playful/fun/compelling in a way that’s attracting mainstream attention. People are actively thinking about this stuff. They’re willing to engage in new ideas. Most of all, they understand why identity is so important.</p><p>Here’s <a href="http://global.id/m">/m</a>’s&nbsp;take:</p><blockquote>Maybe it’s just me as I don’t use emojis much (except for 10 of them). They are really hard to find. Some of them are also very similar (e.g. skin tones, small changes) so I see a lot of problems with this. I guess this might be much easier for anyone that knows e.g. Chinese and Japanese characters but learning an alphabet with more than 3000 characters won’t be easy. But this might be where the 🌎 is going&nbsp;😉</blockquote> 2. We need an identity. We want a&nbsp;voice. <p>Here’s the New Yorker from <a href="http://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> on <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/05/the-rise-of-the-athlete-podcaster">The Rise of the Athlete Podcaster</a>:</p><blockquote>In the past, if athletes wanted to speak candidly, they would write a tell-all book, do a sit-down interview, maybe phone in to a radio show. If they aspired to work in media, they would try to land a cushy network job, providing expert commentary or analysis. But the Internet, which allows any of us to air the slightest thought, has changed those rules. Players have grown infatuated with sharing their perspectives in real time, in direct, unfiltered ways. Retired greats have realized that they possess endless content — stories, memories, behind-the-scenes morsels — that fans crave. And athletes everywhere are seizing the means of production. Around the time that Jeter launched the Tribune, LeBron James got funding for a new company, Uninterrupted. Its aim was to produce content from players’ points of view, and to show that those players could be “more than an athlete.” People like Jeter and James no longer had to settle for being talking heads. Now they barely had to settle for sports at&nbsp;all.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1379061143495381000">Greg’s take</a>:</p><blockquote>“Athletes as Storytellers — one more indication that the world is getting flatter.”</blockquote> 3. This week at the Clubhouse (naturally) <p>Here’s the New Yorker — <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/in-the-clubhouse">Clubhouse Feels Like a&nbsp;Party</a>:</p><blockquote>Here would be the place to speak of the history of mass communication; to produce historical analogues for Clubhouse, such as call-in radio shows, the teen party lines of the nineteen-eighties, and the Agora; to cite Habermas or Gramsci and nod to Marshall McLuhan. I kept thinking of a minor section in Don DeLillo’s “White Noise,” from 1985, in which the narrator completes an A.T.M. transaction and experiences a sparkling moment of integration with the global financial apparatus: “The system was invisible, which made it all the more impressive, all the more disquieting to deal with. But we were in accord, at least for now. The networks, the circuits, the streams, the harmonies.”</blockquote><blockquote>This was basically how it felt to be on Clubhouse. With each new experience — a lullaby room, in which most avatars wore the same cartoon, baby-blue nightcap; a beatboxing and freestyle session between musical-theatre performers; a “dopamine reset” silent meditation, which was actually silent — I felt increasingly as if the app, whose creators have not articulated any particular theory of technology or media, belonged to a great, surging&nbsp;lineage.</blockquote><blockquote>In 1999, John Durham Peters, who is now a professor of English and film and media studies at Yale, published “Speaking Into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication.” “In richer societies, much of our interaction is enabled by interpersonal media such as email and telephone,” he wrote — forums “in which the broadcast and the interactive are hard to tell apart.” In such a society, where the boundary between mass communication and in-person conversation is more porous, everyday talk can assume the tones and tics of media. “In private life, many of us talk like Beckett characters,” Peters wrote, while “in public discourse, celebrities present themselves as if they are our friends.” When we spoke, over the phone, he had not yet used Clubhouse. Still, he considered parallels to the use of CB radio among truckers in the nineteen-seventies, to the Sandinistas’ experimental shows in the eighties, and to French salons. He contemplated feminist scholarship on the synchronization of soap operas and domestic labor, and described the inside-out dynamic of advice columnists — the “structural inversion of the single voice crying out, and the advice columnist crying out to everyone all at&nbsp;once.”</blockquote><blockquote>“In the nineties, you were stigmatized if you were a lurker, but this legitimates the listener,” Peters said, of Clubhouse. “Listening is a democratic thing. It’s not passive. It’s one of the hardest things we do.” The concept also reminded him of shortwave radio. “Very early on, you had amateurs talking back and forth to each other, first in Morse code, then in voice,” he said. “You could presume intimacy because very few people had the receiving equipment. That’s sort of the same idea as Clubhouse. Not everybody has the receiving equipment. They don’t have&nbsp;access.”</blockquote><p>Like I said, it’s the New&nbsp;Yorker.</p><p>And as you all know by now, everyone is Clubhouse — Via MIT Tech&nbsp;Review:</p><blockquote>+ LinkedIn is working on a Clubhouse clone. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/?mc_cid=14aab0a479&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">TechCrunch</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>+ And so is Spotify. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition?mc_cid=14aab0a479&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">The&nbsp;Verge</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>+ And Discord! (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice?mc_cid=14aab0a479&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">The&nbsp;Verge</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>+ The people who will be left behind in the shift to spoken social media.&nbsp;(<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/03/clubhouse-voice-social-media-people-who-stutter.html?mc_cid=14aab0a479&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">Slate</a>)</blockquote> 4. Speaking of Discord, Microsoft wants to buy it, apparently. <p>Via <a href="http://global.id/m">/m</a></p><p>Which everyone hates. Like Linus (of Linus Tech Tips): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdyLB5fyHMU">Do you WANT Discord to be Owned by Microsoft??</a></p><p>Probably because everyone hates Big Tech at the moment.

<p>We talked with our co-founder and CTO <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a> about her unusual career path, amazing achievements and experiences as a woman in tech. Read on to get to know one of our favorite fearless leaders. </p> Q. Can you tell us about your programming journey and your career in computer science/development? <p>A. &nbsp;I have a weird winding path to programming, and kind of "fell into it".</p><p>I started out as a classical music composer (this is relevant for a few reasons, as you'll see). Back in music school, I had the best Photoshop/Illustrator skills in my cohort, so I ended up making a bunch of the concert posters and programmes (back when they were paper). I was also a very interested in the technical aspects of music: What made it tick? What are the underlying structures? How many lines of polyphony can I write while keeping it coherent? Turns out that this is a lot of related theory to CS.</p><p>Many years later, I ended up at a startup doing graphic design. You end up doing a little bit of everything at startups, and they asked me I'd be willing to implement parts of the designs I was making. So I read a book that weekend, and showed up on Monday writing HTML/CSS and a tiny bit of jQuery. It turns out that I was better at that than design, and so I switched to development.</p><p>This was back before it was clear that Node would win the JS-on-the-server space. We were using a JVM-based framework that let you write in a dozen-or-so JVM-based languages, so I had to learn a bunch of languages early on to contribute to this project: Java, JS (Rhino), JRuby, Groovy, Clojure, and a couple more. I got really into Clojure, and thus into functional programming, and started reading the classic CS literature from the 70s and 80s. I quickly became a programming language nerd, which means also picking up a bunch of related CS. The rest, as they say, is history 😉</p><p></p><p></p> Q. Could you share an example of a hurdle or obstacle you experienced during your developer journey and how you overcame it? <p>A. You know, I honestly don't feel like I've have a ton of the classic blockers in my career! I'm very passionate about what I do, and work feels like play. The hardest part has been self-inflicted burnout. Burnout is the flip side of being so enthusiastic about my work: I take on a ton and work myself into the ground. I've burned out several times, and it's deeply unpleasant. </p><p>I'm learning to take better care of myself, but it's an internal struggle of short-term vs long-term. When people talk about mindfulness, you usually think of meditating and clearing your mind to focus on the here and now, but the bigger part of that for me is recognizing when I'm red-lining too much and eustress is turning into distress.</p><p></p><p></p> Q. You are one of the industry's most sought after keynote speakers. How did that come to be and how are you received as woman speaker in a male-dominated industry? <p>A. I think that I ended up keynoting conferences for a couple reasons: I was pretty engaged in tech community organizing, so I was fairly visible. I have a fair bit of public speaking experience, so I generally can generally (but not always :P) put together a coherent presentation. Finally, I like to push the boundaries of my tools, so I've done some OSS work that folks have found interesting (e.g. Witchcraft, Exceptional).</p>Brooklyn Zelenka keynoting at a 2017 event<p></p><p>I've definitely experienced sexism in tech, though as my career has progressed and I've become more visible, there's less of that. There have been comments that the women speaking at conferences are just there to fill a quota. I've had comments on talk feedback forms that were just one word: "girl", or people assuming that I'm Boris' assistant during a workshop about a technical standard that I developed. I've at times overcompensated by trying to "look the part" with programmer joke t-shirts and hoodies. Now, I'm pretty nerdy by nature, and I do like these things, but there's also a level of defense mechanism there.</p><p>That said, on the whole, people have been incredibly nice and supportive! Part of this choice of communities -- I just don't have time for constantly fighting, so I go where the people are friendly!</p><p></p><p></p> Q. What advice would you give young women about a career in tech? <p>A. Honestly: just try it! I've spoken to a bunch of women over the years that just don't see themselves as the unfeeling, uncreative, evil-genius programmers that our culture likes to portray. I had the same bias! It turns out that programming is a very broad field. It's also extremely creative, and provides a ton of flexibility. Yes, bad programming jobs exist, but you have way more agency and power than really any other career I can think of: you can really choose your own adventure. It's not even that hard to get started, though like any skill, learning the basics is the hardest part. Just try it; it's much better than you think!</p><p></p><p></p> Q. What has been your biggest career and/or personal achievement? <p>A. Wow, that's a hard one! I feel really lucky to have done a lot of things that I find meaningful, from activism to building products to seeing the world as a digital nomad. I think my biggest success has been forging my own path: choosing interesting experiences over cash, curating where I spend my energy to support communities that I care about, and learning as much as possible.</p><p></p> <p>Thanks to Brooklyn for taking the time to answer questions about her background and career. Over the next months Fission will be sharing profiles of each of our awesome team members with the community. Fission's team is one of its biggest strengths and we want to give them each a moment to shine. </p><p>Interested in learning more about the Fission community? <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">Visit the Fission events page</a> to sign up to get notified about new events, and join us most Thursdays for new tech talks.</p>

  The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) has selected IDunion for the second phase of the innovation competition “Showcase Secure Digital Identities”.  The three-year implementation phase began on April 1, 2021.&nbsp;  The goals of this new project phase includes the establishment of a European cooperative, the launch of a production network and the implementation of 40+ different pilot applications from several areas.  



<p>Frankfurt am Main, April 6, 2021 – IDunion, an open ecosystem for trusted identities, entered its second project phase funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy on April 1, 2021 as part of the innovation competition “<a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/EN/Standardartikel/sdi_programm.html">Showcase Secure Digital Identities</a>”. With these showcase projects, the German Federal Government aims to promote the development of digital solutions for identity management in Germany within the framework of an innovation competition. This competition is based on the framework “<a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/edt_bekanntmachung_foerderrahmen.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3">Development of Digital Technologies</a>“. The aim of this competition is to develop and test outstanding approaches, which are designed for everyday use and are usable in a wide range of possible applications in the field of secure digital identities.</p>



<p>Based on the concept of self-sovereign identities (SSI), IDunion has set itself the goal of establishing an ecosystem for natural and legal persons as well as things. Use cases in a wide range of areas will therefore be piloted in the following areas: education, e-commerce, mobility, e-government, e-health, finance, identity &amp; access management (IAM) and industry/IoT. Some further concrete examples of applications are the following: the derivation of the ID card into available wallets, campus management and educational credentials for students, legal identities for companies or product identities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the network has several other ambitious goals, such as building a comprehensive framework to further develop trust in the underlying technology. In addition to this, the partners are working together on the conception and implementation of security-related aspects. The wallets and other software applications developed within the consortium will also be further enhanced to ensure an optimal user experience and a wider distribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A European cooperative will be established and will serve as a legal entity for the management of the network and the operation of the ecosystem. The cooperative will act in the interest of all members and will be a non-for-profit organisation. A draft of the statutes, which constitutes the set of rules for the members, can be found <a href="https://nextcloud.idunion.org/s/38weYaGtSMSRwJQ">here</a>.</p>



<p>Within this innovation competition, the following partners are funded:&nbsp; </p>



  Bank-Verlag GmbH,  Bundesdruckerei GmbH,&nbsp;  DB Systel GmbH,&nbsp;  Deutsche Telekom AG  esatus AG,&nbsp;  GS1 Germany GmbH,&nbsp;  ING-DiBa AG,&nbsp;  Main Incubator GmbH,&nbsp;  Robert Bosch GmbH,&nbsp;  Siemens AG,&nbsp;  Stadt Köln,&nbsp;  Spherity GmbH,&nbsp;  Technische Universität Berlin,&nbsp;  Institut für Internet-Sicherheit (Westfälische Hochschule) und  YES Payment Services GmbH.  



<p>The following institutions are associated partners:&nbsp;</p>



  51nodes GmbH,&nbsp;  Berlin Partner für Wirtschaft und Technologie GmbH,  Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Wirtschaft, Energie und Betriebe,  Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge,  BWI GmbH,  CodeCamp:N GmbH,  Commerzbank AG,&nbsp;  CompuGroup Medical Software GmbH,  D-Trust GmbH,  Datarella GmbH,&nbsp;  DATEV eG,  Deutsche Bank AG,  Deutsche Post AG,&nbsp;  Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband e. V.,  Energy Web Stiftung,  Festo SE &amp; Co. KG,  Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte Informationstechnik FIT,  gematik GmbH,&nbsp;  mgm technology partners GmbH,  Ministerium für Wirtschaft, Innovation, Digitalisierung und Energie des Landes NRW,&nbsp;  msg systems AG,&nbsp;  R3 LLC,  regio iT gesellschaft für informationstechnologie mbh,  targens GmbH,&nbsp;  TrustCerts GmbH und  Verband der Vereine Creditreform e.V..  



<p>With the foundation of the European cooperative, the IDunion ecosystem will be open to new partners. Interested parties can reach out to <a href="http://contact@idunion.org">contact@idunion.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 Opening a Bank Account — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials <p>Opening a bank account is something that we have all done at some point in our lives. Though over the years, the process has become a lot simpler, still it entails a ton of documents to prove your identity.</p><p>At the bare minimum, you’d&nbsp;need,</p>  A piece of government-issued identification to prove your&nbsp;identity  Your Social Security Number or a Taxpayer Identification Number  <p>Carrying these documents is a hassle because they can get lost or damaged in transit. Plus, it is highly risky in the event of theft because your Personally Identifiable Information can fall into the wrong&nbsp;hands.</p><p>A more secure and easier way to share your information for opening a bank account could be through verifiable credentials.</p> How to Use VCs to Open a Bank&nbsp;Account? <p>Here is a sample workflow on how verifiable credentials can be used to open a bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>There are three entities to these transactions, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer — A startup company that collates all the government-issued documents and stores them in the form of a verifiable credential. A good example would be DigiLocker from the Government of India that provides access to authentic digital documents to citizen’s digital document&nbsp;wallets.  Holder — The individual/company/entity looking to open a bank account. In this sample use case, let’s assume this entity is an 18-year old girl opening a bank account for the first&nbsp;time.  Verifier — The bank where the holder wants to open an&nbsp;account  <p>As a first step, the holder logs into the issuer’s portal and submits a request for verifiable credentials. After checking the holder’s identity and request, the issuer sends a QR code to the holder, and in turn, the holder scans the code and saves the information in her digital&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>When the verifier requests the documents, the holder creates a verifiable presentation of her SSN/TIN and any other government ID and sends it. Finally, the verifier examines the schema to determine the authenticity and validity of these documents. Specifically, the verifier checks the following.</p>  Is the credential in a format that’s acceptable for the verifier?  Does it contain the data that the verifier needs such as information that identifies the holder, the credibility of the issuer, and&nbsp;more?  Is the data still&nbsp;valid?  Are the credentials issued by a trusted&nbsp;issuer?  Do the credentials or its signature provide the cryptographic proof that the holder is the subject of this verifiable presentation?  <p>If the verifiable presentation sent by the holder meets these criteria, the verifier approves the application for account opening, and the holder can start transacting through&nbsp;it.</p><p>This sample workflow gives you a glimpse into the world of self-sovereign identity, where an entity has complete control over his or her credentials and can choose to share these secure and tamper-proof identities with the appropriate entities.</p><p>Does this enthuse you to create SSI applications that can change the face of our&nbsp;society?</p><p>Check out how <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api">Affinidi’s APIs</a> can help you get&nbsp;started.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/opening-a-bank-account-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-53ea478b5414">Opening a Bank Account — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Holochain Dev Pulse 93

<div class='wrap'>

<p>NOTE: Beginning this week, we’re trying something new with the Dev Pulse. We’re going to start publishing smaller pieces more regularly. We think this will make them both fresher and more digestible.</p><p>This week we rolled out an update to all HoloPorts. The most visible changes are in the UI of Elemental Chat, our demo app. Users now have ‘identicons’ beside their name; these auto-generated avatars are based on their actual agent ID in the Holochain network and can’t be forged. This is important because usernames are just labels; you can set yours to anything you like, even someone else’s name. If you’re talking to a friend and suddenly their identicon looks slightly different, there’s a good chance someone is trying to impersonate your friend.</p><p>This is an example of how cryptographically-secured data is a good first step to <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/is-holochain-a-safe-haven-for-dangerous-extremists-or-a-beacon-of-hope-for-accountability-fcbb8f5d38c6">ensuring authenticity and accountability</a> without the need for a central authority.</p><p>There are some under-the-hood changes to Elemental Chat as well. The network stats are calculated more accurately (you can see them by clicking that graph icon in the upper-right corner). And the real-time performance of chatting (using <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/concepts/9_signals/">signals</a>) has been tweaked to be more efficient; this should result in a small performance improvement.</p><p>Under the hood, the HoloPort’s operating system is using a new version of Holochain RSM. The reason this matters is that it prepares us for the next infrastructure milestone: hosted hApps! The speedups so far are modest, but we expect that other near-term updates will make Holochain substantially faster, fast enough to support thousands of users per app.</p><p>These future updates will include:</p>  A switch to a new storage engine based on <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>, the world’s <a href="https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most popular</a> database engine. I know, I know, last year we said we were switching to LMDB because it was the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-new-holochain-developer-release/#seen-in-dev-team-land-upcoming-initiatives">best</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/announcing-and-unpacking-the-new-holochain/#a-tighter-tech-stack">thing</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holofuel-enters-community-testing-phase/#how-far-have-we-come-so-far">ever</a>. And in comparable tests (hash table lookups) it does outperform SQLite. But we need more than just hash table lookups — we need fast querying with arbitrary filter parameters. This is especially important if we want to do <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">neighbourhood sharding</a> well. And sharding will lift the lid on scaling, allowing hApp networks to grow far beyond what traditional blockchains can reasonably handle.  The proxy server, which helps HoloPorts and Holochain users punch through home firewalls, is in the midst of a large rewrite. So far, benchmarks predict that it’ll be 5× faster for raw throughput, at the very least. Once this is deployed, it will enable us to see places where DHT gossip and validation performance need to be improved.  <p>For developers, all of the above means that Holo hosting is on its way. The <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/web-sdk/">Holo Web SDK</a> is being readied for public use as well, and we’re exploring the possibility of offering automated hApp testing services in a real hosting network on real HoloPorts.</p> Special note for hApp devs <p>The <code>develop</code> branch of Holochain has advanced quite a bit past <code>main</code> in the past month or two, bringing features like the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-tools-in-the-works/"><code>hc</code> dev tool and hApp bundles</a>. For that reason, I’m now recommending that you use <code>https://nightly.holochain.love</code> to install/enter the development shell. Also, take note that we might be changing installation URLs in the future, but we’ll always keep the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install">installation guide</a> up to date for you.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pawel_czerwinski?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Paweł Czerwiński</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/paint?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>I’d like to take a dive into the deep end and talk about the regulatory shift — no pun intended — that is happening today because Bitcoin has performed exactly as we expected. Institutions are now coming aboard. The momentum we see today is more justified than that of 2017’s, during the days of the ICOs. Today’s momentum is here to stay, and that’s exciting. That’s why there is a regulatory shift happening.</p><p>The ecosystem has started to understand the implications of the ongoing regulatory shift. That fact that crypto doesn’t fit into the regulatory box is the problem. Bitcoin doesn’t operate in the same context as traditional finance. The space must figure out how to merge these two, disparate worlds together and create a&nbsp;bridge.</p><p>There will be an intersection at which blockchain and traditional finance meet, and we’re at that Goldilocks moment now. In the children’s story, she tastes three different porridges and finds that she prefers the porridge which is neither too hot nor too cold, but just the right temperature. The question is, What is “just the right amount” of regulation when it comes to blockchain?</p><p>From 2010–2016, there was an impression given that the crypto ecosystem was untouchable, invincible, censorship resistance, and much more. The whole Honey Badger sentiment, which states that Bitcoin will progress no matter what had a few flaws. For one, Bitcoin doesn’t care what anyone thinks. Bitcoin itself is censorship resistant, but its users are not honey badgers, we are bound and influenced by the policies and regulations that shape the societies we live in, and if we don’t get that right, we as a society lose in our ability to utilize at scale what bitcoin and our industry fixes and&nbsp;enables.</p><p>I had a very deep conviction that the traditional world could make impactful and negative changes to our ecosystem, and influence the future of blockchain. In 2017, there were no early crypto OGs working on the regulatory challenge, ensuring it progresses the right&nbsp;way.</p><p>Over the next several years, the ecosystem continued to grow, causing the regulatory landscape too swiftly become the main battleground for blockchain. We must work with international organizations to educate them and drive the ecosystem into the&nbsp;light.</p><p>While lobbying on behalf of the industry, I began in 2016 to look at the problem from a technical perspective. I saw the demand for a blockchain identity infrastructure which preserves openness, decentralization, and the privacy of individuals, and began work thereupon.</p><p>This work comes with tradeoffs. For instance, full anonymization and privacy of money is a big ask in a world that combats terrorist financing. Whether you like Know Your Customer (KYC) or not, it is a function of how institutions operate, just like they must adhere to securities law, international taxation, and so on. Since KYC is a critical requirement when it comes to open payment systems, you can imagine how the regulations would&nbsp;evolve.</p><p>However, our ecosystem doesn’t work the way to which they are accustomed. Their traditional approach to regulation will transform the ecosystem into something barely recognizable. We can avoid that, however, it’s a battle with lots of complexity. There’s plenty to overcome. The challenge requires collaboration amongst the blockchain industry.</p><p>Tackling the problem isn’t as attractive as DeFi or NFTs, but this battle has the potential to empower the space to move forward. We need open infrastructure and tools that support the ecosystem and the cointegration.</p><p>Written By Joseph Weinberg, Co-Founder, Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>About Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>Shyft Network is a public protocol designed to aggregate and embed trust, validation and discoverability into data stored on public and private ecosystems, and facilitate information transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks.

   Calls for interoperability began almost as soon as the second blockchain framework was built. Today there are permissioned blockchains (like The Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric) which are preferred for many enterprises solutions, public blockchains for cryptocurrencies, and emerging blockchain identity frameworks that hold great promise for streamlining transactions in nearly every industry.

<p>The HYPR Spring Release (6.10) brings exciting new features and enhancements for a stable, secure, and simple passwordless experience. From improving the user experience to adding security features that’ll make compliance auditors smile, the HYPR Spring Release creates a clear and safe path to passwordless security.</p>
      
<p>Addressing Security &amp; Compliance</p>
      
<p>HYPR strives to ensure the most secure passwordless experience without disrupting the user experience. HYPR is a favorite of end-users because they’re able to employ their own smartphones to authenticate. This may give administrators pause, however, as admins have little to no control over the devices themselves.</p>
      
<p>To keep up with internal and external compliance regulations that our customers face, with our spring release HYPR has introduced admin-defined mobile version control to establish a minimum OS and HYPR mobile app version requirement that extends to the entire user base.</p>
      
 Enforce minimum OS requirements to maintain the latest security updates. 
      
<p>With these rules in place, users cannot pair devices or authenticate into protected resources without updating their device to the required version. To make the rollout process easy, administrators can define an authentication warning period during which users are still able to authenticate successfully, but are prompted to update their device or mobile application to avoid being blocked in the future.</p>
      
<p>HYPR has always had rules in place to prevent jailbroken devices being used for authentication. Jailbroken devices are prevented from running the HYPR mobile app as well as the HYPR mobile SDK. To further enhance security, our spring release brings additional enhancements to keep the solution up to date and secure. </p>
      
<p>Updated User Login Flows</p>
      
<p>When logging into web resources with HYPR, only devices that the user paired appear as an authentication option, making it easier to know which method to authenticate with. If the user has only one type of device paired, then HYPR automatically sends the request, reducing the required clicks during the flow.</p>
      
<p>In addition to a smoother web login experience, RDP users can now authenticate in a single step. By shifting more of the login control from Microsoft to HYPR, users are not burdened with unnecessary process points and are no longer wasting time in the login operation.</p>
      
<p>Finally, Mac users can rejoice as HYPR enables the use of Touch ID to unlock their Mac workstation. Touch ID is a FIDO-certified authentication method that employs the security of the platform biometrics to validate a user’s identity in lieu of a password. Combining this with HYPR unlock, all users can log into their computers with FIDO authentication with the methods that works best for them.</p>
      
<p>The Takeaway</p>
      
<p>HYPR continues to improve the user experience for end users as well as administrators who rely on ease of deployment and upgrade. Every second counts in performance and it is our goal to deliver lightning-fast experience at every HYPR touch point.</p>

<p>Munich, 2 April 2021 – The decision of Bundesnetzagentur to allow AI (artificial intelligence) based identification methods for new use cases in Germany is a confirmation of IDnow’s platform strategy and at the same time a turning point in international competition for German technology companies.</p>
<p>With the publication “Video identification with automated procedure” for automated optical identity verification by Bundesnetzagentur in cooperation with the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), AI-based solutions for the verification of customers are now approved for certain use cases in Germany in addition to the proven methods. <a href="https://www.elektronische-vertrauensdienste.de/cln_111/EVD/DE/Fachkreis/ModulBest/ModulBest-start.html">(Order here.)</a></p>
<p>The published order is based on the German Trust Services Act, which implements the eIDAS Regulation in Germany. The catalogue of criteria published by Bundesnetzagentur and BSI prescribes high technology standards for automated identity verification. IDnow is one of the few European providers that has already been officially confirmed with other methods by Bundesnetzagentur within the scope of an accredited conformity assessment and is now also already working on the confirmation for AutoIdent.</p>
<p>IDnow has been using automated identification technology for many years. With its product IDnow AutoIdent, IDnow is one of the leading providers for automated identification in Germany. As early as 2012, IDnow filed a patent application for fully automated identification procedures, which has been granted by the European Patent Office. “We are pleased that the regulatory authorities have now finally opened up to technological development in Germany and we see our efforts and years of research into the development of our own AI technology confirmed,” says Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of IDnow. In addition to this patent, IDnow holds other patents and patent applications at the European level.</p>
<p>IDnow’s technology uses so-called Deep Learning to perform an identification at the same security level as a personal identification – for example in a branch. For this purpose, the self-developed artificial intelligence, automatically recognises the security features of the ID documents in a video stream and performs a biometric face comparison of a video selfie with the ID document. This is complemented by new security mechanisms such as a “liveness detection” that prevents attacks through recorded videos and photos.</p>
<p>IDnow sees the regulator’s decision as an important step towards a digital society in Germany and as a fundamental turning point for German companies in international market comparison. The established and very successful services such as the electronic ID card, BankIdent or the VideoIdent procedure can now be supplemented with AI-based AutoIdent methods for new use cases. IDnow expects a significant change for German consumers: The new decree will make innovative technologies such as digital identities accessible to the broad population in the future – regardless of the individual citizen’s affinity for technology. This is because the new regulation enables platform companies such as IDnow to offer the appropriate digital methods for identity verification in each case.</p>
<p>“The decision of Bundesnetzagentur is an important milestone for platform companies like IDnow. In the future, IDnow, as one of the leading European platform providers, will be able to offer additional, automated identification methods to numerous other industries in Europe. This is an essential step towards a digital future in Germany and for Europe and shows that the time for secure digital identities has come,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow. “Consumer security is always at the forefront of the development of our procedures. For many years, we have therefore been actively working with various organisations in politics and regulation to jointly shape this secure, European future,” he adds.</p>
<p>IDnow is one of the leading providers of digital identities with a broad portfolio of products and solutions and identifies several million citizens per year with its platform. The portfolio includes identification methods from offline to online, from automated methods to procedures carried out by identity specialists, available flexibly online, offline in branches and even by a courier at the user’s doorstep. IDnow has expanded its role in recent years far beyond simply offering individual ident methods and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year.</p>
<p>Just last month, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers for on- and offline verification. This is the second acquisition in the last six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe. The acquisition of identity Trust Management AG enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Germany and beyond.</p>

<p>Rewind and replay! Each week, State of Identity host Cameron D’Ambrosi is joined with experts across the identity landscape and enterprises alike to unpack the latest trends, hottest topics, and things you need to know – and this past month was no exception.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March, we hosted identity experts at the helm of Parallel Markets, Teramind, Mastercard, and DueDil for discussions on:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The creation and rollout of a truly portable digital identity 
 Leveraging employee data while balancing privacy at home 
 The impacts of the pandemic-induced digital shift one year later&nbsp; 
 The power KYB solutions can have on retaining customers&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Parallel Markets: Financial Onboarding for Individuals and Businesses 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tony Peccatiello, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Parallel Markets, joins the State of Identity podcast to unpack the difficulties in doing KYC and AML for businesses. He shares how his organization is taking a “come for the tools, stay for the network” approach to building and bringing a truly portable digital identity to the market – simultaneously attacking the complicated issue of accreditation and KYB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/podcast/parallel-markets/">Listen Now</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Teramind: Balancing Compliance &amp; Culture 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the world welcomes remote work as the new standard for many jobs, how can companies manage their workforce while providing workers with privacy at home?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this episode, Eli Sutton, VP of Global Operations at Teramind Inc., joins OWI to discuss the balance of compliance and culture in a “new normal” and how employers can and should leverage the data they receive from employee monitoring and project management tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/podcast/teramind/">Listen Now</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/podcast/mastercard-2/">Listen Now</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 DueDil: Understanding True Business Identity 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can a deeper understanding of customers and UBOs do for risk, compliance, and growth potential?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To unpack this, Justin Fitzpatrick, Co-founder and CEO of DueDil, joins us to explore how the past year accelerated the need for digitization in financial services, why it’s now more challenging than ever to attract and retain customers, and how KYB and identity solutions can keep them.</p>

 Accessing Medical Records Anywhere — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials <p>If there’s one thing we’ve learned from this COVID pandemic, it’s the importance of good health and the need to stay on top of our medical records at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>Whether it’s our vaccinations, prescriptions, medical tests, conditions, or even a history of doctor visits, keeping this information readily accessible has become imperative now than ever&nbsp;before.</p><p>At the same time, this is easier said than done as our medical records are all over the place (literally!). You’ll know this pain if you’ve moved from one state/country to another in the last few years because the medical records are stored only in the institution or physician’s office where it is generated. Though these are done partly to preserve privacy, transferring or giving access to these records is a whole different story altogether!</p><p>But all this can change with Verifiable Credentials and Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI).</p><p>For starters, verifiable credentials are a secure and accessible way to share your medical records with whomever you want. You can read more about verifiable credentials and how they work in this&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/affinidi/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">post</a>.</p><p>So, how do VCs work? How can you keep all your records in one place and share them within seconds to just those you&nbsp;want?</p><p>Let’s understand with a possible real-life scenario.</p><p>Lisa is on a business trip to London, and she suddenly feels dizzy and nauseous. The same night, she develops a high fever and decides to visit a nearby clinic. Now, the doctor suspects it to be a case of food poisoning and wants to know her medical history and pre-existing conditions before prescribing a medicine.</p><p>To give this information, Lisa simply logs into her wallet, creates a verifiable presentation of the medical records that the doctor wants, and shares it with the doctor. After looking at the records, the doctor finds that she is allergic to sulfide and prescribes a mild dose of antibiotics.</p><p>Soon, Lisa gets well and is back to&nbsp;work!</p><p>Sounds simple and quick, right? What went on in the background that made it so easy for Lisa to share her medical records within&nbsp;seconds?</p><p>That’s the magic of VCs, and here’s how it&nbsp;works.</p><p>As with all VCs, three parties are involved and they&nbsp;are:</p><p>Issuer — Lisa’s primary care physician’s office</p><p>Holder — Lisa</p><p>Verifier — The doctor’s clinic in&nbsp;London</p><p>As a first step, Lisa logs into her doctor’s clinic and submits a request for VC. The primary care physician’s office checks Lisa’s immunization status and her history of allergies, and accordingly, issues the verifiable credentials in the form of a QR code with the results of those checks. Lisa scans this code and saves it in her&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Next, she receives a Credential Share Request from the doctor’s clinic in London and approves it to share a Verifiable Presentation containing her medical history to the doctor’s office in London. The receptionist at the office logs into the admin account, verifies the credentials, and notifies the doctor of allergies and pre-existing conditions. That’s it,&nbsp;really!</p><p>If you notice, this workflow doesn’t involve any third-party to store your medical data and this also means no worry about medical data storage policies and the laws associated with it. The holder completely owns his or her medical data and stores it exclusively in his or her digital wallet, thereby making it secure and hassle-free.</p><p>Also, these VCs are secure, tamper-proof, and authentic information that can be quickly shared with anyone you want. Such streamlined access is sure to transform the way we create and handle our Personally Identifiable Information. And undoubtedly, it’s our&nbsp;future!</p><p>Are you ready for&nbsp;it?</p><p>We are!</p><p>We’ve built a bunch of APIs you can leverage to create such applications.</p><p>In the meantime, you can also check out our <a href="https://affinidipocathon.devpost.com/">PoCathon</a> to build Proof of Concepts using Affinidi’s resources and get a feel of the endless possibilities that our APIs&nbsp;offer.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/accessing-medical-records-anywhere-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-81a248f9b746">Accessing Medical Records Anywhere — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

To overcome the systemic constraints on the potential impact of retrofit, a fundamental shift in the system is required. [For more on this, see <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">The System Challenges to Retrofit]</a></p><p>We believe this systemic shift can be achieved by testing strategic interventions in the ‘dark matter’ of the retrofit ecosystem: through piloting and proving out new infrastructures, new standards, new legal patterns, or new institutions. Our ‘dark matter’ experiments and propositions will be oriented around these key principles which we believe will begin to deliver a sustainable, socially-just future.</p> 01 — Collective and democratic <p>The individualisation of responsibility over retrofit continues to frame retrofit solutions with individualised approaches. [For more, see this section of <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3#3883">The System Challenges of Retrofit</a>] Instead, when a whole street is considered as the subject of retrofit, the ambition of retrofit is a scale of magnitude beyond the sum of individual households, by considering not just these private spaces themselves, but in combination with the public spaces in which they coexist. The ambition of collective retrofit could include public realm, green mobility, and community amenities; these are necessary in a climate transition that includes all of the built environment. As a minimum unit of organisation, a street-wide community provides a critical mass to test systemic changes that reshape the retrofit market and the wider ecosystem, such as exploring new models of collective financing that remove cost burdens from the individual. The street as a unit of organisation is also a familiar, natural scale for deliberative decision-making as a community.</p> 02 — Performance-oriented <p>The justification for retrofit is still viewed primarily through its ability to deliver decarbonisation, yet retrofit’s ecosystem is rarely structured around its actual performance in doing so, relying on theoretical and indirect measures. In restructuring incentives around measured performance, the dynamics of the system will not only shift in favour of better performing retrofit, but have wide-ranging systemic impacts — from providing the upstream impetus for improving skills, tools, and services to deliver on this demand for performance, to broadening the definition of what makes a high-performing retrofit project by analysing and accounting for its full range of co-benefits. We think that with this new knowledge infrastructure, built on data from IoT, sensor technology, and automation using smart contracts, the definition of ‘performance’ can evolve from energy use into a more holistic and precise resident-oriented metric such as ‘comfort’ instead, and be built right into the incentives of contracting for retrofit work. [For more on how performance-based incentives can shift the retrofit system, see this section of <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3#e1bb">The System Challenges to Retrofit</a>]</p> 03 — Empower the&nbsp;local <p>Moving from being “done to” their communities, to being “done with” them, a future retrofit ecosystem must empower residents to be in the driving seat of their community’s climate transition. Building their trust, agency and capability is fundamental to have enough community buy-in for its long-term success, and to ensure a democratised transition. This also means challenging the false economies of delocalised, value-extracting approaches. Instead, leveraging local supply chains, local skills, and local networks of knowledge and trust ensure that retrofit is not just about short-term investment in emissions reductions, but also long-term investment in community wealth and resilience. This emphasis on the local also means moving away from assumptions of one-size-fits-all retrofit service models, instead moving to modular, adaptive models that may be built on wider systemic learnings, but tailored to the specificities of the local context. [For more on our research on local retrofit models, see this section of <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3#d64d">The System Challenges to Retrofit</a>]</p> 04 — Built on open knowledge <p>Knowledge and data around retrofit drives better decision-making, yet data gaps exist in the ecosystem for many stakeholders, from residents, to suppliers and municipal governments. Building this open knowledge infrastructure serves as an evidence-base for new infrastructures, new standards, new legal patterns, or new institutions, and each future retrofit project has the potential to become a longitudinal study, offering a wealth of data into the comprehensive impact of deep community retrofit. This knowledge infrastructure must be in place to harness the future utility of these insights. Building this open knowledge infrastructure for the long term ensures that innovation capability in the retrofit ecosystem is not exclusive to proprietary services and governments, but too is democratised. [For more on our research on why this knowledge infrastructure is critical, see this section of <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3#e1bb">The System Challenges to Retrofit</a>]</p> Future retrofit starts now: testing and demonstrating <p>These principles need to be translated from ‘thinking’ into ‘doing’. The work of Dark Matter Labs is currently scoping and investing in strategic experiments to make this future retrofit ecosystem a reality. These ‘system demonstrators’ consist of what we believe to be the minimum viable propositions to prove out a systems change, based on the dynamics of the system we’ve mapped out so far, and in line with the principles we believe are necessary for a democratised climate transition.</p><p>It is important to note that these propositions and demonstrators are part of an ongoing iterative process: as our learning evolves from sketch to prototype, concept to context, so too will the nature of these propositions. Based on our work so far, we believe there are some interesting lines of enquiry that&nbsp;include;</p>  Service journey for community retrofit<br>Can we redesign the citizen experience of retrofit for a community at the scale of a street or block to maximise the potential of its ‘beyond the individual’ approach? By building and ensuring processes to empower the community’s democratic, and deliberative, decision-making capability, can this collective approach form the critical mass needed to reshape the wider ecosystem, such as broadening the range of financing and reinvigorating local supply&nbsp;chains?  Data platform<br>Can we lay the foundations for retrofit’s knowledge infrastructure, and design an open platform that presents relevant insights to stakeholders across the retrofit ecosystem for holistic, data-informed decision-making, at all stages of the service journey? Can this foundation include a protocol to capture the potential insights from future retrofit projects to help grow this knowledge infrastructure?  Smart comfort contracts<br>Can we structure contracts so that their incentives are not based solely on completing agreed retrofit work, or relative energy savings, but instead contract around broader definitions of performance, such as comfort?. Can potential beneficiaries of retrofit outcomes extend beyond the residents? Might these standards be co-created with the communities who will use them, and might they be structured with financing to overcome high upfront costs and tenure barriers?  <p>These interventions aim to target fundamental and interconnected leverage points in the retrofit ecosystem, with propositions that we think could shift the underlying dynamics, rebalance incentives, and empower actors. In the next phase of this work, our ambition will be to build and test these interventions in-situ with the residents of these retrofitted homes, to ensure these interventions create cascading, multiplied impacts and prioritise deep, comprehensive retrofit through systemic changes that are sustainable in the long-term.</p><p>Over the next few months, Dark Matter Labs will be pursuing these and other lines of enquiry, applying future retrofit principles in real places to test propositions with system-shifting potential. We believe that the system not only needs to change to deliver wider adoption of deeper retrofit, but these changes must ensure that the climate transition of the built environment is democratised, equitable, and just. We will begin building this collective, democratic vision of retrofitting, and also rebuilding trust in the systems of how our built environment is made and remade. As our testing progresses, we will be updating blogs in this series with a deeper look into some of the prototypes/propositions that are emerging.</p><p>To outline our work on reimagining retrofit, we have curated our thinking from the last 9 months into a <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">series of blogs</a> which form the basis for ongoing&nbsp;work.</p><p>These blogs&nbsp;examine</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">Retrofit &amp; ‘Building Back&nbsp;Better’</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">The System Challenges to&nbsp;Retrofit</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">Scaling the Right to Retrofit</a> (this&nbsp;blog)  <p>You can find the full series&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">here</a>.</p><p>This blog and its visuals has been co-authored by <a href="https://medium.com/u/1c295ef66c9c">Calvin Po</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/u/f7fc325b2eeb">Ariane Porter</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/ee5c7ea1d010">Jack Minchella</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">Scaling the Right to Retrofit</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">A Right to Retrofit</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

It is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">‘A Right to Retrofit’</a> series, and you can read all other related blogs by following the links at the bottom of the&nbsp;page.</p><p>Over the past nine months Dark Matter Labs has been working with <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/">EIT Climate-KIC</a> and partners in cities across Europe to understand the retrofit ‘ecosystem’, and how it can be reformed to meet the urgent need for climate transition in the built environment.</p><p>In each of the local contexts, alongside our partners <a href="https://www.polimi.it/">Polmi</a> and <a href="http://www.poliedra.polimi.it/en/homepage/">Poliedra</a> in Milan, <a href="http://regea.org/en/">REGEA</a> in Zagreb, <a href="https://jibe.company/">Jibe</a> in Sofia and the <a href="https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/">City of Edinburgh Council</a>, we identified factors across different parts of the retrofit system leading to barriers to retrofitting.</p><p>Through this work we’ve come to understand that retrofit, its uptake and impact, must go deeper than its market dynamics alone, or we risk continuing to overly rely on supply and demand-side levers (such as one-off training schemes and homeowner grants). Retrofit and its market exists in a wider context where factors from across the stack, from institutional infrastructure to community dynamics, have complex interrelationships. To develop a system-oriented understanding of retrofit and its problems, retrofit must be considered as part of an entire ‘ecosystem’.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/The-Multiple-Benefits-of-Deep-Retrofits-A-toolkit-for-cities?language=en_US#:~:text=Deep%20retrofits%20provide%20city%20governments,educational%20attainment%20of%20urban%20residents.)">C40 Cities</a>’ framework and energy<a href="https://municipalpower.org/articles/energy-efficiency-key-findings-from-mpower-exchange/"> municipal learning exchanges</a>, we see emerging consensus in the retrofit field that home retrofit has intrinsic, multiple benefits, beyond just improvements of energy efficiency and emissions reductions. This work recognises that retrofitting has potential positive impacts across health and well-being, fuel poverty and inequality, local economic recovery, job creation, and community resilience, because retrofit exists not in isolation, but sits across strategic intersections of multiple&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The diagram below is a summary of common factors that were found over the course of working across many contexts, where problems that on the surface appear simple (such as lack of cash, lack of awareness, and lack of suppliers) in fact have complex, interlinked causes. These are represented as ‘causal loops’ or vicious cycles, where the identified factors mutually reinforce one another, and all eventually lead to the symptoms of low retrofit uptake rates, lack of deep, comprehensive retrofit approaches, and ultimately, contribute to the exacerbation of the climate crisis. The factors that are connected to many others begin to indicate strategic areas and leverage points for interventions in the system, with potential, multipliable impacts.</p>A system map of retrofit ecosystem — <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C7WjclTqHCP4OBSaDpbFSQQs86kjwv30/view?usp=sharing">original file&nbsp;here</a>. 01 — Individualised Responsibility and&nbsp;Risk <p>Pre-21st century institutions are designed around individual interests and responsibilities, but in the face of an unprecedented collective climate crisis, these institutions are being stretched to their&nbsp;limits.</p><p>Retrofit, in attempting to deliver a collective climate transition of our built environment, still operates within the primarily individualised institution of property. Common across almost all the contexts we worked in, the onus to pay for retrofit work remains by default with the individual property owner, with the risks of high energy costs, maintenance costs, and substandard housing conditions borne by the individual. An owner’s inability to pay the high upfront costs required, and the lack of available financing, becomes a barrier to retrofit with cascading consequences. As a result, credit/cash-poor households, who may benefit most urgently from energy and cost savings, are often excluded, exacerbating a vicious cycle of fuel poverty and inequalities, despite the solid long-term investment case of retrofit.</p><p>Efforts to mitigate this so far still operate within the framework of individual responsibility: governments and local authorities continue to subsidise individual homeowners with one-off grants for individual interventions. This funding is prescriptive and bureaucratic for the homeowner to access, and often require onerous supplier accreditation. The UK’s Green Homes Grants are a perfect example of this: not only were there delays in payments and a distinct lack of suppliers to do the work (<a href="https://www.housingtoday.co.uk/news/government-to-claw-back-unspent-green-homes-grant-funding/5110362.article">leaving 95% of the funding set aside by the Treasury unspent</a>), that which was spent found its way to construction firms currently<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/grenfell-firms-share-in-2bn-green-grants-p6dlc6vr5"> under criminal investigation</a> for the Grenfell tragedy. Grant schemes like these tend to concentrate on the ‘easy wins’ by limiting eligibility to<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-green-homes-grant-scheme#what-the-voucher-can-be-used-for"> certain types of intervention</a>, and lend the weight of government authority to mainly conservative, piecemeal approaches, rather than deep, comprehensive retrofit.</p><p>In the long term, this has been shown to be <a href="http://urbed.coop/sites/default/files/2016%20URBED%20Tyndall%20The%20Retrofit%20factfile%20-%20facts%20and%20publications.pdf">insufficient in reducing</a> energy usage and emissions, and within <a href="https://www.green-alliance.org.uk/resources/reinventing_retrofit.pdf">30 years</a> time, will require further retrofit. The knock-on consequences of this funding barrier is that with retrofit’s limited demand, contractors have little incentive to invest in training or developing dedicated retrofit services, so work is completed with conventional construction methods with little guarantee of performance, and in turn, worsening the perception of retrofit, becoming a cascading risk.</p><p>When retrofit approaches operate under the assumption that responsibility lies with the individual property owner, it ignores the more complex reality that property interests are relational and hierarchical. The only situation where such an individualised approach is even remotely appropriate is the owner-occupied detached home. For anything else, these hierarchies can be the relationship between landlord and tenant, between owners in a block, or between freeholder and leaseholders. Each of these stakeholders may have different incentives and different agencies to act on them, and when these coexist within a single building and are misaligned, the barriers to retrofit are multiplied.</p><p>This may be as obvious as tenants who pay their own energy bills having the incentives to retrofit but being dependent on their landlord to commission retrofit work. In the urban contexts we worked in last year, such as Milan, Zagreb, and Edinburgh, homes were predominantly in blocks of flats. Multiple parties sharing the same building fabric and maintenance costs means commissioning retrofit work comes with an added dimension of complexity. There is a need to enable trust and consensus-building across the community to proceed, subject to property laws and governance of shared buildings that vary by context. More often than not, these governance structures are still built around dividing collective responsibilities (and costs) to individual owners (in the words of a partner in Zagreb, “deciding who can sue whom”). The inability of some residents in a shared building to afford retrofit work may lead to those residents pressured to sell and move out in an<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-2427.12634"> ecological gentrifying phenomenon of ‘renoviction’</a>, or limit the comprehensiveness of retrofit, or even hinder a retrofit project altogether.</p><p>For example, from our work with City of Edinburgh Council, while the council has set ambitious decarbonisation targets with council-funded retrofit used as a means to achieve this, the privatisation of individual council flats has created mixed-tenure blocks with private owners who may not be able or willing to invest in retrofit. The buildings considered viable for the council’s retrofit programme end up being limited to those where the council itself owns all units. The barrier of a resident’s ability to fund upfront, along with limits on how public investment can be used in mixed-tenure buildings, calls for an alternative tenure-independent model with long-term collective financing that can overcome the affordability and accessibility barriers to retrofitting and to high-standard housing.</p><p>This individualisation of responsibility does not just concern money, but also time and knowledge — the complex and inconsistent retrofit landscape of contractors and products, requires the individual homeowner to invest time in research, with little experience or expertise to guide them. While the retrofit ecosystem could benefit from a more established knowledge infrastructure, approaching retrofit collectively rather than individually could allow this burden to be shared. A well designed collective approach could create enough aggregated demand for new models to be viable, such as dedicated, resident-oriented retrofit services providing beginning-to-end guidance throughout the retrofit&nbsp;journey.</p><p>In our work in Milan, where the condominiums, apartment blocks or collection of homes are often managed and maintained by a Building Manager. When redesigning the end-user journey of retrofit around a collective approach, we could leverage the Building Manager’s unique existing community relationship to engage and guide residents through the retrofit process, instead of relying on the efforts of motivated individual owners. By working within governance structures that communities already know, trust and rely upon, the perceived complexity and misaligned incentives that discourage residents from embarking on retrofit projects can be overcome as a community.</p> 02 — Knowledge, performance and&nbsp;trust <p>Retrofitting homes is understandably perceived by residents to be a risky activity. These risks are often not intrinsic to the retrofitting process, but are perceptual. As experienced by one of our municipal partners, these perceptual risks can act as barriers to retrofitting for households who can afford retrofit costs and, at least in theory, should be the “low-hanging fruit” and obvious targets for boosting retrofit uptake. The crucial missing piece is the knowledge infrastructure around retrofit, where the accessibility of accurate information, in particular data on retrofit performance, can mitigate these concerns. For a resident, the perceived risks of retrofit, namely the large investment and the temporary disruption to their home, are balanced out when they can be sure that their retrofit project and its use of new energy technologies is built on a performance track record, and will deliver promised results. This knowledge infrastructure around performance, both as an evidence base and a metric for successful retrofit completion, is critical in transforming the reliance on ‘faith’ in retrofit into genuine&nbsp;trust.</p><p>EU-wide schemes such as Energy Performance Certificates are attempts to implement a knowledge infrastructure around building performance and retrofit, under the economic rationale of “de-risking” and creating a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A52016SC0408#">“market signal for efficient buildings”</a>. However, the implementation of EPC’s have been <a href="https://epbd-ca.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CA-EPBD-CT3-Certification_Control-system_Quality-2018.pdf">inconsistent across member states</a>, and the fact that EPCs rely on <a href="https://www.cibsejournal.com/technical/completing-the-picture-london-energy-map/">modelled or indirectly measured energy performance</a> and lack open access to its data in some countries limits its utility in progressing the knowledge infrastructure around built environment transition. Worse, when EPCs are used as the only performance metric, they could end up incentivising <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117301569?casa_token=vqWfKcyCj4AAAAAA:dPIUTP1uyKgsb8XkSHRgVQVTmi8uTWVA06cpRa3xjp9qJSGYNGE8rJApM6uA8fMaqHrQHImyIPC1#s0050">inappropriate or ineffective</a> retrofit interventions due to their pro forma approach. While long-term financing based on achieved performance outcomes are used in energy performance contracting provided by ESCOs (Energy Service Companies), where energy savings are used to finance the retrofit cost, these models are inevitably based on the few available sources of performance data, primarily metered energy use, and leave the other benefits of retrofit unaccounted for, reinforcing only the energy and emissions-related understandings of retrofitting performance instead of incentivising a comprehensive, deep approach with multiple benefits.</p><p>Knowledge infrastructure is also crucial for the planning of retrofit works: for a local authority or retrofit service provider, data on the neighbourhood can scope out potential retrofit sites that can deliver maximum impact, and support a targeted resident engagement strategy or leverage a local skilled labour force. This data picture not only can survey the condition of neighbourhoods’ built environment and its energy performance, but can be broadened to include its demography, its social, economic and environmental conditions, and embed in the planning process a fuller range of impacts in assessing a retrofit project’s cost-benefit balance, and identify stakeholders and potential beneficiaries beyond the residents themselves.</p><p>From our work in Zagreb, state funding allocated after the March 2020 earthquake primarily for reconstructing homes to a safe standard also provided a unique opportunity to initiate a neighbourhood-scale climate transition, by simultaneously retrofitting those homes and minimising overall disruption. As part of developing the knowledge infrastructure around retrofit, we conducted a data study using a combination of earthquake damage data, census and open datasets in a prototype of a mapping tool that could identify building typology, indicators of fuel poverty, potential for nature-based solutions and public realm interventions, and even public attitudes based on social media&nbsp;data.</p><p>When holistic knowledge of the city is built into the retrofit process, such as in a open mapping platform, neighbourhoods can be targeted for engagement that fit a comprehensive balance of factors, and begin building a portfolio of retrofit sites where returns are not just considered in terms of energy savings per capital expenditure, but maximising impacts across a broad range of environmental, socioeconomic factors</p> 03 — Supply-side cycles <p>One of the key causal loops is that the low demand for retrofit, caused by a myriad barriers including those above, leads to a relatively <a href="https://www.theiet.org/media/5276/retrofit.pdf">underdeveloped supply side of the retrofit market</a>, with <a href="https://www.theiet.org/media/5276/retrofit.pdf">few dedicated retrofit service providers</a>, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/8/12/174">relying on traditional contractors or installers of individual products</a>. This lack of competition to deliver on performance (which impacts quality of construction, timeliness of completion, the appropriate specification of products, in addition to actual achieved energy use and emissions) in turn reinforces lower uptake. As a result of these supply-side barriers, many existing retrofitting services, such as <a href="https://energiesprong.org/">Energiesprong</a>, have adopted centralised industrial supply models based on standardised design, procurement and funding, to target neighbourhoods as ‘critical masses’ for viable community retrofit.</p><p>Standardised approaches are often justified by an assumption of the economies of scale, that they afford greater speed in reaching the scale of renovation and energy efficiency measures needed. This model is used by many local authorities or housing associations to retrofit their own stock, for example Edward Wood Estate, Fulham and New Barracks Estate, Salford. However, these large-scale initiatives mean that the resulting innovation, knowledge and economic growth is centralised and delocalised, reducing the opportunity for alternative services to develop and compete. These centralised models can deliver fast results; companies like Energiesprong have developed off site manufacturing methods that allow for quick turn over by designing and completing prefabricated panels that are brought to site and constructed within 14 days; this speed makes centralised approaches an attractive route with looming legal decarbonisation targets.</p><p>However, the concern is that the speed of a centralised industrial supply model comes at the cost of agency of the local community over the deliberation and consensus-building processes of retrofit, with residents encouraged to accept proposals adapted from their standard approaches. Emerging alternatives, such as <a href="https://carbon.coop/">Carbon Co-op</a>, are developing models that rely on networks of practice which bias existing networks of knowledge, skill and delivery within a neighbourhood to develop local and collective responses to the challenge of retrofit. In the case of Carbon Co-op, a local team is employed to coordinate households requiring renovation, and understand the needs of the demand through detailed sessions with residents. The same team manages various specialist contractors, organising actors to collaborate and build a ‘critical mass’ both supply and demand-side for local retrofit. For a climate transition that is just and democratised, as much agency as possible should be devolved to the level of the community. This is not simply just a desirable principle, but it also builds a solid foundation for ambitious retrofit with a broad and deep scope through a process of co-design and trust-building.</p><p>One of the effects of the centralising tendencies of some service models is that by leveraging centralised, large suppliers, it removes the impetus to retrain and up-skill the local workforce. The benefits of retrofit are economic as much as environmental, with spending on retrofit projects having the potential to create demand for <a href="https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/Green-stimulus-for-housing_NEF.pdf">515,157 new jobs between 2020–2024</a> just within the UK. In contexts such as our work in Zagreb, there have been mostly publicly-funded training and accreditation schemes to up-skill trades with construction skills for low-energy buildings and energy efficiency renovation, such as <a href="https://croskills.hr/en/">CroSkills</a> and <a href="http://www.fit-to-nzeb.com/croatia.html">other programmes</a>. However, these training schemes tend to only be funded on a one-off basis, and the accreditation is not widely adopted by the industry and the wider market, without mandatory licensing or public recognition of their value. These training programmes are therefore often not sustained as they operate in isolation without creating the demand for these improved skills. When training is implemented alongside a service model that draws on local suppliers, and contractual incentives for retrofit are based on delivered performance, these system reforms can sustain up-skilling in the long-term as a critical part of climate transition.</p><p>To outline our work on reimagining retrofit, we have curated our thinking from the last 9 months into a <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">series of blogs</a> which form the basis for ongoing&nbsp;work.</p><p>These blogs&nbsp;examine</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">Retrofit &amp; ‘Building Back&nbsp;Better’</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">The System Challenges to Retrofit</a> (this&nbsp;blog)  <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">Scaling the Right to&nbsp;Retrofit</a>  <p>You can find the full series&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">here</a>.</p><p>This blog and its visuals has been co-authored by <a href="https://medium.com/u/1c295ef66c9c">Calvin Po</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/u/f7fc325b2eeb">Ariane Porter</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/ee5c7ea1d010">Jack Minchella</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">The System Challenges to Retrofit</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">A Right to Retrofit</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

If ‘getting back to normal’ is an illusion, and any ‘new normal’ is ladened with the same vested interests and structural injustices as before, then the promise of ‘building back better’ should also be finding ways of rebuilding the trust that such a just and sustainable future is possible.</p><p>One area of convergence that holds promise is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf668430-fee8-45d4-982c-4b2996186879">retrofitting</a>.</p><p>Taken at face value, retrofitting is the process of upgrading our homes to be more energy efficient, but viewed through a much wider lens, retrofitting is the conscious adaptation our streets and neighbourhoods to become a more <a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/interactive-digital-projects/gnd-glasgow/sectional-view">sustainable and equitable platform</a> for our everyday lives. It is this broadened idea of retrofitting that can serve as a transition strategy for society to recover and&nbsp;rebuild.</p><p>Over the course of the last nine months Dark Matter Labs have been working with partners across Europe to understand how this wider remit of retrofitting, and the systems that support it, can form a vehicle for a post-COVID recovery, and act as a transition model to a 21st century&nbsp;economy.</p> Retrofitting. Where to&nbsp;begin? <p>Building on the work of other organisations, we now understand retrofit’s <a href="https://theiet.org/media/5276/retrofit.pdf">need</a> and <a href="https://www.passivhaustrust.org.uk/competitions_and_campaigns/passivhaus-retrofit/">scale</a>, why we should <a href="https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/Green-stimulus-for-housing_NEF.pdf">fund it</a>, and some great ideas about <a href="https://cc-site-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/07/3.-PeoplePoweredRetrofit-Report.pdf">localising how it can be done</a>. All of them agree on one thing…retrofitting is difficult. This is partly because it’s riddled with complexity (needing to draw on many expertise, skills, and networks) and partly because it’s unpredictable and costly (no two homes are the same). But beyond these technical and logistical hurdles, retrofitting seeks to address a much more complex crisis — the crisis of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Like so many of the crises that define our current economy, a big part of this crisis of trust has its roots in our broken housing system. This is a sector defined by and designed for a carbon age: <a href="https://www.velux.com/indoorgeneration/indoor-generation-facts-and-figures">cramped, expensive, unhealthy homes</a>; <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/futurelondon/air-we-breathe-tackling-hidden-dangers-pollution-inside-home-b925797.html">chronic air pollution</a>; streets dominated by cars and roads; <a href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-9278009/Big-energy-suppliers-hike-prices-96-year-line-price-cap-rise.html">expensive and unaccountable energy costs</a>; disappearing local services and spaces; <a href="https://www.retailresearch.org/retail-crisis.html">failing high streets</a>; <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30482-X/fulltext">rising isolation, anxiety</a>, and <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1872">domestic abuse</a>. These are challenges that have been exacerbated by the economy into which they were born, and unequally amplified during the pandemic. It is no wonder that proposals to tinker with our homes is met with mistrust when faced with the scale of these challenges.</p><p>Lockdown policies have exacerbated inequality<br>For many, lockdown policies have forced our homes to host our entire lives. Four walls now define not only our domestic space, but also the office, the school, the playground, and everything in between. That means more heating, more energy, more internet, more cooking, cleaning, and stress. All which sits against a backdrop of anxiety over our health and wellbeing, job security and rising fuel costs. These added burdens remain largely unaccounted and invisible, and inevitably end up falling on the individual.</p><p>The home is the fundamental unit of our housing system, and the pandemic has made it increasingly clear that the home is also the determining factor in our access to <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/209373/connected-nations-2020.pdf">education</a>, to support networks, and to <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/newsroom/blog/analysing-greenspace-access-during-pandemic">public space</a>, fundamentally shaping our health and wellbeing. When all of this is filtered through an unequal housing system, it shows in plain sight the illusion of equal access to these basic standards of living, especially for those at the intersections of <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-10-29-poverty-and-inequality-surge-across-europe-wake-covid-19">socioeconomic class</a>, <a href="https://www.nhsconfed.org/news/2020/12/structural-inequalities-lie-behind-pandemic-impact-on-bme-communities">race</a>, <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/blogs/inequalities-and-deaths-involving-covid-19">gender</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbydisabilitystatusenglandandwales/2marchto14july2020">ability</a>.</p><p>Any political remedy that proposes a regenerative recovery strategy with housing at its focus needs to recognise these cascading impacts of the home. It must move away from the idea of retrofit as a superficial investment in fixing technical problems in individual buildings, to one which addresses the underlying systems that are tied to our domestic spaces. Retrofit should not only see the home as a strategic site for decarbonisation, but also a site for addressing the inequalities in wider, interlinked systems, of which housing sits at the&nbsp;centre.</p><p>A crisis of trust needs a democratic transition<br>To address the challenge of climate breakdown, retrofitting will mean large-scale, long-term plans that propose to take our homes and streets apart and build them back with us still inside. For this to be possible, the way we approach retrofitting needs to empathise with just how precarious many people’s lives have become, not only during the last 12 months, but as a result of the systemic injustices in how our built environment gets made and remade, and the suspicion that it has caused. A legitimate climate transition cannot address the technical challenges alone, but must tackle the social ones as well. For retrofitting to be a part of this kind of transition, it must be done with the consent of all those who hold a stake in it. This transition must be democratic, not just about voting, but in the widest sense: the agency to shape the future, with the right support to exercise this agency&nbsp;capably.</p> A green recovery at the scale of the&nbsp;street <p>Conventional approaches to retrofitting have attempted to reduce domestic carbon emissions on a piecemeal basis, relying on the ‘easy wins’ for individual homes such as one-off grants for wall or loft insulation, replacing boilers, or adding heat pumps. Although useful in the short term, these measures will only make a small dent in our 2050&nbsp;goals.</p><p>From Home to Neighbourhood<br>Government recovery plans tend to centre on individual households as the site for both decarbonising the built environment, and also the site for attempting to address systemic inequalities. But approaching retrofitting this way, through the lens of an atomised single home, made up of atomised individuals, won’t work. A recovery strategy built on retrofitting should try to multiply the value of green investment and economic stimulus by recognising that the home is inextricable from the spatial, social, and economic relationships of its neighbourhood. Retrofitting is critically situated in a knot of wider networks of local services, spaces, skills, ownership, regulation, ambition, and&nbsp;trust.</p>Fig. 1 — Understanding retrofit as a whole system of&nbsp;recovery<p>In practical terms, this means designing a retrofit strategy that sees the home in the context of its block, its street, and its neighbourhood. It is only at these scales can retrofit happen across a continuum of private to public spaces, and work with economic and social networks together as a complete unit of&nbsp;change.</p><p>The challenge we face now is how we can deconstruct and redesign the ‘dark matter’ around retrofit to deliver on this vision of a democratised climate transition.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">This publication series</a> aims to do just that, outlining the <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">challenges we see in the current retrofit ecosystem</a>, and how we think this approach to <a href="https://medium.com/@darkmatter-labs/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">retrofitting could be scaled democratically</a>.</p><p>These writings are a curated version of our thinking from the last 9 months. Over the next few months, Dark Matter Labs will be pursuing these and other lines of enquiry, applying future retrofit principles in real places to test propositions with system-shifting potential. We hope to begin rebuilding the ecosystem on a collective, democratic vision of a retrofitting that delivers deep and broad impacts, and also rebuilding trust in the systems of how our built environment is made and remade in our shared climate transition. As our testing progresses, we will be updating this series with a deeper look into some of the prototypes and propositions that are emerging.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>This blog and its visuals has been co-authored by <a href="https://medium.com/u/1c295ef66c9c">Calvin Po</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/u/f7fc325b2eeb">Ariane Porter</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/ee5c7ea1d010">Jack Minchella</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">Retrofit &amp; ‘Building back better’</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/a-right-to-retrofit">A Right to Retrofit</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How redesigning the dark matter of city systems can unlock sustainable, democratic urban environments Madrid is one of 10 European cities DML are working with on EIT-Climate KIC’s Healthy Clean Cities Deep Demonstration [Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alexrvasey?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Alex Vasey</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>] Looking back and forward on our work in&nbsp;cities <p>After a year like no other, and faced by what may well be permanent disruptions to their natural rhythms and rituals, cities around the world are grappling with how to navigate their uncertain, post-covid, climate-defined futures. Such transitions have, of course, been long overdue. The entrenched inequality and unsustainable metabolism that have come to define our cities is what drives many to look for ways to transition them towards the sustainable and democratic urban environments we need them to be. On current trends, temperature changes of 3 degrees celsius are <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-why-low-end-climate-sensitivity-can-now-be-ruled-out">more likely than 1.5 or even 2 degrees</a>, exacerbating a series of calamitous, cascading risks in our cities, whether as tangible places or as urban systems. The urgency and the depth of the transitions required to enable more hopeful scenarios means we have to act across a range of systemic levers in order to achieve a democratic, equitable pathway to a liveable&nbsp;future.</p><p>Our journey into&nbsp;cities</p><p>Over the past 5 years, Dark Matter Labs has found itself involved in several collaborations with such focus — where efforts to transition society in response to technological revolution and climate breakdown look to the city as a critical problem-space and tangible unit of change. From our early work to develop <a href="http://www.northcamdenzone.org/blog/launching-learning">impact movements in Camden</a>, to our experiences with <a href="https://civicsquare.cc">Civic Square</a> and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Alternative-Camden-A-civic-innovation-district">Alternative.Camden</a>, then the development in 2019 of our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10n--zTnTtmsMgjZVHVbYd9FrAESGaT7-/view">Micro-Massive urban transition thesis</a> with UNDP and EIT Climate-KIC and our involvement in the latter’s <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DD_Healthy_Clean_Cities.pdf">Healthy Clean Cities Deep Demonstration</a>, we’ve cultivated a deeper understanding of the critical role ‘<a href="https://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2012/08/dark-matter.html">dark matter</a>’ — the invisible structures and infrastructures that shape our systems, from regulation and procurement to contracting and financing mechanisms — must play in driving transitions in&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Cities as systems of systems: regulation, tech, participation, and&nbsp;finance</p><p>Cities, of course, are anything but one-dimensional. Even a first glance at their impact on climate change reveals that their footprint is much larger than the emissions taking place ‘within the gates.’ Scope 3 emissions in particular are driven by complex global supply chains in which urban politics is nested and entangled. But working with cities is still worthwhile — as long as we recognise that cities form a ‘system of systems’, where several levers of change come together, and can be acted upon — whether at the scale of a city-regional portfolio of interventions, or district-focussed ‘living&nbsp;labs’.</p><p>How cities update and in some cases revolutionise their regulatory landscape will determine the speed and depth at which urban environments can transition. Since co-founding <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/The-Network-of-Regulatory-Experimentation-A-peer-to-peer-community-of">the Network of Regulatory Experimentation</a> in partnership with <a href="https://bloxhub.org/">BLOXHUB</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/about-health-canada/legislation-guidelines/community-federal-regulators.html">Community of Federal Regulators</a>, <a href="https://doteveryone.org.uk/">Dot Everyone</a>, <a href="https://www.marsdd.com/systems-change/mars-solutions-lab/mars-solutions-lab-approach/">MaRS Solutions Lab</a>, <a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/">The McConnell Foundation</a> and <a href="https://waag.org/">Waag Society</a>, Dark Matter Labs has continued to explore the promise of a new generation of regulatory sandboxes based in cities, with <a href="https://www.mis.quebec/projets-dinnovation-sociale-realises/2020/10/26/licer-laboratoire-innovation-civique-experimentation-reglementaire/">Montreal</a> and Madrid playing early&nbsp;hosts.</p><p>How cities leverage the promise of technology — digital tools &amp; platforms, open data systems and artificial collective intelligence — will in many cases be pivotal in both accelerating change, but also in either by-passing or actively ensuring deeper legitimacy and ownership of transitions amongst those most affected. Seeing deeper civic participation as inherent in regulatory or technological innovation is integral to the future of cities: the promise of new technology and agile regulation moving us to a more sustainable future rings false unless people and communities can truly be part of collaboratively understanding why it is necessary, what opportunities it could hold for them, and how different design principles can drive towards very different outcomes. In this context, <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.lucidminds.ai/">Lucidminds</a>, with support from <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/">Nesta</a>, have been developing three use cases for near future ideas where <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/civic-ai-1890d93eb8ce">Civic AI</a> can help equip communities with the tools to collectively respond to the climate crisis and achieve the goal of a carbon-neutral society. While such technology scenarios may feel distant, <a href="https://regulation.network/legitimacities1Q">controversies such as around the Sidewalks Toronto proposition</a> shows the urgency of building civic legitimacy around tech-enabled sustainability pathways. In response, we are working with city governments like Amsterdam to explore how to bring collaborative dynamic regulation and tech-enabled renewable energy communities closer to reality, as well as with the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement, tech-enterprises and local citizens in Daegu, South Korea, to develop new frameworks and strategies for combining technology and civic innovation.</p>Visual from our Daegu Creative City project with Daegu Technopark<p>How cities finance their transitions will be crucial in ensuring capital best serves the future, both in terms of what they invest in and how they invest. Dark Matter Labs has been <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-infrastructuring-tomorrow-d19971b1f351">working with partners across North America and Europe</a> to explore how the transition capital embedded in the coming Green Deals can be best deployed. As cities will be significant recipients of transition capital over the coming decade, they must develop new financial instruments that enable long term investment; new mechanisms to capture and share the multiple spillover effects and value flows of a climate investment strategy, like better health and jobs; and new public governance models capable of limiting rent-seeking incentives traditionally structured into investment propositions. In short, we need to re-code capital so it privileges the shared public value of transition investment. Cities are starting to see the significance of the challenge, and our work with the cities of Madrid and Vienna to explore such ‘re-coding’ mechanisms will <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-2021-roadmap-bde60861dacb">accelerate in&nbsp;2021</a>.</p><p>What we’ve learned along the&nbsp;way</p><p>Needless to say, we’ve learned a few lessons from these encounters with cities and their dark matter. We have a growing appreciation of the need to combine discovery work and creative imagining with the hard graft of enabling change to happen on the ground. We have a deeper sense of the undeniable role cultural competence alongside local leadership and partnerships must play to drive and sustain urban transformation in what are always unique places with powerful and complex identities. In response, our team is even more geographically distributed than it was a year ago; aspiring to be more deeply embedded in the local contexts in which we work. We are explicitly working on what it means in practice to deal with urban systems by both reaching down into neighbourhoods and up into sprawling economic and ecological geographies and supply chains. We recognise the need to mobilise national and regional authorities as much as municipal governments if we are to truly rewrite the DNA of cities and their dynamic flows beyond the traditional city boundaries. Each of these points probably warrants a post in themselves, and over the next months we’ll be sharing in more detail some of our insights from the work in different places.</p> Why cities — revisited <p>These experiences and reflections have pushed us to refocus on the why, what and how of city transitions. Of all the problem and opportunity spaces our world has to offer, why do we choose to ‘lean into’&nbsp;cities?</p><p>Aggregate and compound&nbsp;value</p><p>Cities are where many of the most complex challenges we face combine into webs of cascading risks and legacy lock-ins. It’s widely acknowledged that cities are a net-contributor to climate breakdown, covering less than two percent of the earth’s surface, but consuming 78% of the world’s energy, producing more than 60% of all carbon emissions and reinforcing the habits, lifestyles and extractive economies most associated with the causes of the climate crisis. And the past year has been a particularly stark reminder that this takes place in the context of chronic and deepening ‘multiple horizon’ emergencies, of growing disparities in wealth and power, and the double edged sword of runaway technological capabilities.</p><p>While the scale and entanglement of the problems are enormous, so is the possibility for impact. If we succeed in transitioning cities to a more sustainable and democratic future, the aggregated value of improving the lives of the vast urban populations cities serve is clear. But cities are also particularly powerful hubs of knowledge and collaborative innovation capacity, driven by their innate diversity, their assertive plurality of institutional and non-institutional actors, and their capacity to attract capital. This, together with the soon to be made available ‘once-in-a-generation’ investments, if leveraged well, can shift them from engines of unsustainable growth to catalysts of healthy, green, caring transitions.</p><p>The pathways for deploying this capital need to be explored in the full acknowledgement of complexity, uncertainty and entanglement. This also means that we cannot just engage deeply with neighbourhoods and communities, but also have to think widely across (bio)regional and even national economies and ecologies. They provide fertile ground for strategic innovation and new lead markets (e.g. bio-based zero embodied carbon building, nature-based solutions financing, industrial hydrogen) that represent significant compound value and multiplier effects beyond the city’s municipal limits. This, in turn, is critical to overcome the growing political divides and spectre of culture wars between cities and hinterlands where it comes to the winners and losers of transition.</p><p>An opportunity to build institutional capacity for deep transitions</p><p>More fundamentally, we’re seeing more and more clearly the urgent need to enable the deep institutional shift from incrementalism to transformative change. Cities are expressing that they see the need to accelerate this shift — but it is evident they currently struggle to provide the conditions for this to happen. They want systemic change — but can they change their systems? Siloed organisations; analogue-era regulatory approaches; resistance to policy-making that actively shapes markets; limited capabilities in blended finance and multiple outcome accounting; underdeveloped local innovation ecosystems; and rudimentary infrastructures for collaborating with citizens are just some of the critical institutional capacity gaps present in cities. At the same time, the Deep Demonstration in Healthy Clean Cities has seen emergent progress in many of these fields: from Vienna’s success in bringing together a remarkably large number of departments around its decarbonisation agenda employing ‘ <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/why-we-need-more-t-shaped-graduates-1.2584765">T-shaped’ </a>team members to connect opportunities, to Amsterdam’s dynamic outcome-based regulation aspirations for last-mile logistics, cities are starting to embrace pathways to action that can match the ever-more ambitious target-setting. If we succeed in redesigning the dark matter of city systems, and unlock such fertile institutional ground for creating sustainable, democratic urban environments, we go a long way to accelerating transitions towards rapid decarbonisation and a healthier, more sustainable human thriving.</p> What’s at&nbsp;stake? <p>Of course, institutional capacity is just one side of the equation. The other is where it takes us. Directionality matters. Intentionality matters. Values matter. So what are we trying to achieve with our work in&nbsp;cities?</p><p>At Dark Matter Labs, the aspirations of city transitions is to create a thriving urban everyday life with radically improved standards of civic agency and the opportunity for human flourishing afforded to all, within planetary boundaries, and alongside a regenerated natural realm. We see this manifesting across a range of domains and lived experiences in cities and peri-urban areas.</p>Visual from our Malmö Example Streets experiment proposition<p>In the near and now, we aspire for ‘cities-as-commons’ — places where participatory governance of civic assets shape our communities, public spaces and local economy. New institutional tools, such as <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">multiple-level climate contracts</a> and <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/network-city-endowments/">civic endowments</a> for shared infrastructure and innovation investment, are building blocks for this. We see cities as carbon positive urban environments — not just because of decarbonised homes and transport, but also with <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-aa141acdf227">vast urban nature</a> capable of turning concrete jungles into their very own carbon sinks. We aspire for ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/building-mental-wealth-34441f638e3b">caring cities</a>’ — places that privilege and properly invest in wellbeing and empathy, but also shared learning and active participation in deep democracy. We see cities as circular and collaborative, where food and (re)construction are part of digitally integrated local value chains capable of building community wealth and local resilience, underpinned by next generation logistics systems and agile regulation that include real-time environmental performance as key&nbsp;metric.</p><p>Urban futures like these would mean people having more power over their places, a deeper relationship with nature despite their urban setting, a sharpened consciousness of the materiality of their city, greater security and capacity to focus on the pursuit of equitable human flourishing, and the ability to benefit from the value generated by collective endeavours, all the while preserving and nourishing our shared ecosystems. It is a vision in which cities finally deliver on their promise to each and every one of&nbsp;us.</p> How might we get&nbsp;there? <p>As we’re often reminded, it’s not enough to have a clear case for change and a compelling vision for how things can be different. This is particularly true in the uncertain, complex and emergent times in which we live. So if there is no clear linear pathway to unlock such a city transition, how do we&nbsp;proceed?</p><p>Our thesis at Dark Matter Labs is that there are a set of key ingredients we must start&nbsp;with.</p><p>Strategic risk and future liability</p><p>Even though 2020 showed in brutal tangibility what ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/governing-the-asian-century-28b7ce1aaf2e">interconnected and cascading risk</a>’ can mean for cities, urban governments and the national equivalents that support them systematically fail to properly account for risk and liability. In too many cities we see ambitious urban strategies for decarbonisation sat in juxtaposition with stable consumption of high embodied carbon materials such as concrete. In too many cities we see aspirations for eliminating poverty alongside extractive development models reliant on housing and land asset bubbles. In too many cities we see ambitions for once-in-a-lifetime deep energy retrofitting investments that are unconnected to other needs and opportunities in neighbourhoods, like reimaging streets, creating digitally enabled local supply chains or building community wealth. In too many cities we see a growing awareness of mental health risk being undercut by an ongoing inability to make long investments into social infrastructure that overcome loneliness and strengthen individual and collective resilience.</p><p>To address these disconnects, we’re focussing on building capabilities and mechanisms for understanding and acting on strategic risk. That means assessing risk and liabilities not at a project level, but rather at a whole-place transition level: identifying the extent to which a proposed course of action or set of interventions impacts on the ability of a city to deliver on its vision and mission. In our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-way-forward-77ad17a031cc">age of the long emergencies</a>, cities must take steps to address multiple levers of change, connect several domains of vulnerability and opportunity, and unlock new lead&nbsp;markets.</p><p>This new relationship with foundational risk and liability at the urban level can have a ripple effect on some crucial practices that define the trajectory of cities, perhaps most profoundly in how we move towards strategic investment portfolios inextricably linked to the transitions we pursue. We are exploring a range of instruments and financial models such as smart and tradable perpetual bonds that can amplify the capacity of public sector and other public interest actors to raise capital for long term multiple outcome interventions; urban-scale carbon sequestration certificates as a pathway to broader ecosystem services investment certification; and a Settlement Risk-Innovation Facility to enable systemic innovations to resolve key liabilities (e.g. urban air pollution) with solutions that can only be proven over time. Alongside similar efforts such as those of the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/programmes/transformation-capital/">Transformation Capital Initiative</a>, we are bringing together problem owners, solution providers and financiers in new relationships that again are geared towards aligning interests for the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Portfolios of interconnected interventions</p><p>As cities make this shift towards more co-beneficiary investment strategies, the necessity of a portfolio of interconnected interventions becomes clear. EIT Climate-KIC’s 2019 strategy document <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Transformation-in-time.pdf">Transition, in Time</a> lays out how, in the context of uncertainty, a portfolio approach is essential to discover options and pathways. What we have seen over the last year and a half working with EIT Climate-KIC and <a href="https://tomorrowscities.partners/">a range of other partners</a> in fifteen cities across Europe is how the portfolio of interventions need to focus both on domain-based and on transversal approaches. The two intertwine to recognise the complex and adaptive nature of systems, but also to generate systems learning and mark out possible transition pathways, rather than seeking to simply validate whether a single point intervention has impact or&nbsp;not.</p>Overview of one strategic experiment in Madrid’s Health Clean Cities portfolio of interventions<p>To start with the transversal: the next generation transition finance capabilities we mention above are just one of the cross-cutting innovation capacities that cities need. Regulatory innovation capacity will be equally essential: updating cities’ regulatory frameworks can not be limited to a one-off fix to include e.g. embodied carbon emissions into their planning systems and public realm specification sheets. Rather, it needs to be a permanent capacity for change that can work with civic and private stakeholders as well as with other public authorities in an on-going, agile and transparent manner to integrate new progress metrics and strategic learnings stemming from accelerated decarbonisation and pollution targets into policy frameworks. As our <a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/report/legitimacities/">Legitimacities</a> publication set out, this requires us to build a new set of collaboration settings (‘sandboxes’) and capabilities so that urban regulatory experiments can be created with and co-governed by people from across sectors, rebuilding trust and revealing transition pathways.</p><p>And regulatory innovation is just one aspect of a broader transition governance capacity, which is multifaceted and needs active investment at a time where large amounts of recovery capital and transition needs will at local level often meet deeply ingrained scepticism and mistrust of ‘change’ and its winners and losers. It is extremely unlikely that a truly just transition can be forged through the decision-making patterns of the past. Hence we are working to develop a new range of ‘transition’ governance tools and mechanisms, ranging from new contracting architecture for collective action with Leuven2030, to new collaborative governance arrangements with the Orleans Metropole. Our collaboration with <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">Viable Cities and nine Swedish cities to establish Climate City Contracts</a> — an emergent and agile contracting architecture for complex and entangled challenges like the climate emergency — is another example of an alliance of partners working together to reimagine governance.</p><p>In a city portfolio, such ‘horizontal’ innovation capabilities meet with a range of ‘vertical’ missions or integrated interventions such as fostering circular economies, at-scale nature-based solutions, and whole-district climate retrofitting (or actually, we’d prefer to call it future-fitting — as it also needs to take stock of shifting working patterns after Covid-19, counter the loneliness epidemic, and build resilience in adapting to a 3+ Celsius scenario of climate extremes). In each of these domains there are interconnected financial, regulatory and broader transition governance questions, alongside technology and data questions. Responding to these entanglements through a portfolio approach can enable cities to become early movers in lead markets that can build new inclusive value and supply chains, attract investment and drive sustainable recovery. While confronting to the managerial orthodoxies of city administrations, this more dynamic approach inevitably gives rise to new and valuable institutional and sector-specific tools such as comfort contracts that can bind together households, energy solutions providers and financiers in a district retrofit; or material registries that can enable the construction and real estate finance sector to embrace circularity, and make decisions based on long-term considerations.</p> Towards more hopeful urban&nbsp;futures <p>As we continue down the multiple transition pathways we have embarked on with cities, we are making some strategic bets where we will invest our time and energy over the coming years. We’re working with cities and a range of partners on developing strategic transition portfolios, on place-based proofs of possibility exploring how the full stack of institutional innovations can be brought together, and on particular tools and instruments for next generation governance and finance. Across these three types of work, we increasingly pay attention to how we learn from strategic experiments and build capabilities in the process. We believe that by better structuring the demand for such change, building new functions of governance, and showing tangible demonstrations of new and legitimate transition pathways, we can reorientate our cities’ current trajectories towards more hopeful&nbsp;futures.</p><p>This is our emerging thesis on redesigning the dark matter of city systems. It has been built through the support from, and conversations with many of our partners, and we are encouraged by (and immensely grateful for) their trust in together navigating the opportunities for positive change in an uncertain world. Equally, we are keenly aware that our approaches and practices are inevitably incomplete — and we’d like to invite feedback and discussion in order to spot gaps, next opportunities, and blind spots as well as complementary perspectives. It’s not quite true that this shared endeavour is ‘just getting started’ — but given the terrain ahead, that’s often what it feels like. We look forward to exploring the way forward with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://twitter.com/joostbeunderman?lang=en">Joost Beunderman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/t_bez12">Tom Beresford</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RonnquistLinnea">Linnea Rönnquist</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanWainwright15">Dan Wainwright,</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/lesinterstices">Jonathan Lapalme</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/eunjikangsin">Eunji Kang</a> in deep acknowledgement of contributions to our work with cities by other DM colleagues, our kin (the <a href="https://www.project00.cc">00 ecosystem</a>) and our partners — particularly <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org">EIT-Climate KIC</a>, <a href="https://tomorrowscities.partners/Partners">Bankers Without Boundaries, Democratic Society and Material Economics</a>.</p>Funded by EIT Climate-KIC <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/accelerating-city-transitions-3baadbfdcd68">Accelerating City Transitions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Luxembourg, April 2021 – Tokeny Solutions has announced a white-label secondary market solution for securities issuers and digital asset marketplaces to improve private market access for investors. The Billboard module of the T-REX Platform allows an issuer’s investors to connect with one another, express trading intentions and ultimately execute peer-to-peer security token transfers on a decentralized infrastructure. Asset issuers can utilise the solution today, and improve the experience for their investors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The private market industry is one that has grown impressively over the past decade, offering lucrative returns for investors. Yet, due to this industry operating on a plethora of centralized, manual and inefficient networks, there is barely any transferability in the secondary market. Investors are resigned to long lock-up periods and ultimately face costly liquidity problems. Today, this is a barrier to entry for many as liquidity is often needed, especially in times of economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Billboard leverages decentralized technologies to digitally identify stakeholders and their assets to facilitate transactions. Thanks to onchain identities, the ownership and the eligibility claims of the counterparties are automatically verified. Once verified, the transaction is rapidly executed peer-to-peer by investors. This easy-to-use type of transfer reduces many fees seen in traditional private markets such as those to do with settlement and custody.</p>

		 
	 
    Since 2017, security tokens have promised to bring liquidity to an industry that has long been starved of it. So far, this hasn’t happened due to the lack of a complete, end-to-end solution, from the identification of investors down to the on-chain transfer. With T-REX Billboard, we are delighted to be the first company to finally deliver on this promise and open a broad spectrum of opportunities to a wider group of investors, and improve the liquidity as a result.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions       As the leading pan-European market infrastructure, we invested in Tokeny with the shared vision that blockchain technologies and the use of security tokens could further support the development of private markets. Billboard, the new module of the T-REX security token platform, is a significant step in this journey and completes Tokeny’s offerings: financial institutions now have all the technological pieces to efficiently interact with security tokens, and thus grasp the benefits of blockchain technology in the world of private markets.

			<p>Blockchain technology is now recognized as an infrastructure to issue and transfer securities across capital markets. These securities, or security tokens, fall under the same rules and regulations as traditional financial securities in many European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the UK. Asset owners utilising Billboard also benefit from the built-in compliance of the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX security token standard</a>, which has been used to tokenize over €8.5 billion of assets to date.</p>

<p>Dresden, Germany and Sparks, Nevada, April 1, 2021 – Blockchains, Inc., a Nevada-based blockchain technology company committed to protecting and empowering individuals, today announced its acquisition of evan GmbH. Headquartered in Dresden, Germany, evan focuses on building for the new economy through its blockchain-based decentralized identifier solutions.</p>
<p>“Developing a trust infrastructure based on digital identity is key for cooperation on the blockchain. Enabling parties to transfer trust from the real world to the digital world is what led us to Blockchains,” said Thomas Müller, evan’s co-founder and CEO. “Digital identity is in Blockchains’ DNA. We are very excited to be joining the Blockchains’ family and working with like-minded innovators and visionary developers to empower individuals and businesses.”</p>
<p>In 2018, the founders of evan GmbH set out to jump-start the movement to Web 3.0 by developing decentralized identifiers for businesses to interact directly with each other without an intermediary, by leveraging automation and a trust and trace-based methodology. Evan’s core technologies have significant implications for Blockchains’ suite of solutions currently in development. The companies plan to integrate evan’s solution stack with Blockchains’ digital platform to empower individuals by allowing them to control their personal information and assets.</p>
<p>Recognized as one of Gartner’s Cool Vendors in Blockchain Business in 2020, evan is a contributor of the W3C, an international consortium where member organizations and the public work together to develop Web standards. Additionally, the company is a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation and partners with Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation network organizations.</p>
<p>Evan’s expertise extends to employing identity through IoT devices for use-cases in a variety of industries, including energy, government services, transportation, and healthcare. “How IoT connects to decentralized identifiers provides significant privacy benefits when these devices are communicating directly with the outside world, and when the devices operate with multiple parties in different contexts, such as when part of a supply chain or when integrated into smart city infrastructure,” said Thomas Herbst, co-founder and CTO, evan GmbH.</p>
<p>“The value that evan brings to Blockchains is not only in the tremendously talented people who built a technology portfolio based on a much-needed trust infrastructure but also a deep understanding for developing decentralized solutions with global interoperability standards in mind,” said Lee Weiss, executive vice president, Blockchains. “Whether for companies to be able to work together and with us in our blockchain-based smart city in Nevada, or for us to be able to partner with a wide scale of enablers for our digital ecosystem, interoperability is key.”</p>
<p>Together, evan and Blockchains are writing a new chapter in the evolution of the web by breaking dependencies on central platform providers and giving individuals back their autonomy in the digital space.</p>The post <a href="https://evan.network/news/blockchains-acquisition-evan/">Blockchains Strengthens Decentralized Identity Capabilities with Acquisition of evan GmbH</a> first appeared on <a href="https://evan.network"></a>.

<p>Our April 1st platform update brings increased performance, noticeably faster speed, and groundbreaking security enhancements.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>The highly anticipated No-Factor Authentication (NFA) feature is the pinnacle of cybersecurity innovation. It removes the hassle of logging into workstations and applications by eliminating the need to log in…altogether. </p>
      
<p>That’s right — we’ve gotten rid of the login screen completely, so there is no barrier to entry.*&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
 Instant Access for Anyone, Anywhere 
      
<p>No-factor login means you don’t need to prove who you are. By eliminating the authentication flow, your teams will enjoy an unrivaled sense of freedom when logging in. Just sit down at your computer, and begin using it. Nothing else is required —&nbsp;no password, token, biometric, nothing. </p>
      
<p>Arguably, this approach is more secure than a password.</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
 Easy Logout 
      
<p>Logging out has never been easier. You don’t need to log out, because you were never really logged in. Feel free to get up from the computer, walk away from it (leaving it in any state), and when returning it is simply open and available to you.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>A seamless logout experience is only possible with No-factor authentication.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 How It Works: Bleeding-Edge Technology 
      
<p>From machine learning to Zero Trust architecture to immutable blockchain-based identity stores, NFA combines the latest buzzwords to achieve bleeding-edge innovation. </p>
      

      
<p>All the user needs to do is show up. HYPR’s NFA architecture handles the rest. Our R&amp;D team has been working tirelessly on eliminating login and what you see today is the culmination of decades of hard work.</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
 Super Low Pricing 
      
<p>Looking for great ROI when sourcing a security product? How about one that requires no investment?  </p>
      
<p>If you’ve come this far, then by now you’ve probably realized that this feature doesn’t exist, so you’ll never have to pay for it. Happy April Fool’s Day 2021.</p>
      
<p>* Electricity and internet connection are still required.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Urbit provides a powerful and extensible platform for all kinds of app development. It can serve as a general-purpose datastore, decentralized network, and identity solution for a variety of front-end applications. The client that ships with Urbit, Landscape, provides one example of the kind of applications that can be built on the platform. However, other developers can use the same tools used to create Landscape to power their own interfaces and clients for Urbit.</p>
<p>Tyler Brown Cifu Shuster (~radbur-sivmus) has worked with the Landscape team over the past few months to extract these tools into reusable Javascript packages. In this talk, he will explain how to use them to develop a client for Urbit independent of Landscape. He will cover the basic lifecycle of a client and explain how Javascript interface and state frameworks pair with Urbit's data model.</p>
<p>This talk should enable anyone familiar with modern Javascript development and HTTP grammar to build an application on top of Urbit without writing any back-end code.</p>

<p>Data has driven incredible improvements in the way people have experienced financial services over the last decade. Services that once could only be done at bank branches can now be easily accessed online. And people now have powerful financial information, products, and management tools at their fingertips via their mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The expansion of open banking is creating a new turning point in the money experience. Open banking allows consumers to share their financial data with third-party developers and fintechs in exchange for new services—unlocking the potential of financial data to catalyze another generation of innovation across the industry. Services such as providing financial data to build credit and gain immediate access to capital, initiating a direct payment to a business or individual, and managing household expenses and budgets fundamentally change the boundaries of banking relationships.</p>
<p>Responsible data practices are required for participants to best take advantage of this technology. The key differentiator that sets the world of open banking apart from previous innovation environments is the requirement for consumer consent in data sharing and adherence to core data principles: control, access, transparency, traceability, and security (CATTS).</p>
<p>In order to enable open banking and empower customers, data access agreements (DAA) must be in place to ensure access to financial data that financial service providers need to innovate and provide new services and benefits in a digital world. These agreements define common rules for how two parties—usually an open banking platform or financial data aggregator and a financial institution—will communicate and exchange financial data. More secure data access agreements mean more connections that financial service providers can use to empower consumers with greater control over their financial health.&nbsp;</p>
 Finicity’s Market Leadership in Financial Data 
<p>Finicity’s connections cover 95% of direct deposit accounts in North America. And thanks to 20 signed direct access agreements with some of the nation’s largest financial institutions, we support 60% of our traffic with direct API access. We expect that direct-API traffic share to grow to over 80% by the end of 2021, greatly reducing the use of user credentials and screen scraping in the financial services market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2017, we have led in signing data access agreements with the top FIs including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, Fidelity and many others.&nbsp; And, in just the past year, Finicity has worked to strengthen the open banking ecosystem by creating stronger, more secure data access agreements and partnerships with key financial institutions and fintechs, including Charles Schwab, TD Bank, Citi, Brex, Chime, US Bank, and BMO Harris.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And where Finicity has been leading, the market is following. Along with an increasing number of financial institutions and other financial service providers, more payroll providers are recognizing that consumers can benefit from the data they hold. As a result, these providers are adopting API connections to open banking platforms that expand the use of financial data in lending, tenant screening, background checks, government verification and personal financial management.&nbsp; Finicity announced a Direct Access Agreement with the leading payroll provider in September 2020, representing 16% of the payroll provider market.</p>
<p>DAAs provide the broader fintech and financial services community with access, through Finicity, to consumer-permissioned financial data that enables a variety of apps and services across financial management, payments, lending, and beyond. And a key result for all parties is enhanced data stability, accuracy and improved security through reduction of user credentials.</p>
<p>A direct access agreement with Finicity ensures the most reliable data security for financial institutions while still enabling fintechs and financial service providers to deliver solutions that empower consumers and foster financial inclusion.

<p>Unsurprisingly,&nbsp;this&nbsp;year’s study is framed&nbsp;around&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;and&nbsp;reveals the pandemic has&nbsp;significantly&nbsp;elevated the importance of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;as a business priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cisco&nbsp;says: “The reaffirmation of privacy’s value even during the pandemic positions it as a priority for years to come.

The Age of Privacy has arrived.”&nbsp;We wholeheartedly&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">agree with these sentiments</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cisco’s Data Privacy Benchmark 2021 is a significant study. It’s an annual survey which, for this&nbsp;2021&nbsp;installment,&nbsp;anonymously&nbsp;surveyed more than 4,700 security professionals from&nbsp;25 geographies&nbsp;in mid-2020.&nbsp;Respondents&nbsp;represented&nbsp;all major industries and organization size. It also&nbsp;drew&nbsp;on&nbsp;data&nbsp;from Cisco’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-infographic-2020.pdf">2020 Consumer Privacy Survey</a>, which was completed in&nbsp;mid-2020 by 2,600 adults in 12 countries.*&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;four key&nbsp;messages that flow from&nbsp;Cisco’s Data Privacy Benchmark 2021&nbsp;are&nbsp;important&nbsp;for enterprise:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Privacy&nbsp;is helping&nbsp;organizations to overcome the challenges of the pandemic.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Cisco reports 93 percent of organizations&nbsp;used&nbsp;their privacy team to help&nbsp;navigate and manage&nbsp;their pandemic response&nbsp;in 2020, particularly the rapid shift to remote work and&nbsp;balancing&nbsp;individual rights&nbsp;and&nbsp;public safety. Private and secure remote work access and systems and policies for&nbsp;when and how to share employees’ personal information and to limit access to and use of that data&nbsp;are&nbsp;urgent priorities&nbsp;in the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Investment in privacy&nbsp;has increased&nbsp;and&nbsp;ROI is positive.&nbsp; 



 &nbsp; 



<p>As you’d expect in a pandemic, the study shows&nbsp;privacy budgets&nbsp;across all organization sizes&nbsp;roughly&nbsp;doubled in 2020.&nbsp;The&nbsp;average&nbsp;privacy spend is now USD&nbsp;2.4 million.&nbsp;While&nbsp;ROI&nbsp;on this spend&nbsp;was slightly down compared&nbsp;with2019,&nbsp;it&nbsp;tracked similarly to 2020 and remained&nbsp;solid.&nbsp;Thirty-five percent&nbsp;of respondents&nbsp;reported&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;at least two times&nbsp;their investments&nbsp;in areas such as mitigating losses from data breaches,&nbsp;spurring&nbsp;innovation, achieving operational efficiency, and building trust with customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Tighter privacy laws&nbsp;are welcomed and positively regarded.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>We recently told you about the new&nbsp;“privacy actives”, a term Cisco coined&nbsp;following&nbsp;its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/en_uk/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">2019&nbsp;Consumer Privacy Survey</a>.&nbsp;‘Privacy actives’ are highly motivated privacy-aware individuals&nbsp;who&nbsp;care about privacy,&nbsp;are willing to act to protect theirs, and&nbsp;are proactive&nbsp;about it.&nbsp;The latest Cisco data shows organizations are recognizing and responding to this new influential demographic and accept that consumers won’t buy their products and services if they perceive a risk to their personal information&nbsp;from the company’s data practices and policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such,&nbsp;the steady tightening of privacy laws globally,&nbsp;which&nbsp;promote&nbsp;greater transparency, fairness and accountability,&nbsp;are being welcomed and positively regarded by&nbsp;both&nbsp;enterprise and consumers. Cisco&nbsp;reports&nbsp;that 79 percent&nbsp;of organizations indicated&nbsp;privacy regulations&nbsp;are having a positive impact (and only a&nbsp;5&nbsp;percent&nbsp;negative impact).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about&nbsp;how&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">privacy regulations&nbsp;are&nbsp;picking up pace</a>&nbsp;at the state level in the US and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Privacy is&nbsp;becoming&nbsp;even more&nbsp;critical to the bottom line.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Cisco has several key findings in this area:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  90&nbsp;percent of respondents agreed&nbsp;that external privacy certifications, such as&nbsp;ISO 27701, APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules, and EU Binding Corporate Rules,&nbsp;are an important buying factor when choosing a product or vendor.&nbsp;  Organizations with more mature privacy practices are&nbsp;enjoying greater&nbsp;business benefits than average and are&nbsp;in a stronger position&nbsp;to handle new and evolving privacy regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;  More security professionals&nbsp;say&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;is now a core requirement of their role, and&nbsp;93&nbsp;percent of organizations&nbsp;are reporting&nbsp;privacy metrics&nbsp;such as&nbsp;privacy program audit findings, privacy impact assessments, and data breaches to their&nbsp;board.&nbsp;  



<p>All these findings&nbsp;point to the fact the pandemic has strengthened&nbsp;the commitment to privacy&nbsp;globally.&nbsp;As the report summarizes: “Privacy budgets have increased over the last year, organizations have more resources focused on privacy, and privacy investments going above and beyond the law are translating into real business value. Privacy legislation and external certifications are providing assurance in a business environment where it’s hard to know whom to trust. Consumers are exercising their privacy rights and demanding enforcement of existing privacy protections.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed,&nbsp;Cisco could not be plainer in its assessment of privacy’s importance to business&nbsp;as we move further into 2021:&nbsp;“Organizations that get privacy right improve trust with their customers, operational efficiency, and both top-line and bottom-line results.”&nbsp;</p>

 Already integrated by SAP and rfxcel, the Spherity Credentialing Service is now ready to be shipped to the&nbsp;market <p>Spherity announces the launch of its new product: The Spherity Credentialing Service, which sets the benchmark for compliance solutions in the field of trading partner verification and is available from today. The product establishes trust in digital interactions between trading partners in pharmaceutical supply chains and ensures compliance with the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act&nbsp;(DSCSA).</p>Spherity Credentialing Service — Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@aronvisuals?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Aron&nbsp;Visuals</a><p>We are proud that Novartis, as an innovation leader, is looking to adopt the Spherity Credentialing Service. David Mason, Regional Serialization Lead at Novartis says that “Using credentialing is the first proven digital solution for our industry that addresses the ATP compliance gap of knowing if the counterparty is an Authorized Trading Partner. This is a foundation to meet DSCSA requirements by&nbsp;2023.”</p><p><a href="https://news.sap.com/2021/03/pharmaceutical-supply-chain-industry-pilot/">SAP</a> and <a href="https://rfxcel.com/rfxcel-adopts-open-credentialing-initiative-oci-meet-dscsa-authorized-trading-partner-atp-requirements/">rfxcel</a> have integrated the Spherity Credentialing Service within their verification routing service solutions to be able to share and verify the Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) status in product verifications. Herb Wong, Vice President of Marketing &amp; Strategic Initiatives at rfxcel says “The Credentialing Service is the most comprehensive effort to address the upcoming Authorized Trading Partner requirement for DSCSA. rfxcel was impressed to see how seamlessly it integrated with our solution.” Dr. Oliver Nuernberg, Chief Product Owner at SAP says “For SAP, one of the key requirements was to ensure that the existing returns verification process is not impacted by adding credentialing. By making the credentialing optional, we further ensure that our customers can add this capability over time without disrupting existing processes.”</p><p>The <a href="https://spherity.com/credentialing-service/">Spherity Credentialing Service</a> enables supply chain actors to verify in real time that they are only exchanging information with Authorized Trading Partners (ATP), as per DSCSA requirements, even when they do not have a direct business relationship yet. The Spherity Credentialing Service integrated Legisym as credential issuer and is based on the ATP architecture that was tested by an industry wide pilot. Beyond DSCSA compliance, Spherity leverages process efficiencies of exchanging data with indirect business partners by avoiding manual and time consuming due diligence processes. Saving significant time and money for all participants in the ecosystem.</p><p>To drive the utilization of decentralized digital identity technologies across the industry, Spherity participates in the newly founded Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI). As an industry consortium, this initiative incubates the ATP architecture and governs further standardization efforts.</p><p>“Using ATP credentials for product verification interactions is just the tip of the iceberg. The established enterprise identities and associated verifiable credentials will leverage efficiency to exchange data in regulated environments”, says Georg Jürgens, Manager Industry Solutions at Spherity.</p> About Spherity <p><a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a> is building decentralized digital identity management solutions to power the fourth industrial revolution, bringing secure identities to enterprises, machines, products, data and even algorithms. We provide the enabling technology to digitize and automate compliance processes primarily in highly-regulated technical sectors like pharmaceuticals, automotive and logistics.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/fisher">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>I have been covering cybersecurity issues, first as a journalist then as an analyst, since 2006. In that 15 years I have heard the mantra that security is a boardroom issue hundreds of times. The subject has filled countless conference talks and media articles.</p>
<p>It appears that the message is still not getting through if a <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/ncsc-ceo-first-speech" title="speech by the new CEO of the UK National Cyber Security Centre">speech by the new CEO of the UK National Cyber Security Centre</a> (NCSC) anything is to go by. In her first public speaking engagement in March this year, Lindy Cameron, said, you guessed it folks, security must be given more attention in&nbsp;the boardroom.</p>
<p>“Cybersecurity is still not taken as seriously as it should be, and simply is not embedded in UK boardrooms. The pace of change is no excuse — in boardrooms, digital literacy is as non-negotiable as financial or legal literacy,” she said.</p>
<p>“Our CEOs should be as close to their CISO as their finance director and general counsel, and we want to help them to develop this knowledge, as we’re all too aware that cyber-skills are not yet fundamental to our education — even though these are life skills like wiring a plug or changing a tyre as well as skills for the future digital economy.”</p>
<p>Fine words and reported diligently by a few security media outlets in between the latest sensational cyber-attacks. But why has it not changed – and more importantly, does it even matter?</p>
 Have a cigar? 
<p>I take issue that cybersecurity is “not taken seriously” by CEOs etc. I believe they are more than aware of the risk of cyber-attacks. But there is a crucial difference between taking an issue seriously and making it a regular “embedded” boardroom issue - one discussed and approved by directors at all time. This is what many aspire to and to get there, security people are told they must speak the “language of business” for budget approval and to get things done.</p>
<p>I am not sure those who want a seat at the table will ever find one. Perhaps security is not a regular boardroom issue because the board simply expects the CISO and everyone in the hierarchy beneath them to get on with the job. It also betrays a lack of awareness by the “cyber is a boardroom issue” lobby as to <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/04/leading-from-the-boardroom" title="what board meetings consist of">what board meetings consist of</a>.</p>
 Mind your language 
<p>Very often this debate is framed around language – the Board does not care because CISOs only talk in technical terms they do not understand. If security people can frame security needs and projects with “normal” business language, then more budget may be forthcoming or new policies could be approved. I’m not so sure this makes a difference.</p>
<p>Other than reducing people-based incidents such as phishing through awareness training (not usually successful in the long term), reducing cyber risk is almost 100% based on the successful management of policies, IT and software. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for a CEO and the board to consider it primarily an IT issue.</p>
<p>There are articles, books even, which explain how to get boardroom buy-in – yet the amount of activity and social interaction that these entails would preclude the CISO from doing much else. Other organizations are simply too small to have an expensive and dedicated CISO function – so they rely on managed security services. The board then simply expects that company to do what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>Unlike finance, HR, marketing, R&amp;D and other LOBs, IT security is a function of risk and event management and not one of creative development - it is a negative asset- one that organizations would gladly pay less for if they could. Security does not lead to innovation, create new markets, design new products and services or consider the impact of M&amp;A, ROI, or P&amp;L. It is however a cost entry in the auditor’s report.</p>
 Focus on technology not theory 
<p>For her first speech, Linda Cameron would have done to better to focus on how advanced technology, automation and better deigned security tools are doing more keep organizations safe than trotting out a tired line about security’s battle to be taken seriously by the board.</p>
<p>Outside of this diversion the best CISOs, CIOs and IT managers are putting in place security technologies that focus on the end user by working with vendors and analysts to find the right solution. They are making employees lives easier by deploying solutions that provide privileged access, single sign on, secure remote access etc without security controls getting in the way. This is surely making security a business issue -without needing boardroom approval.</p>
<p>Given the workload of most CISOs right now, not having to worry about speaking to the board would probably come as a relief. Of course, the one time a CISO may be summoned to the board is when there is a serious breach, but no-one ever said life was fair.</p>

<p>Mathieu: Jimmy, thank you for&nbsp;doing this with me.</p>
<p>Jimmy: Thank you for having me on; I’m looking&nbsp;forward to it.</p>
<p>Mathieu: We’re doing some&nbsp;cool stuff in the self-sovereign identity space,&nbsp;and we’ll get to that&nbsp;in a few minutes. I was curious — I know&nbsp;you come from the crypto space. It seems that a lot of people in the&nbsp;self-sovereign identity community come from crypto backgrounds. Conversely, there are a lot&nbsp;of people in the self-sovereign&nbsp;identity community who try to&nbsp;distance themselves from crypto, but&nbsp;there is some tie there.&nbsp;Did you come from the crypto space?</p>
<p>Jimmy: I’d say,&nbsp;technically, yes. Although, at this moment,&nbsp;all of that is very nuanced. It’s logical&nbsp;that a lot of people come from a crypto background, because the whole&nbsp;idea of decentralization and everything&nbsp;associated with it, is the same&nbsp;mentality that’s carried over. I think it’s good that&nbsp;crypto and SSI have been parting ways a bit.</p>
<p>I entered the crypto space in 2015-2016 through Bitcoin&nbsp;and then Ethereum; mostly being super-interested in the technology, and just geeking out, diving into it. At some point, I met my&nbsp;co-founders from <a href="https://tykn.tech/">Tykn</a>, and they came from the same space.&nbsp;We saw this big identity problem,&nbsp;and I thought, “Okay, can we marry&nbsp;this idea&nbsp;of decentralization with the problem of identity and&nbsp;privacy and everything?” That was at a&nbsp;very naive stage in early 2017, when everything to do with self-sovereign identity and decentralized identity began to emerge. All those&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;are still very rudimentary; you just hash a certain identifier, and&nbsp;you put that on the chain. No one had said, “Maybe that’s a privacy concern&nbsp;and a correlation concern.”</p>
<p>Everyone was very excited about the potential of these&nbsp;ideas. We built some early proofs-of-concept on Ethereum; at a time when&nbsp;you didn’t have ERC 725, it was&nbsp;just ESC 20s. We saw that this is a lot&nbsp;more complicated than it should be when you’re talking about&nbsp;people needing to have tokens in their&nbsp;wallets to interact with this. The UX was truly a nightmare, even conceptually.</p>
<p>At the time, people also had this idea of verifying credentials when paying for things like gas, which didn’t seem like a very good idea. At a certain point, we saw a group of like-minded&nbsp;people within Sovrin, which had&nbsp;only a couple of other stewards at the&nbsp;time&nbsp;(I think we were the ninth when we onboarded in June or July 2017).&nbsp;They’d been working on&nbsp;this concept of self-sovereign identity for a while. We hooked in on that; we saw,&nbsp;“Okay, these&nbsp;guys have done a lot of work&nbsp;that we thought we still had to do.” So, we dove&nbsp;into that and started flying the&nbsp;sovereign/SSI flag. Shortly after that, we started&nbsp;working with The Netherlands’ Red Cross through the&nbsp;510 data team. For us, that was a very valuable experience in needing&nbsp;to make these things work for people&nbsp;on the ground floor and for high-stakes situations. That was&nbsp;very valuable from the perspective of privacy and the implications. We didn’t want to have any perverse incentives,&nbsp;which you also see in certain models. For example, this is one that’s still&nbsp;around: it’s the idea of data marketplaces. In the humanitarian&nbsp;sector, at least, people were pitching&nbsp;this idea of data marketplaces, where refugees and people who’d been&nbsp;struck by disaster&nbsp;could sell their data. They&nbsp;would get money for it, and then they&nbsp;could use that to sustain themselves.&nbsp;That sounds&nbsp;good, in the sense that, “Oh, you’re&nbsp;empowering people with the&nbsp;power of data; we are giving all&nbsp;this data away anyway, and now — power to&nbsp;the people who can use this to get financial&nbsp;freedom.” But, when you’re&nbsp;talking about people who have been put into such a&nbsp;situation, they will, of course, always sell their&nbsp;data. That’s a perverse incentive, because, at that point, they don’t really have a&nbsp;choice — which&nbsp;doesn’t scale very well. Coming&nbsp;face to face with those realizations&nbsp;was very good for us early on.</p>
<p>Mathieu: We came from the&nbsp;crypto space as well; it was similar to Tykn, in that&nbsp;we had done some early POCs on Ethereum and on some other chains. It was the same problem back in the early days: “Yeah, let’s just throw everything on&nbsp;here, let’s disregard anything else. Yay for immutability,&nbsp;yay for not being able to rewrite&nbsp;data and history, let’s go!”</p>
<p>Then, you realize&nbsp;quite quickly that this doesn’t work. It doesn’t even work for&nbsp;a use case of buying gas, or going to buy a bottle of alcohol. It is interesting; people who come from that space,&nbsp;they get decentralized identity, or they&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/">get self-sovereign identity</a>. It’s&nbsp;more the concept, and not necessarily&nbsp;the implementation, the technology, or the&nbsp;governance, or everything that you could go&nbsp;into. Conceptually, it makes&nbsp;sense. I believe that many people who are advocates for crypto get that right. You gave a presentation earlier this year at the <a href="https://www.btcmiami.com/">North&nbsp;American Bitcoin Conference</a>.&nbsp; I attended&nbsp;that conference in December 2017, which was when the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp">Initial Coin Offerings</a> (ICO) were peaking, and it was crazy.</p>
<p>Jimmy: We were there at the same time, then. It&nbsp;was probably January 2018, the one in Miami.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It was&nbsp;crazy! There were close to 100 presenters at that conference,&nbsp;and half of them were ICO pitches. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Jimmy: That was nuts. We were actually one&nbsp;of the companies presenting, but we&nbsp;weren’t presenting an ICO,&nbsp;and so we stood out in that&nbsp;way. We actually had a booth&nbsp;there as well, and that was the conference&nbsp;where we unveiled&nbsp;our collaboration with the 510 global initiative of the Red Cross, which was done the month before. There were so many ICOs. I was there with Khalid, and I remember the guys next to us. They didn’t really feel&nbsp;right to me; there was something about how&nbsp;they interacted with people that was very&nbsp;defensive. Two months later, they were&nbsp;indicted for&nbsp;securities fraud for 40 million&nbsp;or something.</p>
<p>Mathieu: You can still see&nbsp;some of those classic memes today in crypto: there’s a guy at a party with a Bitcoin&nbsp;Christmas sweater and a guy with an&nbsp;Ethereum&nbsp;sweater, that comes from around that timeframe. It was just pure craziness.</p>
<p>Jimmy:  That was peak madness, because&nbsp;that’s when the market had topped the week before. It was just all-round “Lambo&nbsp;Moon” hype madness.</p>
<p>At the same time, barring those projects, a lot of good things have come out of&nbsp;this as well. What was&nbsp;exciting about that time to me, is&nbsp;that I looked around and saw, “Okay, most of these projects; it’s&nbsp;ridiculous, and they shouldn’t exist.” At the same&nbsp;time, I saw that the underlying technology was still&nbsp;so early, and in a way, it was&nbsp;really shitty; there wasn’t much you could do&nbsp;with it. But to me, this was something that’s super early&nbsp;that’s still going to evolve a lot. You could start to ideate what things might look like in five to ten years.&nbsp;So, in that sense, I’ve tried to remain&nbsp;optimistic but also neutral. I can tell you that a lot of the information is pure hype, and in the short term, that’s going&nbsp;to go very wrong.&nbsp;But then, in the long term, there’s&nbsp;an element of this that’s going to&nbsp;survive, and that element is going to be super&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>It’s the same with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFTs) — a huge hype. A lot of it doesn’t make sense, in that it’s&nbsp;non-persistent. Much of this art is&nbsp;hosted on&nbsp;centralized domains, and the tokens&nbsp;themselves just contain pointers to the&nbsp;centralized domain.&nbsp;If that domain goes down, or if some of these marketplace startups&nbsp;shut down&nbsp;in five to ten years, then your art is gone,&nbsp;and your token’s worthless. That doesn’t&nbsp;make any sense to me.&nbsp;There’s an underlying idea that some of this art that’s created is generative and some not, but it’s actually stored on chain, which is a lot more persistent. I find it interesting that some art will be fully persistent. If we think about how much we are interacting on Zoom and other platforms nowadays, it’s not weird to think that in five years, we’ll get into this “metaverse” idea.</p>
<p>Jamie Burke from Outlier Ventures&nbsp;wrote about the “Open Metaverse”&nbsp;and being involved in these virtual&nbsp;worlds. Of course, having scarcity there is a&nbsp;good idea, just like in the real world.&nbsp;Then that idea becomes appealing, but at the same&nbsp;time,&nbsp;a lot of it is now is hype and it&nbsp;shouldn’t really&nbsp;exist. To clarify, I don’t mean it shouldn’t&nbsp;exist at all; of course, it should, but it doesn’t have persistent, lasting value, and will go through the same cycle.</p>
<p>Mathieu: If you’re thinking about the NFTs&nbsp;today, it’s the same thing as the ICOs were,&nbsp;three years ago. The&nbsp;properties behind it are amazing; the&nbsp;ability to be able to tokenize&nbsp;and create liquidity around pretty much&nbsp;any type of unique asset is quite interesting. Forget “just art”: imagine being able to&nbsp;borrow against it, and to lend against it.&nbsp;There are so many cool things you could do&nbsp;with that.&nbsp; When you went back to&nbsp;the virtual conference this year, you pitched self-sovereign&nbsp;identity&nbsp;to the crypto crowd: How did you&nbsp;approach that?</p>
<p>Jimmy: I try to approach it from a&nbsp;neutral point of view. Oftentimes at these&nbsp;conferences, people pitch their own&nbsp;project or at least shill it, and there’s&nbsp;some financial motivation behind it. The organizers have said, “Don’t do that; try to keep it&nbsp;informational and educational.” That’s what I tried to&nbsp;do. In a couple of slides, I talked about some of the&nbsp;stuff Tykn’s been doing, just from a use case perspective. Really trying to keep it straightforward, as&nbsp;an explanation of&nbsp;how this really works from a high&nbsp;level: how credentials flow, and data flows, and what hits the underlying ledger, and what&nbsp;doesn’t. But then, you already saw in the comments, people asking, “Oh, what’s this project? What’s the&nbsp;token?” No token, no ICO.&nbsp;Just a tech company, building tech&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Mathieu: But, by the way, it could&nbsp;bridge a significant gap between the&nbsp;institutions and crypto, so you want to pay attention.</p>
<p>Jimmy: I wonder when that’s really going to&nbsp;happen. I thought maybe&nbsp;that in this cycle, there would&nbsp;be more of this linkage between&nbsp;the crypto space and SSI space because&nbsp;they’ve separated. I thought maybe some of these <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity-use-cases-in-fintech/">SSI use cases</a> would start to drip into the crypto space, even just for KYC (Know Your Customer).&nbsp;But now, because of more decentralization&nbsp;in the crypto space, with decentralized&nbsp;exchanges and such, you see that, in fact, demand&nbsp;for KYC is becoming less and less — they’re&nbsp;actually moving away from it. For instance, ShapeShift moved to working with decentralized exchanges. Is there really a demand for&nbsp;that now in the crypto space?</p>
<p>I don’t know. Maybe by the time&nbsp;where you have to&nbsp;essentially dox all your wallets, then&nbsp;it might become more interesting. Maybe once it’s necessary to prove that you own certain wallets that becomes interesting, but so far I haven’t really seen that — which is&nbsp;slightly surprising to me. On the other hand, throughout the bear market, blockchain&nbsp;crypto had a&nbsp;bad rep; so, perhaps it’s good that SSI moved itself away from that. In my opinion, that was rational and a good move, because blockchain and that idea of SSI were so strongly connected. There were many misconceptions. There were journalists writing about us,&nbsp;who vaguely understood&nbsp;blockchain and they vaguely understood&nbsp;the premise of SSI. They made assumptions that you could take someone’s identity and put it on a blockchain,&nbsp;and then it can’t be lost anymore, and it’s there forever.</p>
<p>Of course, that isn’t how it works, and that’s not a good message to&nbsp;perpetuate. We got flack&nbsp;from people, saying, “Ah, Tykn’s&nbsp;putting personal information on channels.” No. This is the opposite of what we do. I would be calling&nbsp;these journalists asking, “Oh, could you&nbsp;please amend this in the article?&nbsp;Thank you for writing about us, but could&nbsp;you please correct this?”</p>
<p>Mathieu: But, people get stuck here. I see this often: as soon as the word blockchain enters&nbsp;someone’s mind, they really get stuck on blockchain. It’s&nbsp;not unimportant, but it’s not what you should be focusing on when&nbsp;we’re talking about decentralized&nbsp;identity or self-sovereign identity.</p>
 Digital Identity for At-Risk Populations 
<p>Mathieu: Let’s go back in time to the founding of Tykn: You, Khalid, and there was a third&nbsp;person, I believe.&nbsp;A lot of companies come&nbsp;out of a real -problem. It seemed like this one was a perfect example of a real-world&nbsp;problem; an early&nbsp;contributor to the project,&nbsp;who&nbsp;lost his identity. Would you mind talking through that, and how&nbsp;Tykn came about?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes, that was one of the motivations.&nbsp;He struggled through this problem&nbsp;himself; being a refugee and coming&nbsp;to The Netherlands, without having a birth&nbsp;certificate or anything to prove his history. As a refugee in The Netherlands, there are certain processes with many steps that are required. You go through ten, eleven&nbsp;different&nbsp;kinds of interviews, with different&nbsp;institutions. You have this whole&nbsp;sheet of interviews that you go&nbsp;through to establish things such as your&nbsp;age and everything else.&nbsp;He&nbsp;did have a passport, so he could still have something to show, but for most of the requirements, he didn’t. That&nbsp;lack of track record did impede his ability to integrate&nbsp;better, and to&nbsp;get access to certain&nbsp;opportunities along the way. Of course, while he was within these&nbsp;refugee camps, he saw that there were many people&nbsp;who were worse off, who just had&nbsp;nothing to prove about themselves. Perhaps from a place of&nbsp;good-natured naiveté on our side, we thought — okay, we can solve this.</p>
<p>I feel that a lot&nbsp;of companies are born out of the idea of underestimating how big the problem&nbsp;is: “Oh,&nbsp;we can do this!” Of course, the problem is way bigger than one&nbsp;company could&nbsp;strive to solve, but it did put us&nbsp;on that right track. What’s important for me,&nbsp;and what’s always been important, is to&nbsp;at least make some sort of impact on the status&nbsp;quo to make it better than it is. Maybe we can’t retroactively give billions of&nbsp;people an identifying document — you can’t retroactively give&nbsp;someone a birth certificate. But, you can try to help those&nbsp;people to have a higher degree of access&nbsp;to the current systems without&nbsp;needing that document. To me, that has become an important part of the motivation&nbsp;within Tykn. Of course, there are big regulatory, legal, policy&nbsp;implications. When you’re talking about legal&nbsp;documentation, it’s very hard to change. It will happen eventually; at least, I think that it will happen&nbsp;over time, but&nbsp;that’s not something you can change&nbsp;within the timeframe of five years.&nbsp;Over the past four years, we’ve spoken frequently with policy-makers&nbsp;within different governments. We have worked with different&nbsp;governments through giving&nbsp;awareness sessions,&nbsp;and with large institutions within&nbsp;the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) and IFRC (International Federation of Red Cross), with the United Nations, the&nbsp;Dutch government, the Turkish government. We’ve tried to at least&nbsp;create that awareness and create a&nbsp;discussion. On that front&nbsp;already, it’s done quite a bit of good.</p>
<p>What we were talking about,&nbsp;at the time,&nbsp;was really the far end of the scale for&nbsp;them: the idea of&nbsp;self-sovereignty&nbsp;and coming from a very puristic point&nbsp;of privacy&nbsp;and data control. Some of the&nbsp;things that stuck practically, were the&nbsp;ideas of things such as data minimization. There is a looming idea of what they&nbsp;call ‘surveillance humanitarianism.’ It’s growing to be a more important term and&nbsp;idea, as the opposite of&nbsp;‘surveillance capitalism.’ It’s&nbsp;the idea that by digitizing a lot of these&nbsp;humanitarian aid processes, you are also gathering&nbsp;a lot of data about different people who are at risk of being exposed. You can get a lot of insights into these populations, which can be dangerous. You’ve&nbsp;seen it with the Rohingya people; through&nbsp;the best humanitarian efforts, they&nbsp;became&nbsp;a lot easier to identify. I don’t&nbsp;think that was even a tech problem, but just because of the humanitarian&nbsp;intervention, suddenly, these people&nbsp;became very centralized&nbsp;in certain areas, and they had identification cards. Suddenly, they were an easy target&nbsp;for genocide.&nbsp;That’s of course on the worst end of&nbsp;the spectrum, but it’s also&nbsp;not strange to think that&nbsp;a lot of this tech is being tested in&nbsp;the field. I feel that we’re putting privacy concerns on the back&nbsp;burner, coming from an idea of, “Oh, these people&nbsp;don’t have much anyway”; they are&nbsp;almost entirely digitally excluded. So it&nbsp;doesn’t really matter that much&nbsp;if we don’t safeguard their privacy&nbsp;optimally, or if we&nbsp;store all their information in a central&nbsp;database, or collect their biometric&nbsp;information.&nbsp;That scales very poorly,&nbsp;especially when you’re talking about&nbsp;Sub-Saharan Africa which is digitizing&nbsp;at lightning speed. Over the course of twenty years, it becomes quite dangerous. For us, that’s why that sense of control, data minimization, privacy has to be there as a first building block. Seeing that the conversation has started flowing over the past&nbsp;couple of years, that makes me feel&nbsp;good at least, because it’s a&nbsp;conversation that we didn’t see four&nbsp;years ago. We are definitely not the only ones that have been pushing this.</p>
<p>There are a lot of&nbsp;activists in that space that have&nbsp;been&nbsp;contributing to making this impact. I have personally seen that ‘click’ once we’ve&nbsp;explained it, but at least those core&nbsp;principles got stuck somewhere and are identified as something we have to take&nbsp;seriously. So at least the idea of&nbsp;self-sovereign identity can already produce quite a bit of&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>Mathieu:&nbsp; I guess that&nbsp;naive optimism when jumping into anything is probably not a bad thing, because if&nbsp;you knew the complexity&nbsp;underneath, you might have stayed&nbsp;away from it, right?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes, I think about that a lot. If I had known&nbsp;what was coming and what was ahead in&nbsp;2017,&nbsp;I’d probably have said, “I’m going to do something else, and just sit on my crypto.” Honestly, I would have been&nbsp;better off if I did that.&nbsp;But I have no regrets at all.&nbsp;We actually talked about that this&nbsp;morning during our stand-up. Of course, in the beginning we had to bootstrap a&nbsp;lot before we started raising&nbsp;funds, and even then, we barely paid ourselves out in terms of salary or anything. I was compensating for that&nbsp;within crypto,&nbsp;and even through the bear market, I sold a lot.&nbsp;I’m thinking now that I could have probably just retired at 25, which I don’t think is a good thing, necessarily.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think you guys are clearly trying to&nbsp;make a social impact here, and it’s&nbsp;quite important. Anything that falls outside of that, it’s nice to think about; maybe, it hurts&nbsp;sometimes to think about&nbsp;the missed opportunities.</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes. I don’t think about it&nbsp;too much. What we’ve been doing with&nbsp;Tykn&nbsp;is much more fulfilling to me,&nbsp;and I wouldn’t trade it&nbsp;for a second. So, no regrets.</p>
<p>Mathieu: When I think about privacy, I like to break it down into just two pieces:&nbsp;one being&nbsp;control, or having the ability to control what happens. The second piece is all about&nbsp;transparency or traceability. That could happen with centralized&nbsp;systems but it could also happen&nbsp;with decentralized systems, as well.</p>
<p>Going back to the early days of&nbsp;Tykn; you’re looking to empower&nbsp;people&nbsp;to have control, and transparency&nbsp;and to own their identity. Is that the&nbsp;project that you guys did with the Turkish&nbsp;government?&nbsp;Was that along the&nbsp;same lines?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Exactly. We put that press&nbsp;release out a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp;This is a project that we started in 2019,&nbsp;at least in the research and conceptual phase.&nbsp;We&nbsp;took part in this UN/Turkish government-led accelerator for&nbsp;identity companies&nbsp;to tackle some of the aspects of the&nbsp;refugee crisis&nbsp;in Turkey. Turkey has taken in a lot of&nbsp;Syrian refugees,&nbsp;and they want them to integrate into&nbsp;society. Of course, there are several different facets to different&nbsp;problems within that whole sphere. We went to Turkey multiple times; we&nbsp;went from&nbsp;Istanbul to Gaziantep, which is very&nbsp;close to&nbsp;the border. In Gaziantep, out of the 2.5 million people that live&nbsp;there, 500,000 are refugees. Surprisingly few&nbsp;are still in refugee camps; they’ve put in a lot of effort to&nbsp;be able to integrate them into society.</p>
<p>We went there with a bunch of&nbsp;assumptions, and again, with a certain degree of naiveté. They have this temporary protection&nbsp;card. We know it’s hard for them to move across different geographical areas and to do certain&nbsp;things because they need to get this&nbsp;card updated, and sometimes, they don’t have the&nbsp;mobility.&nbsp;We knew that smartphone&nbsp;penetration&nbsp;was very high amongst the refugee&nbsp;population; a lot higher than people&nbsp;assume. It’s about 94-95 percent, and a lot of&nbsp;families have multiple devices: iPhone,&nbsp;iPad, they love Apple products.&nbsp;We thought, “Okay, we’ll just digitize&nbsp;this temporary protection card and&nbsp;that’s a job done. They can receive the&nbsp;money on their phone, and&nbsp;they can update it remotely, etc. etc.”</p>
<p>However, we got to&nbsp;talk to the refugees on the ground floor, and the people around that; with people from government to local&nbsp;NGOs to&nbsp;United Nations (we try to&nbsp;talk with everyone).&nbsp;Then, we saw that this didn’t&nbsp;even come close to being&nbsp;the actual most pressing issue. They thought the card&nbsp;was annoying, because it’s a piece of&nbsp;plastic that’s just a bit too big to put&nbsp;in your pocket.&nbsp;Further, they said, “that’s annoying, but I don’t really care&nbsp;about that; I have bigger things to&nbsp;worry about. I can’t get a job on paper; my eight-year-old&nbsp;daughter&nbsp;is working full-time in a textile&nbsp;factory&nbsp;for 30 euros a month,” and so on. Those were very&nbsp;heavy and shocking conversations, as they always are. I had a conversation with a&nbsp;colleague about this: the difference between knowing, and&nbsp;understanding. You can know a&nbsp;lot of these facts, and read them from reports and articles, and see them on&nbsp;the news. Understanding: we probably never&nbsp;will, because&nbsp;we’ve never had to go through those experiences. At the least, we can approximate understanding once you have those&nbsp;conversations face-to-face, and when&nbsp;you sit at the table&nbsp;with people and they tell you their&nbsp;eight-year-old daughter is working almost full-time in a textile&nbsp;factory.</p>
<p>We started to look at, and think&nbsp;about this. We saw that one&nbsp;of the pain points was that&nbsp;there’s a work permit application&nbsp;process that employers need to go&nbsp;through in order to employ a refugee.&nbsp;This process is a&nbsp;bit cumbersome; quite long, usually. What often happens,&nbsp;is that the employer passes this&nbsp;process onto an accountant. You have to pay an initial fee for this&nbsp;work permit,&nbsp;and then you have to pay a recurring fee,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;the accountant also charges markup. The way that the accountant does this&nbsp;application process, is that the employer basically gives their&nbsp;information from their&nbsp;portal. Essentially, they give government identity portal&nbsp;login information to the&nbsp;accountant, who also has a lot of other data. The accountant charges a surplus&nbsp;on top of it.</p>
<p>This is not very legal, but what&nbsp;we saw happening&nbsp;often, is that the costs of this work permit were being&nbsp;passed on to the refugee. We started working it&nbsp;out, and we’ve found that&nbsp;for a refugee, oftentimes they end up&nbsp;with less money&nbsp;if they actually work on paper.&nbsp;Of course, that’s a huge&nbsp;disincentive to work, when you can still get your emergency social credit every month,&nbsp;and work under the table and&nbsp;get paid more,&nbsp;because you need to sustain your family. So, we thought maybe&nbsp;we shouldn’t work with the refugees directly, but maybe we should focus on this part&nbsp;with the employers.&nbsp;If we make this work permit application process easier for them to&nbsp;do,&nbsp;then it would give more incentive to&nbsp;hire refugees, and they&nbsp;would be the primary social benefactor.&nbsp;The UN really liked that idea, and the Turkish government really&nbsp;liked that idea.</p>
<p>We started working that out with our product Ana,&nbsp;and we ran a pilot on that in Istanbul, with the Istanbul chamber&nbsp;of commerce, INGEV (a local NGO),&nbsp;and the Ministry of Labour. Essentially, we made&nbsp;it super easy for an employer to receive a certificate of business ownership, and&nbsp;then use that&nbsp;with a statement from an accountant, to&nbsp;be able to apply&nbsp;for a work permit within the application. The pilot was received very&nbsp;well, and it’s now escalated to&nbsp;the top of the presidency office, where we’re now talking about how we can&nbsp;move this forward within their digital&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;framework.</p>
<p>Turkey is very advanced in terms of&nbsp;its digital infrastructure. For some reason, that is not on a lot of&nbsp;people’s radar. For example, Tubitak, which is the research arm of the Turkish government:&nbsp;they’ve been working on indie&nbsp;wallets&nbsp;and sovereign desk networks since 2018.</p>
<p>Many other governments are not thinking about it even now, and they were already looking at that three years ago. So, in that sense, they are very advanced. That’s why it’s been such a pleasure to work with them, because they already know everything. I remember meeting their chief researcher at a UN function somewhere in Ankara, and I was talking to someone else. I was talking <a href="https://northernblock.io/resources/glossary/">about self-sovereign identity</a>, and trying to obscure the terminology a bit to make it easier to understand, like “explain it like I’m five.” This guy came over and said, “Hey, are you talking about self-sovereign identity? Are you talking about Sovrin? Because then we need to talk.” I said, “Yes, absolutely,” which was a really nice moment.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s nice when&nbsp;you can skip that education&nbsp;part; when people are already&nbsp;sold on the concepts. Now, we could focus on what the economics are, and what&nbsp;the business case is.</p>
<p>It seems that going on the ground there really helped&nbsp;you guys understand the dynamics&nbsp;within that ecosystem; to figure out&nbsp;how the economics work. That’s&nbsp;the crucial piece to figure out, if&nbsp;you’re going to make anything work. There’s another key piece too. I know you guys put a lot of focus&nbsp;on UX and design&nbsp;as a company. There are many&nbsp;conversations happening&nbsp;around design in the SSI space. Even just around wallets:&nbsp;more specifically, how do you&nbsp;internationalize wallets?&nbsp;It’s more than just having a switch&nbsp;that you flip the language;&nbsp;people use things differently in&nbsp;different countries. I’m sure that was noticeable as well in Turkey, or with Syrian refugees, around how they use technology. Even looking at intricacies within the apps; how can you make it a better experience, get more&nbsp;engagement, and get more usage?</p>
<p>Would you mind&nbsp;speaking about the&nbsp;importance that you guys place on that,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;how it’s resulted in Ana? I know&nbsp;we’ve talked before, about cloud&nbsp;products and browser products. How&nbsp;does that all tie together for&nbsp;you guys?</p>
<p>Jimmy: It’s a shame Khalid isn’t here, because&nbsp;he’s the chief UX-er. There are some huge things&nbsp;that we’ve seen there, which&nbsp;were very valuable in terms of&nbsp;learning. Like a lot of other <a href="https://northernblock.io/about/">SSI companies</a>, we went being a bunch of geeks working on the whiteboard, to actually having to&nbsp;speak with people and understand, “If we built this, could you use it?” Oftentimes, in the&nbsp;beginning, the answer was “no.” Then, you find out that across population&nbsp;groups, there are a lot of user experience assumptions that we make&nbsp;nowadays. Many things are very intuitive and natural for us now, because&nbsp;the digital products that we’ve been&nbsp;using for the past&nbsp;ten years have certain&nbsp;interactions that&nbsp;are just completely logical to us: filling out a form, scrolling, having it go back using a button. All those things seem very&nbsp;natural to us, but&nbsp;it isn’t inherently&nbsp;natural for a lot of other population&nbsp;groups. When you actually go to test&nbsp;those designs, you see people get stuck.&nbsp;One thing we saw within the Syrian refugee population was that they are a lot more tech-savvy. As I said, a lot of them have iPads; they have iPhones. Syria was&nbsp;generally a technologically advanced&nbsp;society, so they understand those interactions a lot&nbsp;more and there isn’t as much of a gap.</p>
<p>However, with&nbsp;some of the design work with the Red Cross, we did see people for whom it&nbsp;wasn’t ‘intuitive’ when having to scroll&nbsp;and fill out certain forms. You have to think hard about,&nbsp;“Okay, how can I make this as intuitive as&nbsp;possible,”&nbsp;and that also inspired some of the&nbsp;designs for Ana. This probably won’t&nbsp;come as a big surprise,&nbsp;but a service or product that is used almost ubiquitously across&nbsp;population groups&nbsp;is WhatsApp and Facebook. Even people who didn’t understand any&nbsp;other apps; they understood WhatsApp, they&nbsp;understood&nbsp;texting people, and they understood&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and Facebook groups. Many other areas are sometimes quite abstract,&nbsp;and didn’t quite ring globally. Some of the interface within Ana, we try to make it seem like it’s a WhatsApp flow: when you go&nbsp;through certain parts of the onboarding, for instance. It was the same with one-to-one, which the&nbsp;Red Cross project ultimately ended up&nbsp;being called: one-to-one,&nbsp;or cash-based aid.</p>
<p>From an SSI perspective, we took a lot of&nbsp;learnings from that, because we came face-to-face with some of the&nbsp;realities of&nbsp;having to go into the field and making it useful for people. We saw pretty early that the puristic view of SSI, in terms of having everything&nbsp;stored on edge wallets — when you go to somewhere in Sub-Saharan&nbsp;Africa, that’s going to be pretty&nbsp;difficult, when there’s maybe one phone in a&nbsp;village&nbsp;and it’s not&nbsp;even necessarily a smartphone.&nbsp;It’s very easy to say,&nbsp;“Oh yeah, but within SSI, everything has to&nbsp;be stored on the edge wallet.” What we saw was&nbsp;that if you make that this hard&nbsp;requirement, and keep working from that, then&nbsp;all these population groups are just&nbsp;going to be left behind&nbsp;more and more.</p>
 SSI for Privacy and Security Concerns 
<p>For those cases, perhaps it makes more sense to&nbsp;take some of those qualities of SSI in&nbsp;terms of having a higher degree of&nbsp;control and being able to guard that,&nbsp;and&nbsp;have these guardianship models where the information isn’t per se stored locally. For instance, that would allow them to use a feature phone, which is what we’ve been working on: being able to accept credentials and verify credentials using a feature phone, which inherently needs some sort of <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">SSI cloud infrastructure</a>. Obviously, the credential isn’t stored on the feature phone, on the edge in that case. That does open up a lot of these interactions and use cases to these population groups. It’s also better than the status quo, which is something we feel strongly about. Perhaps it’s not in the puristic sense of ‘pure SSI,’ but it is much better than the status quo.</p>
<p>As long as you take certain aspects into account, such as: not having that degree of correlation, still having that degree of&nbsp;privacy, operating from a starting point of user control, and&nbsp;data minimization — they still have the portability. From that point of view, it&nbsp;is a lot better than the status&nbsp;quo, and it’s important to be able to&nbsp;see that nuance across different&nbsp;sectors and within SSI. We’ve&nbsp;also seen it from the other side, within enterprises where they didn’t&nbsp;especially want to have something&nbsp;pure SSI, because they wanted to get&nbsp;certain insights. That’s not a popular idea within SSI for good reason, I think, because&nbsp;that’s something we ultimately want to&nbsp;move away from.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That doesn’t apply for business reasons or&nbsp;for regulatory reasons; there’s no reason&nbsp;why data could not be received&nbsp;and stored and used. Going back to what you’re saying, about removing certain correlations, minimizing&nbsp;the data,&nbsp;and ensuring the user control and&nbsp;transparency, and the different privacy&nbsp;properties, and&nbsp;all the other principles we live by. As&nbsp;long as that’s built into the&nbsp;architecture of what you’re doing; if you want to do&nbsp;business with a bank or with an employer&nbsp;and they need&nbsp;certain information — it’s up to you,&nbsp;to&nbsp;opt into it.</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes. Opt-in, and be able&nbsp;to opt-out, as well. That’s&nbsp;important to me, within SSI as well as complying with GDPR. It’s good that&nbsp;we can request our data back, and request it to be forgotten.&nbsp;I don’t know about you, but I don’t&nbsp;have a list anywhere&nbsp;of companies who have my data, or that I’ve&nbsp;interacted with. So, even being able to have that, and&nbsp;having a ‘nuke’ button&nbsp;that says, “Okay, opt out of all&nbsp;of these,” that would already be pretty&nbsp;great.</p>
<p>At a minimum, becau se of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylWKrg3FjBE">principles of SSI</a>, I think that things like that will become a lot easier within the next five years or so. Ultimately, perhaps it’ll even become a requirement.</p>
<p>Mathieu: On the consumer side, I like what you said about taking&nbsp;messaging into consideration, inside of the user experience. Messaging is the killer application of mobile&nbsp;technology; there’s nothing more used&nbsp;than that. So, I love&nbsp;that this makes sense to&nbsp;literally everyone in the world. If you could try to incorporate a bit of these digital credentials within a messaging experience,&nbsp;it’s very intuitive. It makes sense, and&nbsp;doesn’t force someone to learn&nbsp;something new or get used to using&nbsp;something new, it’s just&nbsp;easy.</p>
<p>Jimmy: That’s something we need to&nbsp;build on. We’ve all become&nbsp;very excited about SSI because of its potentially&nbsp;disruptive properties.&nbsp;You start&nbsp;ideating about what society would&nbsp;look like, in a perfect utopia where this is the norm. You have the people who go a step further, and they’re suggesting, “Oh, maybe we don’t even need&nbsp;governments anymore, because we could&nbsp;just attest to our own existence.” But, at the end of the day, if you build something that’s so&nbsp;completely different, the regular person will just&nbsp;not understand how to even use it, or&nbsp;why I would want that.</p>
<p>A lot of&nbsp;people say, “Oh, but I trust my&nbsp;government,” or “Oh, but I trust my bank, why would I want&nbsp;to step away?” We still see it&nbsp;in crypto: it’s “Oh, I don’t feel comfortable with that. I like having everything in my bank,” and that’s super&nbsp;logical. However, I think that working within SSI, it becomes very easy&nbsp;to have your nose to the whiteboard, and forget&nbsp;that there are other people out there&nbsp;who aren’t as intimately familiar with&nbsp;the technology,&nbsp;its propositions, and the ideology around it. Most&nbsp;people simply want things to work more smoothly, and perhaps as a secondary goal, they want to&nbsp;be less at risk.</p>
<p>This is something that we’ve also seen.&nbsp;In a lot of SSI companies, including us in the beginning, much of what&nbsp;we were saying&nbsp;was based around privacy and security.&nbsp;To many people, that&nbsp;isn’t an appealing value&nbsp;proposition.&nbsp;That assumption is baked-in to a lot of products when you use your bank. They assume with all these&nbsp;regulations it’s all good; it’s a bank, it’s&nbsp;secure and private&nbsp;until proven otherwise. For a lot of&nbsp;people, it’s never proven otherwise.&nbsp;Many people don’t get their identity&nbsp;stolen, so they’re sure it will all be fine. That’s the&nbsp;paradox in The Netherlands; they did some&nbsp;research on it, and found that there’s this privacy paradox of people. Everyone’s&nbsp;concerned about their privacy,&nbsp;but no one necessarily takes the proper&nbsp;actions to ensure that degree of privacy&nbsp;and online security, and even things like password management. I still meet people&nbsp;who&nbsp;have no idea that they shouldn’t reuse&nbsp;passwords. These are people my age,&nbsp;and they just have no idea why&nbsp;that would be risky.</p>
<p>That’s something we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;consider as well. When&nbsp;you put this out there,&nbsp;a lot of people simply want things to&nbsp;go more smoothly,&nbsp;and they don’t necessarily have a strong&nbsp;opinion on how that happens. Many&nbsp;people don’t understand why biometrics may be bad, especially if we consider what’s happening in China. It has taken quite a lot of education&nbsp;of the tail risks of implementing&nbsp;something like that;&nbsp;of having all your biometrics&nbsp;in a central database that can be&nbsp;accessed by governments and who knows else. They only see, “Oh, but wouldn’t it be&nbsp;great to walk through the&nbsp;airport, and they scan your face, and you&nbsp;get on the plane.” From a user experience&nbsp;point of view that could be pretty great,&nbsp;but then from a point of view of&nbsp;privacy and security,&nbsp;maybe not.</p>
<p>Mathieu: At our company,&nbsp;we laugh every time we ask a company&nbsp;we’re talking to about their&nbsp;security. “I don’t know, we hash our data,&nbsp;and we do this and&nbsp;it’s quite funny, To&nbsp;your point here, it comes down to the lowest&nbsp;friction and the most utility. I saw numbers the&nbsp;other day: today there are 2.8 billion&nbsp;people who use Facebook products,&nbsp;and they’re awesome to a lot of&nbsp;people. Why would they not want to&nbsp;use them, when there’s so much utility to it?</p>
<p>Jimmy: That’s also a point. It’s really hard to get away&nbsp;from that&nbsp;grip now. Even if I think&nbsp;about it myself; I still have a Facebook&nbsp;profile,&nbsp;just because my grandparents have a Facebook profile. Especially now, because my&nbsp;grandfather’s&nbsp;pretty sick and it’s magic; it’s the only way for him to see me,&nbsp;and my sister in the UK,&nbsp;and my parents in Spain. We can all&nbsp;see him at the same time&nbsp;while he’s in bed. To him, it’s magical.&nbsp;For me, that’s huge, so it does bring a lot of good&nbsp;things to people’s lives. But then, most people don’t&nbsp;understand the potential risks of having that&nbsp;power within Facebook. We spoke&nbsp;briefly about things like the Open Metaverse in the future.&nbsp;Facebook is already making a big bet on that with Oculus and all these other devices that you’ll need a&nbsp;Facebook account to use. They’re already extending that&nbsp;control&nbsp;which in the long term is very scary. A lot of people don’t&nbsp;inherently care about that, because they&nbsp;just want to receive that&nbsp;utility, which is logical.</p>
<p>Mathieu:&nbsp;For sure. We’re having these utopian&nbsp;conversations about&nbsp;self-sovereign identity and how&nbsp;everything’s going to be on the edge; everyone’s going to own their keys,&nbsp;everyone’s going to own their&nbsp;credentials.&nbsp;There are similar conversations if we jump back on&nbsp;the crypto side; we want to&nbsp;have the right principles baked in.</p>
<p>Over the past&nbsp;decade, the rise of cloud, mobility, and connectivity have&nbsp;created&nbsp;so much usability and so much utility. It’s lowered friction for so many&nbsp;things that you have to use these products. Again,&nbsp;to your point earlier about still interacting with banks: banks are custodians of your money,&nbsp;your fiat money.&nbsp;There are several issues with banks, but they do provide very valuable&nbsp;services. The same thing should be true&nbsp;when we talk about identity and&nbsp;credentials. It’s crazy to think that people are&nbsp;going to store their credentials&nbsp;on an edge wallet, similar to the way the&nbsp;maximalists&nbsp;store their crypto on an edge wallet. That’s such a small&nbsp;percentage of the population, and&nbsp;it doesn’t work well. So,&nbsp;how do you bake the correct principles that we’re&nbsp;advocating, into existing models and augment them? We’re not jumping from 20 percent to 100 percent, but we’re jumping from 20 to&nbsp;25; we have some goals to get to 30,&nbsp;and to keep improving that. I love what you guys are doing and&nbsp;how you guys are thinking about that, with your product suite and&nbsp;your vision for the future.</p>
<p>Jimmy: We’re totally aligned on that. I think ultimately, as you said, it’s a very puristic view that’s&nbsp;come from the crypto space, where it’s&nbsp;natural. You have&nbsp;to manage your own keys, unless you want to keep it on&nbsp;a centralized exchange— which historically&nbsp;hasn’t gone very well. Then, you have&nbsp;these hardware wallets and&nbsp;where you store it, which is essentially on the&nbsp;edge, or at least your keys. If that’s for a regular&nbsp;user, that’s not going to fly, it’s not going to&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>I have many friends and&nbsp;family who&nbsp;are now diving head-first in crypto — of course, because things are at&nbsp;all-time high. I even have to persuade them to&nbsp;spend 80 euros on&nbsp;a hardware wallet, so that it’s not on&nbsp;an exchange and&nbsp;they’re not at risk of huge loss. When you have something like that,&nbsp;but storing it in something like MetaMask, they already find that&nbsp;more comfortable. Ideally, you would&nbsp;use MetaMask with&nbsp;a hardware wallet. That way, you could have it&nbsp;in your browser, but you can still sign&nbsp;it with your hardware wallet, that is, your&nbsp;physical wallet.</p>
<p>I think for identity, something will&nbsp;need to happen where I can at least sign it with my phone,&nbsp;perhaps. Most of the applications&nbsp;are just browser-based, even&nbsp;for different use cases. We talked about this last time, in&nbsp;terms of different stakes and levels of&nbsp;assurance needed. For certain use cases you wouldn’t even&nbsp;need to sign it off. I would love it if&nbsp;a “one-password solution” were able to&nbsp;integrate verifiable credentials. I would simply use my&nbsp;one password, and be able to&nbsp;access all these services. In a way, you could say that approach defeats the point of decentralization, but&nbsp;for a lot of use cases that makes a lot&nbsp;more sense.&nbsp;There’s so&nbsp;much nuance in this, because it’s such&nbsp;a new space.</p>
<p>I think we’ve&nbsp;only seen the tip of the iceberg of the change that this technology&nbsp;will provoke. Take the example of your diploma: we use our diploma&nbsp;to get access to certain job opportunities. You use the presentation of your diploma to provide that you’ve put in the work. But, what we mostly use it for, is signalling; we put that information on our&nbsp;LinkedIn profile. It’s the same with our job history. I might use an employment&nbsp;statement to&nbsp;get a mortgage or something, but&nbsp;mostly, it’s on my LinkedIn profile for&nbsp;signalling.&nbsp;That is data that I want to be&nbsp;public information, and what most of us&nbsp;want to be public information.&nbsp;So, we should have an&nbsp;option to make certain credentials public. I should&nbsp;have the power for myself, to turn that&nbsp;off and make it private again. I should have the option to&nbsp;not disclose that to anyone at all, but&nbsp;then I also should have the option to&nbsp;make that public.&nbsp;A lot of those things, it’s&nbsp;still relatively new&nbsp;and we’re only just thinking about this.</p>
<p>It’s the&nbsp;same with peer-to-peer credentials. I started&nbsp;thinking about that, when my girlfriend was from Canada. She said that in Canada (and you probably know&nbsp;more about this than I do) if you want to&nbsp;get a new passport,&nbsp;you need to get a bunch of people from&nbsp;your circles to attest that you exist.&nbsp;You need to get five people to say, “Oh yes, I know&nbsp;Mathieu. He’s my brother, or he’s my&nbsp;colleague, or he’s my friend, or he’s my&nbsp;neighbour.”&nbsp;Of course, for some applications, p2p credentials would be quite interesting. There are&nbsp;so many other uses that we haven’t even&nbsp;thought of yet. So, yes, I think within that&nbsp;nuance, we’re going to see a lot of billion-dollar companies&nbsp;spinning up within these little corners. This is what excites me about SSI, because it’s still so new. It’s so young and so early, relative to what it&nbsp;will look like ten years from now.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes, I totally agree with you. I would&nbsp;love to have a further conversation&nbsp;with you; there’s a bunch of other stuff we could&nbsp;talk about. I think&nbsp;the whole concept of <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials-for-fintech/">using verifiable&nbsp;credentials</a> for signalling is quite a funny one, if you look&nbsp;ahead. I love that idea. Thinking about&nbsp;the peer-to-peer credential: you start&nbsp;talking about the value of relationships,&nbsp;and how that could start building&nbsp;up. I think we could go on for a long&nbsp;time on these subjects, but Jimmy, I want to thank you so much for doing&nbsp;this with me today.</p>
<p>Jimmy: It was&nbsp;a pleasure, it was really nice.&nbsp;Maybe we do need to have a part two, someday. Let’s plan for that.</p>

 The GiD Report#153 — The age of the digital wallet has&nbsp;arrived <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-152-how-economists-corrupted-the-internet-d4ea0861475f">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-is-hipaa-compliant-1e8cdf915ab6">GlobaliD is HIPAA compliant</a></p><p>This week:</p>  Digital wallets will gut traditional banks  The U.S. isn’t behind in digital payments&nbsp;anymore  Visa lets you settle in&nbsp;crypto  This week in tech&nbsp;policy  The rise of the Sovereign Writer  Thinky longreads on Likes and&nbsp;music  Stuff happens  What’s in your digital wallet? Photo: NeONBRAND 1. Digital wallets will ‘gut’ traditional banks <p>(According to Cathie Wood, who manages the largest actively managed ETF in the world. H/T <a href="https://gritcapital.substack.com/p/fintech-is-eating-the-world">Grit&nbsp;Capital</a>)</p><p>Here’s a crazy stat <a href="http://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> pointed out last&nbsp;night:</p><blockquote>Market cap of top 4 U.S. banks =&gt; $1.1&nbsp;trillion</blockquote><blockquote>Market cap of top 4 cryptocurrencies =&gt; $1.2&nbsp;trillion</blockquote><p>Pretty wild.</p><p>Remember when Marc Andreessen claimed that software would eat the world? Well, apparently fintech is eating the world now (<a href="https://gritcapital.substack.com/p/fintech-is-eating-the-world">according to Genevieve Roch-Decter in her latest newsletter</a> — also via <a href="http://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>).</p><p>Some key&nbsp;charts:</p><p>Because the future won’t be about&nbsp;banks.</p><p>It’ll be about digital&nbsp;wallets:</p><blockquote>A DIGITAL WALLET is a service that allows you to pay for things, usually through a mobile phone app connected to a credit card, debit card or even a bank account. It stores a number of other items, such as a driver’s license, gift/loyalty cards, tickets for entertainment events, and transportation passes. It can also contain private keys for cryptocurrencies and some even let you hold&nbsp;stocks.</blockquote><p>Would be cool to keep my COVID creds and NFTs there,&nbsp;too.</p><p>Welcome to GlobaliD (powered by&nbsp;Uphold).</p> 2. Remember when the U.S. used to be way behind in digital payments? <p>That’s no longer the case, <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/25/america-used-to-be-behind-on-digital-payments-not-any-more">according to The Economist</a>:</p><blockquote>It has been a while coming. In 2018 Ant Financial, China’s payments giant, raised private funds at a valuation of $150bn. It was common then to hear Chinese executives say that America, land of the posted cheque and the hand-signed credit-card receipt, was years behind, held back by a cosy club of banks and credit-card firms.</blockquote><blockquote>Now investors have decided the moment has come. Take PayPal, a digital-payments firm set up in 1999 to allow users of Palm Pilots, a forebear of smartphones, to “beam” each other money. It was later bought by eBay, an online marketplace, which spun it out in 2015 for $45bn. Today it is worth $275bn, more than Citigroup or Wells Fargo. It is also more valuable than Ant, which has fallen out of favour with regulators in China and has been forced to cancel its initial public offering.</blockquote><blockquote>Enthusiasm for digital-payments companies has been whetted by the pandemic. The share price of PayPal has jumped 186% in the past 12 months while shares in Square, an American rival, have more than quintupled and those of Adyen, based in Amsterdam, have nearly tripled. The digital boom is luring credit-card colossi and tech titans, such as Visa and Google, to online payments.</blockquote> 3. Speaking of Visa, they let you settle in crypto&nbsp;now <p>“This is huge.” — <a href="http://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a></p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/visa-uses-anchorage-to-settle-usdc-transaction-on-ethereum-in-further-crypto-push">The news</a>:</p><blockquote>Visa has processed a cryptocurrency payment directly on the Ethereum blockchain as part of a new service the payment giant plans to introduce to its partners later this&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>The move, the latest sign of increased adoption of digital currencies by the old-guard financial industry, bumped the price of bitcoin (BTC, +2.57%) and ether (ETH, +6.05%) roughly 5%&nbsp;each.</blockquote><blockquote>Per a press release shared with CoinDesk, Crypto.com sent a USDC (-0.06%) stablecoin transaction on Ethereum to an account at Anchorage custody under Visa’s name. Crypto.com issues “crypto-backed” Visa cards that allow its users to spend the coins in their Crypto.com wallet.</blockquote><blockquote>United States dollar coin, or USDC, is a stablecoin pegged 1-to-1 with the dollar. It is the second-largest stablecoin with an $11 billion capitalization.</blockquote><p>“Yep.” — <a href="http://global.id/shadi">/shadi</a></p><p>All the other fintech&nbsp;stuff:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/germany-central-bank-tests-blockchain-solution-counter-cbdc">Germany’s Central Bank Tests Blockchain Solution to Counter CBDCs — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/covid-fraud-costs-americans-382-million-dollars.html">Covid-related fraud has cost Americans $382&nbsp;million</a>  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/fintech-how-covid-affected-payments-and-the-underbanked-7q2233xm">Fintech: How COVID Affected Payments and the Underbanked | Hacker&nbsp;Noon</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/federal-reserve-s-digital-dollar-momentum-worries-wall-street?sref=daDAhXzz">Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall&nbsp;Street</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/25/america-used-to-be-behind-on-digital-payments-not-any-more">America used to be behind on digital payments. Not any&nbsp;more</a>   4. This week in tech&nbsp;policy: <p>On <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-00b41ffa-8aac-4433-ac3f-efc4ea32ecc6.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">new tech&nbsp;laws</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: Democrats, empowered in Congress and enraged by misinformation over vaccines and the election, agree it’s time to legislate on tech policy, including updating the key law that shields them from liability from user-generated content. The path to passing a bill is a little clearer, and there have been signs that the largest tech platforms are ready to embrace some&nbsp;changes.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: Pallone said he wants to take aim at online platforms’ financial incentives to amplify misinformation and extreme&nbsp;content.</blockquote><blockquote>“The more outrageous and extremist the content is, the more engagement and clicks they get, and therefore the more advertising dollars they get,” Pallone told Axios. “If nothing else, I’d like to create a disincentive for these companies to amplify this content that leads to violence.”</blockquote><blockquote>In an op-ed ahead of the hearing, Facebook disputed the notion the company has a financial interest “in turning a blind eye to misinformation,” saying, “We have every motivation to keep misinformation off of our apps and we’ve taken many steps to do so at the expense of user growth and engagement.”</blockquote><p>On <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-950953c7-ec6d-4280-86a7-8b5206cde00f.html">last week’s&nbsp;hearing</a>:</p><blockquote>Lawmakers at Thursday’s hearing on misinformation were less interested in getting answers from the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google than in warning the social media giants that a legislative hammer is about to land on them, Kim, Ashley and Margaret&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: In a gruelingly long session conducted entirely by video conference, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee told the CEOs their businesses prioritize ad revenue and engagement over rooting out misinformation and content that harms users, especially children.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: The relatively consistent lines of questioning, sometimes crossing party lines, displayed a new unity among members of Congress in their concern about the companies — and a stronger likelihood that they might pass punitive&nbsp;laws.</blockquote> 5. The rise of the Sovereign Writer <p>Here’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/">a cool Stratechery piece</a>, highlighted by <a href="http://global.id/anej">/anej</a>, who&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>Ben Thompson made a good piece on so-called sovereign writers that thrive off of Substack and he makes a good point with “the problem with the social networks is that they want to own the reader, but the entire point of the sovereign writer is that they own their audience. “</blockquote><blockquote>With the feed and publishing capabilities and addition of wallet we can easily compete in that space as well. Email per se is still just a&nbsp;channel.</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/">here’s Ben on The Sovereign Writer</a>:</p><blockquote>I am by no means an impartial observer here; obviously I believe in the viability of the sovereign writer. I would also like to believe that Stratechery is an example of how this model can make for a better world: I went the independent publishing route because I had no other choice (believe me, I&nbsp;tried).</blockquote><blockquote>At the same time, I suspect we have only begun to appreciate how destructive this new reality will be for many media organizations. Sovereign writers, particularly those focused on analysis and opinion, depend on journalists actually reporting the news. This second unbundling, though, will divert more and more revenue to the former at the expense of the latter. Maybe one day Substack, if it succeeds, might be the steward of a Substack Journalism program that offers a way for opinion writers and analysts to support those that undergird their&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>What is important to understand, though, is that Substack is not in control of this process. The sovereign writer is another product of the Internet, and Substack will succeed to the extent it serves their interests, and be discarded if it does&nbsp;not.</blockquote> 6. And If you want more thinky&nbsp;stuff: <p>Here’s <a href="https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/the-logic-of-the-like/">a longread about&nbsp;Likes</a>:</p><blockquote>And yet, as new communication technologies expand and come to structure more and more of our interactions, it is hard to avoid feeling there is something lost in living by the Logic of the Like. We reach for terms like “homogeneous,” “simple” or “flat” in order to express some truth about life in a world reduced to vectors of attraction and revulsion. Homogeneous, because of the tendency to steer ourselves toward others who already view the world as we do. Simple, in that complex emotional life is compressed into a single scale with only two sides: like and not like. Flat, because it seems to reduce the depth and texture of&nbsp;life.</blockquote><blockquote>But these terms fail to capture what is perhaps the most potent feature of the Logic of the Like, which is its seeming inescapability. It is similar to Thomas Hobbes’s theory of religion. We create a God whose needs and desires in turn come to control us. And the Logic of the Like is a jealous God. It admits nothing outside of itself, even its own negation. For example, suppose you decided to reject homogeny and seek out difference, contingency and surprise. A noble pursuit, perhaps, but easily assimilable: “I think we should expose ourselves to difference” is exactly what someone like you would say. It is a self-organizing system but also a self-enclosing one.</blockquote><p>And another one <a href="https://prospect.org/power/islands-in-the-stream-spotify-youtube-music-monopoly/">about the plight of musicians</a> (in a world full of monopolies).</p> 7.

At the same time, ID.me’s digital calling card can be reused wherever the company’s got a contract, meaning the same DMV visitor in California could drive to Las Vegas and use it to check in at the MGM Grand casino, skipping the front desk. “Portable logins aren’t trusted, and trusted logins aren’t portable,” Hall&nbsp;says.</blockquote>  Via <a href="http://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a> — <a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/idme-brings-in-100m-at-unicorn-valuation">ID.me brings in $100M at unicorn valuation | PitchBook</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/antoine">/antoine </a>— <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/idemia-brings-mobile-id-technology-to-arizona-301255469.html">IDEMIA Brings Mobile ID Technology to&nbsp;Arizona</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/anej">/anej </a>— <a href="https://www.protocol.com/amp/slack-messaging-connect-2651183388?__twitter_impression=true">WhatsApp for work: Slack is turning into a full-on messaging app</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-153-the-age-of-the-digital-wallet-has-arrived-76e32a1aba69">The GiD Report#153 — The age of the digital wallet has arrived</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Gimly is excited to start the EOSIO identity working group WG (Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=eosio_id">#eosio_id</a>)! This open working group (WG) will create and foster identity solutions using <a href="https://eos.io">EOSIO</a> technology, by creating open W3C compliant self-sovereign identity standards, interoperability, and ecosystem development for eosio based identities.</p>
<p>Gimly has been working in the SSI ecosystem for over two years, closely with the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=eosio_id">Decentralised Identity Foundation</a> and <a href="https://sphereon.com">Sphereon</a>, and has been the core development partner of <a href="https://www.gimly.io/europechain">Europechain</a> for the creation and implementation of the <a href="https://www.gimly.io/blog/gimly-europechain-myd-ssi">MyD</a> sovereign identity portal. We are working with the <a href="https://www.gimly.io/blog/gimly-in-essif-ssi-and-nfc-smartcards">European self-sovereign identity Framework lab</a> and <a href="https://ontochain.ngi.eu">Ontochain</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu">European Next Generation Internet</a> initiative, and building an <a href="https://www.gimly.io/blog/gimly-wins-momentum">SSI pilot with KLM/DHL</a> to improve cargo supply chain. </p>
<p>From our experience with Europechain and knowledge of the EOSIO ecosystem, we are excited to bring our experiences and allow EOSIO identity systems to participate in the larger SSI ecosystem. We see this as a pivotal technology to allow enterprises and governments to safely and ethically manage identities and data exchange, and an enabling tool for blockchain and non-blockchain applications.</p>

This can be used by #EOS, #Telos, #WAX, #Europechain, voice.com and more to create self-sovereign identities. The 2nd meeting on of the WG will start planning the DID method. To progress this work item, we have already created a full draft of the EOSIO DID method which we will release next week. As part of this work, we have submitted to W3C a new cryptographic material type called <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/188">Verification Condition</a> needed for EOSIO DIDs.</p><p>Stay tuned to the Gimly <a href="https://twitter.com/gimly_io">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gimly-blockchain">Linkedin</a> where we will announce the EOSIO DID method and the following WG meetings! </p><p>Gimly is hiring!</p><p>Gimly will be participating in the eSSIf-lab second infra call with our connector for using NFC smartcards in SSI solutions AND we will be conbtributing to the NGI-ontochain project with a self-sovereign datavault and identity management panel.</p><p>For these projects and ongoing work with clients, we are looking for a new mid-level full-stack developer as well as a senior product development manager.

 Providing further clarity on circulating supply during the first month, and supply schedules.  From the Shyft Network&nbsp;Team: <p>Hi everyone, as we begin to distribute and hand over the core protocol to the ecosystem and community, we wanted to quickly put out a high-level breakdown to provide more context, as well as a better high-level view of how we see economic circulation and productive supply across the Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>We also want to notify anyone inspecting the contract’s values moving here and there, that we will be shortly moving assets to Cold&nbsp;Storage.</p><p>The way to look at Shyft Network’s economics is through streams of productivity and how those tranches are formulated, what they are intended to achieve, and what role they play across the macroeconomics as well as micro operational needs of any ecosystem or use&nbsp;case.</p><p>Circulating supply and total supply are often black and white, and the numbers are meant to be a macro snapshot of the entire universe. Within this universe, are a variety of asset tranches that are not meant to be a part of the active circulating supply, but are regulating pools of liquidity that were designed for certain use cases and network-effect-specific outcomes.</p><p>Below is a high-level breakdown that should help our community understand the distinction between Active Circulating Supply, Inactive Supply, and Total Supply, and how self-regulating asset pools play into&nbsp;this.</p> The sum of all liquidity in the&nbsp;universe <p>Let’s start by describing what self-regulating asset pools are. These pools are, primarily, use-case-controlled circulating reserves that become a part of the percentage of circulating supply, but are pre-programmed into smart contracts that have specific use cases and are autonomous applications (pre-built in-system use&nbsp;cases).</p><p>These tranches are designed to regulate and accelerate economic activity as cross-protocol total supply balancers. They are not meant for operational disbursement and are not allocated to participants of the ecosystem, but are liquidity pools that act to autonomously expand, decrease, accelerate or slow down the total usage and supply of the overall ecosystem. These asset pools were designed as mechanisms to help regulate and keep the ecosystem functional, plus incentivizing stability and longevity. Here are some examples of these self-regulating pools (for more information on these tranches, please see our <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-token-distribution-and-economics-d2d9a146504e">Token Economics blog&nbsp;post</a>):</p><p>1. Synthetic Asset Wrap Rewards<br>2. LP Pool &amp; Liquidity Rewards<br>3. Economic Metagame<br>4. Next-Gen&nbsp;DEFI</p><p>What goes into the Active Circulating Supply? The following buckets and tranches are considered active or can be active when deployed (some will remain inactive for a long period of time), and can be counted towards the Active Circulating Supply when deployed on the&nbsp;network.</p> Operational Liquidity. <p>Over the next 7 years, these tranches and allocations are defined and allocated across the distribution schedules for the network’s operational activities. These are asset pools that can become active when they enter circulation. They are meant to provide liquidity to new projects, like <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/is-compliance-the-next-wave-for-defi-a4baf6c0e70c">compliant DeFi</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/shyft-network-to-build-opt-in-compliance-primitives-on-the-oasis-network-393388c51f71">strategic partnerships</a>, marketing activities, and community DAOs that incentivize the growth of our developer community. Here are some specific tranches that work within this&nbsp;bucket:</p><p>Ecosystem Development (Support): To be used on operations, liquidity, partnerships, federation bootstrapping, marketing, foundation &amp; DAO creation.<br>1. Public Distribution<br>2. Shyft Network Treasury<br>3. VASP Initializer</p> Purchaser, Team &amp;&nbsp;Advisors <p>These are the incredible people who have made this global ecosystem possible by supporting it, advising, or directly working on it for the last 4 years, and who are committed to continue working alongside all of you as an open community over the coming&nbsp;years.</p><p>1. Ongoing Technical Partnerships<br>2. Purchasers (earlier purchaser private sale)<br>3. Strategic Partnerships (The latest strategic purchaser private sale)<br>4. Core&nbsp;Team</p> So, let’s add it up and see what it looks like for the first month after&nbsp;launch. <blockquote>Active Initial Circulating Supply = Community + Team &amp; Active Liquidity Management</blockquote><blockquote>Estimated Month 1 = 10,700,001 SHFT Active Initial Circulating Supply<br>(until Mainnet *subject to liquidity provisioning requirements*)</blockquote><p>Community<br>2,500,000 (Polkastarter sale)<br>1,616,666 (Marketing, primarily over 4 months, using linear distribution contracts)<br>— — — — — — -<br>4,116,666 (Total Active Tokens in the community)</p><p>Team &amp; Active Liquidity Management<br>5,000,000 (Initial LP Pools)<br>1,583,334 (Marketing/Team budget)<br> — — — — — — -<br>6,583,335 (Total Active Tokens for active&nbsp;usage)</p> Inactive Liquidity <p>All remaining tokens will either be in cold storage (unless otherwise notified with due time through a major wide-access information platform) or placed into contract storage for autonomous applications to utilize as our technical production schedule progresses.</p><p>As liquidity requirements increase through use case demand, treasury reserves will be unlocked and allocated accordingly for liquidity provisioning partnerships.</p><p>These are all the tokens in circulating supply until the Shyft Mainnet launches (eta April, depending on federation members’ go ahead as, at this point, the network is not under the control of Shyft Network&nbsp;Inc.).</p><p>Following Mainnet Launch, the following buckets will form part of the Active Circulating Supply:</p>  Federation Node Inflation (up to 2% of 2.5 billion tokens, per year, as economic requirements dictate);  Community Grants Programs (up 2% of 2.5 billion tokens, per year, as economic requirements dictate);  Shyft Network’s <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/fatf-travel-rule-solution-the-2020s-vision-8500eeb0a750">Veriscope </a>— there are liquid tokens available to partners that will be utilizing them within Veriscope as network&nbsp;gas.  <p>We will describe in Medium posts any additional buckets that become active shortly before the Shyft Mainnet launch. Also, stay tuned; during the following weeks we’ll roll out deep dives, roadmap and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote>

					 One woman’s open-source journey to decentralized identity—with the help of Indicio.tech 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Noha Abuaesh, a Bahrain-based computer scientist, has been exploring decentralized identity for the last year, often with assistance from Indicio.tech’s open-source tools and free communications channels. She took a moment to answer some questions about her work and her journey in the decentralized identity space.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>(The conversation has been edited for length and clarity)</p>
<p>What’s your background and how did you come to be interested in decentralized identity?</p>
<p>I graduated computer engineering in 2007. My graduation project was in robotics. I worked as a technical writer for a while before I completed a master’s in computer science in 2014. My thesis was on embedded systems. Then, I became a dedicated homemaker until late 2018, when I decided to explore my career possibilities.</p>
<p>I felt like one of the seven sleepers, (who slept for about 300 years to avoid persecution; they appear in both the Quran and Christian tradition —ed.) if you know their story. Because in the insane world of computer science, if you snooze for four years—or even less—it can feel like you have been sleeping for centuries! I really didn’t know where to start. Long story short, I took a couple of professional courses, then a nanodegree on blockchain development. I built some projects on Ethereum and Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until last year when I came through a LinkedIn post on self-sovereign identity. I was intrigued. So, I started reading about it, took an edX course on self-sovereign identity and Hyperledger technologies. I was blown away with the potential of this field. I knew I wanted to continue there. I thought, if I am to plan for the next five years of my career, I want to be in this area.</p>
<p>What kind of decentralized identity work are you doing now?</p>
<p>I am now building my first SSI wallet using Hyperledger Indy, experimenting with what can be done with it and exploring its possible use cases. It is command line-based, just a proof-of-concept kind of a thing. I can work on the interface later (or maybe never). There are many cool general-purpose SSI wallets out there with pretty cool user interfaces.</p>
<p>What are your goals in exploring decentralized identity?</p>
<p>Anyone who learns about decentralized technology knows the enormous potential it has in many different applications. Decentralized identity will touch the lives of billions of people in the future. It promises to be the magic wand to a lot of the problems many people are living with now. Who doesn’t want to be part of that? I am looking to be a field expert in this area, inshallah. I am really hoping I can do something with it for the good of humanity.</p>
<p>What Indicio resources have you used in your explorations?</p>
<p>I used Indicio’s TestNet. They have a strong support system. They also have documentation with very clear steps for what to do and what to expect when you run your software development kit. I couldn’t find that anywhere else. I made use of that and other articles as well. At some point, I left a note on their website, not really expecting anything. I was surprised to find their response in my mailbox a couple of days later. They offered a FREE 30-minute session to answer my questions!</p>
<p>What have been your challenges or obstacles to overcome?</p>
<p>Installing the Indy SDK on Windows was challenging for me. Either because it is the very first thing I faced when I decided to work on this, or because it really is a cumbersome process. Nevertheless, I got that working at the end, thank God.</p>
<p>The community is relatively small. At first, my questions didn’t seem to get any attention when I posted them in the public help group. When you compare that with other developer communities that, sometimes, answer your questions within an hour or two, well — it was disappointing. It is really tough when you are new to something and you don’t know where to go for assistance. However, Indicio’s engineering team, I have to say, are doing a great job serving the community in this area.</p>
<p>Another challenge I faced was outdated documentation. It took me some time to get some of the information together. Also, some features are not very well-documented. At times, I had to refer to Jira threads to know what is going on. I am so glad they are keeping these public!</p>
<p>What’s next for you as the field continues to accelerate?</p>
<p>Well, to be honest, I really am not sure what my next step will be. But I am certain that the future holds good things both for me, and for decentralized identity.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *</p>

   Introduction  With their recent appearance on SNL, NFTs have gone mainstream. This is great news for helping creators get paid, and for driving blockchain adoption.  However, the label “NFT” holds a frustrating — but readily solvable — problem. I will explain with analogy to UFOs.

This is great news for helping creators get paid, and for driving blockchain adoption.</p><p>However, the label “NFT” holds a frustrating — but readily solvable — problem. I will explain with analogy to UFOs. Consider the following headline:</p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/22/us-government-ufo-report-sightings">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/22/us-government-ufo-report-sightings</a><p>There are UFO sightings that want further explanation. Similarly, there are fungibility sightings for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For example, RAC’s TAPE token is considered NFT yet follows ERC20 fungible token standard. Limited-edition NFTs appear to be interchangeable. There are more examples.</p><p>This essay explores these sightings, and proposes a modest explanation, which as a bonus shows new opportunities.</p> The fungible in “non-fungible” <p>Here are some fungibility sightings.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC_(musician)">RAC</a> is a Grammy-winning musician operating in the realm of NFTs. In early 2020, he released <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/64760/ethereum-tokenized-cassette-dj-rac-zora-grammy">$TAPE</a>&nbsp;. There are 100 TAPE tokens. You can redeem 1.0 of them for exactly one physical cassette tape of RAC’s “BOY” album. 1 TAPE is currently trading at <a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape">$4200</a>, easily the most expensive cassette tape&nbsp;ever.</p><p>You can substitute 1 TAPE for any other TAPE token; they are mutually interchangeable. This is the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fungible">definition</a> of fungible, not non-fungible. TAPE are implemented in ERC20 — the standard for fungible tokens, not non-fungible. You can even interchange a fraction of&nbsp;TAPE.</p><a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape">1.0 TAPE for 1 “BOY” cassette tape by RAC [Image from&nbsp;zora.co]</a><p>Consider <a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1126506339075641344">Unisocks</a>, ticker $SOCKS. There are 500 SOCKS tokens. You can redeem 1.0 of them for exactly 1 pair of physical socks. 1 SOCKS is currently trading at <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/unisocks">$86K</a>, having peaked at $164K. You could trade a pair of socks <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1360446856392810497">for a Tesla</a>! <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais">Mike Demarais</a> is a self-proclaimed <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1220875073252401153">SOCKS shill</a> 🧦. SOCKS are implemented in ERC20, the standard for fungible&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Let’s contemplate “NFT limited editions”. Consider the <a href="https://nbatopshot.com/listings/p2p/c561f66b-5bd8-451c-8686-156073c3fb69+f2a3c763-f7ff-4342-a209-44a34cdf1d02">“Damian Lillard Dunk” NBA Top Shot NFT</a>. There are 6 editions. There may be unique serial numbers but those numbers matter so little that they’re not even shown on the GUI. You can swap one of these NFTs for another; they are mutually interchangeable. Interchangeable = fungible.</p><p>Consider ERC1155 token standard. If you mint one token, it’s non-fungible, since there’s just one. But mint a second token, and now you have fungibility.</p> Towards a&nbsp;Solution <p>There’s a path forward, inspired by the history of the label “blockchain”. In 2014–2015 as “blockchain” started to get traction, many argued whether some particular system was a “blockchain”. Bitcoin maximalists would say “only Bitcoin is a blockchain”. Others had more permissive definitions like “it’s a chain of blocks”, where block N stores the hash of block N-1; or “it’s a replicated database with no leader”, using a consensus protocol like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04098.pdf">BFT, PoW, or PoS</a>&nbsp;[1].</p><p>These arguments were never resolved per se. Rather, they simply faded as “blockchain” got treated more <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/blockchain-as-a-field-47c9f4589418">like a field</a>. The definition went meta. There was no huge push, it just happened. Now, we have two meanings for “blockchain”:</p>  The technical definition for the database-like artifact that includes a chain of blocks, replicated, etc.  The field or movement around the technology.  <p>Understanding that (2) exists softens the debate, and in fact is highly empowering because it opens the door for new ideas around&nbsp;(1).</p><p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a>” is similar. There were once big arguments whether something was “AI”. Then AI field matured, and now pragmatically “AI” means two things [2]: the technical definition and the&nbsp;field.</p> A Modest&nbsp;Solution <p>“Blockchain” and “AI” both emerged with technical definition(s), and a field definition. We can do the same thing for “NFT”! We can have the technical definition, and the field. The latter is a subfield of blockchain. Upon examination, we actually find two subfields: one covering the creative part, and one covering non-fungible items. Let’s put it all together:</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1369750239649882118">@trentmc0</a></p></blockquote><p>Let’s review each in more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>NFT Definition 1: Technical standard for unique-snowflake</p><p>A unique-snowflake token standard is a standard simply for tokens that can’t be swapped interchangeably with each other. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC721</a> <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">is</a> the most famous example. It’s not restricted to Ethereum; standards on Bitcoin or any other blockchain fit as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Note that I purposely do not use the phrase “non-fungible” here, because that’s what’s causing confusion.</p><p>It also includes <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155">ERC1155</a>, at least for tokens that are unique snowflakes.</p><p>NFT Definition 2: Blockchain subfield for creative&nbsp;work</p><p>This includes all the work in blockchain on digital art, physical art, photographs, music, etc — generally speaking, anything involving creative work that outputs intellectual property&nbsp;(IP).</p><p>This means it may use “unique snowflake” standards, but critically, it doesn’t need to. It can also use ERC20, or whatever it&nbsp;wants.</p><p>With this in hand, we get explanations for each example&nbsp;above:</p>  $TAPE (music) fits within this definition of&nbsp;“NFT”.  $SOCKS (physical art)&nbsp;fits.  “Limited edition NFTs”&nbsp;fit.  And ERC1155 for &gt;1 minted token fits&nbsp;too.  <p>NFT Definition 3: Blockchain subfield using unique-snowflake standards</p><p>This third definition covers blockchain applications that use ERC721 etc. that aren’t in the “creative” realm, such as real estate or financial supply chains (e.g. Centrifuge). It also covers applications that use ERC721 etc that are creative, which means partial overlap with (2), and that’s&nbsp;ok!</p><p>The following image illustrates.</p>“NFT” means 3 things. Here’s how the definitions relate to each other in terms of token standards (top), and fields (bottom). Conclusion <p>This essay started with a problem: fungibility sightings in NFTs, in everything from SOCKS to limited-edition NFTs. It then proposed a modest solution: simply acknowledging that “NFT” is not only a technical standard, but also a field. (And in fact two&nbsp;fields.)</p> Notes <p>[0] FWIW I think RAC is awesome and SOCKS are hilarious.</p><p>[1] See “Ways to Frame Blockchain” in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nature-2-0-27bdf8238071">“Nature 2.0” post</a> for many pragmatic definitions</p><p>[2] See “Ways to Frame AI” in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nature-2-0-27bdf8238071">“Nature 2.0” post</a> for many pragmatic definitions</p><p>Thanks to Wilkins Chung for pointing out the need for NFT meaning (3), to complement the other two meanings.

 T-REX Factory Enhancements 
<p>T-REX Factory is a process management tool, which we rolled out last year, and is specifically designed to support multi-issuers (or agents supporting them) to issue T-REX Tokens in a very automated way and, possibly, a very repetitive way.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in March 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>As you might already know, T-REX Factory is a process management tool, which we rolled out last year, and is specifically designed to support multi-issuers (or agents supporting them) to issue <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX Tokens</a> in a very automated way and, possibly, a very repetitive way. It allows issuers (or their agent), literally in a few clicks, to provide basic information related to a token, upload a list of investors that have been white-listed by the issuer for that token, as well as the tokens positions to be allocated to them.</p>
<p>T-REX Factory then automatically deploys the whole suite of related smart contracts on the blockchain, creates a digital identity (“ONCHAINID”) for the investors who don’t have one, and finally allocates the tokens they are entitled to receive. It can be used at the end of the subscription period into a newly issued digital security or to replicate (“mirror”) on the blockchain the register of an already existing financial instrument.</p>
<p>We have recently enhanced T-REX Factory with a few additional features:</p>

		 
	 
         Set compliance rules for the security token  <p>While the T-REX Protocol takes care of enforcing basic compliance rules of a security token, the compliance smart contract allows more complex or more general compliance rules to be added. The compliance smart contract of the token can now be configured online very simply by the issuer whenever they define the general parameters of the token. At this stage the issuer can define the eligible countries for the token as well as periodic limits in terms of tokens transfers. Other or more complex compliance rules will still need the Tokeny team to design an ad-hoc compliance smart contract as before, but additional compliance rules will be added to the T-REX Factory interface in the coming week in order to minimize those interventions;</p>
                 Email Notification  <p>At each stage of the T-REX Factory issuance process (token deployment, investors whitelisting and tokens allocation), the issuer will be notified by email and receive all details of the step executed;</p>
                 Automatic transfer the ownership of the smart contract  <p>At the end of the T-REX smart contract deployment process, the T-REX Factory now automatically transfers the ownership of the token smart contract to the issuer’s wallet (this was a manual process so far).</p>
        
	 
		 
			<p>With these various improvements, T-REX Factory further facilitates the life of multi-issuers and makes it even easier to industrialize the issuance process of security tokens on the blockchain.</p>

<p>Thursday, 25 March, 2021<br>Gibraltar<br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>In a big step forward for the P2P web, Holo Limited was granted a US patent for the rrDHT networking innovations within Holochain. rrDHT is a peer-to-peer networking design implemented in Holochain that describes a system of nodes communicating according to a relaxed, agent-centric distributed hash&nbsp;table.</p><p>Holo is owned in full by the Holochain Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in Gibraltar, and formal transfer of this patent to the foundation will be completed this&nbsp;month.</p><p>You can read more about the patent (number 10,951,697) in the original documentation: <a href="https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10951697">United States Patent and Trademark Office&nbsp;website.</a></p> So why file a&nbsp;patent? <p>Holochain in an open-source project — so why would we spend the time and money to file for a patent? The reality is that projects can be stopped in their tracks while using their own innovations if others are granted patents for the technology. In other words, this is a defensive patent. It is our intention to use this innovation and share it openly within the context of the Holochain open-source framework.</p><p>This patent is a critical component of the open source license used for Holochain. The Cryptographic Autonomy Licence (CAL) was approved by the OSS in 2019 and it makes Holochain widely available to not only developers, but it also protects end-user data rights. Licenses are only powerful as they relate to the intellectual property laws they are based on. The CAL’s protections for Holochain and users of distributed apps built with Holochain are fully enforceable and this patent enables that enforcement both through copyright and also through patent&nbsp;law.</p><p>Van Lindberg, the IP attorney involved in writing the CAL and the patent application shares&nbsp;this:</p><blockquote>“Patents protect how innovations can be used. In our case this patent is intended to protect the Holochain open-source project from trolls who could file patents on our technical innovation and then use them to prevent us from implementing it. The patent is also a critical component of the Cryptographic Autonomy License. Licenses are only powerful as they relate to the IP laws they are based on. Having this patent ensures the CAL is fully enforceable — which means it will protect the rights of end users to have sovereignty over their&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.taylorenglish.com/people-van-lindberg-intellectual-property-copyright-open-source-and-government-policy-and-practice-attorney.html">- Van Lindberg, Taylor&nbsp;English</a></p> What is the technology innovation of the patent, for a layperson? <p>In simple terms this patent represents an easy way to represent complex distributed data models, and manage them with high resilience. While it is possible to design computing systems that don’t use state, many problems — particularly those that are designed to reflect human interactions and the physical world — are easier to model when the computing system has state. The patent focuses on the methods for saving, storing and retrieving data in a multi-node computing system where no single node has a comprehensive index of nodes or content managed by those&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>As you can see in the diagram below, rrDHT gets efficient sharding and storage redundancy by many nodes with overlapping ranges of data they’re responsible for. We get fast lookups by being able to jump to known peer addresses across the circle. And we have a simple way of representing who is responsible for holding data. This model turns out to be very efficient for managing a self-healing DHT.</p> The team behind Holochain and the people behind this&nbsp;patent <p>Our team and community is deeply appreciative of the work that Arthur Brock, David Braden and Jamison Day have put into this achievement. They are the authors of the innovation upon which this patent is based. Arthur is the co-founder of Holochain. David Braden is a leader on the Holochain core development team who is instrumental at implementing peer-to-peer networking innovations in the framework. Jamison Day is an architect and team lead who worked deeply with the Holochain team for several years to iterate and improve the&nbsp;designs.</p> About Holo <p>Holo is a distributed cloud hosting network and marketplace that enables peer-to-peer Holochain applications to be used by regular web users. Holo does to app hosting what Airbnb did to hotels; anyone can use a spare computer to become an app host and get paid in HoloFuel for hosting distributed applications. Each host on the Holo network sets their own prices and preferences for the apps they want to host, and each app publisher sets the hosting specifications required for their Holochain application.</p> About Holochain <p>Holochain is an open-source framework and network protocol for developing peer-to-peer scalable and efficient applications. It is fast, secure, and versatile, which makes it perfect for a wide range of everyday apps. Its long list of uses include social apps, team collaboration, Internet of Things, currencies, and much more. Holochain is a peer-to-peer innovation beyond blockchain that can actually deliver on blockchain promises.</p> Licensing and&nbsp;legal <p>Holochain is the only implementation of the rrDHT P2P networking innovation that we are aware of. Others interested in implementing based on it should contact <a href="https://holo.host/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a></p> Contact info for Press&nbsp;Release <p>More info available at <a href="https://holo.host">https://holo.host</a><br> For more information please contact: Jarod Holtz at<a href="https://holo.host/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a></p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">https://holo.host</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/press-release-u-s-patent-granted-for-holochain-distributed-app-framework-a05d0cf8d6af">Press Release: U.S. Patent granted for Holochain Distributed App Framework</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   As vaccine rollouts continue, governments and businesses are turning their attention to how to reopen everything from the travel sector to restaurants and bars safely and at scale. 
 The possibility of using vaccine passports to enter certain venues has been raised by the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has said he understands their commercial use but will not be making them compulsory.

<p>This is the fifth in a series of blogs which provide edited extracts of key points made by Mydex CIC in its response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>.</p><p>This blog focuses on the main ingredients needed to unleash the full potential of personal data — in addition to personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Previous blogs focused on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of personal data</a>, why <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/transforming-the-system-a-roadmap-for-practical-implementation-411e8821ed19">how to achieve these changes at scale</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/misconceptions-that-kill-progress-in-personal-data-4736b1d883c6">common misconceptions that derail progress</a>.</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>If you’ve read the other blogs in this series you might think everything we’re saying boils down to a single recommendation “provide every citizen with their own personal data&nbsp;store”.</p><p>That’s definitely pivotal. But it’s not the whole story. Empowering citizens with their own personal data stores only works in the context of a broader ecosystem, where other parties contribute other functions.</p> Adding genuine personalised value <p>The most obvious of these is bona fide service providers, who use data to provide valued services. A personal data store is a generic enabler; a piece of infrastructure. Every bona fide service provider is a domain expert in their particular field. That is why they exist. To provide their services they need to access and use the right data, and they need their own systems to do this. Personal data stores do not eliminate or replace existing organisation-centric systems. They add another complementary layer. We explore some of the implications of this&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-data-sharing-really-works-239fd187c8a8">here</a>.</p><p>A second obvious fact is that value isn’t generated by personal data in isolation. Usually, it’s generated the right connections between and combinations of personal and non-personal data. A simple example: information about the weather is utterly impersonal. But a weather service that provides a forecast for where I am right now, and where I intend to travel tomorrow may use personal data to add value: my location and my future&nbsp;plans.</p><p>Many of our problems today are created by providers of such services using the need to connect personal with non-personal data as an excuse to grab personal data that they can monetise for other purposes. Manipulation of the content and presentation of privacy policies and terms and conditions for these ends has to stop. But the personal data-driven connections and combinations are essential to ongoing value creation.</p><p>This is generating the need for two important bit of enabling infrastructure:</p>  ‘smart directories’ that create connections between the individual’s personal data (my particular circumstances, interests, plans etc) and external data about the world out there, so that all possible extraneous noise is filtered out and only the right information is presented. This is the essence of data logistics: exactly the right information flowing to and from the right people at the right&nbsp;times.  ‘smart search’. Currently, search services are driven primarily by search term plus (perhaps) a tiny bit of filtering that a search engine conducts using information it has gathered about you. Usually, this filtering isn’t done to help you find what you want, but to herd you in the direction that is most profitable for the search engine. Smart search is a genuine service to the individual, using information about the individual that the individual is happy to volunteer (and only that information, almost certainly behind a shield of anonymity) to help filter search results so that the individual finds exactly what they are looking for as quickly as possible. Smart search is a big ask that would turn the existing industry on its head. But it is desperately needed, and only made possible by the prior existence of a personal data store infrastructure.   Additional enabling infrastructure <p>For such services to work efficiently and effectively, further enabling infrastructure needs to be developed.</p> Data directories <p>In <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">a ‘MUMU’ world</a>, where there are many users of data using data from many different sources, service providers need to know what data exists and where to find it. For this, we need data directories.</p><p>Personal data directories create their own special design requirements: they need to protect rather than abuse individuals’ data and invade their privacy. They should not hold the data itself, but provide the routing to that data along with information relating to the nature and type of data that is available.</p><p>In the context of public services, in the long term this directory should list all of the personal data held by the Government and where this data is held. It should also specify what level of assurance relates to that data (for example, was it generated for the purposes of an email newsletter or to verify a person’s identity?)</p><p>The directory should be seen as a service to both service providers and citizens, being used to to signpost citizens to where they can obtain the attributes they need to complete applications and other processes where they need to provide or point to&nbsp;data.</p><p>Many technicalities need to be addressed. For example, a data directory might not point the searcher to the original source of the data, but to another place where the data is easier to access. The directory will need to make clear how, and on what basis, the attribute in question remains up to date and valid (e.g. is updating automatic, periodic or occasional?). A Personal Data Store itself could publish its own directory entries, the same approach could apply for any data&nbsp;source.</p> Metadata standards <p>For data’s full potential to be unleashed, it must be reliable and trustworthy. This creates the need for large amounts of ‘metadata’ — data about the data that is being presented and used. For example, a data user may want or need to know how the data was collected, created, protected and verified. At all times, users need to have confidence that the data they are using is correct and verified and not modified since generated, in storage or transit. They also need to know how to link it with other data and if necessary synchronise the times lines of&nbsp;data.</p><p>To avoid the huge costs and complexities created by the need to check these things — or to regenerate data where it is not possible to check these things — we need metadata standards: mechanisms by which ‘data about this data’ flows with the data to establish its trustworthiness and reliability.</p><p>As with data directories, many technicalities need to be addressed. Data points need to be defined unambiguously and precisely targeted to the context of the transactions they are used in. The metadata should be machine readable and avoid concatenation of data rather dealing with specific attributes and composite attribute structures. (For example, machine readable date of birth as opposed to a composite of date of birth, postcode and full address.) There needs to be clear, standardised processes and procedures for accessing attributes. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>If you are interested, the strategy report Mydex CIC wrote for Scottish Government on its proposed Smart Entitlement’s programme <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Smart-Entitlements-Research-Recommendations-and-Report-for-the-Scottish-Government-FINAL.pdf">examines these technicalities in detail</a>. There is even work being undertaken on this as part of the Identity and Attributes Trust Framework Alpha in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/attributes-in-the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework/understanding-attributes">policy paper understanding attributes</a> which must surely be influenced by and influence the national data strategy.</p> Real as opposed to ‘faux’ strategies <p>Successful strategies do many things. They have a clear idea of what ‘good’ looks like and of how to get there including who needs to do what and how these different parties’ contributions are going to be realised and coordinated. They need a sense of order — identifying those things that need to be put in place first, thereby enabling other things to happen later. They need to be crystal clear about what is not in scope or allowable as well as what&nbsp;is.</p><p>Yet all too often, we are presented with faux ‘strategies’ that are nothing more than pious wish lists of things that would be nice along with some vague descriptions of resulting things that would need to happen. Often they are worded in deliberately vague ways so as to please as many parties and create as much wriggle room as possible. If you want a good example, take a look at the UK Artificial Intelligence Council’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949539/AI_Council_AI_Roadmap.pdf">‘AI Roadmap’</a>.</p><p>The UK’s citizens need and deserve a genuine personal data strategy, formulated and implemented to achieve genuine, lasting benefits. This blog has outlined some of the ingredients of such a strategy.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/not-just-personal-data-stores-f2070eada6be">Not Just Personal Data Stores</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  As users, devices and application workloads move outside the corporate network, the traditional model of enforcing security at the network perimeter is no longer effective. A Zero Trust model offers an alternative that secures data while ensuring it is accessible to employees, regardless of where they are working. But the path to achieving Zero Trust is unclear for many organizations.

<p>Bridge Champは、ジェルリダおよびブリッジのプレーヤーでもあるBarak Lieberman氏を中心に、現代的なオンラインでのプレー選択肢、およびオンライン市場が不足しているというブリッジの課題を解決するために発案された。さらにジェルリダ曰く、ブリッジは社交的なゲームであるため、新型コロナウイルスの流行でオンラインでの娯楽享受が一般的になった現在、対面でプレーできる環境の欠如により、そのコミュニティの発展が停滞しているという。</p>

<p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@artnok?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Nicolas Picard</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/web?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p><p>This week we got word that a <a href="https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10951697">patent</a> we submitted to the USPTO was approved. That means that Holochain’s special DHT design — rrDHT — is <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">covered under intellectual property laws</a>.</p><p>To be honest, when I heard we were filing for a patent, I was surprised and not entirely comfortable with the idea. So let’s get my (and probably your) ethical concerns out of the way first.</p> Why did we file for a software patent? <p>The most pressing reason is troll protection. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll">Patent trolls</a> are organisations that sit on large collections of patents simply so they can collect licensing fees from people who actually build things — and sue the ones who don’t buy a license. This is an unfortunate reality that we must face — because we plan to build a revenue-generating business on Holochain tech, we may become an attractive target for trolls. This patent helps protect us — and every business that builds on Holochain.</p><p>It also helps make the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/cryptographic-autonomy-license/blob/master/README.md">Cryptographic Autonomy License</a> more enforceable. I don’t pretend to understand the legal artistry that went into all this, but I gather that it gives extra legal teeth to anyone attempting to use the CAL to defend end-users’ data sovereignty and access to the Holochain codebase.</p> But isn’t Holochain open source? Isn’t this kinda… closed? <p>The patent isn’t an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patentleft">open patent</a> right now; we still want to figure out appropriate licensing schemes that make sure that it gets used in ways that <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license-172ac920966d">align with our values</a>. But any application developer who has a license to Holochain (which is anyone) gets to enjoy the use of that patent in their software. And it’s being transferred from Holo (the company) to the Holochain foundation this month.</p><p>I’ve got more thoughts about patents, ethics, and living in the current world while trying to create a new world. But I’ll save them for the end of this article. And you can read more about the ‘why’ and the ‘how’, including how to use the patent in your own non-Holochain-based software, in <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">Holo’s press release</a>.</p><p>Now, on to the ‘what’!</p> rrDHT, a relaxed, agent-centric distributed hash table  Background: what is a DHT? <p>The patent language starts out with some legalese, then breaks into some pretty accessible language before returning to legalese. At the beginning, we learn that...</p><blockquote>While it is possible to design computing systems that don't use state, many problems — particularly those that are designed to reflect human interactions and the physical world — are easier to model when the computing system has state.</blockquote><p>In computing terms, ‘state’ means ‘remembering things’. It’s what turns computers from simple machines to magical ‘do-everything’ machines.</p><p>Consider a weaving loom. It takes in thread and produces cloth. Pretty cool, but pretty simple.</p><p>Now let’s add ‘state’, or ‘memory of where I’ve been and where I’m going’ to the loom. Now it can know that it’s done twelve lines of blue and needs to change to yellow, but only once it gets a third of the way through the thirteenth line. Suddenly, it can create something really special.</p><p>So far, so simple. We know that computers remember stuff. But it gets complicated when you involve more than one computer, because who’s in charge of remembering the state?</p><p>Even though we operate in a networked era, most online tools you use operate in a centralised way — client/server — where a central authority takes care of remembering everything.</p><p>That’s nice and easy, and it works great — until the database shuts down, the company gets bought out or goes out of business, or the system gets co-opted by someone with evil plans.</p><p>This prompts us to set out to find a better way of holding shared memory — one that isn’t vulnerable to disruptions or bad actors. If you got rid of the central database and distributed the data to all the participants, it would certainly help. But now you’ve got a new problem: without any authority to talk to, how do you find the data you’re looking for?</p><p>The distributed hash table (DHT) was created to help solve this problem. A hash table is just a simple index of keys (things you know) that point to values (things you want). It’s a bit like a dictionary: when you want to know the definition of the word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/floccinaucinihilipilification">‘floccinaucinihilipilification’</a>, you take its name (the key) and search through the book until you find it. On the same line you’ll see the definition (the value associated with the key).</p><p>A distributed hash table just spreads responsibility for the keys and values across a lot of machines — each one stores just a portion of them. This means that, if one machine disappears, only a little bit of data is lost.</p><p>Of course, now if you want to retrieve a piece of data, you have to figure out who’s got it. You don’t want a central index (remember, that’s risky), so instead you need a way of figuring it out on your own. Here’s how it works.</p><p>We’ve already seen that every piece of data in a hash table has a key. In a distributed hash table, every machine has a key too.</p><p>In order to find the machine that has the data you want, you compare the data’s key against the keys of all the machines you know about, using a “nearness” algorithm, and then ask the closest match for the data at that key. If they don’t have it, it’s likely that they know another nearby machine that does.</p><p>Storing data works the same way: you calculate the key for the data you want to store, compare it against the machine keys, and ask the computers whose addresses are nearest the key of the data to store it for you.</p><p>Different DHTs use different ways of calculating nearness, and might implement different ways of recovering from failures such as a machine going offline.</p> How rrDHT makes things fast and robust <p>rrDHT starts out with a pretty simple nearness algorithm — keys are just 32-bit numbers, and the machine whose number is closest to the data’s number is the best match. This makes lookups very fast to calculate.</p><p>We also want to make a Holochain app’s DHT as resilient as possible. Machines come and go, especially when they’re just users’ laptops and phones, and that means that your ‘best match’ for a data key might disappear for weeks at a time. So we want the participants in a DHT to collaborate to make sure each piece of data is stored by more than one responsible party.</p><p>So each peer — which in Holochain is both an end-user and a storage machine — has a range of the key space that it considers its ‘neighbourhood’. (You can think of the keys as addresses.)</p><p>From your place in the DHT, your neighbourhood stretches out to your left and right. Here, you know everybody by name and have a good idea what’s happening in their lives. You take responsibility for storing a copy of all data whose keys fall within it, to the best of your ability. You also know the transport addresses of all peers whose keys fall within it. (A transport address is the address in the underlying networking layer — an IP address, for example. It lets you do the actual communication.) You gossip over the fence regularly, sharing data with each other. If you go offline, your neighbours have your back, because their neighbourhoods overlap with yours and they can ‘heal’ the gap you left behind.</p><p>The size of your neighbourhood depends on your capacity and the resilience of your neighbourhood. If you find your device storage is filling up too quickly, rrDHT might choose to shrink your neighbourhood and drop responsibility for some data. And if you notice the coverage just outside your neighbourhood seems a bit weak, rrDHT might enlarge your neighbourhood and help improve resilience there.</p><p>Outside of this neighbourhood, you might have a couple connections with reliable peers spread across other regions of the DHT. (The patent suggests between five and ten.)</p> Neighbourhood lookups in action <p>Here’s how data storage and retrieval works in rrDHT. Instead of using numbers, I’ll make things easier and use the letters of the alphabet.</p><p>Maria and her friends are members of a dictionary DHT that stores words and their definitions. In the picture below, you can see the DHT from her perspective, with her neighbourhood spreading out from her place in the DHT:</p><p>Maria wants to know the meaning of the word ‘nanotechnology’. She calculates its address, which is N. That’s inside her neighbourhood, so she probably already has it in her own storage slice. But if she doesn’t yet, she asks Paulina, whose neighbourhood also covers that address. Paulina returns the definition to her.</p><p>Now she wants to store a definition for the word ‘galangal’. She calculates its address, G. If her neighbourhood were just a bit larger, she’d take responsibility for storing a copy herself and gossiping it to her neighbours. She sees that Henry, however, is really close to it. She sends it to him and, because his neighbourhood covers G, he stores it.</p><p>Finally, she wants to know the meaning of ‘caterwaul’. Its address, C, is also outside of her neighbourhood, and she doesn’t know anybody in her neighbourhood who’s close to it. The closest peer she knows about is Aoki. Aoki will have a better view of that part of the DHT than she does, so she asks him for the data. His neighbourhood doesn’t stretch far enough, though, so he doesn’t have it. But within his neighbourhood is Carol, whose neighbourhood does cover it. He sends Carol’s transport address to Maria, who asks Carol for the data.</p><p>We expect that, with most application DHTs, it’ll only take a few hops to get the data you’re looking for. Even in the worst-case scenario of a DHT with full saturation of the address space (roughly four billion peers who each have a tiny neighbourhood of two addresses in either direction), it’ll only take 22 hops.</p><p>(Note: there’s a second, broader neighbourhood that I didn’t mention. Maria doesn’t store data whose addresses fall in this neighbourhood, but she does keep tabs on who lives there. This helps improve resilience and lookup times.)</p> Why did we build something from scratch? <p>There are a lot of good DHT designs out there, and the nice thing about them is that they already have implementations we could’ve used. In fact, the first iteration of Holochain used <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht">IPFS’ implementation of the Kademlia DHT</a>. And it worked okay for finding data — it was fast and well-supported — but the challenge is that we want Holochain to have self-healing storage where data gets moved to peers with nearby addresses. And it was very hard to describe that kind of neighbourhood with Kademlia's nearness algorithm. And Holochain wasn’t just using neighbourhoods for data storage and retrieval – it was using them for security too.</p><p>To understand that, we need to back up a bit and look at another problem that pops up when you take the authority out of the middle.</p><p>As I mentioned before, if an application wants to work right, it needs an assurance that it’s got a predictable view of the stored data, or state. If you expect X to equal 3 but it actually equals 7, your application might start throwing errors. But when nobody’s in charge of keeping that state consistent, the individual copies can get out of sync and make a mess of things. So you need to figure out who gets to modify that shared memory, and when. That is, how do you prevent two people from modifying the same thing at the same time on their separate machines? (Remember, there’s no central authority anymore — and there’s a new group of bad guys who would love to get involved too.) This problem was identified back in 1983 as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault">Byzantine Generals’ Problem</a>.</p><p>A common strategy is to select a ‘leader’ — the entity who’s allowed to make writes — and make sure that nobody else can write to the data.</p><p>Bitcoin, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">not</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)#Byzantine_Paxos">first</a> to tackle this problem, is certainly a pioneer when it comes to a strategy for leader selection among an unknown number of untrustworthy members. It simplifies the problem by recording everyone’s data writes in a single journal, of which everyone has a copy. Then a lottery is held every 10 minutes to select the next leader. This lottery helps keep everyone honest. But by design it’s expensive to play, in real time and money. This means that those with more money tend to dominate the game. That doesn’t feel very peer-to-peer anymore.</p><p>This is necessary because of Bitcoin’s design choice — that single, shared ledger is pretty attractive to bad actors, so it needs to be well protected. But we don’t think a shared ledger is actually necessary for ensuring data integrity.</p><p>Holochain makes things even simpler by saying, “why don’t we just put everyone in charge of their own write journal?” That’s where a peer-to-peer application runs anyway — on the devices of its users. This solves the leader selection problem; everyone is their own leader!</p><p>That’s fine when you’re just writing data for yourself. But when you start interacting with others, and everyone's in charge of their own data, how do you police bad data? Particularly problematic is the ability to manipulate your own history; you could do all sorts of fun stuff with that. Make negative balances disappear, change your mind about the politician you just voted for, modify things you said in the past without any accountability trail, etc.</p><p>Holochain’s answer is to make everyone accountable to everyone else. And here’s where that neighbourhood model comes in: when a neighbourhood is called on to store a piece of someone else’s public data, they first validate it according to Holochain’s #1 rule (you can’t manipulate your journal) and an application’s particular rules. If they find any suspicious activity, they sound the alarm. This alarm acts like an antibody — it spreads through the network of peers, triggering an immune response in each of them until everyone recognises the bad actor and has taken steps to protect themselves. (This usually looks like putting the bad actor in a block list.)</p><p>The address of each piece of data you produce is based on a cryptographic hash. That makes it effectively random, which means you don’t get to choose which neighbourhoods witness and validate your data. This prevents you from colluding with your evil friends and hiding your crime. You can try, but the person you’re trying to deceive has their own view of the DHT. They’re going to talk to the peers they trust. And when they find out nobody’s seen the data you said you published, your fraud is exposed.</p><p>Not only that, but you cryptographically sign every piece of data you produce. This means that your identity is all over the evidence.</p><p>This randomised peer witnessing, validation, and policing is what distinguishes Holochain’s rrDHT from other DHTs — it’s built for data integrity from the ground up. And that’s what makes Holochain able to perform at the speed of DHTs while offering the safety of blockchain.</p> Op-ed: bridging the old and the new <p>As I mentioned before, I’ve had a bit of a personal struggle accepting the idea of a patent on Holochain technology. I’m a bit of a starry-eyed idealist — I love free software (free-as-in-speech, although free-as-in-beer is also nice), and I love openness and sharing. Software patents feel like they’re part of the old world of enclosure, extraction, and competition.</p><p>But in the past few years of working with Holochain and Holo, I’ve come to appreciate the value of building bridges between the current world and the next. But when I reflect on it, I think that’s what we’ve been trying to do all along — working within the structures of the current world in order to birth the new. It’s unsexy, tedious, and sometimes dirty, but maybe it’s where we need to start.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this. First, if we don’t understand the rules of the game we’re stuck in, we won’t survive long enough to see the new game to maturity (this is why the troll protection). And reality is hard, messy, and inconsistent — we’re all at various stages of growth, various levels of ability to participate in new games according to our means. The current system isn’t going to just roll over and give us free room and board while we build tools for open collaboration and economics.</p><p>We also need to find ways to start unlocking and using the massive power and wealth that the current system is currently holding. We can see them as an asset, rather than a hurdle, and start ‘composting’ them into regenerative systems.</p><p>In the case of the CAL, that means we’re using the weapons of today (intellectual property law) to protect this little embryo of an idea we love so dearly. Besides being a standard open-source license, it imposes an extra restriction on those who create software with Holochain: they’re not allowed to hold your data hostage. It doesn’t mean you get to choose how it’s used (that’s an application-level concern), but it does mean you’ll never be barred from accessing it.</p><p>That feels powerful to me. It goes beyond the scope of open-source licenses to ensure freedom beyond just being able to audit and modify code. We’re embedding an ethical stance about data sovereignty into Holochain’s terms-of-use. This puts the CAL into the (sometimes <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/ethical-source-hippocratic-license">controversial</a>) territory of ‘<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/definition/">Ethical Source</a>’. Personally, I’m okay with that. We’ve always been explicit about our intention to support the commons, and sometimes that means asking people to consent to <a href="https://osf.io/hnerp/?view_only=44b5c10772d5470892b701dfe4b2c833">restrictions</a> if they want to play this new game with us. After all, as Dr Elinor Ostrom famously demonstrated, <a href="http://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons">that's what makes the commons work</a>.</p>

 Oraichain, an AI-powered oracle and ecosystem for blockchains, will publish and monetize data generated from their services on Ocean&nbsp;Market. <p>Ocean Protocol is proud to announce a partnership with <a href="https://orai.io/">Oraichain</a> to integrate products, services, and AI data to expand their AI-powered ecosystem offerings.</p><p>Following the launch of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v3-is-now-live-b47c0e73f52a">Ocean v3 and Ocean Market</a> in October 2020, this new partnership connects key pillars of the Oraichain and Ocean ecosystems:</p>  Ocean will support Oraichain by providing Compute-to-Data technology to Oraichain’s AI Request Hub and AI Marketplace.  Ocean will enable its ecosystem partners to leverage Oraichain’s Request Hub to request data, compute services, AI oracles, and other AI services provided by Oraichain.  Oraichain will publish and monetize data from Oraichain’s AI services such as AI APIs and AI-generated data via the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>.  Oraichain and Ocean will explore further integrations of future products and services within their ecosystems.  <p>Here’s what Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol founder, said about the partnership:</p><blockquote>Ocean Protocol’s engagement with Oraichain promises to be a dynamic addition to our data and AI ecosystems. The presence of Oraichain data on Ocean Market diversifies our offerings while Oraichain can benefit from leveraging our Compute-to-Data feature in their Request Hub. We’re excited to further explore the potential synergies.</blockquote><p>Commenting on the partnership, Dr. Chung Dao, Oraichain CEO,&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>I am confident in the strong impact that the partnership between Oraichain and Ocean Protocol will have in terms of innovation in the AI and Blockchain space. Artificial Intelligence is the core of both companies, and the combined efforts, synergies, and future integration will create plenty of new opportunities.</blockquote><p>Oraichain is developing an AI Marketplace for AI services, featuring an AI Request Hub that will be the platform where companies (AI services &amp; data buyers) will be able to request customized AI solutions, and AI providers (AI services &amp; data sellers) will offer and monetize their solutions.</p><p>The collaboration will fast-track Oraichain’s AI Request Hub to be a solution-driven product providing direct access to Oraichain’s AI services, including AI Oracles — that contain AI APIs — and data for training and testing for those AI models. After the launch of <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/get-ready-for-smart-contracts-20-oraichain-launches-new-ai-powered-blockchain-network-2021-02-24">Oraichain Mainnet</a> (Oraichain’s blockchain network) in February, this new partnership will accelerate the rate of adoption of both organizations’ platforms.</p><p>The Request Hub is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2021 and will utilize Oraichain’s AI Data Hub and Ocean Protocol’s Compute-to-Data technology in order to attract customers and AI solution providers. Oraichain’s Request Hub will run several AI and Machine Learning competitions to call for an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners, which is similar to Kaggle — a subsidiary of Google. Oraichain also intends to fund innovative AI projects via the Request&nbsp;Hub.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>Ocean’s “Compute-to-Data” feature gives compute access to privately-held data, which never leaves the data owner’s premises. With it, Ocean Market enables the monetization of private data while preserving privacy.</p><p>The OCEAN token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability. OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Visit <a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">oceanprotocol.com</a> to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8TXwmWWAE9TZO0yTBHB3A">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://blockfolio.com/coin/OCEAN_3">Blockfolio</a> | <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8TXwmWWAE9TZO0yTBHB3A">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ocean_protocol">Reddit</a> | <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram Chat</a> |<a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">&nbsp;Discord</a></p> About Oraichain <p>Oraichain is the world’s first AI-powered oracle and ecosystem for blockchains.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This week, The Grocer’s conference on ‘How to build a sustainable brand’ brought together challenger brands, multinationals, NGOs and others to discuss the key issues in FMCG today. Read on for our roundup of the event’s key takeaways.</p>
 1. Brands must avoid ‘tunnel vision’ on sustainability issues 
<p>It’s vital that FMCG brands approach sustainability holistically and avoid championing certain environmental or social issues at the expense of others.</p>
<p>In a discussion on net zero targets, Dan Crossley of the Food Ethics Council reminded attendees that the current momentum around carbon mustn’t slow progress in other areas: “Brands must avoid having tunnel vision on climate alone and make sure that they are thinking about all those other environmental impacts: biodiversity loss, social impact, etc.”</p>
<p>Victoria Sjardin, VP of Marketing at Kraft Heinz, echoed this sentiment in a panel on sustainability communications. “It’s important to land simple messages with consumers but also to be responsible, and understand the framework of how we think about sustainability holistically.” She cautioned against making decisions to reduce impact in one area which might have detrimental effects in other areas, not least because “Gen Z has never been faster or more able to understand the full business intent.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s important to land simple messages with consumers but also to be responsible, and understand the framework of how we think about sustainability holistically.” – Victoria Sjardin, VP of Marketing at Kraft Heinz</p></blockquote>
 2. Customer-friendly frameworks will be key to driving behaviour change 
<p>“There are customers who would do something different if they knew what that was,” argued Susan Thomas, Senior Director of Sustainable Commercial Activities at Asda, in a panel exploring evolving shopper priorities.</p>
<p>Thomas highlighted the industry’s progress on communicating complex nutritional information to customers with <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/check-the-label#:~:text=The%20traffic%20light%20labelling%20system,kilojoules%20in%20that%20particular%20product.">traffic light</a> health labelling. She believes the FMCG industry needs to deliver comparable education on sustainability issues: “From that data information understanding perspective, we’re a long way behind on the planet side of this conversation. Some products have put a carbon footprint on their packaging, but in isolation I don’t really know what to do with that number as a consumer. And of course, carbon footprint is not the only consideration – how are we going to collectively and consistently communicate these complex interlinked issues, so that customers can make important choices? I think that’s going to be a body of work for us as an industry for the next couple of years.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Some products have put a carbon footprint on their packaging, but in isolation I don’t really know what to do with that number as a consumer.” – Susan Thomas, Senior Director of Sustainable Commercial Activities at Asda</p></blockquote>
 3. Don’t underestimate the proof required by regulators 
<p>Katie Vickery, Partner &amp; Head of the International Food Law Team at Osborne Clarke argued that proof was key to minimising risk for sustainability marketers, particularly in light of regulators’ increased focus on FMCG sustainability claims. She described how she’d seen a number of brands “put forward what would seem to be very credible substantiation [to the ASA], and actually that’s been knocked back.” Her advice for brands was not to underestimate the extent of substantiation required: “If you look at the trends that we’re seeing in terms of regulators, you get a sense of actually how far now marketing teams need to go when they’re coming up with their brand names or marketing slogans.”</p>
<p>But Vickery also offered marketers hope, in the shape of new guidance from the CMA, due to be published in summer 2021: “We’re going to get some really specific points around the different types of environmental claims that people can make.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Victoria Sjardin, VP of Marketing at Kraft Heinz, urged a holistic approach to sustainability</p>
 4. ‘No one can fix this alone’ 
<p>Cross-sector collaboration was a key theme throughout the day, and it prompted a fascinating debate on where responsibility lies for encouraging shoppers to make better purchase decisions. Rob Metcalfe, Richmond &amp; Towers, argued that retailers must take the lead: “The majority of brands don’t have sustainability as their raison d’etre. I don’t think brands can do it on their own.” Others stressed the need for a system-wide approach. ASDA’s Susan Thomas suggested that&nbsp; “a partnership between brands and retailers” was key to making sustainable shopping easier for customers. Jenny Costa, Rubies in the Rubble, agreed that brands have a big role to play, alongside retailers and government: “I would say that brands do have a really strong role to play in this. Purpose-driven brands can transform a category.”</p>
<p>In a keynote on net zero targets, Tesco CEO Ken Murphy also raised the importance of collaborating with suppliers, explaining that Tesco’s progress on carbon was only possible thanks to buy-in from its own-label suppliers: “By working to get our own house in order, we’ve learned lessons we can apply to the broader supply chain and we’re sharing our journey with suppliers. No one of us can fix this alone.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Retailers want to list products that have a sustainable message and reflect their values well. It’s really exciting to see that change.” – Jenny Costa, Rubies in the Rubble</p></blockquote>
 5. Sooner or later, sustainable brands will reap the rewards 
<p>According to Jenny Costa, Rubies in the Rubble, both retailers and consumers have doubled down on sustainability issues in the last year: “Retailers want to list products that have a sustainable message and reflect their values well. It’s really exciting to see that change.” As for customers, she spoke of a huge rise in demand from zero waste stores, and explained that customer engagement in influencing business decisions is higher than it’s ever been.</p>
<p>But whilst investment in sustainability will pay off for brands, Ben Greensmith, Tony’s Chocolonely, suggested that this may still take time: “At the moment the companies that do good are at a commercial disadvantage, but I think in a few years time, those that don’t will be at a disadvantage.”</p>

  <p>A customer once asked me: “Hey – Can Okta integrate with Kong?” Spoiler alert: You totally can integrate Kong with Okta using its <a href="https://github.com/nokia/kong-oidc">OpenID Connect</a> plugin.</p>

<p>Still stuck wondering what an API gateway even is? Here’s a metaphor that works for me: You know that sci-fi movie trope in which you have a centralized hub that “jumps” you to other places in the galaxy? In that kind of system all the screening and security happens at the hub. It’s the same with Kong (and other API gateways).</p>

<p>In the case of the OIDC plugin, only Kong speaks directly to Okta using the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">Authorization Code flow</a>. It then passes the contents of the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeIDToken">ID Token</a> to an internal service using an HTTP header called <code>x-userinfo</code>. Your app just needs to know what to do with this HTTP header. It doesn’t have to do anything with OIDC itself.</p>

<p>This is easier to understand with some diagrams. Here’s what an architecture might look like without an API Gateway:</p>

<p></p>

<p>While you may have a load balancer sitting in front of everything acting as a “traffic cop”, each of your services has to know how to “speak” OIDC.</p>

<p>Here’s another diagram with an API Gateway in the mix:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this case, only the Kong API gateway is interacting with Okta. Kong then passes the <code>x-userinfo</code> header along after the user authenticates. This enables your services to be a lot leaner – no OIDC stack needed.</p>

<p>I created a screencast based on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-kong-origin-example">this working example</a>.</p>

 
  
 

<p>In this demo, I use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> to create a container for Kong and another for a <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> app that understands the <code>x-userinfo</code> HTTP header.</p>

<p>The slides used in the screencast <a href="https://github.com/dogeared/centralize-auth-with-kong-and-okta">can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>James Little presented on <a href="https://stork-search.net/">Stork Search</a>. He created it to solve the problem of locally owned, fast, relevant search for mostly static sites.</p><blockquote>Stork is two things. First, it's an indexer: it indexes your loosely-structured content and creates a file that you can upload to your web server. Second, it's a Javascript + WebAssembly frontend for that index file: Stork will hook into an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> on your web page, download the index you've specified, and display the best search results immediately to your user, as they type. The precomputed index and WebAssembly frontend module make the entire Stork engine very good, and very fast.</blockquote><p>It was really inspiring to hear James' story, starting with solving problems for his college newspaper website.</p><p>WebAssembly, ubiquitous CDN-like functionality for static sites, and that full-text search isn't black magic were the three things that happened roughly at the same time. Can a search index be treated like an image (which we know how to cache and deliver quickly), and use WebAssembly to make the experience very fast?</p><p>The answer of course is yes, with Stork!</p>"I can generate a search index out of band, then load it onto a webpage like an image, then use WebAssembly to run the search"<p>And, how the approach to images on the web can be applied to large search indexes:</p><p>Watch the video below for the full presentation.</p> Video <p><a href="https://files.jameslittle.me/talks/stork-slides.pdf">Download a PDF of the slides</a> or <a href="https://jameslittle.me/talks/stork/">visit James' talk page »</a></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jameslittle230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jameslittle230</a> considers Stork super early still. Use it as the obvious choice if you're building a static site. A "lifetime project" that he can keep working on.<br><br>PRs welcome! <a href="https://t.co/NR5fB9eVgb">https://t.co/NR5fB9eVgb</a> <a href="https://t.co/x23u7psjVq">pic.twitter.com/x23u7psjVq</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1375128122362785797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2021</a></blockquote>

   The traditional paradigm of investing in protection of known threats alone has been declining over recent years, as attackers become more adaptable and capable. Combine this with increased threats and attacker ingenuity it is small wonder that a CISO’s role has become more complex. This leads to the inevitability of a security incident where the complex environments and inventive attacks collide.

  <p>The traditional paradigm of investing in protection of known threats alone has been declining over recent years, as attackers become more adaptable and capable. Combine this with increased threats and attacker ingenuity it is small wonder that a CISO’s role has become more complex. This leads to the inevitability of a security incident where the complex environments and inventive attacks collide. <br></p>
<p>This presentation looks at three fundamentals:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Why traditional protective approaches are no longer effective enough.</p>
 
 
<p>How complexity has made the CISO’s ability to respond more difficult.</p>
 
 
<p>The importance of automation in the response process to address this paradigm shift CISOs now face</p>
