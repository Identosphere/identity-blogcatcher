				  Indicio open sources a text messaging UI for digital wallets.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Technology provider Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation advancing decentralized identity software and solutions, today announced the public availability of the Indicio Wallet UI Design, a user interface for holding and presenting verifiable digital credentials. A <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2020/11/02/news-release-finalists-announced-digital-wallets-prize-challenge">finalist </a>in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology ( S&amp;T) Trusted User Interface (UI) Digital Wallets Challenge, the UI digital wallet design is now available in the <a href="https://github.com/Indicio-tech/indicio-mobile-ux">Indicio public Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>To date, most wallets that handle Aries-based credentials have focused on having the user navigate lists of items and an array of popups and notifications. The Indicio UI design concept is rooted in the understanding that the exchange of verifiable credentials isn’t simply about moving data, it’s also about creating and maintaining relationships. As a consequence, Indicio’s design placed all of the interactions into a single, threaded record whereby each party can communicate in plain language.</p>
<p>“Our wallet design is 180 degrees from the list-based or card-based approach to presenting the user with information,” said Scott Harris, Vice President of Business Operations, Indicio. “Instead, we focus on the relationship between a user and issuers and verifiers and we designed the interactions to use an interface that people are familiar with: the text message. A natural and comfortable interface allows issuers and verifiers to clearly communicate requests, offers, clarifications, and policies. It allows users to query their contacts and receive either a personal reply, or a ‘smart reply’ from AI or chatbot systems.”</p>
<p>As Indicio is committed to open source as a proven way to deliver complex, sustainable innovation and adoption across industry sectors, anyone in the open source community beginning work on their own digital wallet can now make use of the Indicio UI design and its associated elements and assets.</p>
<p>“Decentralized identity can give people unprecedented control over their identities and data online,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “But it will only happen if people feel in control of the technology. That’s where good design meets great engineering. Good design is not just about creating beautiful things, it’s about giving people control over their lives, keeping them safe, solving their problems, and helping them achieve their goals.”</p>
<p>Indicio.tech is committed to being a resource hub for decentralized identity, providing enterprise-grade open source tools to get our clients, and the community, building solutions today. Providing the companies and organizations from diverse industries around the world rely on the work of Indicio.tech for expertise in building and scaling their decentralized identity solutions.</p>

 The GiD Report#152 — How economists corrupted the&nbsp;internet <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-151-understanding-globalids-vision-soc-2-type-ii-certification-62ebc3d93b36">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  How economists corrupted the&nbsp;internet  GK on the Justice Department investigation of&nbsp;Visa  Glenn Greenwald on Big&nbsp;Tech  What the future of NFTs is really about:&nbsp;music  Tweetstorm of the week — Clubhouse edition  Stuff happens   1. Matt Stoller: How economists corrupted the&nbsp;internet <p>Stoller’s latest blog post is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/16/google-files-ftc-antitrust-investigation-475573">based on this Politico piece</a> that uncovers 312 pages of FTC&nbsp;memos:</p><blockquote>Few moments in the power struggle between Washington and Silicon Valley have inspired more anger and bafflement than one in January 2013, when antitrust regulators appointed by former President Barack Obama declined to sue&nbsp;Google.</blockquote><blockquote>The decision still rankles the company’s rivals, who have watched the search giant continue to amass power over smartphones, data-hoovering devices and wide swaths of the internet, unimpeded by laws meant to deter monopolies. It has fueled some lawmakers’ calls to overhaul the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that spent 19 months investigating Google’s efforts to overpower the competition — and critics say,&nbsp;blinked.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Nearly a decade ago, the documents show, the FTC’s investigators uncovered evidence of how far Google was willing to go to ensure the primacy of the search engine that is the key to its fortunes, including tactics that European regulators and the U.S. Justice Department would later label antitrust violations. But the FTC’s economists successfully argued against suing the company, and the agency’s staff experts made a series of predictions that would fail to match where the online world was&nbsp;headed:</blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/how-biden-can-clean-up-obamas-big">here’s&nbsp;Matt</a>:</p><blockquote>The FTC’s lawyers made two observations about Google. First, Google intentionally harmed and killed vertical search rivals by putting its own product first, which is known as ‘self-preferencing.’ “Google,” said the complaint, “routinely, and prominently, displays its own vertical properties, while simultaneously demoting properties that are identical to its own, but for the fact that the latter are competing vertical websites.” Google also would scape from its rivals and present their user-generated content as its own. Second, Google used exclusivity agreements and its own market power to deprive its rivals of user traffic, advertising revenue, data, and advertisers.</blockquote><blockquote>In doing so, Google drained the vitality out of the web, so much so that venture capitalists began using the term ‘kill zone’ to describe the un-investable spaces adjacent to&nbsp;Google.</blockquote><p>So why didn’t they take action? Reason&nbsp;1:</p>President Obama with Mark Zuckerberg and Eric Schmidt, Photo: Obama White&nbsp;House<blockquote>There were three main reasons for the reluctance to bring a case. The first is simple: corruption. Google was extremely close with the Obama administration, with its lobbyists averaging a meeting a week at the White House. Today, four out of the five FTC Commissioners who voted on the case, as well as staffers involved like Howard Shelanski, receives money directly or indirectly from one of the five big tech giants. (The only former FTC Commissioner who voted on the case and does not receive big tech money is deceased.)</blockquote><blockquote>Even more tellingly, the resolution of the case happened a little over a month after the reelection of President Obama, a campaign in which then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt was on election night, as The Wall Street Journal reported, “personally overseeing a voter-turnout software system for Mr. Obama.” Today this sounds bad, but at the time, the attitude in the White House was that Google, Facebook, and Amazon were making the world a better place. Republicans loved them because the GOP loves business, and Democrats loved them because they were culturally progressive and good for consumers. (For example, in 2013, well-known Democratic pundit Matt Yglesias wrote about Amazon, “Amazon, as far as I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers.”)</blockquote><p>That second paragraph is almost weird to read now. It’s crazy the aboutface the public has taken on Big&nbsp;Tech.</p><p>Reason 2:</p><blockquote>The second main reason was ideological. Even the FTC lawyers were under the spell of the ‘consumer welfare’ standard, and felt that Google had the right to monopolize as long as consumers weren’t harmed. The reason, for instance, that the lawyers didn’t want to bring a charge for Google’s self-preferencing to kill vertical search engines wasn’t that they didn’t know the goal. They realized it was a scheme to monopolize. But they felt that Google had presented enough evidence showing that consumers might like it if Google’s search engine prioritized Google’s own properties. This ideology made the lawyers meeker, though they still wanted to bring&nbsp;suit.</blockquote><p>This goes along with the first reason — the way we think about monopolies and Big Tech and the parameters by how we might assess those situations has radically shifted in the last couple years (further cemented by the appointments of Lina Khan and Tim Wu as part of the Biden administration).</p><p>Reason 3:</p><blockquote>The third and most significant reason is that the commission’s antitrust economists made a very strong, and entirely wrong, argument against the case, which in retrospect rested on a set of laughably inaccurate predictions. While the FTC lawyers at the Bureau of Competition wanted to bring some charges, the economists at the Bureau of Economics said there was no case. They believed the online ad and search markets were competitive, consumers were benefitting, and there was little evidence of misbehavior.</blockquote><p>So where are we&nbsp;today?</p><blockquote>Mostly I’m pretty happy with my predictions, in which I said Biden would spend a lot of money and be more populist than Obama. But Biden has out-performed my expectations. He hired antitrust expert Tim Wu for the White House, and is reportedly appointing antitrust expert Lina Khan to the FTC. And Biden himself when he was in the Senate had little patience for economists. Meanwhile, Republicans, who were just as in thrall to Google, have changed as well. Trump brought a Google antitrust suit, the conversation on Capitol Hill has undergone a stark change on the right, and the awesome Texas case against Google is heavy on evidence of monopoly power and very light on theoretical economics.</blockquote><blockquote>So both parties have broken from the antitrust status quo. That said, the question now is whether political leaders writ large can ditch their affection for economists. These debates are more than theoretical. When someone uses Google to find help for their addiction, that person is not accessing a search engine, but a manipulation machine designed to serve the interests of whoever pays Google the most. It didn’t have to be this way. And if we downgrade economics, it doesn’t have to be this way&nbsp;anymore.</blockquote><p>In a very different place, apparently.</p><p>And it’s not just Google. It’s Facebook. It’s Apple. It’s Amazon. These companies have spent years consolidating their market power and they’ve all leveraged their position for their own gains — at the expense of their competitors and at the expense of end&nbsp;users.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/99a3f7c1-54d9-47fe-9bcb-fd72fcd94076">Apple warns Chinese apps not to dodge its new privacy&nbsp;rules</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-singapores-sea-used-facebook-to-become-an-e-commerce-giant">How Singapore’s Sea Used Facebook to Become an E-Commerce Giant</a>   2. But hey, at least we’ve woken up. Better late than&nbsp;never. <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=e2tw">The WSJ on the Justice Department’s investigation of&nbsp;Visa</a>:</p><blockquote>The Justice Department is investigating whether Visa Inc. is engaging in anticompetitive practices in the debit-card market, a probe that casts a cloud over a core part of its business.</blockquote><blockquote>The department’s antitrust division has been gathering information and asking whether Visa, the largest U.S. card network, has limited merchants’ ability to route debit-card transactions over card networks that are often less expensive, according to people familiar with the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><blockquote>Many of the department’s questions have focused on online debit-card transactions, but investigators have asked about in-store issues as well, the people&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>The probe highlights the important role of the so-called network fees that are invisible to consumers, lucrative for card companies, but a weight on merchants, who often pass on the fees in the form of higher prices to customers.</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1373038167092264960">here’s Greg&nbsp;Kidd</a>:</p><blockquote>No surprise here — Visa costs for running debit cards kept going down but prices kept going up. Hmmm. Glad the policymakers are finally waking&nbsp;up.</blockquote> 3. Glenn Greenwald’s opening statement on Big&nbsp;Tech: <blockquote>Over the last several years, my journalistic interest in and concern about the dangers of Silicon Valley’s monopoly power has greatly intensified — particularly as wielded by Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. The dangers posed by their growing power manifest in multiple ways. But I am principally alarmed by the repressive effect on free discourse, a free press, and a free internet, all culminating in increasingly intrusive effects on the flow of information and ideas and an increasingly intolerable strain on a healthy democracy.</blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20210312/111315/HHRG-117-JU05-Wstate-GreenwaldG-20210312.pdf">Check out the entire statement here.</a></p> 4. What the future of NFTs is really about:&nbsp;music <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-187d649e-11c3-4584-85b4-495befd03358.html">Here’s Felix&nbsp;Salmon</a>:</p><blockquote>How it works: The overwhelming majority of music revenues now come from streaming, with less than 6% coming from digital downloads, per the RIAA. Artists and genres appealing to a younger audience see almost no downloads at&nbsp;all.</blockquote>  Fandom, however, remains, and there is almost no limit to how much fans are willing to pay to express their allegiance to their favorite artists — especially if that allegiance has potential speculative value.  <blockquote>The state of play: Currently, artists release their singles and albums digitally in unlimited editions, normally at a price of 99 cents per song or $10 per&nbsp;album.</blockquote>  If those downloads were replaced with limited editions of say 10,000 NFTs per single, the price could be orders of magnitude higher — and could attract buyers who currently have no interest in downloads.  The NFTs would become collectible objects, with a resale value that might even go up over&nbsp;time.  <p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opensea-raise-andreessen-horowitz">NFT Marketplace OpenSea Raises $23M, Led by Andreessen Horowitz — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wisekey-price-rally-nft">This (Small-ish) Swiss Cybersecurity Stock Jumped 80% After NFT-Related Press Release — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tony-hawk-nft-540-ollie">Tony Hawk Skates His Last Ollie 540, Puts the NFT of It Up for Auction — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jack-dorsey-first-tweet-sells">Jack Dorsey’s First Tweet Sells for $2.9M — CoinDesk</a>   5.

<p>This is the actual letter to keep VCs that contacted me so far up to&nbsp;date.</p><p>Dear [%investor_name%]!</p><p>I’m thinking how to make venture capital aligned with the web3 style organization. I came up with a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-DAO-your-advice-needed-5a63f9dbb4594b7fbc76ed5a8827f585">draft</a> and for further thinking/building I need to verify with you a couple of assumptions.</p> TL;DR <p>If you agree/disagree with the assumptions in bold chose an action item in the&nbsp;end.</p> Assumption: The way a project is made matters a lot in&nbsp;web3  Assumption: Intrinsically motivated team is better than highly payed&nbsp;stars <p>There is a choice: go fast from day one with money and strong devs VS go slower and build motivated AND strong team along the way. I believe the second option is better. Though certainly harder, in the long run it would be&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Or is there an even better&nbsp;way?</p><p>The plan is to start paying devs with tokens (1 token = $1). Mint them on the go. No real value until launch. After launch convert them into ownership. Hope to catch intrinsically motivated people this&nbsp;way.</p> Assumption: Multiple investors is a&nbsp;must <p>I think having investors in a decentralized project is good. Business professionals with large participation will help to make better decisions. But we need a number of them. Not just in rounds, but simultaneously.</p><p>Is it okay to have multiple investors from the&nbsp;start?</p><p>That would mean splitting the investment. You probably have a minimum threshold sum. Would it be a&nbsp;problem?</p> Assumption: Investor is a part of the community <p>Open discussion with investors brings a lot of value. It shows how the project is made, adds trust. Even the fact of having an investor in the community adds a lot of value. <a href="https://discord.gg/VQwHVqEDWk">Join Upala’s&nbsp;discord</a>!</p><p>Can I tell your name to other possible investors?</p> Action items <p>Join <a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation/your-help-needed-db9464bc3030">Upala’s first community call</a> this Wednesday (March 24) 05:00 PM&nbsp;CET.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-DAO-your-advice-needed-5a63f9dbb4594b7fbc76ed5a8827f585">Macine DAO draft</a> — an organizational structure for Upala and its evolution</p><p>Join <a href="https://discord.gg/VQwHVqEDWk">patrons channel in Upala’s&nbsp;discord</a></p><p>Answer the questions in the text (in&nbsp;italic)</p><p>If you think that I’m can do something better/faster/stronger or my assumptions are wrong please let me&nbsp;know.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation/an-open-letter-to-investors-a59c3813fc4b">An open letter to investors</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation">Upala Digital Identity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Overview <p>Do you know about “short&nbsp;clips”?</p><p>Short clips are short videos that improve the overall quality of video content, by inserting short scenes. Short clips are used in various videos such as YouTube, advertisements, and news. Content businesses like YouTube, where over 500 hours of videos are uploaded each minute, use a variety of diverse short&nbsp;clips.</p><p>Below is a 30 seconds campaign video that was produced using the short clips we provided. Could you figure out how many short clips were used in this&nbsp;video?</p><blockquote><a href="https://youtu.be/kdnKoMOPmQY">How many short clips are&nbsp;there?</a></blockquote><p>Video content editors acquire short clips from taking videos by themselves or purchasing from other sources. They spend a lot of time struggling to resolve copyright issues when purchasing from various sources. Videos posted on YouTube are frequently taken down for copyright infringements and/or violations. For YouTube, it is difficult to detect copyright infringements in the vast content&nbsp;library.</p><p>CRISPY WHALES has created Banana Clips, to address these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Banana Clips is an online marketplace where video content creators can sell or purchase short clips using web and mobile applications. Anyone with a smartphone can easily upload videos and anyone can easily search and purchase them via the&nbsp;web.</p> Features <p>Banana Clips provides 3-big features:</p>  Uploading and searching short&nbsp;clips,  Preserving copyrights of short clips and protecting contracts between buyers and&nbsp;seller  Tokenizing short clips and&nbsp;rights.  <p>Banana Clip users can easily upload their own videos and receive rewards through sales. Searchable metadata and simple recognizable keywords are extracted from the uploaded short clips via our AI system. In addition, emotional keywords like ‘warm’, ‘afraid’, ‘sad’, etc. are extracted through our patented AI algorithm which provides a search function that allows downloaders to easily search for the right short clips without professional knowledge.</p><p>The uploaded short clips are analyzed by our AI system, and then unique steganography is implanted in each short clip through our copyright management system to be used for identifying and verifying later. The watermarked short clips are stored and protected over the AERGO platform. We believe that the fast transaction speed and the strong security of AERGO is the best solution to provide the appropriate environment to protect and verify the copyright of short clips. Additionally, the short clips are used in a variety of ways when purchased and 3rd party protection lends credibility. Banana Clips provides a contract management system using fingerprint technology on the AERGO platform and protects rights for buyers and&nbsp;sellers.</p><p>Uploaders can sell their ownership of short clips at any time in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) with their unique value in Banana Clips. However, a contract to purchase rights of usage for a short clip would be a common case in our service. The unique value of it is determined by the value derived from the short clip and the contract. In order to enable trading, we are proposing to develop a new token protocol; a re-fungible token (RFT) which is a separate token value from non-fungible token&nbsp;(NFT).</p><p>Video content production and/or editing professionals using Banana Clips can purchase short clips and may use them free from copyright infringement through professional and advanced search methods. The unique token for each short clip issued can be traded to other users, so the sustainable value will further boost the market. In addition, NFTs or RFTs issued in this process will be valued and traded in the market, providing transparent compensation to uploaders.</p> Goal <p>CRISPY WHALES aims to provide a transparent marketplace through Banana Clip to ensure various short clips are securely provided and that each user can be fairly compensated. Furthermore, our company’s goal is to create a transparent and ethical culture by establishing a video copyright verification system that can be shared worldwide.</p><p>Within Banana Clips, content creator’s efforts will be paid at a fair price, the diverse values of the world will be brought together, and users will have a great collaborative experience.</p><p>CRISPY WHALES will work with AERGO to provide tools that will make it easy for content creators to exchange their creativity and have their work protected. We will collaborate together to create a world where the creator’s contents are respected.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-community-to-vote-on-awarding-second-incubation-investment-to-crispy-whales-be08520c8ea4">AERGO community to vote on awarding second incubation investment to CRISPY WHALES</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>2020 saw a gigantic shift of work occurring outside of traditional corporate offices. The trend toward a mobile, distributed workforce had been underway for some time, but the global pandemic kicked it into overdrive, with work from home transforming from a fringe benefit to a critical component in keeping businesses running successfully.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But for wholesale remote work to be viable, it needs to be secure and convenient. And when enterprises no longer can rely primarily on their network security infrastructure as their main defense against outside attacks, what does the new security ecosystem look like?<br> &nbsp;</p>

Meeco has been enabling organisations and people to collect, protect and exchange personal data since the <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Meeco manifesto </a>came to life in 2012. Since then, Meeco has been steadily growing in size and recognition.




 




2020 was an interesting year! Despite worldwide shutdowns and uncertainty, Meeco doubled in size in the last year, adding to our development team in Melbourne. Meeco also secured new partnerships in Europe along with the <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/fintech-australia-announces-meeco-as-a-finnies-2020-finalist/">Finnie 2020 award</a> in “Excellence in Industry Collaborations &amp; Partnerships” to prove it.




 




Now as we enter 2021, we’re keeping the momentum and thrilled to announce the expansion of our UX, Design and Testing team in Adelaide, Australia.




 




The new meeps will significantly bolster Meeco’s design chops, bringing more <a href="https://womeninidentity.org/">diversity</a> to the team and addressing the need for more women working on digital identity and personal data solutions. This new team is  Meeco’s Design/Digital hub, cementing Meeco’s commitment to delivering beautiful design and digital work made in-house.




 




The first task of the Meeco Design Team will be breathing some new life into its website and digital communication. The new meeps are excited to bring in their understanding of data collection, user interactions and how they can bring them together to create thoughtful design solutions. They add to Meeco’s belief that an holistic approach to designing processes is key to delivering unique and powerful memories for people.




 Our new office 





 




The team has taken residence in <a href="https://www.stoneandchalk.com.au/">Stone&amp;Chalk </a>Adelaide, keeping up with the tradition in Melbourne and Sydney. Stone&amp;Chalk  is located on Adelaide’s remarkable <a href="https://lotfourteen.com.au/">Lot Fourteen</a>.

  The French web was paralyzed after the fire that took place in a datacenter of OVH. For Cozy Cloud, despite 43 lost servers, no impact on the user side. We reveal why.

 <p>More than 3.6 million web servers representing 464,000 domain names went offline in a few minutes following the fire that broke out on Wednesday night, March 10, at our hosting company <a href="https://us.ovhcloud.com/">OVH</a>, including French government sites. Be assured: your Cozy domains were not affected by the fire and no data was lost.<br>
Our infrastructure withstood the fire despite the very rapid loss of 43 of our servers and in keeping with our strategy of transparency, we decided to detail you the impact of this incident on our business and how we were able to cope with it.</p>
 The French web paralyzed 
<p>The websites and services of more than 12,000 French companies that had chosen to have their data hosted by OVH were taken offline following the disaster.<br>
This is notably the case for :</p>
 
 the digital workspace (ENT) of the Île-de-France region 
 the Centre Pompidou 
 the data.gouv.fr website 
 the Simplified Procedures website 
 the CityScoot application 
 Coinhouse, a specialist in cryptocurrency transactions. 
 
<p>And the list of "burnt" machines is still long.</p>
<p>©SDIS 67</p>
 Why did your Cozy not be impacted by this fireplace? 
<p>At <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a>, our business is the protection of your data. Your data is hosted in geographically separated datacenters - Gravelines, Roubaix and Strasbourg, managed by OVH which guarantees for example that a "catastrophe" on one site will not affect the data hosted on the other sites. Each of your data is replicated 3 times in redundant systems, spread over several sites. Our infrastructures are also sized so that the loss of servers does not disturb the service.</p>
<p>Following this exceptional accident, 43 servers were destroyed out of a total of more than 200 and despite this, there was no noticeable impact on the service provided to our users, nor was any data lost.</p>
<p>©SDIS 67</p>
 What was our action plan? 
<p>First of all, nothing! The configuration and automation in place responded perfectly and isolated the affected components to maintain data and service despite everything.<br>
Then, as soon as we became aware of the fire shortly after midnight, our team established the following action plan:</p>
 
 Identify losses and prioritize actions to replace machines 
 Immediately order replacement machines from other OVH datacenters to restore redundancy and our scalability and performance capabilities 
 
 
 Re-installation of machines with priority given to restoring the redundancies most affected by the accident. Our configuration automation allowed us to perform these re-installations in only a few minutes per machine and thus minimize the time when our redundancy was reduced 
 
 
 4. Real-time communication to our various partners of the impact on their production and specific action plans 
 
<p>All of these actions performed by our team took place in less than 36 hours of intervention after the disaster was announced.</p>
 What is the total impact to you, the Cozy users? 
<p>This incident has not impacted the availability of your Cozy and its data. However, action is required on the part of Cozy Banks users to <a href="https://support.cozy.io/article/509-ma-banque-affiche-identifiantserrones-que-dois-je-faire">resume synchronization of their new bank data</a>.</p>
 "Keep calm: your data is safe" 
<p>Making data backups is essential today but it also requires technical skills. Our mission is to do it for you in order to facilitate your already complex digital life.</p>
<p>Testimony of an user who chose to save his data in a Cozy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had my laptop broken into and stolen. But thanks to Cozy, I didn't lose any data, and I have access to everything from my phone! I was able to print invoices partly recovered by the connectors, and other documents, from my Cozy on my phone. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I am very happy to be part of your users!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to all our users who have already chosen Cozy!</p>
 Support OVH 
<p>Faced with the challenges of digital sovereignty, and in order to keep our promise, we have always chosen to work with French and more European partners.<br>
The reason is simple: by interacting with them on a daily basis, we have control over our infrastructure and therefore your data. This makes it easier to act quickly and effectively in these extreme cases.<br>
We therefore reaffirm our confidence in OVH and give them all our support to overcome this ordeal.</p>
 Thanks to our team 
<p>We would like to thank all of the system administrators who have been able to work with us, since the beginning of the Cozy adventure, to set up an architecture that is sufficiently robust, redundant and resilient. It is because of their work that this incident has not impacted your data or access to your Cozy today.</p>

<p>The Fission team has had the pleasure of getting to know medical doctor and developer Abraham Samma. Abraham is based in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, where he practices medicine and develops software. His latest project is called Oneplaybook, and is built on TiddlyWiki.</p><p>We talked with Abraham about his work, digital note taking apps, TiddlyWiki, Oneplaybook and his thoughts about the future of all things privacy and security.</p> Q. When did you first Discover TiddlyWiki? <p></p><p>A. I discovered TiddlyWiki around 2016. I was looking around the web at the time for inspiration for my next web side project. I wanted to try to create a knowledge management system because, as a doctor and philomath, my primary concern was building and maintaining an organized personal knowledge base for the many things I learned over the years. However, I didn’t want to simply use someone else’s app. <br></p> Q. What is TiddyWiki in your own words? <p></p><p>A. Describing TiddlyWiki has become something of a mental exercise when introducing it to people outside of the TiddlyWiki community. It’s pretty hard because it is more than just another wiki application. For beginners, the succinct description of a “non-linear notetaking app” is usually sufficient to get them interested enough to have a look and try it out for themselves. The idea of creating free flowing linked thoughts is appealing because in many ways, that is how our minds usually work. We tend to meander in our thoughts, and at our own pace. It’s refreshing for many of us who can’t bear to fill diaries on a regular basis!</p><p>However, the moment beginners start to use TiddlyWiki and experience the many incredible features it has to offer like transclusion, metaprogramming and the ability to reproduce its own source code (making it a quine) and allowing it to save itself as a self-contained, decentralized single HTML file, they usually almost always experience a profound “aha” moment. All of these features aren’t really captured by the non-linear notebook description well enough. So I’d prefer calling it ‘a metaprogramable environment for your thoughts and knowledge’. Another apt high-level description I like to use is ‘like Excel, but in notebook form.’</p> Q. What do you use TiddlyWiki for personally? <p></p><p>A. I try to organize my life with TiddlyWiki as much as possible. I use it for brainstorming, creating shopping lists, noting down ideas, even saving web articles for offline saving that are too important to me to be put into another web article saving tool.</p><p>In some cases, I use TiddlyWiki’s built-in building blocks to create my own solutions. Other times I use a solution crafted by other TiddlyWiki users. I do all this not only for my own utility, but also to explore new ideas for plugins to fill in certain need gaps that may exist in TiddlyWiki.</p><p>I’m heavily invested in my notebook. So much so that it has become a living portrait of my life. I am sure advertisements networks would kill to have this kind of rich information about a single person. But they never will, and that’s the beauty of it! It’s all yours and no one else’s. Oh, it even has a built-in tool to encrypt your notes so there’s that!</p> Q. What have you built with TiddlyWiki? <p></p><p>A. I’ve built a number of plugins, including a Lean canvas manager that I’d like to revamp in the near future. I also created Maarfapad dot com which is a free community cloud service for hosting personal wikis. Now I am busy with the upcoming <a href="https://oneplaybook.app/">OnePlaybook</a> dot app service which will give users the ability to create and use wikis inside their preferred cloud service, like Google Drive or Dropbox. You could also deploy it onto a private server and use it completely offline.</p>From Oneplaybook.app<p>It’s been a work in progress since sometime last year. I came up with the basic concept in February and I’ve been refining the idea with a colleague of mine who is a software engineer.</p><p>We are testing it and seeing we can address some pain points for our future users. We’re staying customer focused on our side of things because we really want this thing to succeed. The pandemic is showing us different pain points that can be met with our product and with TiddlyWiki. For instance, Oneplaybook allows teams working remotely to work together asynchronously or in real time in a free and secure workspace.</p><p>People need to be empowered with their own agency and sovereignty again with these tools</p> Q. What are your favorite TiddlyWiki plugins? <p></p><p>A. Let me break it down into a list:</p>  For UI, I love the work that JD mobile is doing. I use his Whitespaces plugin that configures TiddlyWiki into a mobile friendly experience among other things.  Mohammed’s Kookma Todo list plugin is a very compact micro-app todo list maker for your wiki. Highly recommended  Noteself is an awesome edition of TiddlyWiki that creates a self-hosted wikis with your data being stored inside your browser. You can also sync it to a CouchDB server that you own  Projectify is a beautiful edition of TiddlyWiki reimagined as a project management tool with direct inspiration taken from basecamp by its author. Very nice that one.  Krystal plugin turns your wiki into Andy Matuschak’s notebook. If you don’t understand, Google this guy’s notes. It’s mind-blowing and he’s awesome!  <p>There are many more than I could go on about, but these are my absolute favorites. There is also a plugin that turns TiddlyWiki into a Roam Research lookalike called Stroll. This is a testament to the inventiveness of open source communities like ours. You never know what you might find tomorrow.</p> Q. What’s one thing that you wish TiddlyWiki did? <p></p><p>A. In terms of features, there’s not much it can’t do that’s essential. You can always create a plugin or macro to satisfy your needs. And more will come along, especially as the core developers work to make API easier to understand and work with in upcoming versions. More integrations with other external services for things like sharing and publishing would also be nice. But what I would like is more traction. And that’s somewhat more difficult to attain.</p><p>Although TiddlyWiki is already very popular as an open source software, with more than 5k stars on Github, it is still relatively unknown to many it’s meant to help. Its main ‘competitor’ in this space is Roam Research which tends to steal the show among academics, which is ok--we all have different tastes, but I feel people are missing out a lot. Particularly in terms of robustness; TiddlyWiki works fine no matter the browser you use or the state of your internet connection. You can’t say the same about most proprietary software-as-a-service apps.</p><p>And when it comes to knowledge management, you want that kind of robustness and versatility. TiddlyWiki is so much older than other similar apps today (more than seven years old now) and it has stayed very stable throughout that time. Backwards compatibility is keystone in the community. A TiddlyWIki from 2014 will work just as well and will be mostly compatible with a version from 2021. That kind of robustness is gold in an age of planned obsolescence and ‘move fast, break things’.</p> Q. What excites you about Fission and TiddlyWiki teaming up? <p></p><p>A. Whenever there is a new service integration for TiddlyWiki, there’s more to look forward to in terms of possibilities and opportunities. Hooking up TiddlyWiki to Fission allows for all kinds of interesting things IMO, such as web publishing, site creation, SaaS creation (difficult if you don’t employ a MERN or LAMP stack), things that might require domain experts or teams might now be possible for ordinary people from other fields of expertise to do.</p><p>The web should be open for creators from all walks of life, not just IT ninjas. I see this partnership as a step towards enabling that vision even more. We can imagine people learning only basic web skills creating B2B web services built with TiddlyWiki and hosted on decentralized infrastructure and improving their livelihood. It may feel like a stretch, but we must remember that all of the web today was once seen as a stretch too. It’s up to all of us to make it more mundane!</p> Q. What interests you about the future of web technology? <p></p><p>A. I’m really interested in decentralized web technologies--these are really good things and we need them more than ever. Last year we as a nation actually experienced for the first time some form of censorship during our elections. It was really unnerving for a lot of us. We couldn’t access Twitter...and evidence emerged online that Twitter was being locked on every level imaginable. They were blocking it wherever they could find it.</p><p>In fact, VPN became a meme of sorts because Tanzania was introduced to such a thing after this incident. It was really disorienting for people to need to think about this sort of thing. Some people even thought VPN was a magical potion to drink in order to access the internet.</p><p>The situation got me thinking about how vulnerable we are. Something needs to change on a fundamental level. We need to think about how we create stuff on the web and how we can be better protected.</p><p>This is a wakeup call of all of us over here. But, at least there is encouraging progress being made toward creating a lot of decentralized protocols. I hear that Mozilla and maybe Brave have taken up some of these protocols. So who knows? The future is bright. It’s encouraging.</p> <p>We here at Fission agree with Abraham--the future definitely looks bright! Especially with brilliant minds like Abraham's </p><p>If you’d like to be notified when Oneplaybook is ready, sign up for the waiting list at <a href="http://oneplaybook.app">oneplaybook.app</a>. You can find Abraham on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/ABSamma">@ABSamma</a>.</p>

					 Meetup with Indicio to explore decentralized identity 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  As a public benefit corporation, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a technology that will benefit everyone. To help people understand how this technology works, we are hosting Meetups once per month on a Wednesday, except holidays.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>We started in December last year, and this Wednesday the 24th will be our fourth get-together. I would like to briefly share with you some of the highlights from our past events. </p>
<p>Our first Meetup on December 23, 2020 saw Sam Curren (@TelegramSam) present an overview of decentralized identity, Lynn Bendixsen talk about the Hyperledger Indy Network community, and Daniel Bluhm (@dbluhm_) give an overview of Hyperledger Aries.</p>
<p>Our second Meetup in January, 2021 discussed our newly <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/">open-sourced mediator agent</a>, which makes it possible to communicate verifiable credentials to mobile devices via open source standards. Indicio’s Sam Curren (senior architect) &amp; Daniel Bluhm (software engineer) dived into the details. The recording (highly recommended!) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXsELfUYrGM&amp;t=2s">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our February saw Mike Vesey, President of <a href="https://idramp.com/">IdRamp</a>, demonstrate how users of <a href="https://qiqochat.com/">QiqoChat</a> can take full control over their digital identity with a self-sovereign privacy-focused solution protected by state-of-the-art cryptographic blockchain security. Vesey showed just how easy it was to integrate verifiable credentials &nbsp;with various communication tools. You can watch the demonstration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94Wd9S66Is4">here</a>.</p>
<p>This Wednesday, the innovative app developers at <a href="http://global.id">GlobaliD </a>&nbsp;Alexis Falquier and Dev Bharel will show a brief video demonstration of their interoperable wallet connecting with, receiving a credential from, and verifying the credential with an agent on Trinsic’s studio. Sign up <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/276745615/">here</a>! </p>

					  Gleich sechs Business Angels beteiligen sich mit einer Pre-Seed-Finanzierung in sechsstelliger Höhe an der comuny GmbH aus Weinheim. Bereits im Dezember konnte der Pitch des Startups beim Online-Matching der Business Angels FrankfurtRheinMain (BA FRM) überzeugen. Neben Mitgliedern aus dem Frankfurter Investorennetzwerk wurde ein weiterer Business Angel aus dem Kölner Raum gewonnen. <p>Benutzername plus Passwort? Nicht mehr sicher genug. Unternehmen unterziehen ihre Kunden immer stärkeren Sicherheitsüberprüfungen, wenn sich diese an digitalen Services anmelden. Doch die Organisation sicherheitsrelevanter Nutzerdaten und Passwörter ist für Unternehmen anspruchsvoll, technisch aufwändig und teuer. Zudem unkomfortabel für den Kunden: Trotz Kundenkonto braucht er oft zusätzlich eine App oder zeitraubende Hilfsmittel wie Smartcards.</p><p>Dabei liegt die Lösung auf der Hand: Zum einen setzen sich mobile Endgeräte aktuell immer klarer als favorisierter Zugriffspunkt vieler Nutzer durch. Zum anderen benutzen Prüfverfahren Gerätefunktionen wie Kamera, Fingerprint, TAN-Apps oder schicken Codes via SMS. Wer dieses Nebeneinander verzahnt, generiert entscheidende Vorteile.</p><p>Hier unterstützt comuny über eine schlanke B2B-Komponente und etabliert sich als Spezialist für die einfache und sichere Realisierung von Registrierungs- und Login-Prozessen für Apps über mobile Endgeräte.</p><p>So können Unternehmen erstmals persönliche Daten des Kunden für verschiedene ihrer IT-Systeme effizienter, nämlich unter Einbeziehung des Mobilgeräts organisieren. Denn einmal verifizierte Daten des Kunden können auf dem Gerät verwahrt und anschließend für sicheren Zugriff bei Anmeldung sogar auf neue Dienste weiterverwendet werden.</p><p>Steffen Seifarth, einer der Investoren von comuny, erfahrener Business Angel und bekannt für kritisch-konstruktive Prüfung von Teams und Geschäftsmodellen bekräftigt: „Uns hat von Anfang an der konsequente WIN-WIN-WIN Gedanke von comuny imponiert, bei dem Nutzer, Unternehmen sowie die eingebundenen Dienstleister von einer sicheren, schlanken und gleichzeitig hochflexiblen Datennutzung profitieren.“</p><p>Und Nikolaus D. Bayer, preisgekrönter Business Angel des Jahres 2020 formuliert für alle Investoren von comuny: „Wir freuen uns darauf, das Team von comuny in den kommenden Wachstumsphasen zu begleiten und bei der Applizierung der Technologie auf weitere Branchen und Use-Cases zu unterstützen.“</p><p><a href="https://www.comuny.de/presse/">Vollständige Pressemitteilung vom 22.03.21 lesen</a></p><p>#startups #businessangelfrankfurt #verifizierung #authentifizierung #operator #trinity</p>

There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU. Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready. Too many technical problems were yet to be solved.

When these minor harms are done at a vast scale by a large number of actors, they aggregate into more significant harms to people and society.

<p>(originally sent on Sep 30. <a href="http://eepurl.com/coMMKT">Subscribe to our newsletter now</a>)</p><p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>I have a couple of follow-ups to Bitmark’s recent milestones mentioned in past newsletters.<br> <br> Last week, our team received the Cohack award for Autonomy, our public health app. Taiwan president 蔡英文 Tsai Ing-wen presented CEO Sean with the award, which upon seeing up-close photos of, I’m quite envious. <br> <br> See Sean at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1307962865777651714">:15 from this tweet</a> from the President.<br> <br> We also officially announced our collaboration with UC Berkeley and its school of public health via this <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uc-berkeley-and-bitmark-launch-autonomy-app-as-part-of-the-schools-covid-19-safe-campus-initiative-301134438.html">press release</a>. We’re excited to transition Autonomy to the entire city of Berkeley on September 30th. It’s completely free and users control the full rights to their data.<br> <br> If you know anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area, please have them try it out here: <a href="https://autonomy-pwa.bitmark.com/">https://autonomy-pwa.bitmark.com</a>. We’ve had some encouraging talks with other public health departments around the United States, and I hope we can be of&nbsp;help.</p><p><a href="https://autonomy-pwa.bitmark.com">Try Autonomy&nbsp;Now</a></p><p>I only have one link to share this month, so I’ll get to that first before going deeper into my current frame of mind. There is an irony that in many places, such as New York City, a tenant cannot install cameras (ex. doorbell cameras) to preserve everyone else’s privacy. Yet…landlords can.</p><p>There are few laws and regulations governing the collection and use of data in the context of Landlord Tech. Because it is generally sold to landlords and property managers, not tenants, Landlord Tech is often installed without notifying or discussing potential harms with tenants and community members. These harms include the possibility that sensitive and personal data can be handed over to the police, ICE, or other law enforcement and government agencies. Landlord Tech can also be used to automate evictions, racial profiling, and tenant harassment. In addition, Landlord Tech is used to abet real estate speculation and gentrification, making buildings more desirable to whiter and wealthier tenants, while feeding real estate and tech companies with property — be that data or real estate. Landlord Tech tracking platforms have increasingly been marketed to landlords as solutions to Covid-19, leading to new forms of residential surveillance.<br> <br> <a href="https://antievictionmappingproject.github.io/landlordtech/">https://antievictionmappingproject.github.io/landlordtech/</a></p><p>This got me thinking about the theme of today’s newsletter, how do we trust in the current age? A big part of why we built Autonomy during COVID-19 was that we heard how communities needed a way to trust, yet verify what they were being told. In an age of mass distributed disinformation, extreme politicking, and cancel culture, it’s hard to figure out if anything is real.<br> <br> For Bitmark, we like to believe that we can be a great partner because we are trustworthy, but how does one prove that? You really can’t. From the company’s inception, we needed to be able to create a digital rights standard. We felt we had to be effectively neutral without any ability to hold market power over stakeholders. Thus, we implemented blockchain in our infrastructure and open-source to let others verify what we were doing and be able to improve our work if we ever slacked behind. Using a decentralized platform ensured it would be extremely difficult for us to abuse our power (it would have been nice if we could say that about the Facebooks and Apples of the world right now).<br> <br> That said, you’d have to be pretty hardcore to go validate these things yourself. Unless there’s a lot of money in it or value in seeing Bitmark fail, not many people will be incentivized to investigate what Bitmark is doing.<br> <br> Perhaps the best we can do is signal our integrity and build relationships with you. When you have a chance to choose Bitmark to help you control the rights to a digital resource, we hope you feel comfortable doing so. One attempt is through this newsletter. Another is our new initiative to share Sean’s past reflections to our investors, which you can find here: <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/tagged/ceo-observation">https://medium.com/clean-titles/tagged/ceo-observation</a><br> <br> Sean writes these notes as part of his quarterly update to our investors. They’re often a bit raw, but they’re always an honest reflection of how he sees Bitmark’s role in the world at that time. Of course, if we go back, we might cringe at how naive we were, but that’s just part of the learning process.<br> <br> Moving forward, we’re going to share these with you, unedited, one quarter behind — you’ll see Q2’s notes in Q3. I’ve never seen another company do this, and I’m always fascinated by Sean’s viewpoint. I hope you can gain something from them too.<br> <br> I appreciate your continued support. If you enjoy this newsletter or our work, please help us by sharing it with a friend. We’ll keep fighting for your #digitalrights.<br> <br> Michael Nguyễn<br> Head of Operations, Bitmark<br> <a href="http://www.bitmark.com">www.bitmark.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/how-do-you-trust-in-the-digital-age-b2618e55a2e8">How do you trust in the Digital Age?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles">Bitmark’s Official Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

I love coding and I’m introvert. I though that it would be much simpler to explain in code, than in&nbsp;person.</p><p>Now I realized, that building everything by myself is certainly doable, BUT I need a long uninterrupted stretch of time for that. Which is impossible to get with all that presentations, documentation, talking, writing articles, and million of other things. Not to mention the necessity to make money for a living (I’m a human too, you know). I could shut it all down and go for a coding retreat for a couple of months, but there is a danger of falling into perfection death spiral for a project. Not an&nbsp;option.</p><p>Another important thing, is that by making all by myself I centralize it.

			  Xavi Aznal Prieto is Product Owner at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Xavi Aznal Prieto. I was born and still live with my wife and kids in the Barcelona area (Spain). I have a degree in Telecommunications Engineering and a masters in Computer Vision. Since I was a child I have always had an interest in knowing ‘how machines work’. I had the opportunity to have my own computer since I was 10 years old (8 bits CPU and 128KB RAM at that time), so I would say I am a vocational engineer. During my professional career I have developed several tech related roles, from big companies to startups. I have coded a lot, defined tech strategy and managed projects and teams. In particular, I have been involved in startup projects during the past 12 years, an environment that I feel very stimulating as I like new challenges and not getting bored 🙂</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I previously worked with our CCO Daniel Coheur in a startup project where I recruited and managed a tech development team in Barcelona. Tokeny had the idea of setting up a development team in Barcelona, so Daniel contacted me, we started discussing with Luc, our CEO, and I was quickly convinced by the potential of the business vision. I started with Tokeny by taking a Product Owner role and also with the goal of recruiting and managing Barcelona development office. Now we are seven people in Barcelona, and we will hopefully keep growing!</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I feel very comfortable being part of Tokeny’s team. People are very skilled and communication is fairly fluid in all directions. Because of last year’s situation, we have become very familiar with a fully remote working environment and our adaption has been excellent, which speaks volumes about the quality of the team.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I love to be outdoors and breathe some fresh air. I have been into endurance sports for many years, having finished some marathons, Ultra Trails and Iron Man triathlons. Now I do not train so hard but a good run across the countryside still charges my batteries.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>If all my beloved ones, wife and kids, stay healthy I have more than enough to be happy 🙂</p>
  
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would say that every person in the world could have their basic needs covered: food, roof and health access. A utopia? I would like to think it’s not.</p>

It features Bitmark CEO Sean and Girls in Tech’s Renee Yeh contrasting their experiences with technology, rights, and democracy in the east and the west. You can also find our audio podcast links in the video description of the link&nbsp;above.</p><p>I’ve asked some questions from our two hosts and producer Vivian&nbsp;Chen:</p><p>Who is this podcast for and what should they expect from&nbsp;it?</p><p>Vivian: This podcast is for those who care about rights and democracy and are wondering how we can improve&nbsp;it.</p><p>What’s been the most interesting learning you’ve had so&nbsp;far?</p><p>Sean: The most interesting learning I’ve had was with the National Taiwan Treasure project on the Hsiao A episode. It was surprising to me that it has had no impact on Taiwanese People. Finding out how this single bad decision has been affecting Taiwan as a country should have been a constitutional moment, but I was shocked that Taiwnese people didn’t care as much as I expected. In the United States in 2013, when Edward Snowden leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency, U.S. citizens thought of him as a traitor. After thinking deeper into the incident, people realized that what the government was doing was actually anti-democracy. But it seemed that people don’t really know what or how to change anymore, since these problems are so deeply rooted in our culture and governance.</p><p>I think that podcasts are, for now, the most important media to share information and educate the public. They can be independent without censorship and time limitations. During each episode’s discussions, we get to go as deep as we want. It’s unlike the current media, which is under the attention economy — eager for fast and short content. I feel privileged to talk with Renee and share things we care about, and getting people to start thinking about them. It’s basically pirate&nbsp;radio!</p><p>Renee: I enjoy communication and public speaking, and I would say that audience response is what drives me to share more. Podcasting is very different. It is like sailing in the dark for me. Producing each episode is like piloting Endurance (sorry for being an Interstellar nerd) into the unknown, and testifying to the truth, the cosmic truth — “Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and&nbsp;space.”</p><p>In each episode, we project love. Love for the world, love for each other, love for a better future. We are not sure when or where such love will be perceived, but we keep projecting.</p><p>Vivian: At the beginning of this podcast program, I imagined that our show would be purely rational. Talking about technologies for good and how technology could be the engine of growth in modern crises, Covid-19 especially. After episodes of discussion, I realized our program can be more than that. We started to cover all different elements that form our society, problems that lead to crises and tools people use to get through the crises. I was amazed by the complexity of the world and hope to discover more in our future episodes.</p><p>With everything going on in the world, which crisis should we most have hope for and&nbsp;why?</p><p>Sean: Covid-19 of course! This crisis brings forward the importance of health, and it activates science. For example, traditionally, it would take around 10 years to fully develop a vaccine. But due to Covid-19, the U.S. government was encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to innovate by simplifying and amplifying the process of development, and the government is willing to take the risk of failing by covering the money lost in failure. This is what the government should do — protect people’s civil liberties, unlock innovation and make it safe to&nbsp;fail.</p><p>Renee: Democracy. I think democracy is a value but we humans have little knowledge about how to realize this value through political means.

<p>by Shannon Appelcline.</p><p>As the Bitmark blockchain becomes more popular for NFTs, health data, music royalties and other types of digital property, we are frequently asked about the energy impact of the Bitmark blockchain and of blockchains in&nbsp;general.</p> Energy &amp; The Blockchain <p>The energy usage of blockchains has been in the news a lot lately. What’s that&nbsp;about?</p><p>Q: Why do Blockchains Use&nbsp;Energy?</p><p>A: The most widely used methodology for securing blockchains is the “proof-of-work” algorithm, which is at the heart of Bitcoin, as well as the Bitmark blockchain.This means that you have to do work in the form of extensive cryptographic calculations order to add a block of transactions to the blockchain. Since each block requires time and computational power, the blockchain grows more and more secure the more blocks are piled on top of each other, because it becomes increasingly difficult to go back and redo all those calculations.</p><p>Computers running calculations draw&nbsp;power.</p><p>Q: How Much Power is&nbsp;Needed?</p><p>A: The power needed to secure a blockchain is related to the total computational power working on a blockchain. The more computers that are trying to create blocks for the blockchain, the more power that’s required. That means that a very popular blockchain like Bitcoin has high energy requirements, while one focused on a much smaller area of expertise, like Bitmark, has a smaller power requirement.</p><p>That means that the power requirement of a blockchain can be directly measured by its computational power. That measurement is usually recorded as a “hashrate”: the number of hashes that can be made in a second by computers working on the blockchain, where a hash is the main cryptographic function used to make blocks and thus secure the blockchain.</p> Energy &amp;&nbsp;Bitmark <p>Like many other blockchains, Bitmark uses a proof-of-work algorithm, which means that it uses energy to secure its blocks. How much and how does that compare to other energy&nbsp;uses?</p><p>Q: What is the Hashrate of the Bitmark&nbsp;Network?</p><p>A: The Bitmark Network runs at about <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitmark/hashrate-chart">160 TH/s</a> and remains rock solid at that level. That’s terahashes per Second, or trillion hashes per second. In other words: 160,000,000,000,000 hashes per&nbsp;second.</p><p>In comparison, the Bitcoin Network’s hash rate has been rapidly escalating since 2017 and is currently running a bit under <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html">160 EX/s</a>, which is 160 exahashes or quintillion hashes per second, which is to say: 160,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per&nbsp;second.</p><p>The hashrate of the Bitcoin Network is literally a million times that of the Bitmark&nbsp;network.</p><p>Q: How Much Energy Does That Mean Bitmark&nbsp;uses?</p><p>A: We can measure energy usage by looking at the power costs of the mining rigs that secure blocks on blockchains. A relatively modern rig, the <a href="https://shop.bitmain.com/promote/antminer_s17pro/specification">Antminer S17 Pro</a>, uses 39.5 joules per terahash, which is the same as&nbsp;.011 Wh, or&nbsp;.000011 KWh, for a trillion&nbsp;hashes.</p><p>If Bitmark were run entirely on Antminer S17 Pros, in year it would use&nbsp;.000011 KWh/TH * 160 terahashes per second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 365 days, which is 55,500 KwH or 55.5 MwH. That’s probably a lower boundary, as average energy usage is likely to be less efficient.</p><p>Q: How Does that Compare to&nbsp;Bitcoin?</p><p>In comparison, a variety of reports state Bitcoin energy usage currently runs 80 to 120 TwH, which is 80,000,000 MwH to 120,000,000 MwH.</p><p>That’s unsurprisingly the same one to a million comparison that we saw in hashrates between the networks: Bitmark’s energy usage is likely one one-millionth of Bitcoin’s.</p><p>Q: How Does that Compare to Centralized Financial Systems?</p><p>A: It’s very hard to compare a blockchain with centralized financial systems because the power costs of blockchains are quite transparent while those of centralized systems are full of hidden subsidies.</p><p>However, we can produce a quick thumbnail to reveal the scope of the cost of those centralized systems. Considering the financial sector as a whole, there are 9 million financial employees in the US, another 5 million or so in Europe, and even more in Asia, Australia, South America, and Africa, bringing the number to many tens of millions. They have a whole infrastructure of buildings, vehicles, computers, credit card machines, and stock markets underlying them. That energy cost is obviously astronomical.</p><p>Many of those employees work in skyscrapers, which allows for a more precise comparison: in New York City, a fairly average skyscraper <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90181905/a-block-by-block-look-at-the-energy-consumption-of-new-yorks-buildings">can use 40 MwH of energy a year</a>, which means that 1.5 skyscrapers would balance out Bitmark’s energy usage. However, the workers in the US centralized financial industry alone could fill 750 skyscrapers! That’s 500x more energy usage than Bitmark’s blockchain, just for the offices of those US&nbsp;workers.</p><p>So, even with all those hidden subsidies, it’s pretty easy to say that Bitmark at least uses a bare fraction of even the US financial market’s office&nbsp;energy.</p><p>For a more extensive look at the costs of the financial industry as a whole, please see our article, “Bitcoin: What are the Real&nbsp;Costs?”</p><p>Q: How Does that Compare to Other Property Blockchains?</p><p>A: Bitmark is specialized in digital property. We’ve worked to create <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/digital-property-rights-with-bitmark-nfts-evolving-the-artists-reserved-rights-transfer-and-sale-509ffd1f990a">the best combination of software technology with property law</a>. Fundamentally, there aren’t any other major blockchains with that focus. The closest is Ethereum, which has created some standards for tokens to support property. However, what they’ve created is ultimately an add-on to an existing system, so unsurprisingly their implementation is <a href="https://docs.bitmark.com/meta/bitmark-eth-comparison">less efficient</a>.</p> Energy &amp;&nbsp;Miners <p>It’s ultimately the miners who create (and secure) blocks that use the energy in a blockchain, thus examining them can tell us a bit more about energy&nbsp;costs.</p><p>Q: Where Are Miners&nbsp;Located?</p><p>A: Blockchain networks are decentralized, so they can be anywhere in the world. The University of Cambridge maintains <a href="https://cbeci.org/mining_map">a map</a> that suggests that the US, China, and Russia are the biggest homes of Bitcoin miners. (Other sources say that China may have more than 50% of&nbsp;mining.)</p><p>The more general answer is that miners tend to be located where energy is cheap, and that also tends to mean where energy is cheap because it isn’t being used. A lot of the Bitcoin mining in China thus uses hydroelectric power that was built up but was not used or is underutilized. In fact, Chinese cities have been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-city-known-for-bitcoin-mining-seeks-blockchain-firms-to-burn-excess-hydropower">seeking Bitcoin miners</a> because they literally have billions of KwH of power going to&nbsp;waste.</p><p>More importantly, Bitcoin energy usage is very green. The best report on the topic puts <a href="https://coinshares.com/assets/resources/Research/bitcoin-mining-network-june-2019-fidelity-foreword.pdf">renewable energy usage at&nbsp;74.1%</a>.</p><p>Bitmark mining demographics are likely to closely follow Bitcoin demographics.</p><p>Q: How Distributed Are&nbsp;Miners?</p><p>A: Distribution is pretty much the heart of any blockchain.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/pools/">number of mining pools</a> each mine between 10–20% of all blocks. There is certainly some centralization here, though a mining pool doesn’t require all the mining rigs to be in the same&nbsp;place.</p><p>For energy usage considerations, the most relevant fact here is this: miners distribute themselves to where the cheap energy is, and that often means clean energy and unused energy. Miners do not tend to cluster in locations with existing high energy costs, which would suggest high usage, because it’s just not economical to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>For a carefully footnoted look at the overall problems with the framing of blockchain energy arguments, especially in relationship to Bitcoin, see our article, “<a href="https://medium.com/p/ba830d6df104">Bitcoin: What are the Real&nbsp;Costs?</a>”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/bitmark-blockchain-energy-usage-q-a-aeda13537228">Bitmark Blockchain: Energy Usage Q&amp;A</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles">Bitmark’s Official Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The March 2021 edition of Fission's monthly Demo Day covered updates and demos from Fission, an overview of how we use IPFS, and demos from TiddlyWiki and IndyWiki.</p> How does Fission use IPFS? <p>We covered a brief intro to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as part of our demo day. We had a lot of interest in our recent <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/ipfs-local-offline-collaboration-sig/">presentation to the IPFS Local Offline Collab group</a>, and so decided to talk a bit more about how we use IPFS and why it's important to us.</p> User Domains and Public File Sharing Link Types <p>Every Fission user account has a custom domain at <code>USERNAME.fission.name</code>. For files that are stored in a user's public folder, they can access them using a consistent link using their own subdomain.</p><p>Brian from our team gave a demo and explanation of the different types of links that are available, as well as a small piece of example code showing how this works.</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://benevolent-senior-pink-yeti.fission.app/">benevolent-senior-pink-yeti </a>to get all the links to sample code and to experiment with the live demo yourself.</p> Linking Fission Accounts on Desktop <p>People can link accounts between browsers and devices today. Developers use the command line interface (CLI) use developer-only accounts that can't currently link to the web. Our CTO Brooklyn gave a preview of how CLI linking will work.</p><p>When this is released, it also opens the door for desktop-based file syncing and many other features, so we're excited to have this close to release.</p> Community Demos <p>Below is the full video for March 2021 Demo Day. Unfortunately, because we had an accident with recording, we managed to not capture a big chunk of the middle of the demos. In particular, Jeremy's TiddlyWiki static file publishing demo!</p><p>Join us this week, <a href="https://lu.ma/5j50g810">Wednesday, March 24th, for a TiddlyWiki Community Chat</a>, where we'll showcase current features and progress of <a href="https://tiddlywiki.fission.app">TiddlyWiki on Fission</a>.</p><p>Gyuri, who can follow online as <a href="https://twitter.com/Trailmarks">@TrailMarks on Twitter</a>, gave us a brief demo and overview of <a href="https://indywiki.fission.app/">IndyWiki</a>.</p><p>The full slide deck is <a href="https://presentations.fission.app/demodays/2021-03-18-fission-demoday.pdf">available here as a PDF »</a></p><p>Thanks to everyone for coming, including brief reports from Neil and Jim on what they're working on at the moment!</p> <p>We do weekly tech talks most Thursdays, as well as our monthly Demo Days. <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">Sign up to get invited to future events »</a></p>

It can be used for machines, services and anything that identities can be built on,&nbsp;too.</p> Machine Identity <p>Identity is multifaceted, made up of a unique combination of characteristics, attributes and properties that distinguish a person or object from&nbsp;others.</p><p>At KILT we break identity down into two key components:</p>  A decentralised identifier (DID), which uniquely identifies an entity or device,&nbsp;and  Verifiable, revocable credentials that are confirmed by trusted parties (“attesters”).  <p>In machine identity, these credentials would be the static and dynamic properties of the device, such as certificates, rights, roles or capabilities.</p><p>In order to add credentials to its identifier (DID), the device could create a claim that it wants to have confirmed by an attester. The attester would check that the attributes are correct and if they are, would send a credential back to the device, which would store it under its control. Additionally, the attester anchors the validity of the credential by creating a hash out of the credential that represents the credential on the blockchain.</p><p>If the attributes change or become invalid, the attester could invalidate the credential on the blockchain. When the device presents a credential to a third party (verifier), the third party could check if the entity presenting the credential actually owns it, and could verify the validity of the credential on the blockchain.</p><p>Using the KILT Protocol, only a hash that represents the credential and its validity is ever recorded on the blockchain, not the full certificate itself. Thus, a minimum of data is stored to maximise privacy, anonymity and security. The attested certificate itself remains the property of the device and can only be read with the permission of the device&nbsp;owner.</p> Energy Efficiency <p>How could that be used in the real world? A current example is our collaboration with <a href="https://www.dena.de/en/home/">dena</a>, Germany’s federal energy&nbsp;agency.</p><p>In a move towards greater energy efficiency, dena initiated a project to create the Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL), a decentralised digital registry to enable the integration of energy generating and energy consuming devices as active market participants.</p><p>To achieve this, assets such as energy meters, heat pumps, solar power systems, etc. could register their identity on the BMIL. As outlined above, this means that the device could generate an identifier in the form of a DID, with attributes assigned to this identifier as verifiable credentials whose validity is anchored on the BMIL as long as they meet the standards built into the system. More credentials could be added as needed, creating a digital identity.</p><p>These digital identities would allow data to be exchanged between the market participants and systems while meeting the required regulatory standards.The process contributes to the creation of the digital ledger as a dynamic registry of devices to be registered and have their data verified in a decentralised way. The owner of the unique identifier of each device could choose how much information is released by it, maintaining privacy and control over the&nbsp;data.</p><p>This pilot project provides the basis for building services and market-oriented applications, complementing the use of smart meters. The BMIL thus aims to coordinate and connect the rapidly increasing interfaces within the German energy system. In addition to being secure, reliable and traceable, the cost of sharing data could be kept&nbsp;low.</p> Cooperation <p>The dena project is being delivered by an alliance of 21 partners, made up of scientists, established players in the digital and energy sectors, and innovative blockchain startups like BOTLabs, the inventor of&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>KILT is participating as part of a consortium led by <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/2019/06/19/energy-web-foundation-launches-worlds-first-public-open-source-enterprise-grade-blockchain-tailored-to-the-energy-sector/">Energy Web Foundation</a>, a global non-profit organisation who use open-source technology to initiate a low carbon system that enables any energy asset owned by any customer to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web blockchain was launched in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>Other members of the consortium include <a href="https://www.riddleandcode.com/">Riddle &amp; Code</a>, <a href="https://www.50hertz.com/">50 Hertz</a>, and <a href="https://www.parity.io/">Parity Technologies</a>, the company behind the development of Substrate — the blockchain technology that KILT is built on — and Polkadot, a ground-breaking “blockchain of blockchains”.</p> Web 3.0 with&nbsp;KILT <p>This is just one example of the many ways KILT Protocol could be used to create digital identifiers and revocable, verifiable credentials while protecting the self sovereignty and anonymity of the data owner. We look forward to seeing how entrepreneurial developers use our universal protocol as blockchain technology moves into the next generation of the internet, Web 3.0, evolving beyond the hype to real-world uses.</p><p>We are proud to be part of the cutting edge of that revolution. In 2018 we were early adopters of Substrate, the modular system powered by Parity Technologies that makes it easy to build a customized blockchain using pre-built components. Substrate also allows seamless integration with Polkadot — an ecosystem of blockchains that overcomes the previous problems of security, scalability, and interoperability that have hampered blockchain adoption so far. Founded by Ethereum co-founder and former CTO Gavin Wood, Polkadot is paving the way for a new era of innovation.</p><p>In January 2021 KILT became one of the first projects in the world to join Rococo, the parachain testnet for the Polkadot ecosystem. When parachains have been fully tested and stabilised on Rococo and subsequently on Kusama, Polkadot’s canary network, we aim to participate in the first Kusama parachain auctions. We then intend to start our mainnet on Kusama shortly after securing a parachain slot to make our services available as soon as possible.</p><p>See our <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/kilts-path-to-parachains-ad3be644db8a">Path to Parachains article</a> for more details and <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/newsletter/">sign up for our newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date with developments as they&nbsp;occur.</p>

 5 Beauty ingredients you thought were&nbsp;clean <p>Clean Beauty is an up and coming industry with the potential to effect real, positive change. Unfortunately, many products branded as “clean beauty” contain hidden ingredients that negatively impact our health and the environment.</p><p>Here are five beauty care ingredients that you might not know are harmful to people and the&nbsp;planet.</p>  Exfoliating microbeads — many face washes and exfoliating body washes contain a plastic substance called polyethylene or microbeads. Microbeads are touted as good for your skin because they exfoliate to remove dead skin cells. Unlike natural exfoliants like salt that biodegrade, plastic microbeads cause <a href="https://cvskinlabs.com/7-cosmetic-ingredients-that-are-bad-for-the-environment/">real harm to the planet</a>. Although the beads are tiny, one container of facial cleanser can contain up to 350,000 beads! These beads accumulate in rivers, lakes, and oceans, causing plastic pollution.  <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/six-skincare-ingredients-which-are-harming-the-environment">Triclosan</a> is “an antibacterial agent sometimes found in toothpaste, shampoo, soap, face wash, and hand sanitizer.” Not only does it have harmful effects on algae and aquatic bacteria, but it may also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6126357/">negatively impact human&nbsp;health</a>.  Synthetic fragrances can be found in almost every beauty product from shampoo to bronzer and they may contain any combination of bad ingredients. <a href="https://coconutsandkettlebells.com/10-harmful-ingredients-makeup-skincare-products/">The problem</a> with fragrance in beauty and skin care products is that manufacturers aren’t required to say exactly what is in it. They can simply say “parfum” or “fragrance,” which could contain carcinogens, allergens, endocrine disruptors, or irritants.  Oxybenzone and octinoxate are ingredients commonly found in sunscreen and are known to have <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/news/sunscreen-corals.html">harmful effects</a> on coral reefs and marine life. In January of this year, <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=dc777751-66bf-4b68-abe4-3176bb93a589">Hawaii officially banned</a> the sale of over the counter sunscreens containing these ingredients, in an effort to preserve marine environments.  Last, but not least are Siloxanes, which are <a href="https://www.byrdie.com/toxic-beauty-ingredients-4782646">compounds found in many cosmetic and skincare products</a>. Not only have they been found to cause harm to the environment through bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms, but they have also been linked with <a href="https://davidsuzuki.org/queen-of-green/dirty-dozen-siloxanes/">endocrine disruption and fertility issues</a> in humans, making them a serious health&nbsp;concern.  <p>It is disappointing to learn how few regulations there are governing the beauty industry and manufacturers claiming to be “clean beauty” brands can get away with putting harmful ingredients in their products. <a href="https://www.greenamerica.org/green-living/ugly-side-cosmetics">According to the Environmental Working Group</a> “89 percent of 10,500 ingredients used in personal care products have not been evaluated for safety by the CIR, the FDA, nor any other publicly accountable institution.”</p><p>Thankfully, some companies are taking a stand to ensure that everything in their products are good for human health and the planet. Brands like <a href="https://www.drbronner.com/media-center/press-release/genuine-eco-friendly-brand-squeaky-clean-reputation/">Dr. Bronners </a>and <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/why-drunk-elephant-is-the-best-natural-skincare-line.html">Drunk Elephant </a>are paving the way in real clean beauty, ensuring that their products are free of any dangerous ingredients.</p><p>But how can serious clean beauty brands show customers that they are the real deal? Peer Ledger’s <a href="https://peerledger.com">MIMOSI Connect</a> empowers companies to uphold their social values and share proof of their responsible practices. We help companies prove not only what’s in the product, but where these ingredients came from. That’s not just good business, it’s good people and the&nbsp;planet.</p> References   Rebecca (April 18, 2016), 7 Cosmetic Ingredients that are Bad for the Environment, CV Skin Labs.

<p>When Kristy Kim moved to the U.S. with her family from South Korea, she worked hard to achieve the American Dream. But when she graduated from a top university and landed a high-paying job in investment banking, she realized her years of scrimping and saving didn’t pay off in one crucial way – she had no credit file, so she wasn’t eligible for a car loan. She had to pay cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Kim has launched <a href="https://www.tomocredit.com/">TomoCredit Inc.</a>, a startup that uses with <a href="http://www.finicity.com/">Finicity’s</a> open banking platform to determine which applicants are qualified for credit, and how much credit to offer them. Traditionally, lenders use a credit score, but many people, including immigrants to the U.S. and young people, have not built up a credit history. TomoCredit’s research indicates that legacy lending policies keep 40 million people from accessing credit and the ability to build wealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using consumer-permissioned real-time data from than 10,000 financial institutions, Finicity can help TomoCredit get a clearer picture of an applicant’s financial health, <a href="http://www.finicity.com/lend">improving risk assessment and credit decisioning</a>. Once approved, applicants receive a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210318005204/en/The-TomoCredit-Mastercard%C2%AE-Gives-Consumers-Access-to-Credit-Through-High-Limit-Offering-With-No-Fees-and-0-APR">TomoCredit Mastercard credit card</a> with no fees and 0% APR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Enabling people to access and control their data, while ensuring best practices to protect both that data and the consumer, will continue to drive tremendous innovation that increases financial literacy, inclusion and health,” Finicity CEO Steve Smith says.&nbsp;</p>

This announcement fits well into the SailPoint strategy of expanding their core offerings IdentityIQ and IdentityNow with additional SaaS services, such as AI-based identity analytics and, now, capabilities for in-depth management and control of access in business applications.</p>
 Acquisition will help SailPoint in further expanding their offerings for business applications 
<p>This acquisition also fits well into the SailPoint focus on managing users and their access across the entire lifecycle, and for all types of services. While SailPoint has been strong in managing SAP users and roles before, and also comes with considerable capabilities in SoD management, this acquisition will help them in further expanding their offerings for business applications.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the acquisition, once executed and once the two product sets are integrated, will give organizations an interesting option for a one-stop-shop for a solution that covers IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration, i.e., User Lifecycle Management, Identity Provisioning, and Access Governance) and delivers in depth SoD control and access control capabilities for environments containing business applications of various vendors.</p>
<p>While ERP Maestro’s biggest strength is in managing SAP environments, they also support some other business applications. SailPoint also provides support for a wide range of business applications.</p>
 Combining in-depth capabilities for ERP and core business applications serves current trends 
<p>With the business application landscape undergoing change, with SaaS offerings already playing a strong role in certain areas, and with a trend towards multi-vendor approaches for providing business applications, the combination of in-depth capabilities for ERP and other core business applications, and the breadth of supported systems SailPoint can offer, serves these trends well.</p>
<p>As for every acquisition, there is a need for unifying roadmaps and integrating the offerings, on which SailPoint must deliver. However, due to the specific strengths and focus of the existing solutions of both SailPoint and ERP Maestro, we see significant advantages in this strategy, and limited risk for existing customers of the companies.</p>
 CIOs should revisit their strategies around siloes of business applications 
<p>We recommend CIOs to revisit their strategies regarding access control, SoD control, and GRC for their business applications as well as their IT organizations, to reflect the move away from siloed solutions towards a more open ecosystem of business applications by various vendors, frequently deployed as SaaS.</p>

<p>The UEFA European Football Championship or the Euros is one of the most anticipated soccer competitions in Europe. The global sports betting volume is expected to increase massively – so providers have to ask themselves if they are ready to handle the player spike?</p>
<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the growth of the online gambling sector drastically. With fans watching from home, many are looking to engage through sports betting. Operators around the world are reporting record-high player numbers. We at IDnow noticed a surge in player onboarding since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 with impressive peaks during Super Bowl (+ 175%) and big football matches like Bayern Munich v Borussia Dortmund (+ 340%) – and we are expecting an even higher demand during the Euros.</p>
<p>Operators need to get ready to handle the spike in demand and keep their players happy. We prepared a convenient Infographic to give you an overview of what’s on the horizon:</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms are attracting a lot of attention from many organizations, from enterprises to government agencies and even those on the upper end of Small-to-Mid-Sized Businesses (SMBs). The reason for this is clear: the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve and get more complex in order to combat the corresponding rise in frequency and complexity of attacks.</p>
<p>SOAR platforms can be the capstone application for Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Most organizations have a plethora of security tools already, such as Endpoint Protection/Detection &amp; Response (EPDR), Next Gen Firewalls (NGFWs), Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR), Secure Web Gateways (SWGs), Email Gateways, Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, and so forth. SOC analysts have to interact with each of these systems in the course of daily management, investigations, and incident response. SOARs are designed to centralize many of the SOC analyst common and repetitive tasks, thereby decreasing the chance of errors and promoting efficiency.</p>
 From SIEM to SOAR 
<p>Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) tools have been on the scene for more than 15 years. SIEMs are the central repositories that hold security log data from all the upstream security tools. SIEMs can catch the data but have historically had difficulties with enterprise-wide orchestration and generating false positives. SOAR solutions have filled some of the functional gaps, adding orchestration, automation of enrichment and investigations, and providing the capability of simplifying incident responses.</p>
<p>Many SOAR products originated from specialized startups addressing the gaps in SIEM tools. Some SIEM solutions have upgraded and added SOAR type functions to their platforms; other SIEM and security stack vendors have acquired SOAR specialist companies to augment their offerings in that way. In some cases, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) management platforms have grown toward full SOAR capabilities. CTI management is a core feature of most SOAR tools, so this market development makes sense.</p>
 Orchestration and Automation 
<p>With a myriad of deployed security products in most SOCs, the lack of orchestration makes analysts’ work more arduous and time-consuming. Consider the following scenario. An analyst is alerted by EPDR via SOAR that registry entries have been added to a user’s workstation. These registry entries don’t match the baseline for deployed software within the organization; however, malware was not immediately detected. SOAR queries CTI and finds that these registry entries match newly discovered Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). SOAR can then automate a full scan on the affected machine and execute an enterprise-wide search for the same IoCs on all nodes.</p>
 Playbooks 
<p>Playbooks are the constructs that allow for default and customizable orchestration, automation, and response tasks. In the example above, the SOAR platform can profile the registry changes and query CTI sources to find out if others have encountered this type of event. SOAR can add the relevant CTI to the ticket for the analyst as it is opened and updated. Follow-up tasks such as the scans and multi-machine searches can be scripted in. Most SOAR solutions ship with dozens to hundreds of playbooks that address many of the common tasks that SOC analysts have to perform. Most SOAR playbooks are quite customizable, allowing customers to decide what level of automation they want to implement. Many organizations that use SOAR choose to automate preliminary investigation tasks and package response actions such that complex tasks can be reduced to a single analyst action. Another pertinent example would be allowing an analyst to remotely terminate network sessions to suspicious IP addresses while initiating scans and collecting file-level forensic evidence.</p>
 Integrations 
<p>Since SOAR must interact with various security data sources and downstream tools, integrations are the key. Integrations are typically packaged connectors that utilize APIs to pull information from and remotely command downstream security tools such as EPDR, NDR, NGFWs, etc. SOAR capabilities are constrained by the actions exposed by integrated tool APIs. When selecting a SOAR for your SOC, it is imperative to choose the vendor that has integrations for the tools you already have.</p>
 SOCs, SOC-as-a-Service, and MSSPs 
<p>Large organizations with mature security architectures and SOCs already in place can achieve a reasonably short time-to-value with SOAR implementations. Organizations that have SOCs but want to utilize outside help for SOAR functions, or those that want additional expertise may opt to use SOAR services delivered by Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs). Companies that do not have SOCs can still benefit from SOAR features if they engage SOC-as-a-Service solution providers. Many SOCaaS providers utilize SOAR products from the major vendors as a way to reduce the Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) for security incidents for their customers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>#ThrowbackThursday</p>



<p>The car industry offers a powerful example of a market that has been transformed by clever use of people’s data – as long as it puts drivers in control, says J Cromack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The automotive industry has changed gear, with the need to capture and use rich data about vehicles, their performance, and their environment in real-time.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://telematicswire.net/connected-cars-and-the-role-of-telematics-in-the-future-of-intelligent-transport/">Telematics</a>, are systems used to send, receive, track, and store information about automobile operations. Telematics can also track personally identifiable information about car users. however; they can offer huge benefits to everyone along the automotive value chain. Car manufacturers gain an opportunity to monitor how their products are used, experienced, and maintained out in the real world. Insurers can reduce their risk and provide&nbsp;more attractive and personalised policies as a result of better insights into the causes of accidents. Indeed, Deloitte predicted <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/be/Documents/finance/European-Motor-Insurance-Study_2nd-edition_November-2016.pdf">that in Europe digitally-enabled motor insurance could reach 17 percent of all policies by 2020</a>. Have we reached this milestone yet?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, drivers receiving timely feedback about their car, or driving and road conditions, are less likely to have an accident, break down, get stuck in traffic or run out of fuel. If they have an insurance-linked telematics ‘black box’ or dash-cam, they’ll also be less vulnerable to bogus claims against them by other drivers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The momentum for adopting telematics on an industry-wide scale is accelerating. <a href="https://www.eycom.ch/en/Publications/20130129-The-quest-for-Telematics-4.0/download">Ernst &amp; Young predicted that 88 percent of all new cars globally will have integrated telematics by 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But to get to a point where everyone can benefit, car companies and service partners need to gain the trust of drivers and regulators. In a world sensitive to privacy breaches and keenly on the side of consumer rights, there are some confidence issues to overcome.&nbsp;</p>



 Drive home the benefits&nbsp; 



<p>Measures to update legislation, including the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/eu-data-protection-rules_en">EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),</a> <a href="https://www.caprivacy.org/about-us">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> and others , have highlighted the <a href="https://www.fleeteurope.com/en/taxation-and-legislation/europe/analysis/fleet-telematics-must-comply-eus-new-data-protection-rules">delicate balance</a> between the use of car and journey data for genuine benefit and the potential for misuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bvrla.co.uk/news/press-release/bvrla-explores-fleet-attitudes-connected-vehicle-data">Research</a> conducted in 2017 by the British Vehicle Rental &amp; Leasing Association suggests that the majority of drivers (95 percent) would happily share vehicle data if this might help diagnose or prevent faults. Similarly, high percentages said the same about it being used to automatically alert a breakdown company (93 percent) or help a manufacturer identify safety and warranty issues with its parts (82 percent). But in situations where personal exposure felt higher yet the perceived benefits harder to determine, drivers were much less comfortable about agreeing to data being shared. Scenarios here included information about their driving behaviour and performance or their location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The onus is therefore on car manufacturers, service partners, and insurance companies to be completely transparent about their intentions. They must also empower drivers with sufficient options to control the data that is collected and how it is used. A 2016 <a href="https://www.fiaregion1.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FIA-Survey-Brochure-2016-web.pdf">survey</a> among members of FIA Region I, a consumer body representing motorists in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, flagged up the need for restrictions including time limits on data being kept and used. But to feel completely reassured, drivers will also be looking for options to specify the types of information that can and can’t be collected and to assign specific permissions about who can access and use it for each documented purpose.&nbsp;</p>



 Respect personal boundaries&nbsp; 



<p>In a work context, GDPR’s parameters around keeping and using people’s data in <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/">legitimate</a> and reasonable ways should prompt fleet managers to differentiate between company-relevant driver data and that which has no bearing on business use, for instance. Even if telematics ‘black boxes’ are set to record everything about every journey, this would restrict the information that can be stored and used. Information about mileage and fuel consumption may be kept, for example, but details about where a vehicle is parked outside of company hours should remain private.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It stands to reason that if the data people agree to share about their driving experiences results in something expected and beneficial – a smoother journey or avoidance of incident – they will relax and embrace it. But if they feel spied on, compromised, or taken advantage of in some way – perhaps because their route has been captured and sold on to service stations and retailers who start to bombard them with promotions as they drive past, or the wrong person discovers they have gone away because their car is parked at the airport – they will have every right to object. It’s this kind of activity that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pnlh2J5mYY">My Car My Data</a> campaign, championed by the FIA, is warning against.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The keys to winning over drivers to the brave new world of connected cars – as in any attempt to use personal data– is to hand them control. By providing transparency about data collection and use, clarity about what individuals will get back in return, and the ability to review and edit those parameters at any time, individuals will feel empowered to embrace positive change instead of feeling suspicious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) updated its <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_guidelines_202001_connectedvehicles.pdf">guidelines</a> for processing personal data in the context of connected vehicles and mobility-related applications. This references the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC, as revised by 2009/136/EC), which sets a specific standard for all actors that wish to store or access information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user in the European Economic Area (EEA). The guidelines state that prior consent is required for such activities and article 5(3) of the e-Privacy Directive takes precedent over article 6 of GDPR although a legal basis is still required for the processing of personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transparency is crucial, supervisory authorities are now focused on this principle. It’s easy for them to validate and provide enforcement notices or intention to fine an organisation that is not demonstrating transparency. Connected vehicles and those that use Telematic systems must engage in a way that’s totally upfront and honest when seeking to use personal data for an organisations’ own purpose or when sharing with 3rd parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Processes must be robust, clear, and comprehensive to ensure effective and consistent compliance and build a trusted relationship. Organisations should ensure privacy notices are relevant, clear and specific, and relate to the complexity of what happens with the data and if being repurposed.&nbsp; This privacy notice must be written in a way that a layperson would understand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Understanding the lawful basis for processing personal data and making this clear, consistent and obvious is vital, hence Transparency and Consent are finely intertwined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>	Many global small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have limited access to financing which creates an uneven playing field for those who cannot acquire traditional data. Those outside the US struggle to finance their endeavors due to lack of a credit score, SMEs are cornered into financing through alternative options with high-interest rates. On the flip side, these alternatives will struggle to effectively validate sellers and transactions, inevitably increasing the risk for all parties. These international buyers and sellers are who TrafiGuard lends its services. Built on 0x’s Bloom platform, TrafiGuard uses a form of self-sovereign identity to deliver its mission statement as the “[Global] Trade Finance Solution for Micro Small and SMEs”.</p><p>	The “solution” allows the buyer to deposit funds into the TrafiGuard smart contracts, which are locked in the <a href="http://compound.finance/">Compound</a> protocol via USDC to collect interest and provide collateral allowing the seller to take out a loan in its local currency. The process is as follows: First both the buyer and seller must connect with the TrafiGuard Smart Contract. Then the buyer is required to submit proof of their digital identity via encryption on Bloom. In order to secure the loan, however, the seller must prove they are valid and trustworthy through steps that will then be stored as proof in the blockchain. The first involves the seller submitting their Bloom decentralized ID and ‘credit score’.</p><p>	TrafiGuard bridges the gap between global SME financing and global, verified players by removing documents that are often barriers in determining how trustworthy the user is in relation to risk via Bloom. Users are able to track their Bloom-unique credit score, utilization, age of credit, payment history, and inquiries, similarly to how credit karma is structured except with inclusivity. This opportunity allows international SMEs to become stronger candidates for financing regardless of their country’s differing credit systems. This is also beneficial for buyers or lenders since they are able to access risk efficiently and with more accuracy through Bloom’s Truth Platform.</p><p>	Bloom’s Truth Platform is composed of Validator, SourceSpring, and SafeSwap, to attain cryptographically secure alternative solution to KYC/AML compliance for the digital age.</p><p>	The seller must provide approved income, tax returns, and any additional financials to the connected data providers. The third and fourth steps regard the actual shipment of goods, in which case the seller must provide a Bill of Lading verification and a voyage complete event for settlement. All proofs will be supplied via Chainlink oracles to the smart contract. Here, multiple protocols are executed to enact the process. The first being Bloom’s share kit and smart contract bridge, (Currently under development through the name ‘OnRamp’) handles validation and trustworthiness; Chainlink external adapters that supply proofs to the smart contract, compound CTokenhandler &amp; Comptroller, and USDC stable coin for money flows and lending. Sample transactions and references are documented on their GitHub page for those who are not well versed in blockchain.</p><p>	Once all these steps are completed, a risk score is calculated and depending on the score, the seller can take out a loan. The buyer deposits an amount of currency in USDC into the compound protocol. There it is locked, leaving it to accrue interest and be used as collateral for security purposes. The seller has the ability to take out a loan between 10% to 50% of the deposited collateral. Once the goods arrive at their destination, the deposited amount from the buyer will be cleared with the loan and sent to the seller, with the financial also taking a share.</p><p>	TrafiGuard’s system is redefining trade finance, especially for those who trade and finance on an international level. Bigger companies that were held back before are able to finance their businesses, leaving small and medium enterprises struggling to obtain a loan or paying high-interest fees. With multiple varied credit scoring systems, it becomes complicated to gauge how secure or risky a seller is and if the seller is truly who they say they are, resulting in SMEs being underfinanced with limited alternatives and buyers who are constantly taking uncalculated risks. TrafiGuard’s system, while it does require a certain degree of knowledge pertaining to blockchain and program development, is much more accessible and stricter with validation, resulting in buyers who feel more at ease with financing sellers, which in turn creates a flowing market.</p>

<p>Payroll data is a tremendous resource upon which fintechs and financial services providers can build better experiences for consumers and, at the same time, enable consumers to benefit more from their financial data.<br>
<br>
But enabling access to payroll data isn’t as easy as flipping a switch. And we can’t build better experiences without a simple and trusted process for consumers. This is where open banking comes in. Open banking platforms can unlock payroll data, but such data access has to be done the right way with a consumer-centric model that ensures successful connections and collection of data.</p>
 How to Leverage Payroll Data the Right Way 
<p>Payroll data is a beneficial resource, but how it’s accessed is central to enhancing the customer experience and ensuring successful data collection. Let’s look at this in greater detail.&nbsp;</p>
 API Connections Vs Credentialed Access 
<p>In some cases, data providers look to access payroll data by using a consumer’s credentials. Unfortunately, this model is overly cumbersome for the consumer. Unlike digital banking, where consumers know the data source and have login credentials, consumers are largely unaware of their payroll provider, and in many cases haven’t even set up an account to access a payroll portal. Plus, many employers use a firewall-protected HR portal to enable employees to view paystubs and other income information, which means the employee never directly interacts with the payroll provider. That firewall also protects the payroll data from external access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These credentialed-access hurdles make it painful for employees to permission data access and significantly depress successful connections to payroll data. With a low hit rate, financial services innovators or others looking to leverage such data are left with an awkward, sub-par user experience at best and no data at worst.</p>
<p>The best way to leverage payroll data is to provide technology that enables the consumer to easily access their data, and protects them while they do so. This is achieved through direct API connections to payroll providers that eliminate the need for employees to have or know their credentials. It even eliminates the need to know who their employer is using as a payroll provider.</p>
<p>By connecting directly via an API, an open banking platform provider partners with payroll organizations that are equally committed to providing consumers with access to their financial data. The open banking platform can then connect the employee with their payroll provider for them, enabling the employee to more readily benefit from their payroll data and, should they choose, permission access of that data to a fintech or financial service provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity is already leveraging direct API connections to payroll providers and is quickly expanding those tested and proven connections to reach more employers and benefit more employees. We already provide direct connectivity that covers tens of millions of employees in the U.S. Finicity has a history of building partnerships with leading data sources, such as our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/finicity-lend-to-accelerate-next-gen-credit-decisioning-experience/">&nbsp;direct API connection with the largest payroll provider</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of payroll data, direct API connections have created the best experiences and led to the best outcomes for both our partners and for consumers. This remains consistent with our market push on direct API connections to a broad range of financial institutions.</p>
 Consumer-Centric Means Consumer Protection: Operating as a CRA 
<p>It’s not enough to promise consumer-centric processes or protection in word only. After all, leveraging payroll data the right way also comes down to how the open banking platform handles the data and how they involve the consumer in that process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the primary uses of payroll data is in lending. Our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">Finicity Lend solution set,</a> for example, currently leverages payroll data to enhance income and employment verifications necessary for credit decisioning. In this use case, consumers can gain additional protection and strengthen engagement through the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). These protections hold the data provider accountable for data accuracy and ensure the consumer has a mechanism to dispute the data in case of issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While other data providers claim FCRA compliance, at Finicity we’re not just talk. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/data-aggregators-cra-fcra/">Finicity operates as a Consumer Reporting Agency</a> (CRA), which means we are legally required to adhere to FCRA requirements. When data providers are delivering income, asset, and/or employment data for the purpose of credit decisioning, operating as a CRA is not only the best way to provide the data, it’s the right way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But data access that truly empowers the consumer and keeps data secure doesn’t stop there. We also keep the consumer at the center of all our data-access experiences with <a href="https://www.finicity.com/the-finicity-perspective-whitepaper/">our CATTS data principles</a>: Control, Access, Transparency, Traceability, and Security. These principles inform our policies, our products, and ultimately our entire approach to empowering the consumer with their financial data.</p>
<p>It all comes back to trust. Consumer-centric principles, reinforced both in word and in deed, establish trust between data access providers and consumers, as well as with financial institutions, payroll providers, and other financial services providers.</p>
 How Can Open Banking Platforms Use Payroll Data? 
<p>Payroll data enables financial service innovators to leverage consumer data to improve decisioning and enhance lending processes, as well as create new financial services experiences.</p>
<p>While financial service providers have traditionally relied on ‘physical’ documents, such as bank statements, tax documents, paystubs, and more to verify information about consumers, digital payroll data via open banking provides quick access to all insights necessary to create next-gen financial experiences.</p>
<p>Finicity payroll partnerships provide access that enable or enhance various use cases, such as:<br>
</p>
 
 Mortgage lending 
 Auto lending 
 Personal lending 
 Tenant screening 
 Background checks 
 Government verification 
 Personal financial management<br>
 
 
<p>And where Finicity has been leading the market, the market is following. Along with an increasing number of financial institutions and other financial service providers, more payroll providers are recognizing that consumers can benefit from the data they hold. As a result, these providers are adopting API connections to open banking platforms that expand the use of financial data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Employees aren’t the only ones who benefit from consumer-permissioned data. Payroll providers ensure greater security when specific data is only shared with third parties for the use case, rather than released on a large, broad scale. They retain greater control in their role as data stewards.</p>
<p>Payroll data goes even further in delivering a more complete view of a consumer’s financial story when it’s paired with other open banking capabilities, such as validating information with bank transactions and, in appropriate cases, with digitized paystubs—another area where Finicity has led the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers own their payroll data, and they should be able to benefit from it. But to ensure the best experience for the consumer and the financial services innovators looking to use such data, enabling access to that data must be done right. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/fintech-demo/">See in action</a> how Finicity is leveraging partnerships with payroll providers and financial institutions to provide technology that empowers consumers to benefit from their financial data and improve their lives.</p>

A PDF of the full interview is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blockchain-Brad_Transcript.pdf">here</a>.</p> 1. TESTNET TO PARACHAIN <p>Ingo [00:54:38] Well, right now we are in testnet mode. We want to go live as soon as possible. So actually from the tech side, including everything that we are claiming and what not, on the verifiable credential and DID side, we are ready to go. The testnet is out there for a year now and has been tested by lots of people. And we have got a lot of feedback and we improved a lot of things that we didn’t see in the beginning. And so I think from that side, we are ready to&nbsp;go.</p><p>The only thing that is currently missing is the parachain. We’re waiting for that. But that’s going to come out — maybe not in the next weeks, but in the next few months, definitely. So we will have that and we will take part in the first parachain auctions and hopefully get one of them. And then we are basically… the next thing coming up is the go-live of the network. So we are ready to go. Just some external dependencies which we have to clear up and then we’re good to&nbsp;go.</p><p>Brad [00:55:42] You absolutely must be excited because it’s been years in the making. Now one of the things I wanted to ask you, and I hope you don’t mind if I do, is the backers. Now often when we’ve seen in the last few years, there’s been a lot of money raised in all kinds of ways. Some are controversial, some are not. But ultimately, it’s the backers in the long term that I care about, and I hope others do, in the space. Because that’s how they support you long term. One of the worries I have is that some of them don’t and they’re just out for the capital and they dump the value of your whole economy, your whole&nbsp;system.</p><p>But from what I’m understanding about you is that you’ve also built so much in that paramount to everything, even the fear of that, is the utility itself of the system. So what are your thoughts on this? When it comes to backers, when it comes to the long term position for your economy, for the quality of the technology, for the team and for really pushing this whole thing forward. So that people can start to use this more and more around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Ingo [00:56:42] Yeah, so, for backers, I think the fact that we are in this ecosystem from day one on basically, gives us a lot of connections to really nice people who back us. And they all come from the development circles. And I think it’s even more important to have those people behind you than to have a huge financial backer behind you. It’s always nice to have money in the bank. I think we do have some money in the bank which will actually give us the possibility to…</p><p>Brad [00:57:20]&nbsp;…have more runway as well. But the great thing is that you have the devs. You have real people building this, as&nbsp;backers.</p><p>Ingo [00:57:27] Yeah, especially in blockchain, things take longer than we thought. We have seen that with multiple things. Just look at Ethereum, how long we are waiting for Ethereum&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Brad [00:57:40] Yeah, and respectfully so I mention that. Because we do see a lot of promises come out. But I mean, they were first mover in terms of smart contracts, as you’d appreciate. But again, that’s why you’re&nbsp;moving.</p> 2. LOOKING TO THE&nbsp;FUTURE <p>Ingo [00:57:51] Also see that that’s things like when we do the social KYC and those KYC things, those will first emerge inside the blockchain world, right? And the blockchain world is relatively small. And then we have those projects, which we call the lighthouse projects, together with European governments; and stuff like that. But those projects, they also take a very long&nbsp;time.</p><p>So we are in front of a runway. We have to recognise that. It’s not like “Hey, we go live next Tuesday, then we have two hundred million users” — this is not going to happen. It’s going to be gradual, a ramp-up period. And we know that we need the funds to survive that. And we’re pretty OK with the funds that we have. So we are looking to a positive&nbsp;future.</p><p>Brad [00:58:41] And that’s the great thing. That’s the great thing, because that’s what is beautiful about the crypto community, is that they do come together from top to bottom, from high net worth to the average person who wants to contribute. And that is where the movement is also potentially revolutionary because there are so many people that want to support endeavours like yours, quite sincerely.</p><p>So there’s a lot of excitement for KILT out there, especially with the support and the brand and the integrity of the top tier Polkadot teams. That’s the truth. And you’re up there. We can see that code. We can see the collaborations that are emerging, the integrations. So there’s a really good positioning that you are in right now for 2021. I’m really excited to see what’s coming very soon. You mentioned the switch to live state from the testnet. That’s also ahead on the road map. So that’s all a big deal for everything from speculation hype all the way across to the imperative of having more credentials built in and more tinkering on the blockchain.</p><p>But what about things like market economies? We talked about trust built in, rather. So those trust market economies, they’re really important to everything that makes sense when you build this out and when it unfolds. So that it all is seamless and, I guess, it’s being self regulated and automating because the protocol’s done. Are you excited about the potential of this once everything goes live,&nbsp;Ingo?</p> 3. ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPERS <p>Ingo [01:00:04] Yeah, definitely. I know this from my past. That was not only an industry, I was a board member of the Drupal Association. Drupal is one of the biggest open source projects out there in the world for a couple of years. And it’s really interesting how open source actually works. Because, well, it doesn’t go just by enthusiasm. It always needs&nbsp;money.</p><p>And the thing is, a project can only be successful if it is possible for others to earn money with the project. Of course, you can join and then hope that this coin gets rockets, but there must be a little more to that, actually. So with Drupal, what we learned is that we have to maintain just the core of Drupal. But then if somebody wants to build a website, they probably don’t turn to us. They turn to the Drupal shop on the next corner. And the Drupal shop on the next corner then makes a profit with that website and then draws out a little bit, but then also contributes back to the original software.</p><p>And this is how the whole thing grows. In Drupal we had more than 70,000 developers working for Drupal and we didn’t pay any of them, but they all got money. Because they all had jobs because it was possible to build business on top of Drupal. That’s the important thing.</p><p>And this is why we focus very much in KILT on the fact that it is possible to earn money with KILT. So if you are a trusted entity or building trust and want to build a trusted entity on top of KILT — like, half a year after we go live there will be another stage for that, so that you can build virtual organisations on top of KILT which accumulate trust — so if you are in a business like that or if you want to go into a business like that, then you can build that on top of KILT. But you can also be an integrator and just build software on top of KILT and start earning money with&nbsp;that.</p><p>I think building this economy is absolutely crucial for a lively ecosystem and this is why we have a strong focus on that. That every role, no matter if you are a validator, if you are a nominator, if you are a builder, if you are an entrepreneurial developer, if you are an attester, if you are an integrator, that all of those guys, according to their abilities, have the chance to grow on this. And there must be the possibility to live off it, right? You cannot trade on something you can’t live off in the long run. Sometimes you have to eat, right! And then you need some money to buy your&nbsp;food.</p> 4. BERLIN AS BLOCKCHAIN HUB <p>Brad [01:02:48] It’s amazing. And this is a decentralised global economy built in and embedded into this protocol. And that’s where the game-changer is. Not only is it the benefit of the block chain for the transparency and for the provability, but really it’s also a major game-changer because there’s something real built in that’s a unique technological addition to the layer one and layer zero tech&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>But you’re literally providing something that is an incentive by design to take on board and use and and reap the benefits of. I mean, that reward system that is being built in is really second to none. And it’s really what is, I guess, catching attention all the way to Wall Street, because it is a different classification. And this is what I did want to talk to you&nbsp;about.</p><p>Berlin and Germany are world leaders when it comes to being progressive in the blockchain. We know all the way to dena, we know to the government papers I’ve read. It is quite remarkable. And they definitely are supportive of this kind of innovation to really bolster, much like you see hubs of the world for tech. Berlin is no different, I guess, to Silicon Valley, some places in Hong Kong or in China, Shanghai, India. So you must be excited that you are in one of the world’s leading hubs to build out and play around with something that by design can really change the game when it’s married with something useful like these credentials that you are building into the layer&nbsp;ones.</p><p>Ingo [01:04:22] Berlin is fantastic. I can say that, I’m a born Berliner. Yes. It is, it’s fantastic. But it’s also really nice — when we saw the blockchain scene emerging here from 2015, 2016, 2017 on, where the Ethereum builders were here, where also other new companies like Ocean came up here. And it was very, very intelligent people and a very international crowd. It was really, really nice. We had blockchain meetups every night. You could get your pizza and beer there and listen to really highly intelligent people.</p><p>We’ve got the whole Parity team — or, not the whole Parity team, but most of the Parity team — sitting in Berlin. Which was very helpful for us, of course, because we could not only video conference with them, but also meet them in person. That’s just two kilometres away. That’s also nice because it builds personal relationships, and even in computer science, personal relationships are really important.</p><p>Brad [01:05:32] I want to ask you also, I follow a lot of the things that Gavin’s involved with, and he is obviously a staunch advocate for the tech first. You don’t see him in a lot of interviews, but you just know this guy is all about the integrity of the technology first and foremost. I would imagine the relationship you’d have with people like Gav would be pretty important because he sees the value of what you’re doing. You’re in Berlin. He’s been building Parity from the outset. So, do you liaise, do you engage, do you connect with who is essentially the co-founder of Ethereum and the builder of Polkadot?</p><p>Ingo [01:06:07] Well, basically, we know each other, but it’s not necessarily that we engage every day and make plans together. I think it’s far more important, actually, that the devs of the teams work together. That’s bigger because this is where the news comes from. Right? And when Parity changes something in Substrate or so, it’s so important for us to get very early information on that, to have somebody to talk to and say, “whoops, now my code is broken at this point. Did you change anything?”</p><p>Those things, I think, are much more important than the strategic alignment because the strategy of Polkadot is one thing. And it’s good that we know what’s happening there. But we don’t have to align all the time. The whole thing was built as an ecosystem. So we are basically doing what we think is important and what is right. And we do our stuff and we are just linking up to their system and utilising what they have built. So it’s not necessary that Gavin and I make strategic decisions.</p><p>Brad [01:07:11] Right, and that’s the way it should be. I have noticed that Gavin does support you with his own tweets of you. Obviously, you know, the fact that you’re on that testnet indicates a lot with regard to that mutual support indirectly.</p> 5. DEMO CLIENT AND KILT&nbsp;FAUCET <p>Brad [01:07:25] So it’s great to know and again, I agree with you, I think the tech needs to speak. It’s not about the fomo and the hype of certain personalities in the space leading things, and that’s certainly not Gavin’s agenda. It’s more about letting the tech talk and you utilising it how you see fit. And that’s definitely what you’ve noticed from the technology, from what you’ve been saying and what you’re doing now, which is essentially building upon what is already available. And then letting others use you for their own purposes.</p><p>So with regard to things like the full SDK. I want to understand, is it all ready now for access? Can anyone go and use that in this testnet phase? And also, any other things that you’ve built in beyond the SDK? How much is actually ready and being used&nbsp;now?</p><p>Ingo [01:08:11] Yeah, so the SDK is, I would say 100% ready. There’s going to be a new release, but this is minor changes in…next week I think. That should be the final release for the SDK actually before going live. So everything’s there, everything’s open source. Go to dev.kilt.io and find the Github pages there. Find the 101s and how to install it, how to use it. And if you get stuck, just jump on our Riot channels and get the devs directly and ask them why you’re not going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Brad [01:08:45] So the devs are relatively accessible for other devs if they need to&nbsp;connect.</p><p>Ingo [01:08:52] I think this is happening all around the ecosystem. So basically there are lots of Riot channels from all the projects. We never had any problem getting in touch with anyone. And we try to live up to the same standards, also be as accessible as possible. When five hundred projects ask at the same time, then it is a sign for us that we obviously need better documentation. Right now they still can&nbsp;develop.</p><p>Brad [01:09:25] Absolutely, and that’s great to know because having that access to you is going to mean so much as people are trying to just grapple with the gravity of what they’re embarking on; if they’re new, perhaps, to blockchain or new to some of the technology that you’re building out. And certainly the SDK is a great tool for them to engage. With regard to things like client demos as well. That’s available, as I understand. So how is that working in the context of the SDK? Are there other things and demos that you provide for parties as they are starting to really want to utilise the protocol&nbsp;itself?</p><p>Ingo [01:10:02] Yes, what we have is a demo client that everyone can access at demo.kilt.io. We have a faucet where you get some Mashnet coins, which is our testnet coin, and then you can play around with that and that’s basically built for if you have a great business case in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>And this involves credentials and well, maybe something like delegated trust. And so as one entity delegates trust to another entity and this entity then issues a credential and somebody then looks at it, and whatever. So with the demo client, you can basically build those scenarios very easily on the live testnet. It’s not a fake. So when you start it’s connecting directly to the blockchain and you can start building your business cases on&nbsp;that.</p><p>And then if you see that the business basically works with that technology, if you want to build your application, then, as the demo client is, of course, open source as well, you can just take this piece of software and hack it into pieces and reuse pieces of that to more easily build your application, because it’s a nice piece of software. So that as a developer, you can understand what’s happening there and you can just use the pieces and build up your system easier with that right on top of the&nbsp;SDK.</p> 6. PROOF OF&nbsp;STAKE <p>Brad [01:11:26] And it’s good that you have all of this ready now. I mean, you really are coming out of the blocks, literally, so to speak, with so much ready for 2021. And we like to see that when it comes to those who are exploring these new technologies, coupled with economies. And in that sense, I wanted to also ask you about your comment more generally about&nbsp;staking.</p><p>Because that seems to be a really innovative way to add democracy, to add support for legitimacy in what you’re building, but also just sheer value in enabling an economy. So do you think that staking more generally is something that is not only innovative but necessary to build out the initial support and attention and interest in something like&nbsp;KILT?</p><p>Ingo [01:12:15] I think staking is really, really important because we decided a couple of years ago to move away from proof of work. First, proof of work is not really sustainable.</p><p>Brad [01:12:26] A bit too much&nbsp;work!</p><p>Ingo [01:12:29] Yeah, that’s a catastrophe for the environment. And if we have better technologies at hand, like proof of stake, then we have to use that. We cannot go back and say “proof of work is also nice. Please have big KILT coins farms out there.” You don’t want that. I think that’s the first notion that we need to do. And then there’s a necessity inside any permissionless blockchain system that is decentralised to be de-incentivised to do wrong things. And this is what you do normally with the proof of stake system. And this is why you need&nbsp;staking.</p><p>And then after that was found out five years ago, then people started thinking about, hey, actually there are interesting economic models behind that, which can also not only de-incentivise people, but which can also incentivise people to do things, right? And there are different ways you can go there, like nominated proof of stake and stuff like&nbsp;that.</p><p>And I think the direction in which the Polkadot and Substrate things moved is actually extremely well thought out. Because it has a lot of democratic ideas behind that, which are extremely cool. And it’s not perfect. Nothing is perfect. And that is not a true democracy, of course, again. But it is far closer to a democracy than maybe all the other things we see out there. So we are absolutely happy to adopt these technologies and those mechanisms also for our&nbsp;system.</p><p>Because they are economically very sane, I would say, and they are producing the current maximum of democracy within the network, which is not the optimum probably that we will ever see — so there will be new developments after that — but I think it is the best we have right now. So, yeah, that’s it. And it’s there. So it’s there to use and be built. And this is another thing, right? Like other people are using KILT because they don’t want to implement this boring credential stuff; we can use Parity Substrate, Polkadot, Kusama mechanisms to actually not reinvent the wheel on this nominated proof of stake thing. So we’re basically tweaking it. But we are 98%, I would say, using the mechanism that Polkadot and Kusama already proved work, obviously.</p><p>Brad [01:15:17] Yes. And I think people underestimate Kusama thinking it’s just simply a testnet. And we know it’s so much more than that for specific use cases. For certain parties who want to have, perhaps, a less expensive — in terms of cost and tinkering — system as opposed to that really gold star or gold standard parachain with the Polkadot network itself. Making sure that differentiating use cases for both is important, not just simply saying that one is the step to the other. It’s just not the case. You would know that, because you certainly are involved in both of those core technologies.</p><p>Now, the roadmap, I wanted to ask you again, it’s not definitive, but I have read a bit into some of the interconnections, and I thought you could clarify or confirm. It does seem to me that certain entities in Berlin, beyond even the blockchain space, are paying attention to you and can see the benefits of this. And I mentioned this in the context of some of those local government bodies. I listened to some of those — the ones that aren’t just in German — I listened to some of the presentations that happened there. And it’s really interesting because there’s so much interest from the top down coming from Berlin and coming from Germany. Do you foresee in the near future, more of these kinds of announcements that come out that showcase that KILT is going to be embedded in the real world so that the average person can read in the paper that this company has partnered here and is doing&nbsp;this.</p> 7. KILT IN THE REAL&nbsp;WORLD <p>Brad [01:16:46] Will we see more exposure of KILT in the real world? So people understand it’s not just a blockchain game for crypto-savvy people.</p><p>Ingo [01:16:54] Yeah, we’re pretty sure that this is going to happen because we’re being involved. We tried to pay attention to our surroundings in the beginning. And one of the surroundings, obviously, is the crypto scene, which is important for us because we’re part of that. But there’s other worlds out there. And there are some people in the crypto scene who say we don’t have to recognise them because we are happy in our&nbsp;bubble.</p><p>But we said from the beginning, actually, we have to recognise the outside world and the outside world consists of people, industry and government. And we tried to make connections there as soon as possible. And the merits of that is probably that now governments are sometimes very much interested in building projects, not only in Germany, by the way. Right now, we are talking with a South American..</p><p>Brad [01:17:45] You can’t tell me too much, can&nbsp;you?</p><p>Ingo [01:17:46]&nbsp;…about a climate thing. That would be extremely exciting to also have a footprint there. And if you talk to those people, if you respect them — OK, you’re from government, you might have a little bit different views on things — but we are not being bad. We’re trying to build a supportive technology, which might be interesting for you as well. And if you consider thinking about using such a technology, maybe it’s also beneficial for you. And then people start thinking about&nbsp;that.</p><p>And this is why a project like the German Energy Association is doing a project with us. This is why we are part of the Gaia X project, which I’m extremely proud of, which is the European cloud infrastructure. We are one of the first members there as a company. And the other companies in there are basically like the German Telecom with two hundred thousand employees or something. And then it’s us. And it’s good to be&nbsp;there.</p><p>It’s beneficial for them because in this case, we definitely bring very, very new ideas. And it’s beneficial for us because if a thing like a European cloud infrastructure should ever be really, really successful, it’s already got KILT baked in then, that would be cool. So, yes, I think we will see a lot more of those things because we didn’t do any big marketing things around what we&nbsp;do.</p><p>Brad [01:19:16] Yeah, I don’t think you needed to. And you also are backed by some of the most reputable in this space when it comes to start-ups, when it comes to people. Or even if you are working relatively independently in that context, you are still using the underlying core technology. And we saw the likes of Energy Web, for example, and you mentioned some names that they’re also aligned with. And that’s because you see such immense support from that mainstream arena of business enterprise.</p><p>And what was great about the parties that you’re involved with is, you’re not discounting the value of enterprise either. It’s not just simply the narrative of DeFi, a.k.a. cypherpunk or right at the end of one continuum. You actually appreciate the whole broad spectrum from one to the other and everything in between. So with the roadmap, because it’s been a long interview and I do apologise for the length, there’s so much I want to get out of it. What excites you most coming up? Because you are the CEO, you certainly are privy to stuff you’re not telling us today and respectfully so. But what are some of the things that you’re excited that you can tell us about the KILT roadmap that’s coming, that you feel very confident is going to unfold in the way intended because you’re on time so&nbsp;far?</p> 8. A ROCKET WITH TRAINING&nbsp;WHEELS <p>Ingo [01:20:25] Yes. The most important thing for anyone who builds a blockchain is basically a token generation event. And then the phase after that until we set the thing to complete decentralisation. So this is going to be an extremely exciting time for us. We don’t have an exact timeline because we still don’t know when we get the parachain, because we don’t know when the parachain auctions&nbsp;are.</p><p>Brad [01:20:48] But not months&nbsp;away.</p><p>Ingo [01:20:52] We expect this for the very, very near future. And this is the most important time for us because the blockchains are a little bit like a rocket, right? You fire them off once and then they lift for themselves. And if you did something wrong, then it’s a really big mistake. Or you have this, like Polkadot did, this transitioning phase from after the token generation event to the decentralisation, where we have maybe six weeks to a month where we have the Sudo key and can still fiddle around with the&nbsp;system.</p><p>So we have a rocket with training wheels, which is good. And this period of having a rocket with training wheels is probably one of the most exciting periods of my&nbsp;life.</p><p>Brad [01:21:42] Absolutely. And, you know, what Ingo, I have to say, perfect timing. And this was fortuitous by circumstance, because now we see the market in the way it is. We see the conditions are ripe. We also see most importantly, that there is so much support in the crypto community for Polkadot and for multichains and for integration, for collaboration, for Ethereum, for DeFi, for Web 3. Now you’re coming out with the reputation of all of that, plus the credibility of all the time you spent building this. And we can see it. It’s transparent through the code and you have the use&nbsp;case.</p><p>So there’s so much going on. I’m very excited for you, for this new event that’s about to unfold. But beyond that — you’re going to be subjected to a lot of hype — is what excites you post that, when you really start to see, as a lead developer, as a lead, a sort of initiator in this movement, beyond the live moment, what’s something that is going to really showcase your value to those who want to start to tinker more? Is there anything at all that you know about that you can tell us post a major event coming&nbsp;up.</p><p>Ingo [01:22:48] We could talk about this project or that project,&nbsp;but…</p><p>Brad [01:22:51]&nbsp;…you’d have nothing to talk about&nbsp;later.</p><p>Ingo [01:22:55]&nbsp;..but they would be really, really disappointed because they didn’t get mentioned. But I think that everything that’s growing adoption, and maybe growing adoption in the big wave, is going to be very exciting for us. After that it’s basically growing adoption. That’s what we are going to do in the next two to three years after that, grow adoption for the whole&nbsp;thing.</p> 9. KILT COMPETITION <p>Brad [01:23:22] So just a couple more things I want to ask you. One was the competition question. Now we’ve seen the likes of Litentry emerge. Litentry is something that arguably has its own unique value proposition. It also has come forth prior to you. I wanted to ask you some specifics about that with regard to the claims potentially of all the differentiations of both in the context of identity. Because one, on the one hand, there’s arguments for KILT, there have been suggestions of off-chain authorisation to issue credentials as opposed to potentially on-chain. Another argument is put forth for Litentry. So I wanted to ask you, can you clarify exactly if there is even competition or are they different? And are there any others aside from Litentry that you have your eye&nbsp;on?</p><p>Ingo [01:24:08] Well, it’s always complicated to talk about other projects because I don’t know exactly what they’re doing today. So that can also change. What I have in my mind is that Litentry is more about producing reputation on-chain and utilising other chains for producing this reputation. So you have a reputation on this network, have a reputation on this network, and they are aggregating the reputation.</p><p>So this is actually an interesting use case that could be used also with KILT, because when you talk about reputation, you normally don’t talk about your reputation. Normally when you are in the credential space, you’re talking about the reputation of the attester. So when you show me your university degree, it’s not about your reputation. It’s about the reputation of the university. Because I look at the credential and say, oh the university is great, so this guy must be great. So it’s about this reputation.</p><p>Ingo [01:25:19] And I think that an area of cooperation could actually be that we could use the Litentry system to build the reputation of attesters in there. And then those attesters issue the normal credentials to the people. But this is something…we are talking for a couple of months with Litentry.</p><p>Brad [01:25:42] This is super interesting because you have all attestation information in your white paper. It goes into detail about that aspect as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Ingo [01:25:49] Exactly. And then they are concentrating on something else. They’re concentrating on the reputation part. We are not really concentrating right now on the reputation part. So if they do a good thing there and if they actually manage to utilise the Polkadot ecosystem for receiving some kind of reputation from other chains, that could be valuable to aggregate with them and then use this power of reputation for building attesters. So actually, for me, it’s not a case of competition. For me, it’s a case of potential cooperation.</p><p>Brad [01:26:29] Exactly. And that’s what I was hoping because when I was researching. I couldn’t really see how the idea of competition come up. It was just someone brought me the question actually, in the community and I wanted to clarify that with you. So it’s exciting to hear that they have a unique value proposition.</p> 10. BUILDING&nbsp;ADOPTION <p>Brad [01:26:45] Yours sounds like it’s very vast, though, in the sense that once again, you are specifically about that verifiable credential embedded in all potential startups and all potential uses of the technology right across the board. So it’s going to be interesting to see how this unfolds. And again, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a partnership that does emerge that’s meaningful between the two of&nbsp;you.</p><p>One last thing I want to ask you. I think I can already guess the answer, but are you going to engage in marketing or what’s the strategy here? Because I will say this. You don’t come across like someone who is playing games with a lot of the, sort of, more questionable things we say with influencers in some respects from certain sort of lower-tiered start-ups where they almost rely on immediate hype. Sounds like you’re going to approach this very differently.</p><p>Ingo [01:27:34] Well, yeah, so what will we do with marketing? So we will have to do more marketing based on the technology, because when the technology is out there and it has the first use cases, then I think it’s really, really interesting to have those lighthouse projects out there and then also talk more. So this is computer science and computer scientists don’t talk. So this is why we were a little bit silent maybe in the last three&nbsp;years.</p><p>We have to change that a bit and talk more about the technology. I don’t think It’s the right way to do this.:.well, I’m always happy when one influencer says KILT, because that feels to me like we are recognised, so that’s really cool for us, but this is probably not how we will actually get the word out to industries and governments and bodies like that. So I think, influencers are important and it’s good that they like us and I hope they like&nbsp;us.</p><p>But it’s also important that we are a part of, for example, the International Blockchain Association, that we are part of the Blockchain For Europe initiative and things like that. I think there’s a lot going on on the interface between the blockchain world and the old world, right? And so we engage a lot in those things as&nbsp;well.</p><p>So that’s really important because what our goal is actually, as I said, for the next three years, we have to build adoption. This is where everything comes together. It’s nice to have good technology out there, but if nobody knows about the technology, it’s useless, right? Now if you can build for three years the best possible&nbsp;rocket…</p><p>Brad [01:29:41] Exactly. And what a time to come out. Now you’ll ready to go, you’re ready to fire the engines and showcase that you are able to achieve adoption because you spent the years. And it is time for you to come out of the blocks as well and go with your team. And I had a look at them. If anyone wants to know more about the team, there is so much information. There are so many credentials, again, no pun intended, but there are a lot in the team itself of KILT Protocol.</p><p>Now. As I said before, there’s a lot that’s going to unfold here. It’s very clear you’re in a position that’s primed for the attention of all the crypto space right now. They’re hungry for more in this market. And they’re certainly looking for the best reputation, the best credentials, the best technology that can really prove itself as you move forward and you’re primed to go. So with that in mind, thank you so much for your time. For those who survived this very long interview, it’s been an honour speaking with the founder and CEO of KILT Protocol.</p><p>Again, if you’d like to know more, I put links in the social media. I’ll make sure that there are links for those who are devs who want to learn more and can interact with devs based on the feedback from Ingo after the interview. And also, just don’t forget, credentials is the word, but it’s all about embedding into the technology. It’s about making sure that it is provided for a very specific trust aspect of the trustless world that we are currently all trying to support for the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Ingo, is there anything you’d like to say as one final comment to the people on behalf of KILT Protocol?</p><p>Ingo [01:31:14] I don’t have anything else. I’d like to thank you for the excellent questions. That was really, really good and a very nice interview. Thank you very much for all the questions and for digging so deep into what we do, which would obviously enable you to ask those very specific questions. Very cool. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Brad [01:31:34] You’re super welcome. And if it’s okay with you I’d love to catch up with you again, especially after these events are about to unfold, because it is always about that continued support, free, transparent. Everything you represent is the same for me. I definitely want to see you grow in the future to really transform legacy models that need to change. And you are definitely part of that conversation. So keep going Ingo, keep leading this team out and don’t stop, mate. It’s only going to get more exciting, as we see the blockchain show what it can&nbsp;do.</p><p>Ingo [01:32:04] Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Read to <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/blockchain-brad-interviews-ingo-rübe-essential-credentials-for-web-3-0-7ed856151aec">Part 1</a> of “Essential Credentials for Web 3.0” interview.</p>

<p>(Part 1 of&nbsp;2)</p><p>“KILT Protocol: Essential Credentials for Web 3.0 | Trust Enabler | Universal Blockchain Protocol”<br>February&nbsp;2021</p><p>Part 1 of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGuTaeVQ8S4">Brad Laurie’s wide-ranging conversation with Ingo Rübe</a> covers the below topics; a PDF of the interview is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blockchain-Brad_Transcript.pdf">here</a>.</p>  Credentials  Identity  Use Cases for Verifiable Credentials  Sovereignty  Trust &amp;&nbsp;Truth  Anonymity  Social KYC  Open Source  A Universal Protocol  Decentralized Identity Foundation  Ingo’s Background  KILT Use&nbsp;Cases  Why Polkadot?  XCMP and Polkadot Relay&nbsp;Chain  Ecosystem Collaboration  <p>Brad [00:00:06] Hello, it’s Brad Laurie, I’m Blockchain Brad. And today I’m honoured to speak with the founder and CEO of KILT Protocol. His name is Ingo and he’s here to explain everything that we possibly don’t know yet about KILT and what they’re actually building and have been building for some time. So Ingo, thank you very much for being here as the lead of this very challenging endeavour.</p><p>Ingo [00:00:27] Hello. Thanks for having&nbsp;me.</p><p>Brad [00:00:28] You’re very welcome. Now, in transparency, it’s important that all of you know this is entirely free. And obviously I know KILT. This is about making sure that there really is key information from the source. And that’s from Ingo himself. No better than the CEO and founder of any team anywhere in the world right now in blockchain.</p><p>So let’s talk about something that isn’t really talked about a lot Ingo, and that is credentials. Honestly, it’s a very complicated topic. A lot of people really haven’t dug deep, I don’t think, yet into KILT, and they don’t tend to do that until they start to see financial reasons to do so. So let’s start early. Let’s explore for the right reasons. That’s the tech ones. Why do we need to explore credentials in the context of Web 3 and blockchain Ingo?</p> 1. CREDENTIALS <p>Ingo [00:01:09] So the credential is something you all know. You have a lot of those. Normally they come on paper or on plastic. So for example, your identity card is one, your driver’s licence is one. And also if you have a university degree, you’ve got a piece of paper from the university. This is a credential. Also, your key which opens your door or your car, this is also a credential. So credentials are all around us basically, but normally they are not digital. Normally they are somehow physical. And we were exploring this thing from the side of the digital identity.</p> 2. IDENTITY <p>Ingo [00:01:43] So I think everybody agrees that digital identity is needed in digital systems. So we need to know who to talk with. We need to know if a service is actually the service it pretends to be and stuff like that. So there’s a huge need in identity. And when you look a little bit into identity, you can actually see that identity consists of two things. The first thing that you need is an identifier. So in this call, Ingo would be a nice identifier for me because I’m the only Ingo here and if Brad says “Hi Ingo”, I know that it’s going to me. But this is just an identifier and it doesn’t say anything about me. So this is not identity. This is just an identifier. It’s just like you put a QR code on an egg or you put a number on some packages or whatever. It is, it doesn’t say anything, it’s just a&nbsp;number.</p><p>And to have this become identity, actually, you need to put something more to it. So how does my identity grow? It grows with credentials, actually. So, I’m European, for example, I have a European passport, so that makes me European. And this passport mentions my identifier again. It says Ingo. So I can show it — this is Ingo, this is Ingo — this is part of the identity. Also, I can drive a car. This is why I have a credential for driving cars. I also have a company here which I can prove by having somebody look into the commercial register of the city I live in. And I also have a university degree and if I go to look for a new job, I might want to show this because then the guy trusts me, obviously, that I can do something, especially in computer science, and this is how my identity actually&nbsp;grows.</p><p>And if we want to have digital identity, it’s not enough to just have the identifiers and give everyone a name because then you don’t know anything about those things, it’s just names. You have to put credentials to it and you have to have the credential in a digital representation. And this is why we need those verifiable credentials — that’s the name for that — in a digital representation so that we can link them up to identifiers. And identifiers plus the credentials together form an identity. And this can be an identity of a person. It can also be an identity of a machine. It can also be an identity of an IOT device. It can also be the identity of a service which is just running in software. Right? So to build digital identity, we need those credentials because otherwise it’s just pure identifiers. And that’s boring and doesn’t help&nbsp;anyone.</p> 3. USE CASES FOR VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS <p>Brad [00:04:31] Well, let’s explore this also in the context, because the reality is that you want to have key use cases. You’ve been building this for some years and we’ve already seen in the blockchain arena DIDs, or those decentralised digital identification markers, nice experimentation on the blockchain emerge for real use cases. But one of the things that hasn’t come, perhaps so much, is the credential component that must happen. So in the context of, I guess, real world business and real world applications and more importantly, all the way to the very top of government, surely Ingo, this is really limitless in how this can be applied in this Web 3 arena. And obviously the blockchain is crucial to innovating, otherwise we’re just reinventing old&nbsp;wheels.</p><p>Ingo [00:05:16] Exactly, so it’s not… Actually what we do is protocol development. And if you do protocol development, it’s always very wise not to have a specific use case in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>Think of Tim Berners-Lee. He invented the http protocol. Nowadays you can sell your bicycle via http. This definitely was not Tim Berners-Lee’s goal, right? So if you do protocol development, you have to do something which is basically open for millions of use cases. Otherwise, it’s not going to be successful. So we were thinking in the beginning, shall we maybe go into some vertical? Should we concentrate on DeFi? Should we concentrate on government? Should we concentrate on whatever? And we said actually that would be the wrong way. Let’s be completely open.</p><p>And it now turns out that this was basically quite a good idea. Because now we have this base technology out there. We see use cases popping up left and right from us, which is really, really cute because we never thought of those things. So people come there and say, hey, can we do this for certificates for allergens inside food? And we never thought of that. And then people have come up and say, hey, we’re trying to make a genetics service which doesn’t store the genetic information about the people so it can’t be misused. Actually, you could do that with credentials can’t you? And then we say, yeah, actually, you can. That’s cool. And so, there are use cases all around us. And the cool thing is that we just concentrate on building the protocol and making it so flexible that everybody can possibly use it and then people around it build the use cases on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Brad [00:07:05] Yes. And that’s why I’m so excited about it, to be honest. I’ve been tweeting about this for a while and following you along because it really equates to, in many respects, the TCP/IP of credentials aligning with identity for really limitless use cases that aren’t specific to KILT Protocol itself. But in that context, I wanted to talk you through a few terms related to this universal potential of the protocol, such as self-sovereignty, the anonymity and the verifiability or the verification aspect. You mentioned that already, but they are key components to building this, I guess, universal protocol, because that’s really what it is from the&nbsp;outset.</p> 4. SOVEREIGNTY <p>Ingo [00:07:44] Yeah. So let’s dig into sovereignty first. So I think sovereignty is one of the most important things when you look at the internet as we see it today, and this is where the Web 2 and the Web 3 actually differentiate a lot. So when you look at digital identity in the Web 2, this identity is basically held with big companies. I don’t want to mention names, but they’re mostly in America. And so how does it work? So if you want to log into a huge social network, actually what you choose is a username and password, which is an identifier. Right? And then they look to see if the username is already taken, if the password is long enough and whatever. And if everything is fine, then they say, OK, this is now your username and password and you’ve got an identifier.</p><p>The first problem there is actually that they know your secret and you know your secret. Actually, you have a shared secret. From a security point of view that’s not so cool. What happens then, is that you start to behave on this social network and this aggregates data. And this aggregation of data is actually the credentials. This is your behaviour and this aggregates not with you, it aggregates there. Right? It aggregates on their database. And then it becomes really, really dangerous because it’s not only your data that’s aggregating, everybody’s data is aggregating there. So this is a huge honeypot for hackers. If you just hack in once and you’ve got all the information, pretty cool — for the hacker, not for the&nbsp;others.</p><p>The second thing is that this aggregates a lot of power with this social network because the social network then goes and says, hey, we got a messenger service as well. If you want to log into the messenger service, you can just use your identity or your identifer you have from your social network. That’s so convenient for you. But in the end, it’s all put together to one database and they have more information and they can start selling and misusing it. And there’s a huge, huge danger in&nbsp;that.</p><p>And the biggest danger is actually, if you have a better idea of how a messenger should work, how will you ever go to market? Because they can already say, hey, you have your log-in there already, it’s so convenient. And so they’re aggregating more and more users. And better technologies, brighter ideas will never come to market because no one is going to finance them because they don’t have the users. Right? And that’s a huge thing, which is which is hindering innovation. And so we have to somehow stop&nbsp;that.</p> 5. TRUST &amp;&nbsp;TRUTH <p>Brad [00:10:22] Can I just jump in there and ask you this in the context of trustlessness. We hear that a lot in DeFi. We hear that a lot in the broader blockchain speak. But you’re embedding a layer of trust within the framework so that all the engineering that is afforded by blockchain for trustlessness, so that any entity from top to bottom, grassroots or otherwise, governmental or enterprise, can actually start to engage. But with the security and provisions of trust built in for proper applications and use cases that we know can then be utilised in business, even.</p><p>Ingo [00:11:03] Yeah, that’s it. I think this is a complicated thing people have to get their head around. Because actually you’re completely right. What we’re doing in blockchain is we produce a trustless system. What does a trustless system mean? Trustless means basically, we exchange trust with the mathematical truth. So if I have a Bitcoin and I see a Bitcoin on my balance, this is mathematically calculated. I can be sure this is my Bitcoin. Right? So this is truth. When I have a dollar in the bank, I can see my balance there, but I have to trust the bank that their database is actually working well and that they give me the dollar back in cash or whatever. So this is&nbsp;trust.</p><p>So we have a truth system in the blockchain and we have a trust system outside the blockchain. So we can state that. But then also in our culture, we need some kind of trust. And this kind of trust is represented normally by entities. This basically starts in the beginning of your life. At first, you trust your parents. You can’t get away from&nbsp;that.</p><p>Maybe 12 years later, you start doubting this trust, but in the first 12 years and it’s just trusting that. And then we are educated to trust institutions. Some people trust judges. Some people trust governments. Normally you trust universities. And it’s not going to go out of our culture. So when I have an employee who wants to work here and he shows me a university degree, then I will actually look at it and say, OK, I’ve heard of this university. This is a good university. I trust this university or what they do. And of course, then I would like to have this employee here because he has this nice piece of paper. So this trust between me and the university is probably not going to go away just because we have a new technology here.</p><p>Brad [00:13:03] Right. And… sorry, go&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Ingo [00:13:07] And if we want to implement something like credentials, we have to recognise that those structures are there. Right? So we have to give the university a chance. The trust relationship between me and the university is something that happens in the real world. So this is a trust relationship, this does not have anything to do basically with the blockchain. But you could actually also make your university diploma yourself and just show me a fake&nbsp;one.</p><p>And this is what we can actually prevent with the blockchain because we can — and this is what KILT is about — we can store a hash of this credential on the blockchain so that it is absolutely mathematically true and verifiable that the university actually issued this credential and issued it exactly to me. And this is what we can find out, where we can produce the truth&nbsp;upon.</p><p>Brad [00:14:04] This is so awesome. I want to jump in here because this does this at a level that really hasn’t been done before in terms of finite trust, provable by blockchain, provable by code. So rather than trusting people and systems that sometimes can be flawed, this can be a better way, arguably for the future of any system, whether that be open source design for the people with no enterprise, endeavour or otherwise.</p><p>The great thing you said there was that there is this true, valuable synergy between the blockchain’s trustless design that’s provable and verifiable through the chain itself and then coupled with credentials that we absolutely need in society. So that’s a really innovative thing. I think that has the potential that we really haven’t explored yet globally.</p> 6. ANONYMITY <p>Brad [00:14:50] So that verifiable aspect that’s nuanced by the blockchain. You’ve also referenced the importance of sovereignty as well, self-sovereignty. But what about anonymity? How does that fit into the context as well, especially when that’s had a bad rap Ingo, at the beginning of the blockchain movement, when the governments tend to be quite averse to anonymity sometimes.</p><p>Ingo [00:15:11] Yes, I think anonymity is something that comes in different flavours and that has to be provided in different ways. So, for example, take a real world example. So I want to get into a bar and I have to be eighteen for that. So I choose one of the credentials I have in my wallet, which is probably my driver’s licence. And then I show this to the bouncer. And the bouncer actually needs to see the picture so he can see that the credential matches the subject. And the bouncer also has to see my date of birth, obviously, so he can find out if I’m eighteen or not. And he definitely doesn’t need to know my name. Right? So what I can do is I can put my finger on the name and then he will still let me in. He will not know who I am, but he will see that I’m eighteen. This is what we call selective disclosure.</p><p>This is one part of anonymity we have to provide and this is also something that KILT can provide. So if you have a credential and this has four different things in it, you can choose which parts you show. So that’s one thing. The other thing that is important is that it must be possible for you to show up somewhere and prove something and then show up again and prove it again or prove something again without the verifiers, the bouncer in that case, knowing that it is you again. This is needed for many different DeFi applications and this is also something that we implemented. So I come to you and say, hey, I have a cat, I can prove I have a cat. And next I come back and say, Hey, I have a cat. You say, OK, he has a cat, but you don’t know that this was the same person. That is something that is also especially needed around blockchain projects.</p><p>So those things around anonymity have to be provided. And that’s necessary to get to the general acceptance of a system like that. Otherwise, it would be absolutely open to anyone to read that and that wouldn’t fit with data security. And sovereignty is also something that plays into anonymity, because when I have the sovereignty over my credentials, and this is what you have in a blockchain-based system and this is what you also have in the real world system, like with your real wallet, then I choose who I show which credential to and which part of the credential I&nbsp;show.</p><p>Brad [00:17:50] That’s a huge thing because many, many different parties want to be selective.</p><p>Ingo [00:17:55] Exactly. So this is why we need those features as well to be useful for a variety of use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Brad [00:18:05] Yes, I mean, it’s immense what you’re talking about. I mean, it really is immense because, again, it’s that standardisation. For those who aren’t really understanding perhaps yet, that’s a keyword, wouldn’t you argue Ingo, is that you are a standard as a true protocol.</p><p>Brad [00:18:21] But I would also suggest that you’re going to be more than that, because whilst you are the protocol, you’re building in specific potential, specific, technology, specific, perhaps even products, who knows — you’re going to teach us this — that really build out more than a protocol, but a whole platform. Because there’s a lot going on for the standard protocol that can be applied to a vast amount of use cases. But I wonder, from you, are you thinking of specific ones that really capitalise on the potential of this protocol?</p> 7. SOCIAL&nbsp;KYC <p>Ingo [00:18:50] Yeah, I think there are things that we already see which are going to have a very big potential. So, I think we’re KYC-ing is one thing that really has to be rethought in the world. And everybody’s really unhappy with KYC. That has to do with every country having a different legislation around it. This has to do with basically every bank or whoever you deal with has a different view on what he should do and what he shouldn’t. It has to do with being really annoying for people when they are around in the DeFi space to KYC basically every day. So that doesn’t make a lot of sense right now. So something has to be done about that. And we see the first projects coming and popping up and we are part of those projects.</p><p>For example, together with the companies, Polkadex and Fractal, we just started a really, really nice thing where we provide the KYCs from a well-known KYC provider as verifiable credentials which are in the possession of the user. Not only the KYC. You do the KYC and then the data is owned by the bank or by the service you signed up to. This is basically stupid, actually. You should have that because then you can reuse it. Right? And you don’t need to make the KYCs&nbsp;again.</p><p>We are also working on a project called Social KYC, which I think is going to be really important. Because there’s not only the government KYC, it’s also possible to do social KYCs around there, which means that you actually prove that you have access to different accounts like a LinkedIn account, a Twitter account, a Riot account, a Github account and your email address. And if you prove that you have all those accesses and if you store them in a credential, you can actually send people out there in the internet something that is basically much more valuable than a KYC which is issued by a government’s thing. Right? Because..why do I want to know where you live? Actually that’s really not important to me. But if I know who you are on Twitter, who you are on LinkedIn, who you are on three or four social networks and know your email address and your phone number, then I actually know who I’m dealing with. And if you can prove to me that you control all these accounts, then I’m pretty sure I’m working with you, right? That’s much more valuable.</p><p>Brad [00:21:28] Exactly. And you’re opening this up so that someone like me or anyone really who wants to engage with the open source nature of the code — and that’s what I wanted to check with you — can start to tinker with this and start to almost personalise it or to make it their&nbsp;own.</p><p>And something quite unique because we haven’t seen that kind of access in the past before either, especially in the context of credentials and especially in the context of systems that are built. And often they’re for people but not available as readily, as easily. So in that, where’s the value for this Ingo, when it comes to open source tech as opposed to proprietary? Given that this is in the spirit of block chain, how much of the protocol itself, through the GitHub, through the access, through the nature of open source, is available for everyone to interact with? And can it be forked? Can it be appropriated?</p> 8. OPEN&nbsp;SOURCE <p>Ingo [00:22:20] So, what we do is 100% open source. So anything that we produce is always open source. So as soon as it’s released, it’s also open source. I think this is a necessary component in the blockchain world. If you build something on blockchain and then it’s not open source, then who will trust you actually, that you don’t put traps in that? So that’s a precondition. I don’t think there are many blockchain-related projects out there which have closed source components, and I wouldn’t trust them, actually.</p><p>Brad [00:22:54] Thank you for letting us know that. So where does the value sit in then for you? So we clarify this because you’ve been spending years with your team on this code. You’ve been building this out for a very specific value universally for, as you’ve mentioned, limitless potential. So how does KILT as a team capitalise on the protocol?</p><p>Ingo [00:23:15] So we capitalise like any serious blockchain project just by producing our own currency. That’s what we do. So we don’t take any fees for licences or data from people and sell it later. We’re not going to go into the service thing. Because I think that an open source project actually works best when there are integrators around that. We have seen that in the past. So successful open source projects actually concentrate on their open source product, which is in our case, KILT Protocol.</p><p>And then around that you have people with bright ideas who want to build great services on that and have their own business models. And you have to encourage those guys actually to build the software. And then they can earn money with it and there must be different, multiple business models possible on top of that. While we stay very small, stay in our corner and just build the KILT Protocol.</p><p>Brad [00:24:24] So you’re the lean protocol team. And you also alluded to that important economic aspect of this. I mean, that’s the true utility fuel. The reality is that token economy is really important to the dynamics of how this can play out to enable everyone to engage with this, but also be incentivised. This is something quite revolutionary, I would think, given that this is something that people can then take to build out their own credential needs. They can add them in and embed them into their own technology, their own tech stacks, their own business models, whatever the use case may&nbsp;be.</p> 9. A UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL <p>Brad [00:24:59] But going back to you, one thing I did want to ask you: often when I talk to CEOs and founders, they also have in the back of their mind, perhaps we could also tinker ourselves as a team, not just build the protocol, but we could perhaps build some products. Have you ever thought about that on top of the work you’re doing, which is vast? I mean, let’s be real. This is a universal protocol. But is it a possibility later on where you may privatise some aspects in-house, that can use the protocol like anyone else? That are high quality, that are high tech and are very usable for, say, for example, governments. For, say, for example, enterprises. So they don’t have to build these products or these useful&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Ingo [00:25:42] Yeah, right now we are not doing this because we have enough to do with the protocol, actually. But like many blockchain companies you see, we also have two parts. We have the Foundation and we have the commercial entity. And the Foundation will always care for the protocol. But then we also have the commercial part. And the commercial part is absolutely free to move into building a service later. But right now, no time for that! But hey, next year things can&nbsp;happen.</p><p>But actually we don’t have any…this company doesn’t have an unfair advantage. It has the same source code as everybody else. And if we say we are going to build Service X, which is the super duper premium wallet for KILT credentials, someone else might come around and build a better one because it’s just normal competition. We don’t have any advantages.We could do that, but we are not even sure that we will. If we do, it must be a really bright idea. And we must also see that no one else is doing something better than&nbsp;that.</p><p>Brad [00:26:55] And you know what’s so exciting is that the protocol itself is the ability, the basis, the foundation for all of the economy to emerge. That’s what I’m hearing from you, is that the token economic design of this is really just to build out the value of the protocol, allow that to be the true core system at play when you can start to build these important credentials the world&nbsp;over.</p><p>So you must be pretty proud of the fact that you’re potentially a world mover here. First mover, rather. Do you know of anyone else in the space, given that you’ve been doing this for a few years, that is doing something similar or doing something even remotely as complex as you in the world of verifiable credentials, in the world of Web 3, in the world of self sovereignty?</p> 10. DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY FOUNDATION <p>Ingo [00:27:42] So that’s a very good question, because we are part of the Decentralized Identity Foundation, which has, I think, more than a hundred, maybe two hundred companies in there. Small ones, blockchain ones like us, but also bigger ones like IBM and Microsoft. We are all organised there. Why did we do that? We saw that if it goes to digital identity, this is a biggie. Right? And we are not competing with our ideas of a decentralised identity with just another small company. We’re competing with the real big ones, the GAFA, right? And so if I come with my little 15-people team here and say now I’m going to compete against the GAFA, I will probably not be successful, especially not if the next project, just a couple of streets down the road, has the same idea and does it a little bit different.</p><p>And so what we need to do is we first have to agree on how we do it and then we have to do it the same way for the user. So the credentials and the DIDs have to look the same way. So already in 2017 we gathered all those companies together and said we have to agree on standards so that we are compatible with each other, even though we might be competitors.Where the DIDs actually emerge from, this is where the verifiable credentials standard emerged from. So there are many companies in this field and they all differentiate a little bit by doing something a little bit different than others. But the credential which you hold in your wallet will basically be compatible with any other.&nbsp;Right?</p><p>And this is absolutely important because otherwise we can’t win. We are all, even if we are Microsoft and IBM, we are too small to win. So we have to put our strengths together and all go to a little bit of a different use case maybe, or go into a different vertical or have some speciality around it. Like maybe we are a little bit better in providing anonymity and we might be a little bit more in the blockchain world, which other companies maybe are not. But in the end the credential is the credential.</p><p>Brad [00:30:14] This is fascinating because I’ve spoken to only one other company in this context before where we were talking about standardisations. And we were talking about global standardisations that were reaching across into the mainstream, into those major players in enterprise, as you mentioned, in Microsoft. So what does that mean for something like KILT? So I can really understand, and everyone listening, when you’re collaborating at that level. When you’re having that inter-discussion about the internet of credentials, essentially. Having that TCP/IP really, to use that analogy, for having that credentials layer. That’s a big deal for every aspect of literally every application, and every person in the world really can benefit from&nbsp;this.</p><p>I’m wondering, why would Microsoft pay attention to little KILT, little KILT Protocol? What’s in it for them? What’s the reciprocal and mutual benefit? Because clearly, no disrespect to you, they have the money, the power, the capital, the centralised systems. But what they don’t have is the years of experience that you’ve had and you’ve built. So are you ahead of the game and they are catching up and working with you for that reason or what’s going on here&nbsp;Ingo?</p><p>Ingo [00:31:23] I think in the beginning of this Decentralized Identity Foundation it was, just, let’s gather the people and start to work on standards. That was the idea. So it’s more like really doing something together and being bigger. And even Microsoft isn’t big enough. They need us. It’s not only us. They need the 200 companies in there as well. And pretty quickly, actually, we took it away from the company-to-company talk because that doesn’t really make sense, because then everybody has their own&nbsp;agenda.</p><p>What we did is we asked and we were successful in asking the World Wide Web Consortium, the W3C to handle the standardisation process for us. So everybody now comes to the table and has their ideas. And so Microsoft has the same say in this as we do. And we all go to the standardisation bodies, bring in our ideas and what comes out is the standardisation. And we say beforehand, no matter what comes out, we are going to agree on that. Right? That’s the stuff that we&nbsp;did.</p><p>Brad [00:32:31] So it’s almost like the UN, Ingo, for credential standardisation, for a revolutionary protocol that’s going to change the game. Once the world comes together on&nbsp;this.</p><p>Ingo [00:32:46] It’s not meeting every day like the UN, but it’s actually…(laughs).</p><p>Brad [00:32:50] It’s mind boggling because we talk about DeFi but we have to have those board members at the dev table. And you’re one of them. So how does it feel to be one in two hundred approximately who are contributing to what is potentially — without trying to understate this — a game-changer for the entire world? I mean, as revolutionary as the internet was, this could be also something of that magnitude. Would you&nbsp;agree?</p><p>Ingo [00:33:14] I wouldn’t say… I would say that what we do with credentials and digital identity is a base layer which is needed for the next generation of the internet, which we normally call the Web 3. Which also needs some more things. But one of them is identity. Definitely. So you have to be able to do digital identity in a way that is self-sovereign — that’s absolutely necessary. No way around&nbsp;that.</p><p>So we are important, but we are only a building block within something much bigger — that is the Web 3 — with things like infrastructure, things like being able to produce blockchains for dedicated use cases, like Polkadot does. Where we need decentralised storage like Filecoin and IPFS does. I think all those things basically have to come together to actually change the world of the internet and bring us into a new and a little bit better scenario with the&nbsp;Web.</p><p>Brad [00:34:23] Well said. And you know what’s great is that you’re embedded, as you articulated. You’re a feature embedded in that layer, that fundamental foundational layer that is going to potentially sweep the globe in that Web 3 scenario. So you’re not something built on top. You’re actually embedded and built in as a key component with the credential aspect and the verifiable credentials specifically.</p><p>So let’s keep going, because there is so much to unpack. And it’s really exciting to talk to you. Your background — I just want to touch on that briefly. So that people understand again, you didn’t just move from an everyday job to build this. You had a lot of experience behind you. So do you just want to give yourself a bit of a&nbsp;plug.</p> 11. INGO’S BACKGROUND <p>Ingo [00:35:06] Yeah, so, after studying I had my first startup in the 90s of the last century. That was something completely different. It was medical informatics. And then we sold this company in 2000, I think, and that was nice. But then I did the thing that the normal serial entrepreneur doesn’t do. I didn’t set up the next company. I went into industry. And I think that was a good learning experience for me, because when you are always an entrepreneur and you’re always the boss, then you actually don’t know, don’t learn how the structures work and how complicated and complex structures work.</p><p>So it was very, very healthy for me to go into big industry for 12 years or so. And I worked mostly with huge publishing companies and media companies and made my industrial career there. And then after that I decided, now I’ve actually seen both things. I’ve seen the small companies, I’ve seen the tech, but I’ve also seen how you actually build business and what the mindset of those people is and what they actually require and how you can talk to those guys. And that’s a knowledge that is really, really valuable.</p><p>And then I decided, when the blockchain thing was coming up, I decided, OK, this is actually the big chance in my life because I understand this technology. How cool. And I know how to build a business and I know the surroundings. I know the needs of the industry. And I can still speak to the blockchain scene people and be respected by them because I studied the right thing. So why not build something there? And then, yeah, I left my everyday job as a CTO and said, OK, now let’s give it a try and build something which is actually useful for the&nbsp;world.</p> 12. KILT USE&nbsp;CASES <p>Brad [00:37:13] Well, let’s start with that comment for the next point of discussion, that’s useful. That is such a rare proof in this space. As you know, with blockchain and crypto coming together to be known as the crypto space, utility and use case, real proveability when it comes to being applied and useful is a rarity and a gem, even today. So are you confident that you really do have something that isn’t just a narrative, isn’t just another scenario with the token economy, but actually something that is genuinely going to be applied and useful for the everyday user who more importantly, does not even need to know about the blockchain.</p><p>Ingo [00:37:51] Yeah, we did a lot of research on that because actually, the idea behind the whole thing of KILT is do something useful and not do something to get rich quick or something. So it’s really about use. And we thought a lot about that. And many of the decisions that we have made are actually driven by this “use”&nbsp;thing.</p><p>So we were seeing that digital identity is really, really interesting. And we were also seeing that everybody is talking about the digital passport and how useful that would be. Actually, it might be useful in some edge cases, but talking to politicians, actually, it’s not going to happen in the next ten years. Because the politicians or the governments, they have a monopoly on identity right now and they don’t want to give it up. And let’s be also fair, it’s working for most people. Those people where it doesn’t work — when you don’t have a passport, when you are a refugee — for those people, it doesn’t work in a nice&nbsp;way.</p><p>My passport works nice, actually. So I don’t need to replace the very, very simple plastic card with a piece of really complicated technology. That’s really hard to explain to someone living in Australia and Germany. And this is maybe going to come — but not today, not tomorrow.</p><p>But then we saw that there’s a huge need in industry actually to have verifiable credentials for services and for things inside the internet. Because the only digital identity mechanism that we have is the OAuth2, which is basically the thing that the GAFA use to centralise the data. And it seems to be quite OK — not understandable for me — but it seems to me seems to be quite OK for people to have their credentials stored with a big American company and not with themselves.</p><p>Brad [00:39:56] No allusion there. Wouldn’t be F and B together, would&nbsp;it?</p> 13. WHY POLKADOT? <p>Ingo [00:39:59] It would be nice if we change that, but obviously this is also not the biggest necessary use case. The biggest necessity use cases are actually for companies, because when I build a product and this product owns a credential, then the credential is part of the value of the product. Right? And then if this credential or the validity of this credential is not with me — it is with Facebook or whoever — this is not acceptable for me as a production company. They need that. So then they need this fully decentralised machine, actually, where there’s no trust needed, where there is truth in there. Right? And there, blockchain is needed, by the way. This is somewhere you can do something useful with blockchain.</p><p>And then you come to the next phase where you go to potential industry partners and say, hey, we’re building this thing and it’s a fully decentralised blockchain and it has the truth in it and it holds your credentials and you hold your credential but it holds the validity. And then they say, OK, nice thing. But unfortunately, your blockchain produces unpredictable production costs. Because sometimes the gas is five euros and sometimes the gas is fifteen euros and sometimes it’s twenty four. And actually we can’t produce things like that because we don’t know how expensive the product is going to be in production so what price point would we&nbsp;set?</p><p>And then you could say, OK, let’s do a permissioned blockchain like Hyperledger, or whatever, and go into that and then you have a predictable price. But unfortunately then you don’t have the truth in the system, right? So you have a dilemma&nbsp;there.</p><p>And this is basically why we moved to Polkadot in 2018 because Polkadot is solving this problem. I think it’s the only technology out there which we have which solves this problem. Because when I have this — it’s called a parachain lease — I actually can build a small blockchain and have predictable gas prices, so I can say making a credential in KILT will never cost more than €0.10 or something. And then they can build their production costs on&nbsp;that.</p><p>But I can also say I have the truth of a truly, fully permissionless blockchain in there because I can send my blocks to the Polkadot Relay Chain and have them verify it for me. And if they are good, then they have the truth in the system again. So I have the mathematical truth and I have the price stability which I need. And we are really trying to make things which are useful and we are reflecting with the people who will use them later. And when they say it doesn’t work this way, then we use the technology or choose the technology that can actually fulfil the requirements of the potential users.</p><p>Brad [00:42:57] And can I just jump in there? Because, I mean, there’s a lot said in there. So clearly, you’re the sort of person who’s paying attention to the optimal blockchain platform; the optimal blockchain, full stack of services and provisions, tools and all the way down to that fundamental code. Now, you talked about Polkadot. Again, everyone knows I’m a fan of that, but I am certainly agnostically positioned in all the space. So I’d imagine you would be too, whether it be Polkadot or whether it be something in the future. The absolute criterion for you is that this system, whichever it is, is the best in the world in what you need. And right now Polkadot clearly is that for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Ingo [00:43:37] Yeah, that’s true. We were brought there by this dilemma of price and truth, so they were solving the price/truth dilemma. So that was clearly where we wanted to be. So this is why we started developing the whole thing on Parity Substrate in October 2018. Parity Substrate was in the beginning at that time, so it improved a&nbsp;lot.</p><p>Brad [00:44:04] That’s why we had the canary&nbsp;network.</p><p>Ingo [00:44:08] And then it turned out that it’s also a nice community actually. And this is another reason to stay because the Polkadot community obviously attracts very, very bright minds. And that is also a thing where we feel very well. Yeah, we feel very well talking to and exchanging with people in a relatively small community when you compare it to Ethereum or so. And a relatively small community which has bright people in there who come up with new ideas, who also criticise you in a positive&nbsp;way.</p><p>Brad [00:44:45] Well, let’s talk about that then Ingo, because we had the co-founder of Ethereum move across and build Parity, Gavin Wood. Then he tinkered with the highest standards of tech to build out what has now become the Polkadot ecosystem. We see that Substrate now emerged. We see Kusama with the canary network, and we see again, from many other key parachain initiatives or potentials, we see also very complex and emerging tech moving out for specific purposes, specific use cases and even more that is just really on the edge of the future of decentralised technologies.</p><p>So this is a very big deal, knowing that we’re talking about interoperability here. Cross collaboration, the potentials of working and enhancing even the likes of Ethereum, for example, and many others to come. So would it be fair in saying that you’re also not only pro Polkadot, but you’re pro interchain. You’re pro bringing things together just like you are with the credentials built into this foundational layer of the&nbsp;future?</p><p>Brad [00:45:44] Surely, because when we listen to Gavin, he doesn’t talk solely about Polkadot, he talks about what’s coming and integrating so much more into a more seamless Web 3&nbsp;world.</p> 14. XCMP and POLKADOT RELAY&nbsp;CHAIN <p>Ingo [00:45:56] Yes, sure. So when you do base layer technology, interconnecting is crucial because people have to somehow use the KILT Protocol. And there are different ways to do that. So for industry players we provide a nice JavaScript SDK on top of that so that they can use their own resources, basically. Because normally big companies have some JavaScript developers. To build KILT applications on top of that, that’s the industry part. We have to cover&nbsp;that.</p><p>We are very happy about XCMP now coming up, the cross-chain messaging protocol, so that we are able to natively speak through the Relay Chain in a very secured way to other projects which are also in the Polkadot ecosystem. And I’m very excited about what’s going to come up there. This technology is brand new, right. So there’s no one really out there already using it. It’s just there. We now know how it works and we start talking with the first projects and say OK, and could we send messages here and there, and start collaborating on this level as well? So this is too new to talk about, basically, but this is very, very exciting for us. And I think it’s a great chance to be an early part of this ecosystem, because in the beginning, it’s going to be relatively small. Right? This is going to grow.&nbsp;Yes.</p><p>And it’s good to be there in the beginning already and have some use cases also inside the ecosystem where we can show that communication through the Relay Chain is very valuable for projects to be part of this ecosystem. This will draw more people inside the ecosystem, which is good for us, because then we have more partners to talk to. And it’s also good for them because if they wait a little longer, they will already find a functioning infrastructure for a lot of problems that they will&nbsp;see.</p><p>Brad [00:47:52] Yes,&nbsp;exactly.</p><p>Ingo [00:47:54] And so it’s good for us to be in early and it’s good for the others that we are in early because we can solve some of their problems. They don’t have to wrap their heads around&nbsp;them.</p><p>Brad [00:48:04] Yes. Well, I want to dig a bit more because everything you’re saying suggests meaningful partnerships, which was on my agenda later in the conversation. But let’s do it now. So earlier in the conversation, you mentioned that blockchain itself is something you are knowledgeable about, or you had some understanding of. That makes you rare. Firstly, when you couple that with all the expertise you had technologically and even in your role as leading out some very important, I guess, engineering roles, important leadership roles, all the things you’ve done in the&nbsp;past.</p><p>Now, when it comes to crypto, we see a lot of partnerships that aren’t meaningful, that are just hype-driven and fomo-driven and drivel-driven. But then we see the ones that aren’t. You know the difference pretty quickly when you start researching why these partnerships happened.</p><p>What’s interesting about you is that you could potentially partner with literally every high quality initiative that is useful in and of itself and in inter-blockchain, inter-multchain scenarios with other core layer one solutions or layer one foundational technologies. And then even outside of the scope of all of those in the mainstream, too, with the compatibility you mentioned, with the alliances you’re forging. So let’s start with the smaller ones. With the Polkadot arena, with the Polkadot potential. Can you tell us a bit more about the meaningfulness or the importance of these relationships you are forging and partnerships. For them, what’s the mutual benefit and why are they saying, yes, partner with us? Because it is happening. It’s unfolding now.</p> 15. ECOSYSTEM COLLABORATION <p>Ingo [00:49:34] Yeah, that’s actually pretty simple. This credential thing and identity thing, I would call it, this is a lot of work. And it’s really not nice if you have a project which needs to identify a person, say you’re building up an exchange, or whatever. If you have a DeFi system where you need some kind of credibility for people in there to calculate their credit score or whatever. You are very often confronted with the problem that you have to identify a person. And then you could go and implement this yourself because there’s a standard or they’ll just use the standard implemented.</p><p>Then you will notice, OK, the standard is maybe not enough. We need some things on top of the standard, like delegated trust and stuff like that, which you come to when you think about it and which are not described in the standard but are implemented already. Then you have two choices. Either you delay your project by one and a half years and start implementing the stuff, or you just use the stuff that is already&nbsp;there.</p><p>Brad [00:50:46] Or you call KILT. That’s what you&nbsp;do.</p><p>Ingo [00:50:50] That’s it, we save the people one and a half years of development work.</p><p>Brad [00:50:56] So let’s be real, I mean, we’ve seen the value of some of these real and meaningful partnerships. Chainlink has led the way with the Oracle endeavour, and I’m sure you’ve seen that because they are essentially an agnostic technology that’s important for the whole space. And they’re working across a multitude of different layer ones. And even layer zeros, as we know Polkadot&nbsp;is.</p><p>So without, again, trying to add any kind of hype, it’s really impossible not to when we know that this is a technology that doesn’t really exist outside of the scope of you in the Polkadot context, I would imagine. Or if it does, there’s few of them. And that means that there’s a very high chance that there’s going to be a vast amount of partnerships because they would all want to add this credential layer&nbsp;in.</p><p>Ingo [00:51:39] Exactly. I think there are two types of partnerships. There is the type of partnership where people just use our system. You don’t have to ask us for that. It’s open source. So that’s the easiest partnership, when we’ve just noticed “Whoops, they are using KILT. That’s cool.” That’s cool for us. But then there are also dedicated partnerships. And we use those partnerships for building things together.</p><p>So this happens, for example, as I said in the beginning with the Polkadex example, that we set something up together because nobody has done that before and we decided that we have to do that together. Right? Or with Moonbeam, we also have a partnership. We’re building something. And this thing only works when we bring the devs together, actually. If we can’t do it alone, they can’t do it alone, let’s let’s work together. This is a partnership which really makes sense because it makes the thing&nbsp;bigger.</p><p>And then we do partnerships and actually also bring development resources to the table. In the normal case, say, the 95% case, it’s just a project which is building something and says, OK, if we use KILT, then we’re faster on the market and it also fits into the ecosystem. And let’s just use those guys. Maybe they call us and say hey, we use you. And of course, they&nbsp;can.</p><p>Brad [00:52:57] This is so fantastic. It’s fantastic to know this is already happening now. You haven’t even launched and really explored publicly what’s unfolding with your whole economy.But to hear that utility is built in now, this is a big deal. Because sometimes we see white papers at launch with other projects, as you would appreciate, or not. So we like to see years of tech built in, years of the team building. And you’ve been doing all of&nbsp;that.</p><p>But on top of that, now you’re starting to be able to be useful, prelaunch, with something that’s going to fuel a broader, more experimental economy on top. So this is a big thing, especially knowing that this is related to something that’s underpinning so much more above, like we see with layers twos and all the applications that can come forth on these new and emerging blockchains.</p><p>Brad [00:53:43] So one of the things you said is “simple”. And often the case is with a great CEO, they won’t explain that simple means very technical. But it does. You know, for you to get to something where it’s seamless and easy and simple for me, it means that it’s years in the making for you. And some of those key things that have come up are things like creating, issuing, verifying, presenting and also claiming when it comes to the digital credentials.</p><p>So do you feel like where you are in your roadmap now, that you can actually achieve those things in reality? When you see these partnerships, when you see these other businesses and entities and protocols start to want and need you as they emerge for the future, are you applied now? Are you usable? Are you ready to go? And is this moving forward something that’s only going to grow and prove itself with real functionality and real application?</p><p>Continue to <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/blockchain-brad-interviews-ingo-rübe-essential-credentials-for-web-3-0-73fdb4ab4427">Part 2</a> of “Essential Credentials for Web 3.0” interview.</p>

<blockquote><p></p><p>“Markets don’t wait for engineering timelines.”</p>–Vinny Lingham</blockquote>



<p>That’s Vinny Lingham describing why <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-announces-integration-with-solana-blockchain/">Civic is integrating with the Solana blockchain</a> in a special AMA last week, featuring a fireside chat with Anatoly Yakovenko, CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>.</p>



<p>As background, Ethereum transaction fees have soared since last summer, blocking the mainstream adoption of DeFi and squeezing companies that depend on a functional blockchain ecosystem. With a second layer solution requiring months of development, chain-agnostic Civic <a href="https://www.identity.com/embedding-identity-into-the-blockchain-with-solana/">and its non-profit partner</a>, Identity.com, are paving a better path by leveraging Solana’s blazing speed and low fees that scale as the ecosystem grows.</p>



<p>Vinny’s point was that companies experiencing the stranglehold of high ETH fees don’t have time to simply wait months for a software fix that may work. There are many available alternatives, including solutions like Solana that are better-positioned for the future.</p>



<p>For its part, Civic believes that with identity as a cornerstone of blockchain infrastructure, a safer, more sustainable financial ecosystem may develop. And, with its unique expertise in identity-based key management and recovery, Civic will help make financial tools more accessible to mainstream consumers.</p>



<p>The journey to working with Solana began several years ago, when Vinny was first introduced to Anatoly in the most unusual way. As Anatoly recounts to Vinny during the virtual event, they met through a mutual friend that plays underwater hockey, back when Solana was looking for its seed round of funding. Anatoly said it really was that weird sport with a small community that led to the check that got the company its start.</p>



<p>Key Takeaways</p>



  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=195">03:15</a>: Civic is integrating with the Solana blockchain to leverage blazing speed and scalable fees.  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1398">23:18</a>: Solana CEO Anatoly Yakovenko joined Civic CEO Vinny Lingham for a fireside chat. Spoiler: they met through a mutual friend who played underwater hockey.  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1815">30:15</a>: Why is Solana the right platform for DeFi?  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=2715">45:15</a>: The move away from ETH was prompted by high gas fees and a long timeline for Layer 2.  



<p>Other Highlights</p>



<p>During the event, Anatoly and Vinny cover a range of topics, including Solana’s vision for DeFi at inception (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1815">30:15</a>), what it was like last summer when ETH gas prices spiked (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1643">27:23</a>), and what the landscape will look like now that many corporations have invested in cryptocurrency (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=2444">40:44</a>). Importantly, they cover the near future of identity. Anatoly notes that the “Summer of DeFi” proved that small groups of 10,000 to 20,000 people can easily organize around the idea. By knowing that a fellow group member is a verified human, the community can very easily build decentralized trust, unleashing a brand new way to connect and take action around good ideas (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=2317">38:37</a>).</p>



<p>Check out the full AMA above and hear more about what it takes to move blockchains. With the integration well underway, Civic will have more announcements about <a href="https://civic.finance/">our consumer gateway</a> soon.</p>

				  Professionally-staffed MainNet supports mission-critical, enterprise-grade decentralized identity market solutions   
			   
				
				
				 <p>Technology provider Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation advancing decentralized identity software and solutions, today announced the public availability of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio MainNet</a>, a professionally-staffed decentralized identity network designed for global enterprises that need a reliable platform to develop and scale identity services and products. The development of the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>-based network follows on the successful deployment of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">Indicio TestNet</a>, a market leader in decentralized identity networks.</p>
<p>The Indicio MainNet uses distributed ledger technology—multiple identical databases spread across different nodes—to enable the use of privacy-preserving verifiable digital credentials. This provides the foundation for flexible, portable, and permanent digital identities that are always under the control of the identity holder—the individual—and which provide an evolutionary leap forward in security.</p>
<p>“Our clients asked for a stable, fully-staffed network based on Hyperledger Indy— one that could provide the&nbsp; Service Level Agreements their customers need for mission-critical workloads,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “Today, we are excited to announce that this MainNet is open for business.”</p>
<p>“This is the network we need to accelerate adoption of passwordless zero trust ecosystems for enterprise customers” said Mike Vesey, President of <a href="https://idramp.com">IdRamp</a>, a leader in decentralized identity and a Genesis Node Operator on the Network. “Our customers are developing service delivery ecosystems that require world class support, and leading edge features managed by a team with deep technical experience. The Indicio network provides exactly that.”</p>
<p>“The Indicio Network enables GlobaliD to deliver a digital identity platform that puts you in control of your identity and your data,” says Mitja Simcic, CTO of <a href="https://global.id">GlobaliD</a>, one of the first companies to use Indicio’s MainNet. “Most digital identity platforms take ownership and control of your digital identity and your data for their own purposes. For instance, social media companies make money from selling your data to unauthorized third parties. Indicio is creating an ecosystem for providers that are working to make this practice obsolete. This network is bringing real change to real people, all over the world.”</p>
<p>The Value of Decentralized Identity<br>Decentralized identity allows individuals to control their own data and solves the privacy and security issues that undermine current models for handling identity online. This privacy-preserving model for identity, where everyone controls their own information, makes it easy for companies and organizations to comply with data privacy laws, makes business partner integrations more secure, and does away with the need for third-parties to manage and hold personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
<p>It is important to note that as part of Indicio’s <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-network-governance/">governance</a>, no personal data, such as names, addresses, or birth dates, are written to any of the Indicio Network ledgers. Instead, machine-readable cryptographic information identifies the issuer of the credential and the details that demonstrate the credential is authentic. With just a few writes to the Indicio MainNet, millions of credentials can be issued, all pointing to the same few ledger writes making the system easily scalable.</p>
<p>How to use the Indicio MainNet<br>Anyone using technology to verify a verifiable credential that is presented to them may access the Indicio MainNet for free. Several wallets currently in production now point to the Indicio Network, enabling credentials to be issued on, and read from, the Indicio Network.</p>
<p>Global innovators interested in becoming part of the Indicio Network are welcome to become an Indicio Node Operator. This diverse, supportive, and collaborative network of dynamic companies, work together to support a copy of the ledger while helping to advance decentralized identity. <a href="https://indicio.tech/node-operator-program/">Learn more</a> about the other benefits of becoming a Node Operator.</p>
<p>Finally, those that want to use the publicly available ledger as a platform for an identity solution may write directly to the Indicio Network. <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1xPes3CuyQqeGBbWU8FtrNQ4frvz">Go here</a> to learn more about how you can write to the Indicio Network today!</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to advancing decentralized identity, Indicio is committed to being a resource hub by providing enterprise-grade open source tools so that everyone can start building solutions today. In addition to the public MainNet, Indicio offers a TestNet, and builds <a href="https://indicio.tech/private-networks/">Private Networks</a>. Indicio’s customizable, instructor-led <a href="https://indicio.tech/training-packages/">training programs</a> are an excellent introduction to understanding how decentralized identity works, and scale to all levels of expertise.</p>
<p>A note on environmental impact<br>As a public benefit corporation, Indicio takes environmental impact seriously. The use of a distributed ledger in decentralized identity does not involve “proof of work” or mining, both of which entail substantial energy costs. Instead, with the optimal network size being 25 or fewer nodes, writing to the Indicio MainNet is energy comparable to logging into a website or sending a form. Much of the activity in a decentralized identity ecosystem takes place off ledger. This all makes decentralized identity a low-energy consumption practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>ABOUT US<br>Indicio.tech provides technology development services for decentralized identity, and offers a complete software ecosystem for business, consumer, and mobile applications to issue, verify, and exchange verifiable digital credentials. Founded on the belief in privacy and security by design, Indicio supports the open source and interoperability goals of the decentralized identity community.</p>
<p>As a Public Benefit Corporation, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a public good that enables people to control their identities online and share their data by consent. Identity and application teams rely on Indicio’s simplicity, extensibility, and expertise to make identity work for everyone.</p>

 Ocean Protocol smart contracts and Ocean Market are deployed on a low gas fees network with rapid community adoption <p>As part of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">Ocean’s multi-chain strategy</a>, we have partnered with <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> (formerly Matic) to bring Web3 Data Economy tools to their chain &amp; ecosystem. Polygon has seen widespread adoption with over 90 dApps, 7 Million transactions, and 200,000 unique users, enabling high-quality user experiences for top dApps like Polymarket, Aavegotchi, Decentral Games, and Neon District. Polygon also offers a strong alternative to the high gas fees on Ethereum, meeting a key goal for Q1 in our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2021-6875bc1f804f">2021&nbsp;roadmap</a>.</p><p>With Ocean deployed to Polygon, this&nbsp;means:</p>  People can use Ocean Market to publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in Polygon. Transactions now cost mere cents with lower latency. Users simply point their wallet in Metamask to Polygon, and Ocean Market will show data assets registered in the Polygon&nbsp;network.  Data marketplace builders and other dapp developers can use Ocean libraries (ocean.js, ocean.py) and frontend components (react hooks, market) with&nbsp;Polygon.  Token holders can <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge">move their OCEAN to Polygon as mOCEAN tokens</a> and&nbsp;back.  <p>Ocean components supported in Polygon include: Ocean smart contracts, Ocean Market, <a href="https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x282d8efCe846A88B159800bd4130ad77443Fa1A1/transactions">mOCEAN smart contract</a>, OCEAN-mOCEAN bridge, Provider (for data services), Aquarius (metadata cache), and Ocean Subgraph (The Graph queries). For more details, visit our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#polygon-mainnet">Supported Networks</a>&nbsp;page.</p><p>The Ocean Protocol deployment to Ethereum mainnet, and related services, including Ocean Market, will continue as&nbsp;before.</p> Cross-chain mental&nbsp;model <p>Prior to Polygon, Ocean Protocol was deployed on Ethereum Mainnet, Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Ganache. An Ocean Market user could change the network by pointing their wallet (e.g. Metamask) to a different network, and Ocean Market would show data assets that are on that network. Ocean.js and ocean.py drivers are similar; the dapp developer simply specifies the “network” URL.</p><p>It’s the same for&nbsp;Polygon.</p><p>Polygon is the first network beyond Ethereum Mainnet that isn’t a testnet, where tokens on the network have real value associated, so token bridges across networks have been&nbsp;built.</p>  OCEAN on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as mOCEAN on&nbsp;Polygon.  ETH for gas fees on Ethereum mainnet corresponds to MATIC for gas fees on&nbsp;Polygon.  ETH on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as mETH on Polygon, though you won’t need mETH for Ocean&nbsp;Market.   New Datasets and&nbsp;Services <p>People can choose to publish datasets and services in Ethereum or Polygon. With Ethereum, there are higher gas fees and confirmation latency, but in exchange, the UX and familiarity of users is high. For Polygon, the costs and latency are much lower, but users need to use the mOcean bridged&nbsp;tokens.</p> Prior-Published Datasets /&nbsp;Services <p>Let’s say a publisher has an existing dataset/service as an Ocean datatoken contract published on Ethereum, along with a pool of sizable liquidity. They shouldn’t just publish a new datatoken contract to Polygon for the same dataset /service. This would be highly unfair to their existing datatoken holders and stakers on Ethereum because value in the new token siphons value from the&nbsp;old.</p><p>Ideally, there would be bridges for datatokens, just like the bridge for OCEAN. This might seem like it would come out-of-the-box since datatokens follow the ERC20 standard, but alas, it doesn’t work because there are technical “gotchas” related to datatoken metadata and more. These issues are solvable and currently being worked on, but not in time for this first&nbsp;release.</p><p>In the meantime, we have a pragmatic workaround for publishers and stakers. We call it the Republish Rule.</p>  General principle: republishing datasets and services as a new datatoken into Polygon is not unfair if most liquidity has been removed from the datatoken’s pool in Ethereum (low vested interest in the datatoken).  Republish Rule: it’s ok for a publisher to republish a dataset/service as a new datatoken (and pool) in Polygon if there is less than 1000 OCEAN in the dataset/service pool in Ethereum mainnet. Conversely, if they publish while there’s still greater than 1000 OCEAN, this is not ok, and the publisher and the asset will get placed into <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">Ocean Market Purgatory</a>.  <p>This needs no further software implementation, as it uses the Ocean Market’s existing flows for purgatory. The community can flag assets breaking the republish rule, just as the community has already done for IP violations, sensitive data violations, etc.</p><p>The rule provides a natural incentive for stakers to remove their stake from Ethereum mainnet pools, so publishers can republish in Polygon and for the stakers to follow suit with staking on the&nbsp;new.</p> Further Resources on Ocean *&nbsp;Polygon   Ocean-related tokens and services in Polygon: <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#polygon-mainnet">https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#polygon-mainnet</a>  Tutorial on bridging OCEAN in Ethereum mainnet, to mOCEAN in Polygon: <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge">https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge</a>  mOCEAN contract in Polygon blockchain explorer <a href="https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x282d8efCe846A88B159800bd4130ad77443Fa1A1">https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x282d8efCe84</a>   Announcement Statements <p>“Polygon has a long history of collaboration with the Ethereum ecosystem with an eye towards scaling and security. The Polygon team has developed a first-class platform for running EVM-based contracts and bridging across chains. It’s our pleasure to leverage Polygon so that our users benefit from far lower gas costs in Ocean Market and in other emerging dapps &amp; protocols that use Ocean,” said Ocean Founder Trent McConaghy.</p><p>Sandeep Nailwal, Co-Founder and COO of Polygon, said, “We’re thrilled to have Ocean Protocol and their revolutionary data marketplace on Polygon. The Ocean Market will allow Dapps to build powerful marketplace-powered applications, leveraging the power of data and Polygon-grade transactions. We’re excited to see what devs&nbsp;build!”</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The OCEAN token is used to stake on data, govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability. OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">oceanprotocol.com</a> to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://blockfolio.com/coin/OCEAN_3">Blockfolio</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8TXwmWWAE9TZO0yTBHB3A">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ocean_protocol">Reddit</a> | <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram Chat</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">Discord</a></p> About Polygon (Formerly Matic) <p>Polygon is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development.

<p>(originally sent on Oct 28. <a href="http://eepurl.com/coMMKT">Subscribe to our newsletter now</a>)</p><p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>A major discussion we’ve been continuing internally is about how Bitmark can make the control of digital rights accessible (applicable) to everyone. As hard as we’ve worked in the areas of personal data, healthcare, music, and art, there remains a significant learning curve for most people to join in. Many of us in the United States are used to signing our rights away without really considering what we’re reading. That’s the way it&nbsp;is.</p><p>If you’re now told you should have better control over your rights and this [Bitmark] is a way to do so, it may not seem that obvious that you should care unless you already are someone who protects their rights at every opportunity — for example, maybe you refuse to use Facebook.</p><p>To be honest, most people are not in this bucket. While Bitmark believes in market solutions over well intended (but poorly executed) regulation, the market seemingly says rights are not important. Otherwise the US government wouldn’t be talking about Facebook in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/house-antitrust-committee-facebook-monopoly-buys-kills-competitors.html">monopolistic terms</a>.</p><p>Thus, I have a couple of asks of you this&nbsp;month:</p>  Where are you actively looking to have digital rights control? How could Bitmark&nbsp;help?  CEO Sean often tells me that Bitcoin is the first major success of giving users direct control over a digital asset where control (eg: transfer, subdivide) is based on cryptographic proof instead of trust. Along those lines, if you’re someone who’s passionate about BTC (the ethos behind it, not just a fan of making money from it), please reach out to me. I’d love to understand your relationship with BTC, your current frustrations.  <p>To respond, just reply to this&nbsp;email.</p><p>Continuing on with this question about accessibility, the Oct 19th iteration of the New York Times ON Tech Newsletter discussed what I feel is a way of taking away rights — simply don’t give people information on how to exercise them. I don’t mean the following situation was malicious in intent, but we know that people who need rights the most are the ones most unable to access them. In our first project in public health with UC Berkeley years ago, I remember learning that health research is made up primarily of middle aged white men because they have the resources to access health services, learn of opportunities, time to participate without affecting home life, and the least to lose in terms of potential privacy leaks. The people who could benefit the most from clinical trial research or better decision making from public health institutions were the very people being excluded!</p><p>So I present to you: A new<a href="https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/9DDbf-9Xs2GjjHxABXMsTg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhcD2cP0TBaHR0cHM6Ly9jZW50cmVjb3VudHl2b3Rlcy5jb20vP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTE1OCZlbWM9ZWRpdF9vdF8yMDIwMTAxOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0yMzI3MyZubD1vbi10ZWNoLXdpdGgtc2hpcmEtb3ZpZGUmcmVnaV9pZD05MjQyNzgxNiZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTQxNTAzJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD0xYzc4ZDI0OTU5NmI5YzBiNTFjYzcyOGJiMDI1MmE1YVcDbnl0QgoALJy4jV-hWhosUhNtaWNoYWVsQGJpdG1hcmsuY29tWAQAAAAA"> election information website for Centre County, Pa</a>., that’s as easy to use as your favorite shopping&nbsp;site.</p><p>That’s it.

He was quoted costs of up to $40,000, he said. The county paid nothing for the election services that U.S. Digital Response volunteers helped&nbsp;create.</p><p>Now, about 1,000 people a day visit Centre County’s election website, Pipe said. “It’s been about saving personnel time and a better customer service experience for our residents,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>“You can’t do public policy if you can’t make the damn website work,” is how<a href="https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/pZt4wiAVbJiQpFlwDInaSw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhcD2cP0TcaHR0cHM6Ly9iZWVja2NlbnRlci5nZW9yZ2V0b3duLmVkdS9wZXJzb24vcm9iaW4tY2FybmFoYW4vP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTE1OCZlbWM9ZWRpdF9vdF8yMDIwMTAxOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0yMzI3MyZubD1vbi10ZWNoLXdpdGgtc2hpcmEtb3ZpZGUmcmVnaV9pZD05MjQyNzgxNiZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTQxNTAzJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD0xYzc4ZDI0OTU5NmI5YzBiNTFjYzcyOGJiMDI1MmE1YVcDbnl0QgoALJy4jV-hWhosUhNtaWNoYWVsQGJpdG1hcmsuY29tWAQAAAAA"> Robin Carnahan</a>, a former Missouri secretary of state who is helping lead U.S. Digital Response’s election projects, put it to&nbsp;me.</p><p>Pipe said this is his 18th election as a county commissioner, and it’s a doozy. He said the new website, with clear information and election returns, is also a way for officials to build faith among voters in a year with lots of misinformation and mistrust about the election&nbsp;process.</p><p>In the United States, it took over a hundred years before everyone had the same, equal right to vote. But that hasn’t stopped some from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/24/861776313/federal-judge-rules-florida-law-restricting-voting-rights-for-felons-unconstitut">making it harder for some groups </a>to do so or basically <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/19/903886567/trump-while-attacking-mail-voting-casts-mail-ballot-again">restricting the access</a> to the right if not the right&nbsp;itself.</p><p>This has made me think, shouldn’t equal accessibility to a right be a right, not just the right itself? In the Bitmark sense, we can’t be satisfied with “build it and they will come”. We have to come to you, hold your hand, work with you — whatever it takes to give you the help you&nbsp;deserve.</p><p>Bitmark news and in the&nbsp;news:</p><p>Press</p>  [Chinese] Sean’s Op-ED in DIGITIMES talking about the collaboration with UC Berkeley on the Autonomy community health app:<a href="https://www.digitimes.com.tw/iot/article.asp?cat=158&amp;cat1=20&amp;cat2=25&amp;id=0000596558_6OY6OXAM4BD6NE9S7XPXY">【Sean Moss-Pultz專欄】台灣經驗激靈感 區塊鏈助柏克萊「自由」防疫</a>”  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cateinbigcity/posts/2721520034784658">Sean’s talk with Anchor Catherine Lu</a>.  <p>Our Hope in Crisis Podcast with Girls in Tech&nbsp;Taiwan</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjkISTTSEZI">How a software engineer can influence country’s policies ft.

Understanding GlobaliD’s vision <p>RealVision’s Santiago Velez <a href="https://www.realvision.com/shows/the-interview-crypto/videos/globalid-the-age-of-digital-identity?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=2021312_Crypto_MR_TW_W1_LINK">conducted a super interview with Greg Kidd</a> — and the end result is the best overview we have at the moment of GlobaliD’s vision.</p><p>Here’s an&nbsp;excerpt:</p><blockquote>Very frankly, we’re not excited about, maybe you like hitting ads, I hate that. We hate ads. We don’t believe the world should be built on advertising where the person is turned into the product. But we want people to make money. And so, our alternative vision, and we’re seeing it now with what we call monetization of content, or just NFTs, it’s non-fungible tokens.</blockquote><blockquote>People are willing to pay, they pay for subscriptions to things to get access to data, they pay per view, and they’ll just pay, and they might tip, they might pay for one time use, they might pay for ongoing use. But we see that the economic rights of content or the economic rights of things can be built into those things with lightweight smart contracts. I don’t need to go to Netflix to find out about some good movie on. Oprah will tell me about&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>I saw it on Oprah’s Instagram account, and I clicked on the link. And because I have an identity with a wallet attached to it, either custodial or noncustodial, and Oprah has a wallet and the creator has a wallet, that’s a flat world, and no ads. You could say that me listening to Oprah that Oprah is advertising but that’s not how I see it, I’m just listening to the people or listening to the causes I want. And if they mentioned some content that’s interesting to me, it’s a process of discovery, not advertising.</blockquote><blockquote>And that world can be very flat. It doesn’t mean we have to get rid of the intermediaries. If they really have such a great search engine, but I hate the concept that there’s all these silos and if I have to find the Beatles, I have to go here, because these guys locked it up, or I want to watch the Tour de France and I found out all the exclusive rights were sold to one entity. I’m like,&nbsp;why?</blockquote><blockquote>For all these things with great content, just let the creator create tickets or access and maybe it’s people in the movie that are advertising them. Anywhere you discover content, and you want to watch it, if there’s a model that lets that person who wants to pay for it, pay and reward the creator, and potentially the distributor, just embed those rights directly in the content. So, while we’re talking about GlobaliD for people and groups, things have identity too. Like a lot of diamonds, they last a lot longer than us people. We come and go, but that diamond ring is going to be one hand after another over generations.</blockquote><blockquote>So, put the economic rights into the things. But once again, from a regulation point of view, things ultimately are controlled by people or groups. There’s an ultimate beneficial owner. You could have title registries that don’t have owners in them but that’s silly, like, oh, here’s this great title registry of houses and cars. Well, who’s behind all those? Oh, we don’t know. But it’s really, really efficient, and&nbsp;slick.</blockquote><blockquote>And I’m like, okay, those guns and badges guys, they don’t like that stuff. Yes, technologically, that’s possible but we live still in a world of law and ethics. And so, these trustless systems that don’t have any identity but that are technologically efficient, it’s like that saying “ready, fire, aim”. Just because you can do it, it doesn’t mean you should do&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>And so, we really love all these new defi and registries and title this and non-fungible token that, monetization of content, but on behalf of who? And without identity, you’re back to like the Mad Max world. Why should I give you this? Well, my gun is bigger than yours, or I have bullets and you don’t. Well, okay, that’s a world we can live in. It’s fun to go to the movie theater and see Mad Max, but that’s not the world I want to live in at the end of the&nbsp;day.</blockquote><blockquote>And I want everybody, everybody to have a seat at that table. It doesn’t matter where you are on the economic spectrum, everybody has a right and a responsibility to an identity so they can transact in this world and be equally empowered. It doesn’t matter if you’re the richest or poorest person, like when you need that horse because you got to get out of town, you either have the authentication and the authority to do it, or you don’t and we want that to be a level playing for everyone.</blockquote><p>Check out the full interview:</p>  <a href="https://www.realvision.com/shows/the-interview-crypto/videos/globalid-the-age-of-digital-identity?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=2021312_Crypto_MR_TW_W1_LINK">Globalid: The Age of Digital Identity | Real&nbsp;Vision</a>  <p>Also relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCU32JjOj0A">Greg Kidd: Global Investment Trends for New&nbsp;Unicorns</a>   2.

During his campaign, Mr. Biden said he would be open to breaking up tech companies.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Wu has warned about the consequences of too much power in the hands of a few companies and said the nation’s economy resembled the Gilded Age of the late&nbsp;1800s.</blockquote><blockquote>“Extreme economic concentration yields gross inequality and material suffering, feeding the appetite for nationalistic and extremist leadership,” Mr. Wu wrote in his 2018 book, “The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded&nbsp;Age.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Most visible in our daily lives is the great power of the tech platforms, especially Google, Facebook and Amazon,” he&nbsp;added.</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Wu was a contributing writer for The Times before dropping that position for his appointment to the White&nbsp;House.</blockquote><blockquote>His role, with a focus on competition policy, will be a new one in the National Economic Council. Mr. Wu will also focus on competition in labor policy, such as noncompete clauses enforced by companies, and concentration in power in agriculture and the drug industry. The job does not require Senate approval.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-tech-critics-tim-wu-lina-khan-68af4526-8bd6-48f1-9fe9-f75da80f547b.html">Biden gives tech’s toughest critics seats at the policy&nbsp;table</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcMRr0frKj0">Sorry, Apple: Government Stepping&nbsp;Ina!</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/what-big-tech-antitrust-foe-lina-khan-could-do-at-the-ftc">What Big Tech Antitrust Foe Lina Khan Could Do at the&nbsp;FTC</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-tech-breakups-could-be-good-for-shareholders-the-informations-tech-briefing">Why Tech Breakups Could Be Good for Shareholders: The Information’s Tech&nbsp;Briefing</a>   4.

<p>Gimly is participating in the European SSI  infrastructure programme (eSSIf-lab), building a bridge for the implementation of NFC smartcards with secure elements as physical SSI identifiers. Our aim is to enable self-sovereign identity for both online and offline identification, authorization and access management, with a decreased dependency on the use of personal smartphones. Example use cases may include  private health records (including corona test and vaccination status), eID cards with eIDAS compliant signatures, or enterprise employee authorisations, access management and transactions. </p>
<p>The bridge will be blockchain and did-method agnostic to allow for easy integration of SSI smartcards in any SSI solution. The smartcards hold an NFC microchip with an EAL6+ grade secure element for authentication and signing with their embedded DID and can be used for sovereign storage and selective disclosure of verifiable credentials. While the first smartcards to be supported are <a href="https://www.gimly.io/tangem-by-gimly">Tangem made-for-blockchain NFC cards</a>, we welcome any producer of smartcards that meet the hardware, firmware, and security requirements for SSI functionality in our open-source project.</p>
<p>Open source, ecosystems, and collaboration are the drivers in SSI and in our NFC bridge. We are looking forward to collaborating with Sphereon, our partners in SSI, and with all participants in the eSSIf-lab programme or other partners in the SSI ecosystem to ensure compatibility of the NFC bridge with their SSI stack.  </p>

 Achieving Change At&nbsp;Scale <p>This is the third in a series of blogs providing edited extracts from Mydex CIC’s response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>.</p><p>The first focused on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of personal data</a>, the second on why <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store</a>. This blog explains why this strategy can be quick and easy to implement.</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>In some peoples’ minds, the idea that every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store generates visions of massively costly, risky and time-consuming IT projects that invariably overrun in terms of both time and money while failing to deliver their promises (the sad but common experience of many centralised Government IT projects).</p><p>Providing individuals with their own personal data store is not one of these projects. In fact, because it implements a completely different model, it avoids these problems.</p> How to make it&nbsp;happen <p>Providing every citizen with a personal data store does not require a massively high cost, high risk IT procurement process. To the contrary, the strategy can be pursued in a way that minimises costs, risk and disruptions, and builds momentum incrementally. For example, the strategy identified <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/">by the Scottish Government</a>:</p>  Builds on what already exists. Organisations already hold huge amounts of data about citizens, including verified attributes. All they have to do is electronically share some of this data when requested. Providing individuals with personal data stores does not stop organisations from collecting and using data to provide valuable services. Rather, it builds on their expertise and infrastructure to add a new, additional layer of capabilities and infrastructure.  <p>Verified Attributes are already used widely and frequently in the provision of public services. Citizens are already required to present proofs about themselves using documents provided by other parties (e.g. passport, driving licence, bank statement, official letter etc). Providing individuals with a personal data store so that they can separately store and share Verified Attributes about themselves simply enables the same things to happen digitally, safely and securely in a more efficient manner.</p>  Minimises risk and disruption. Providing individuals with a personal data store does not require any significant changes to existing back office systems, or to organisations’ processes, culture, business models or operations. Personal data stores add a new connecting element that ‘joins the dots’ between previously separate data silos, where the personal data stores acts as a node for citizen-controlled information sharing. This does not require the dots themselves to change what they do or how they&nbsp;operate.  Builds momentum automatically and incrementally Roll-out can proceed incrementally, taking one particular service at a time, allowing for a test-and-learn approach that builds momentum and impact over time. This avoids big leaps into the unknown. Incremental adoption can be built-in to small, additional process changes. For example, by minting digital copies of birth certificates during the certificate creation process and placing them into the child’s attribute/personal data store, the Government could create a system that provides every individual with a personal data store from birth, and which builds momentum over&nbsp;time.  Generates compelling win-wins to gain active buy-in. Using Verified Attributes to improve the quality and cut the costs of public service provision generates powerful win-wins between service providers and citizens (who will find applying for and accessing these services much quicker and easier than before). As the richness of the data held in each individuals’ personal data store grows, incentives for other organisations to connect to the system also&nbsp;grow.  Sets the right course for the future, pump-priming further developments. Even as this approach enables improvement of prioritised services now, along the way, it also builds the infrastructure and capabilities to further improve these and other services as momentum&nbsp;builds.   Central Government’s role <p>In saying that every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store, we are not suggesting they should be provided directly by the Government via some new centralised, nationalised personal data store authority. Multiple different, competing providers can and should offer personal data store services, so long as they conform to an essential set of design principles (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>The particular role that only the Government can fulfil is to break a collective action logjam that currently blocks progress. This collective action problem is simple to state: while every service provider using data wants to be able to access more reliable data, more quickly and cheaply, none has any immediate incentive in making the data they hold available to others. Why should Organisation A invest time and effort helping Organisation B cut their costs and improve their outcomes?</p><p>But if all such organisations made key data points available via the citizen’s personal data store, all of them would benefit from the ability to access this data. Government can, and should, break this logjam by mandating public services to share Verified Attributes for free via personal data stores in public services. This approach can also solve some internal data logistics and distribution issues and reduce internal operating costs and help eradicate use of paper and contribute to net zero&nbsp;targets.</p> Design principles <p>For such a mass-scale personal data store infrastructure to work at scale however, it needs to operate by design principles that ensure its integrity. Learning from experience since our founding in 2007 we have identified what these key design principles are:</p>  Fiduciary duty Personal data stores should be required to work in the best interests of their clients — the citizens.  Neutral and enabling Personal data store infrastructure should not be designed or used so as to favour one party’s vested interests over another (e.g. one data controller or relying&nbsp;party).  Distributed, not centralised Each personal data store should be uniquely and separately encrypted and held by individuals for individuals. They should not result in the creation of a new centralised database holding all citizens’ data.  Zero-knowledge operations Personal data stores should not look into or seek to influence how individuals use their data. Their job is to promote and enable citizen agency, not to seek to control or influence citizens in any particular direction.  Aligned incentives Personal data stores’ business models should be structured so that they have no financial incentives to monetise, manipulate or seek control over individuals’ data or their uses of this data. They should earn their money from infrastructure provision and related services.  Separation of storage from use Personal data stores should focus on the provision of infrastructure enabling citizens to collect, store and share their data and should not seek to use this data to provide data-driven services (e.g. to provide financial advice, treat a medical condition, or assess an individual’s eligibility for a service). By enabling service providers to access individuals’ data (with permission) the role of the infrastructure is to enable more service providers to better access and use more, richer data in order to provide better, cheaper services.  Committed to interoperability Citizens should not be ‘locked in’ to any particular provider of personal data stores. It should be part of the duty and responsibility of personal data stores to enable interoperability to enable sharing of data between individuals and organisations and to enable individuals to move from one PDS provider to&nbsp;another.  Universality Every citizen should have access to their own personal data store (their own ‘running data’ as it were), just as every citizen should have access to ‘running water’ and ‘running electricity’.  Independence For privacy protection and independence reasons, personal data stores should not be owned or controlled by the state or under the control of existing service-providing data controllers.  Built to last Personal data store providers should have built-in safeguards against changes to role, functions and priorities — for instance, in the case of a change of leadership, stock market listing, merger, sale, acquisition or bankruptcy.  <p>The EU has already embraced many of these principles in its <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/vindicated-cb897fb4e94b">new Data Governance Act</a>. The UK should do the&nbsp;same.</p> Unleashing a positive feedback&nbsp;loop <p>Every now and again, as societies and economies evolve, a need arises for citizens to be equipped with new capabilities.</p><p>In the late nineteenth and early 20th centuries a need emerged for public sanitation to secure public health and for all children to learn how to read and write. Similar advances soon followed: universal access to running water, universal access to electricity, and universal access to basic health services.</p><p>Each of these advances improved personal wellbeing, making individuals’ lives easier and better.

			 The Knock-on Impact of NFT Tokens Going Mainstream 
<p>As we’ve seen with the recent activity amongst crypto tokens and now with NFTs, 2021 is shaping up to be the year blockchain-based tokens go mainstream.</p>
<p>The flavour of the month is Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). They have hit the headlines as major artists and celebrities around the world announced their plans to use tokens to represent their creations. People are willing to pay big bucks for these NFTs, with one collector even selling a digital artwork of Joe Biden and Donald Trump nude for $6.6 million! Popular musicians such as the Kings of Leon and Lindsay Lohan have also jumped on the bandwagon.</p>
 But, What Are NFTs? 
<p>NFTs are blockchain-based tokens with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. In the world today, non-fungible items are typically items such as real assets, diamonds, collectable cards or even artwork. NFTs are digital representations of these items with code that verifies their authenticity. Just as diamonds may come with an accepted certificate of authenticity, NFTs digitally associate authenticity and rights to assets or items, such as digital art. In the same way jewellers accept certificates of authenticity for diamonds, consumers are beginning to accept NFTs as acceptable authentications of digital art.</p>
 NFTs vs Security Tokens 
<p>This notion of associating authenticity and/or rights to an item is also applied in the realm of security tokens. In the same way NFTs associate rights with digital certificates (tokens), security tokens associate rights on the asset, i.e. ensuring that only eligible investors can hold the specific token. Whilst NFTs and crypto-tokens are going mainstream as we speak, the security markets will naturally move more slowly due to the surrounding regulation. That being said, we can see an acceleration occurring with security tokens, encouraged by all the legislation passed recently.</p>

<p>Since the AERGO mainnet upgraded to 2.0 update in late 2019, we have been working hard to enhance both the usability and stability of the AERGO network to prepare for mainstream adoption.</p> Building the Foundation <p>In 2020, we saw the introduction of AERGO Enterprise 2.0 with enhanced performance and a more enterprise-friendly user experience, as well as AERGO Agora to better decentralize the network and empower the AERGO community. The introduction benefited both the individual AERGO community members expecting more usage and utility for the native tokens, and the prospective enterprise clients who desire a more stable, decentralized environment that can be used to process serious workloads.</p><p>Earlier this year, we launched the closed beta service for AERGO Hub, a utility computing center built around AERGO, meant to replace more traditional PaaS (Platform as a Service) implementations.</p><p>All those developments precipitated into building a solid foundation required for the serious enterprise adoption of blockchain technology and now we believe we are ready for rapid expansion.</p> Our Vision for&nbsp;2021 <p>With a fully functional mainnet and a rich set of utilities to ease the adoption process, we intend to push the mainnet utilization to its theoretical limit by bringing a plethora of applications and use cases into our ecosystem this&nbsp;year.</p><p>In order to achieve this, we are announcing collaborations with two additional second party partners into our network to accelerate both the business and the technical sides of the AERGO ecosystem.</p><p>“Devroos” is a new entity based in Korea, introduced by a former Blocko co-founder and CISO Hochul Seok (the lead architect behind the AERGO Agora effort.) Devroos means to function as a more specialized, business-development vehicle for the AERGO project with a heavy focus on public relations. Devroos will strive to discover strategic opportunities for AERGO and help us make key investments in order to boost our ecosystem.</p><p>“Onmydev” is a new tech team founded by Hunyoung Park, the current CTO of AERGO and the lead architect behind AERGO mainnet technology. Onmydev will supplement our core team by bringing DevOps and cloud technology specialists into our workforce.</p><p>The two entities will work in tandem with Blocko, which will continue to serve as our core technology and business development partner in the enterprise area.</p><p>With the Devroos and Onmydev team in our network, AERGO will be able to seek a much broader range of opportunities and a stronger focus on B2C and&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>“Blocko” continues to be one of our important technology partner that has incorporated AERGO into their core products, AERGO Enterprise, AERGO Enterprise Manager, and DTT TSA. Blocko will be the source for corporate deployments and real life applications of&nbsp;AERGO.</p> Accelerate <p>We plan to accelerate the adoption of AERGO and boost our mainnet utilization with the help of the Devroos&nbsp;team.</p>  App and Service Incubation  <p>Starting with our investment in CCCV (<a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-to-award-the-first-incubation-investment-to-cccv-63794ccfd96">https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-to-award-the-first-incubation-investment-to-cccv-63794ccfd96</a>), we are launching an all-year-long effort to introducing second-parties to build crucial apps and services for AERGO that are meant for general consumption.</p><p>Those apps and services will integrate tightly with AERGO mainnet and test the limits of our technology.</p>  Community Acceleration  <p>We will be hosting a number of events and opportunities for the general public to propose/build applications and help them with the resources and network required to be successful.</p><p>We are in communication with key/strategic partners to provide more opportunities for those applications, including a chance to be listed/integrated into a global wallet provider.</p>  Enterprise Integration  <p>We will be working with Blocko to bring enterprise applications and workloads onto AERGO&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>AERGO will play a central role in DTT alliance (<a href="https://en.blocko.io/dtt/">https://en.blocko.io/dtt/</a>) by providing a high-performance, readily usable blockchain network that can be readily&nbsp;used.</p> Development <p>With the help from Onmydev team, we will be making key enhancements to better support apps and services built on AERGO technology, paving the way for the general adoption of our technology.</p>  App Portal  <p>Building on the concept introduced by AERGO Hub, we will be launching a dedicated starting page for AERGO users, which will serve as both a control panel and an app store to discover and access AERGO apps and services.</p><p>Our app and service incubation program, as well as the community acceleration initiative, will play a crucial role in seeding the App Portal with important apps.</p><p>The App portal will be a two way channel where both DApp developers and users can interact with each other. By introducing features such as DApp registration, categorisation, advertisement and wallet based authentication, the App Portal will allow users to search and find Dapps while Dapp developers can acquire users efficiently. In this way, we hope the app portal will maximise the utilisation of AERGO&nbsp;mainnet.</p>  Mobile Support  <p>AERGO wallet support will expand from the current desktop-based experience to accommodate mobiles apps — opening up the possibility of building mobile apps/websites making use of AERGO technology.</p><p>Our mobile wallet will be fully integrated with the App Portal to allow accessing vital functionalities including participating in governance and BP selection process.</p><p>Important features to be developed include; storage of native AERGO tokens, access to the AERGO Portal easily, easy swap service and integration with the App&nbsp;Portal</p>  Hardware Integration  <p>The hardware wallet support for our native tokens will be enhanced, allowing not only the users, but potential crypto exchanges to interface our mainnet tokens directly as&nbsp;well.</p><p>We see this development as a crucial step in allowing more liquidity into our native tokens, enabling a more diverse range of applications/services to be built on top of our mainnet technology.</p> The Roadmap for&nbsp;2021 <p>In order to realise our vision in 2021, we have outlined our roadmap for 2021 as&nbsp;follows.</p> Our Promises <p>We will work hard to bring “the year of AERGO mainnet adoption” to reality. This will be a joint effort not only between our first party and second party partners, but with the community as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Up to 10% of global GDP could be stored on blockchains by 2025, according to the World Economic Forum (<a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Building-Blockchains.pdf">http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Building-Blockchains.pdf</a>.) and I believe the only way for the decentralized future to come to reality is by helping enterprises adopt blockchain.</p><p>Join the journey and help us shape the future of enterprise blockchain.</p><p>AERGO Team</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-2021-vision-and-roadmap-2d4ab015a31d">AERGO 2021: Vision and Roadmap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) is an established area within IAM. Since the early days of Identity Provisioning some 20 years ago, more and more vendors have entered that market, and technologies have matured. However, 20 years of maturity are a lot for IT, also indicating that some concepts may benefit from modernization. 
 In his talk, Martin Kuppinger will look at four areas:

  <p>IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) is an established area within IAM. Since the early days of Identity Provisioning some 20 years ago, more and more vendors have entered that market, and technologies have matured. However, 20 years of maturity are a lot for IT, also indicating that some concepts may benefit from modernization.</p>
<p>In his talk, Martin Kuppinger will look at four areas:</p>
 
 What is the right approach for future IGA deployment models? 
 What must change in role and entitlement management, to remain complaint but reduce complexity and workload? 
 How to reduce the workload in access reviews/recertification while getting better in compliance and concrete risk mitigation? 
 How to move to the next level in customization, orchestration, and integration, without staying in fear of the next major update?

<p>As consumers demand more responsible practices from companies, governments and global organizations are taking&nbsp;action.</p><p>Over the past few years, we have seen an increasing number of regulations come out related to responsible sourcing and supply chain management. These standards play an important part in the adoption of ethical practices and are essential to our sustainable future. In this article, we summarize the main regulations and standards shaping the metal and minerals industry.</p><p>The first, and most recent standard is the <a href="https://coppermark.org/multi-metal-coalition-publishes-joint-standard-to-respond-to-lme-responsible-sourcing-rules/">Joint Due Diligence Standard for Copper, Lead, Nickel and Zinc</a>. We wrote more about this in a recent <a href="https://peerledger.com/blog-posts/2021/3/3/new-joint-due-diligence-standard-for-copper-lead-nickel-and-zinc">blog post</a>, but in short the standard comes into play in 2023 and will impact producers, traders, and extractors of these metals by requiring them to adopt a responsible supply chain management system.</p><p>The <a href="https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/march/tradoc_155423.pdf">EU Conflict Minerals Regulation</a> is another recent regulation that came into effect in January 2021. The standard affects anyone involved in the trade of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (the 3TGs), and is mostly focused on conflict affected and high-risk areas. The aim of the regulation is to ensure that the sales of metals and minerals are not supporting armed groups and human rights violations. It will require companies and individuals within certain requirements to carry out due diligence on their supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> is a financial reform legislation in the US that was passed in 2010, and it includes requirements related to conflict minerals. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf">Section 1502</a> of the Dodd-Frank Act requires companies to evaluate and disclose their use of conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and neighbouring countries on an annual basis, with the goal of creating a responsible compliance and assurance framework.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/OECD-Due-Diligence-Guidance-Minerals-Edition3.pdf">OECD Due Diligence Guidance</a> for responsible supply chains provides recommendations to help companies respect human rights, and targets companies sourcing metals and/or minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. The five step framework is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Establish strong company management systems  Identify and assess risk in the supply&nbsp;chain  Design and implement a strategy to respond to identify&nbsp;risks  Carry out independent third-party audit of supply chain due diligence at identified points in the supply&nbsp;chain  Report on supply chain due diligence  <p>The last standard we will look at is the <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/responsible-gold/conflict-free-gold-standard">Conflict-Free Gold Standard</a> which was set by the World Gold Council. The standard gives gold producers an approach to assess and provide assurance that their gold is responsibly sourced and extracted, and does not contribute to armed conflict or human rights&nbsp;abuse.</p><p>Many of these regulations and standards require a technology solution to support their efforts. Our <a href="https://peerledger.com/supply-chain">MIMOSI Connect</a> supply chain traceability system gives companies a trusted, immutable record of transactions, documents and metrics across their entire supply chain, and enables them to easily comply with regulations related to responsible sourcing. There will always be new regulations coming into play and our flexible solution is a great tool to make sharing your ethical practices easy.</p> References   The Copper Mark (February 9, 2021), Multi-metal Coalition Publishes Joint Standard to Respond to LME Responsible Sourcing Rules.

<p>To: Bitmark Investors &amp; Advisors<br>From: Sean Moss-Pultz</p><p>Note: This article series is taken from Sean’s quarterly letters to Bitmark investors. We share them publicly one quarter after they are written to give everyone a deeper, transparent look at Bitmark’s perspective of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Dear Investors &amp;&nbsp;Advisors</p><p>Bitcoin appears to be emerging from the trough of despair. The fundamentals are looking strong. Taproot, one of the most important improvements to the Core Protocol, was merged. That will enable more flexible (and private) smart contracts when activated. Or price, if that’s your signal, is again back to nosebleed levels. When Trump was elected in 2016, Bitcoin was $700. At the start of Q3 it was around $11,000. Now it’s over&nbsp;$26,000.</p><p>Behind this excitement is an institutional story for Bitcoin. Microstrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) bought $425MM worth of Bitcoin in Q3. Their CEO says <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=ff33eb5671&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">Bitcoin will be their primary treasury reserve asset</a>. Square Inc. (NYSE: SQ) generated $1.63 billion in bitcoin revenue and $32 million in bitcoin gross profit during Q3 from their mobile payments Cash App. This is 11 times more in bitcoin revenue than Q2. In their earnings call, CEO Jack Dorsey said, “We believe [bitcoin] will be the native currency of the Internet, and help people thrive around the world and the economy.” Square also announced it has <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=7b00ad18c8&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">invested $50MM in Bitcoin</a>. Again, touting that Bitcoin is “an instrument of economic empowerment and provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system, which aligns with the company’s purpose.”</p><p>While Square’s $50MM bitcoin bet pales in comparison to MicroStrategy’s $425MM, it’s arguably more important as a forcing function for other financial institutions. JPMorgan said “other payment companies will also likely follow in Square’s footsteps or risk getting shut out of a growing segment.” which is exactly <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=aaeac391d9&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">what PayPal did</a>. Their entire network of more than 26 million merchants can now use&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin is a demographic mega-trend led by younger age groups — 18% of Gen Z and millennials already own Bitcoin. To put the millennial proclivity in perspective: Only 37% of people under 35 are invested in the stock market. By the way, if you want to see a beautifully simple introduction to Bitcoin you should read “<a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=4c11efecb9&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">My First Bitcoin</a>” from&nbsp;Square.</p><p>JPMorgan sees Bitcoin’s increasing use as an alternative to gold as being amplified by millennials. “Even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from&nbsp;here.”</p><p>It’s worth noting that the biggest US bank’s CEO Jamie Dimon said, back in 2017, that bitcoin was a “fraud” and that, “If you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it one day.” As Bob Dylan would sing, “The Times They Are A Changing”.</p><p>Fidelity announced they are getting ready to launch a Bitcoin fund. They explain their perspective for holding this asset in their <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=f3bfd48f3c&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">Bitcoin Investment Thesis</a>. For a fund with $3.3T under management, this is a truly shocking position. If even 5% of their clients participate the overall impact would be staggering.</p><p>Closer to home, Grayscale, a wholly owned subsidiary of one of our investors DCG, said that they attracted $1B in new capital in Q3. That was 1.5x the capital it raised throughout 2019. What’s equally exciting is that 84% of inflows came from institutional investors.</p><p>By this point I hope you’re thinking, “What exactly is the institutional case for bitcoin?” Some people like to describe bitcoin as a hedge against central banking. Right now the US central bank is running an unprecedented experiment injecting trillions of fiat money into the global economic system. How you think that ends says a lot about how you look at longtail risk in an increasingly unpredictable environment.</p><p>Having a hedge against central banking makes sense. It’s like having home insurance. You pay a small price now so that if disaster does happen you’re prepared.</p><p>Yet, Personally, I think something deeper is going&nbsp;on.</p><p>Institutions can be understood as mechanisms which govern the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community. In computing, a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities to transmit information. In the digital environment, protocols can create new institutions because they can redefine the rules, syntax, semantics of transactions between parties. I believe we are witnessing a fundamental change in how institutions will operate. I believe we will see new institutions emerge that can better address the needs of a global, digital&nbsp;economy.</p><p>If you asked me I would say the reason institutions see value in bitcoin is because enough people inside them understand bitcoin as a protocol — an integrated system of algorithmic rules that can structure social interactions. They see a chance to fix some really fundamental problems.</p><p>How does this play out? Like most technologically driven change, it will be very slow for some time and then wickedly fast. Institutions almost never want to be first. But it’s equally as true that they don’t want to be last. This snowball will get huge as more and more institutions embrace&nbsp;bitcoin.</p><p>Make no mistake, bitcoin is not (just) money. It’s an alternative financial system in disguise. Bitcoin will not replace banks anymore than the Internet replaced the phone or the cable companies. But it can radically change them for the better. The shift from trust to cryptographic proof will be profound.</p><p>Even with COVID-19 and the political divisions, I’m quite optimistic about the future. Financial institutions embracing Bitcoin means that there is a path to build a more transparent financial future. And if improvements can be made to financial institutions, then other institutions will swallow this pill, too. I would not be surprised if recording value without using a blockchain will be seen as luddite within a&nbsp;decade.</p><p>That’s the macro view. Let me share what this means to Bitmark. In Q3, we spotted a great opportunity for us to build a mobile app and personal data server that makes individual control of Bitcoin safe and easy. I will call this a “Crypto Wallet” from here onward. But please keep in mind that it’s actually a lot more than that. The personal server component, unique to our architecture, will play a critical role in realizing our mission of giving individuals control over all their&nbsp;data.</p><p>In case you don’t use Bitcoin, a “Wallet” is what we call the app that stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins. It’s quite the misnomer. Unlike a physical wallet that actually holds things, a Bitcoin wallet stores the digital credentials for you to access (and spend) and spend your bitcoins. The actual bitcoins are in the cloud — they are inseparable from the blockchain transaction ledger.</p><p>The Bitcoin network uses public-key cryptography for access control. Once you have a bitcoin that is issued (by the miners), all subsequent use is with bearer objects. Control of that bitcoin can be transferred or subdivided to others who can satisfy the requirements of the script (based on either public or private keys) associated with that bitcoin. At its most basic, a Bitcoin wallet is a collection of these&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Managing these keys continues to be one of the most difficult tasks in information security. We are nowhere near a user experience that can go mainstream. People, like me, that do it ourselves have become a bit more experienced and a lot more numb to the risks. When I talk to people that are new to bitcoin they are baffled and bewildered by all of&nbsp;this.</p><p>Most individuals when they understand the problem of key management simply give up and let central intermediaries like Coinbase do it for them. That weakens the security and privacy architecture in Bitcoin. Centralizing keys has led to incidents where exchanges have lost their customers’ assets and then “<a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=8f5b059941&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">compensated</a>” them with an exchange token. (Aka “Shitcoin”.)</p><p>Crypto Wallets are necessary to secure all types of digital assets, not just money. OurBeat is actually a cryptographic wallet and server infrastructure for beats. In our work with Pfizer and UC Berkeley, it became clear that a cryptographic wallet is also critical for advancing the future of healthcare. Right now our data is trapped in institutional silos. If individuals could control their own data they could exchange it directly with institutions for better services. Right now when an institution wants access to your health data they need to contract with other institutions. Competing commercial interests oftentimes prohibits access. As we showed with Pfizer, going direct to the individual radically simplifies that flow. Giving individuals control over their digital assets also helps the bottom line: Compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR are trivial; the transaction is “peer-to-peer”.</p><p>This is why Bitmark is building a mobile app and personal data server to make individual control of digital assets safe and easy. The initial architecture makes individual control over Bitcoin keys safe and easy. This might be surprising to many of you. A fair question to ask is, “Does the world need another bitcoin wallet?” Probably not. However, that misses the point, unless you understand our larger plan. The mission of Bitmark is to give individuals control over their own data. Bitcoin has the biggest user base that pays for control over their data (digital assets). There’s at least 60 million active Bitcoin wallets. These users suffer from complicated and unsafe key management. Bitmark can solve this problem and, in the process, drive down costs and optimize the technology to provide control over any type of data. We can then go down market from Bitcoin users and give individuals control over things they never dreamed possible.</p><p>So in short, the master plan&nbsp;is:</p>  Build a crypto wallet and personal server architecture that makes individual control of Bitcoin safe and&nbsp;easy.  Extend that architecture to provide control of Facebook data. Experiment with ways for individuals to monetize (opt-in).  Extend that architecture again to control more data (eg: health) and more ways to monetize.  <p>The vision is that, in the future, you will carry a crypto wallet that holds not just money and your ID, but also what you like, where you’ve been, your medical records, health data, exercise habits, and more. This wallet will have a multi-dimensional record of who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>We are building on <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=084edb3983&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">Gordian</a> from Blockchain Commons. Gordian is secure open infrastructure for mobile clients to access Bitcoin full-node services with exceptional security and privacy. After we make the basic Bitcoin features like multisig a joy to use, we will bring in Cryptographic Object Capabilities to the Bitcoin and Bitmark protocols and make more powerful authorizations possible. (That’s what I wrote about in our Q2&nbsp;update.)</p><p>The founder of Blockchain Commons is Christopher Allen. He’s the co-inventor of SSL/TLS — the cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end security of data sent between applications over the Internet. When your web browser shows the green lock in the address bar you’re using his work. Without TLS, sensitive information such as logins, credit card details, and of course your personal information can be seen by eavesdroppers and hackers. In short, our goal is to bring to that level of safety and security to all types of digital assets, starting with&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. In the early days of the Internet, we had a collection of protocols for file transfer, email, newsgroups, etc… but we lacked a central place that made the benefits of these protocols accessible to everyday people. That’s why, when the Netscape web browser came out, the Internet rocketed to the mainstream. It wasn’t that Netscape was a radically new piece of technology. Rather, it was a friendly user experience for existing communication protocols that were (previously) difficult to&nbsp;access.</p><p>This Crypto Wallet is a “browser-like” opportunity. Done right, it has the potential to revolutionize our economy and society at a scale that could make the Web seem&nbsp;small.</p><p>That’s all for now. Stay&nbsp;hopeful.</p><p>Best,<br>Sean</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/bitmark-ceo-observations-q3-2020-57b737141de">2020 Q3: Bitmark CEO’s Observations to our Investors</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles">Bitmark’s Official Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Our latest feature, private delegation, allows credential issuers to delegate to other entities the ability to issue verifiable credentials.</p><p>We are excited to be making Dock’s credentials delegatable, as we expect this feature to serve many use cases across different industries. For example, a government may want to allow private test centers to manage issuance of certain licenses on its behalf. Or a professional organization may delegate the credentialing authority to online learning platforms, so that the members who complete courses on the platforms can receive verifiable credentials that are officially recognized by the organization.</p><p>This release leverages Dock’s <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-completes-claim-deduction-milestone/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=delegatable-credentials-now-available">claim deduction</a> feature from Q4 2020, which is showcased in our <a href="https://biometrics-demo.dock.io/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=delegatable-credentials-now-available">biometrics demo</a>.</p><p>How It Works</p><p>Let’s take the first example mentioned above, and imagine that a government would like to delegate to a private testing center, so that the latter can issue professional licenses to the individuals who qualify. In this case, using Dock’s latest feature, the government simply issues a verifiable credential to the testing center. The credential states that the testing center may issue credentials on the government’s behalf.</p><p>When the testing center issues licenses to the individuals who qualify, these verifiable credentials would now be bundled with the credential that the government has issued to the testing center earlier.</p><p>Now, let’s say that an individual has obtained a license from the testing center. When she needs to prove to others that she indeed holds this credential, she would need to present her license to a verifier. When she does this, the verifier is presented with the bundle containing both the verifiable credential and the testing center’s delegation credential. Then the verifier uses Dock’s claim deduction feature to analyze the proof, and determine that the testing center has been authorized to issue the credential on behalf of the government.</p><p>Further technical description of the private delegation feature can be found in our <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/concepts_private_delegation.html">concept document</a> and <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/tutorial_private_delegation.html">tutorial</a>. And our open-source code can, as always, be found on <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/">Dock’s GitHub</a>.</p><p>Limitations and Next Steps</p><p>The current release is only the first version of our delegatable credentials feature, and has some limitations: it supports full delegation of credential issuing and sub-delegating rights, without an option to granularly specify what kind of statements &nbsp;the delegatee is allowed to make within the credentials they issue (for example, allow the delegatee to issue only the credentials that certify one’s ability to work as a plumber). The current version also requires the credential holder to store and present the proof of delegation as part of their verifiable credential, without a way for the delegator to publish the delegation and allow it to be freely viewed by others.</p><p>In the upcoming months, we will release further features to support more nuanced delegation, as well as public attestation for delegations. We will continue to work diligently on delivering these updates, and keep the community posted as always. Stay tuned!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> TPG Capital acquiring Thycotic in addition to Centrify, but leaving many questions unanswered 
<p>Mergers and acquisitions are not uncommon in the tech industry, specifically in software. Even in the specialized area of Privileged Access Management (PAM), currently a $1.4bn market according to the KuppingerCole market sizing data, there have been several acquisitions in recent years. Despite its relatively small size, competition within the PAM market is fierce and it attracts startups and investors who realize that PAM has performed a growth spurt in the last years.</p>
<p>This was due to both the ever-increasing cyber-attacks and the challenges imposed by new work and software delivery models, but also due to regulatory compliance and C-SCRM (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management) challenges. It is a hot market, and predictions are that it will remain a growth market.</p>
 We should welcome investment, but... 
<p>Venture Capital and Private Equity are a valuable part of the tech sector. Without them, many innovative companies would not exist. However, on some occasions we must, as analysts, carefully analyze and, sometimes, criticize the rationale behind their investments.</p>
<p>Sometimes investments make perfect sense. Sometimes, however, they leave you scratching your head. The purchase of Thycotic by TPG Capital and its plan to merge the company into its existing property, Centrify, is one of investments that don’t immediately fit into the first category. And, for legal reasons until official approval of the deal, there won’t be many answers. The official line in the announcement is full of words like synergy, cloud-first, identity platform, best-in-class SaaS platform, etc., but lacks concrete facts.</p>
<p>It describes Thycotic as a “next-generation, cloud-first company with innovative identity security solutions” and Centrify as a “trusted PAM market leader”. The description of Centrify is true. They are one of the market leaders, and this statement also is backed up by its performance in KuppingerCole’s PAM-related <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80088/privileged-access-management" title="Leadership Compass reports">Leadership Compass reports</a>.</p>
 Thycotic and Centrify: Both amongst the PAM leaders 
<p>Thycotic is also a leader in PAM, and even outperforms Centrify in some of our report ratings, although the two are closer when measured for <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80355/privileged-access-management-for-devops/" title="DevOps capabilities">DevOps capabilities</a>. However, “next generation” and “cloud-first” are bold claims. Thycotic delivers many services to their customers as SaaS, but most are still based on their established Secret Server product. On the other hand, Thycotic has cloud-native offerings in the portfolio such as their Account Lifecycle Manager (ALM) and DevOps Secret vault. Overall, based on its activity in the last 12 months, Thycotic, despite these claims, seems the more innovative of the two. But “next generation”? Partially yes, without any doubt, but not (yet) in all areas.</p>
<p>Thycotic too, was on the acquisition trail in 2020 when it purchased CASB startup OnionID to add that functionality to its PAM suite, an excellent purchase and one easily integrated. It signed an OEM deal with IBM to provide a white-label version of its PAM platform – a deal that has benefited both parties. Its management and active road map seemed in a good place.</p>
 A merger of equals – not a takeover 
<p>As aforementioned, TPG Capital is acquiring Thycotic in addition to Centrify, with the intent of merging the two companies in what we would rate as a merger of equals. Centrify, while showing good progress and continuing to be amongst the PAM leaders, may not have shown the same levelheadedness as Thycotic. On the other hand, with the split of the IDaaS (Identity as a Service) business now being Idaptive, Centrify is fully focused on PAM for quite a while now. It has had three ownerships in three years. And three (or, more correctly, two) different CEOs. The latest, industry veteran Art Gilliland is set to take over the reins of the newly merged business. He is #3, but became CEO just at the day of the announcement of the Thycotic acquisition by TPG, now being in charge of leading the integration. This, amongst others, is a clear indicator for a merger of equals, not a take-over of one by the other.</p>
<p>The general question in every merger is whether synergies will be leveraged. Is the approach taken by TPG the right or wrong way around for merging companies? As usual, there is a danger that the innovations that Thycotic displayed will be lost in the familiar process of merging the two companies two sets of PAM technologies with considerable overlap (but also several uniquenesses), and all that entails. There also is a danger that some of the Centrify’s strength will suffer. But the setup chosen by TPG is focused on avoiding these scenarios, despite all the buzzwords used in the official announcement.</p>
 Cui bono? 
<p>At the end, the bottom line is whether it is good for the customer. The answer is unclear yet, until more concrete plans are announced (which, as mentioned ahead, has to wait until formal approval of the deal). It is arguably good for TPG Capital to effectively neutralize a rival, but it means less choice for the customer – especially at the enterprise level. There always remains a risk for the companies and products if the merger runs into difficulties.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TPG Capital has a reputation for longer-term strategic investments, thus this can turn into leveraging synergies, which we consider being a lot more likely. But we don’t know yet, and as of now, there (for the aforementioned reasons) has been no strategy and roadmap published. In other words: For now, we are in a phase of uncertainty, but with some positive hints when looking at the details, and behind the scenes.</p>
 Wait until the dust settles 
<p>Our advice for organizations currently in the process of making decisions in the PAM space is to wait until the dust has settled and both transition and integration roadmaps are published. Ask also the other vendors to explain their roadmap and longer-term strategy. While there is yet a lot of uncertainty regarding the future of the mutual products and the strategy, there appears being a plan behind the acquisition.</p>
<p>For existing customers, the same holds true. With two vendors with largely overlapping product portfolios merging, the risk of one of the products disappearing exists. But there are also opportunities, with two strong vendors joining forces. Thus, before making decisions in a hurry: Better wait a little, until Centrify and Thycotic tell us about their plans, and then decide based on that.</p>

  <p>NestJS is a node.js framework that boasts the ability to build efficient, reliable, and scalable applications.  A NestJS application can serve as the backend for your SPA.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will use React, one of the most popular javascript front-end libraries available to build your SPA, and then use NestJS for your server.  To secure everything, you will level Okta’s simple and powerful single sign-on provider.</p>

<p>You will learn how to authenticate a user to React using Okta.  Okta will then issue a JWT to your SPA, which you can relay to the NestJS application.  NestJS is built with external libraries in mind, meaning it’s straightforward to use Okta’s JWT verifier to validate the JWT and ensure the user is authorized to access the resources on your server.</p>

<p></p>

 Create your Okta Application 

<p>To start, you will need a forever-free Okta developer’s account.  If you don’t have one, you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/developer/signup/">sign up here</a>.  For this tutorial, you will be creating your application using Okta’s new CLI tool.  If you haven’t used it before, I highly encourage you to check out <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/12/10/introducing-okta-cli">this tutorial</a> or check out the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Once you are logged into the CLI, run <code>okta apps create</code> and begin the setup.  Give your application a meaningful name; I called my <code>nest-js</code>.  Next select Single Page App.  Change your Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> and your Post Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. The CLI will return your Issuer and Client ID.  Make note of both of these as you will need them in your applications.</p>

 Create your React Application 

<p>Now that you have your application set up in Okta, you can create your React application.  For this, you can use the <code>create-react-app</code> task runner. Use <code>npx create-react-app nestjs-frontend</code> to begin your application set up.  For this project, I named my react app nestjs-frontend, but you can name yours whatever you like.</p>

<p>After the task runner has scaffolded React for you it’s time to install a few packages.  First, install <code>bootstrap</code> since it’s a nice, easy CSS library.</p>

   <code>npm i bootstrap@4.5.3
</code>   

<p>Okta provides a couple of useful libraries to help facilitate securing your application.  You will want to install these next.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@4.7.2
npm i @okta/okta-react@4.1.0
</code>   

<p>You’ll also be using a library that allows you to use a local file to store properties that will be read as environment variables in React, called <code>dotenv</code>.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

<p>The last step before coding your application is to set up your <code>.env</code> file.  Add a new file called <code>.env</code> to the root of your front-end application and add the following values to it.</p>

   <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE={yourOktaDomain}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
PORT=3000
</code>   

<p>You will plug in the Okta CLI client ID you received earlier and your Okta organization URL (e.g. https://dev-123456.okta.com).</p>

<p>Next, add a file to your <code>src</code> folder called <code>AppWithRouterAccess.jsx</code>.  Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

import Home from './Pages/Home'

const AppWithRouterAccess = () =&gt; {
  const issuer =  process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE + '/oauth2/default'
  const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
  const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + '/callback';

  const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
    issuer: issuer,
    clientId: clientId,
    redirectUri: redirect
  });

  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth}&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
};
export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

<p>This class provides the setup for your application’s authentication.  It wraps your application in a <code>Security</code> component that’s initialized with your Okta settings.  That way you will have access to the <code>oktaAuth</code> object on any of the paths defined within.</p>

<p>Next, open your <code>app.js</code> file and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import AppWithRouterAccess from './AppWithRouterAccess';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;AppWithRouterAccess/&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>Here you are using the <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code> you just created.  This is also the appropriate place to import <code>bootstrap</code> to use with your application.</p>

<p>Next, add a folder called <code>Components</code> and add a file called <code>Header.jsx</code>.  Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

const Header = () =&gt; {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

  if (authState.isPending) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  }

  const button = authState.isAuthenticated ? (
    &lt;button
      className="btn btn-secondary"
      onClick={() =&gt; {
        oktaAuth.signOut("/");
      }}
      &gt;
      Logout
    &lt;/button&gt;
    ) : (
    &lt;button
      className="btn btn-secondary"
      onClick={() =&gt; {
        oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
      }}
    &gt;
      Login
    &lt;/button&gt;
  );

  return (
    &lt;div className="navbar" bg="light" expand="lg"&gt;
      &lt;div className="navbar" href="/"&gt;
        NestJS To Do List
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="navbar" aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="navbar" id="basic-navbar-nav"&gt;
        &lt;div className="navbar mr-auto"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;form className="inline"&gt;{button}&lt;/form&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
export default Header;
</code>   

<p>This header provides a title for the website and a button for logging in or out, depending on the value of <code>authState.isAuthenticated</code>.  The button then uses the <code>oktaAuth</code> object to call <code>signOut</code> or <code>signInWithRedirect</code>, depending on which is appropriate.  The <code>signInWithRedirect</code> function will redirect the user to the Okta-hosted login page and return the authentication information to the callback you defined in <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code> before.  Once the user signs in, you will have access to the requested authentication details.</p>

<p>In that same folder, add a file called <code>ToDoList.jsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";

const ToDoList = ({ authState, list, onCompleteItem }) =&gt; {
  if (!authState.isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Hey there, it looks like you aren't logged in yet. To log in, click here.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  } else if (!list) {
    return &lt;div className="container"&gt;Loading....&lt;/div&gt;;
  }

<p>This component does a couple of things.  First, it checks if the user is authenticated and, if not, directs them to log in.  In practice, the user should never see this because the <code>Home</code> page you will implement shortly will prevent this.  It also checks if <code>list</code> is populated.  If not, it displays a message that your application is loading.  Finally, if the list exists then, it shows it in a simple table.  The table has a column with a button for marking the items complete.  The logic for this will also be on your <code>Home</code> page.</p>

<p>You will want to implement that next.  Add a folder called <code>Pages</code> and add a file to that folder called <code>Home.jsx</code>.  This is a relatively simple application, and you will only have one page.  Add the following code to that file.</p>

</code>   

<p>Here you have a <code>getCurrentItems()</code> function that gets called when the component is loaded.  This uses <code>fetch()</code> to contain the server you defined in your <code>.env</code> file.  That server isn’t operational yet, but that’s where your NestJS application will be.  Similarly, there is a function for <code>markItemAsComplete()</code>.  This function will also call your NestJS application and request the item selected to be marked as complete; then, it will remove the item from the table.  This is injected into the <code>ToDoList.jsx</code> component from before.  Finally, if your user isn’t authenticated, you will display a small welcome page for the user.</p>

<p>At this point, you can now run <code>npm run start</code> and let your application load.  Your lists won’t load, but you should be able to see the application.</p>

<p></p>

 Create your NestJS Application 

<p>Now it’s time to get the backend written for your application.  Navigate back to your root directory.  If you haven’t installed the NestJS CLI yet, then now is the time.  Run <code>npm i -g @nestjs/cli</code> and wait for that to complete.  Next, run <code>nest new nestjs-backend</code> to create a new nest project next to your frontend React app.  I named mine nestjs-backend, but you can call yours whatever is meaningful to you. You’ll be asked to choose which package manager you want to use. Choose <code>npm</code> to use all the commands that follow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: You may get some <code>WARNING</code> messages when running the NestJS CLI or installing dependencies. This seems to be related to npm version 7+ and doesn’t seem to affect the application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This process takes a moment, but you can begin to install your packages once it’s complete.</p>

<p>First, as usual, install <code>dotenv</code>.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need a few packages for authenticating your user and setting up the auth modules.  To do this, you will level <code>passport</code> and Okta’s jwt verifier.  You can install these now.</p>

   <code>npm i passport@0.4.1
npm i passport-http-bearer@1.0.1
npm i @nestjs/passport@7.1.5
npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@1.0.1
</code>   

<p>Next, add a file to the root of your backend directory called <code>.env</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
OKTA_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer}
OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
APP_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3001
</code>   

<p>You will plug in your client ID and issuer you received from the Okta CLI earlier.</p>

<p>Now, open your <code>src</code> folder.  The rest of this tutorial will take place there.</p>

<p>In <code>src</code> you’ll see a file called <code>main.ts</code>.  Replace the code in there with the following.</p>

   <code>import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.enableCors();
  await app.listen(3001);
}
bootstrap();
console.log('app started');
</code>   

<p>Most of this code is boilerplate from NestJS, although you are also enabling CORS so that your React application can make requests to this server.  To avoid conflicts, you changed the port this application is running on to <code>3001</code>.  This should match what your React application is expecting to call.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>app.service.ts</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getToDoList(): any[] {
    return [
      {
        id: 1,
        text: 'Clean the dishes',
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        text: 'Cook Dinner',
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        text: 'Take out the trash',
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        text: 'Legdrop off the ropes',
      },
      {
        id: 5,
        text: 'Brush your teeth',
      },
    ];
  }

  markAsComplete(id: any): any {
    console.log(id);

    return {
      success: true,
      error: '',
    };
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The service component here defines the logic for the <code>markAsComplete()</code> and <code>getToDoList()</code> methods.  These are stubbed out, but you can connect them to a persistent storage if you want.</p>

<p>Next, replace the code in <code>app.module.ts</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthModule } from './auth/auth.module';

@Module({
  imports: [AuthModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
</code>   

<p>The change here from the stock code is that you are now listing <code>AuthModule</code> as an import.  This should throw an error at this point since you haven’t created the auth module yet.</p>

<p>Finally, edit your <code>app.controller.ts</code> to the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Controller, Get, Post, UseGuards, Body } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get('/todolist')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  getToDoList(): any[] {
    return this.appService.getToDoList();
  }

  @Post('/todolist')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  markAsComplete(@Body() id: any): any {
    return this.appService.markAsComplete(id);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you are defining your routes and the logic within them.  The syntax here is pretty self-explanatory.  You can decorate methods with <code>@Get</code> or <code>@Post</code> (or, of course, any HTTP Method) and provide a route in the argument.  Next, you are using the <code>AuthGuard()</code> guard.  You have injected the <code>app.service.ts</code> class with the <code>app.module.ts</code> and, in the constructor of this controller, you’ve accepted that argument.  Now you can call the <code>getToDoList()</code> or <code>markAsComplete()</code> methods in the service.</p>

<p>Now, you will need to set up your auth module. First, you need to access the config variables found in <code>.env</code>.  NestJS prefers you inject the configuration rather than accessing with <code>process.env</code>, so start by creating a folder under <code>src</code> called <code>config</code>.</p>

<p>Add a file for <code>config.module.ts</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

import { ConfigService } from './config.service';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ConfigService,
      useValue: new ConfigService(`${process.env.NODE_ENV || ''}.env`),
    },
  ],
  exports: [ConfigService],
})
export class ConfigModule {}
</code>   

<p>This class allows you to inject the <code>ConfigService</code> into other classes that need access to it.  Create the <code>config.service.ts</code> file in the same directory and add the <code>ConfigService</code> code found below.</p>

   <code>import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import * as fs from 'fs';

export class ConfigService {
  private readonly envConfig: { [key: string]: string };

  constructor(filePath: string) {
    this.envConfig = dotenv.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath));
  }

  get(key: string): string {
    return this.envConfig[key];
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This class provides the logic for getting the values from the <code>.env</code> file by parsing the file and returning the value based on the key.</p>

<p>You are all set up now to complete the authentication portion of your application.  Under your <code>src</code> folder, add a folder called <code>auth</code> and add a file for <code>auth.module.ts</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

import { ConfigModule } from '../config/config.module';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { HttpStrategy } from './http.strategy';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  providers: [HttpStrategy, AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
</code>   

<p>This should start becoming a pattern for you.  The module defines the imports and providers for the class.  Next, add the <code>auth.service.ts</code> file to the same folder and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as OktaJwtVerifier from '@okta/jwt-verifier';

import { ConfigService } from '../config/config.service';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  private oktaVerifier: any;
  private audience: string;

  constructor(private readonly config: ConfigService) {
    this.oktaVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
      issuer: config.get('OKTA_ISSUER'),
      clientId: config.get('OKTA_CLIENTID'),
    });

    this.audience = config.get('OKTA_AUDIENCE');
  }

  async validateToken(token: string): Promise&lt;any&gt; {
    const jwt = await this.oktaVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, this.audience);
    return jwt;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Once again, the service will contain the actual logic for your module.  Here you are using Okta’s JWT verifier to verify the token.  You don’t even need to parse any information from the token.  If the token is invalid, then <code>oktaVerifier</code> will throw an exception that you can catch later on.  This piece simply takes your issuer, clientId, audience and validates your token against it.</p>

<p>Finally, add <code>http.strategy.ts</code> to the same folder.  The code for this is below.</p>

   <code>import { HttpException, Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Strategy } from 'passport-http-bearer';

import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class HttpStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {
    super();
  }

  async validate(
    token: string,
    done: (error: HttpException, value: boolean | string) =&gt; any,
  ) {
    try {
      return await this.authService.validateToken(token);
    } catch (error) {
      done(error, 'The token is not valid');
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This class ties everything together.  It is registered as a provider for the auth module, which is injected into the app controller, which uses the <code>AuthGuard</code> that looks for a passport strategy to tell it how to authenticate the user.  In this case, using your auth service class that knows how to use the Okta JWT Verifier.</p>

<p>Now you can run <code>nest start,</code> and this application should be ready to start.</p>

 Test and Run 

<p>You can now go back to your React application and login with your Okta account information.  Once you do that, you will be showing the to-do list with the items that you stubbed out in the app service class.</p>

<p>The evolution of identity on the web is happening at a rapid pace, with many different projects and efforts converging around similar ideas with their own interpretations and constraints. It can be difficult to parse through all of these developments while the dust hasn’t completely settled, but looking at these issues holistically, we can see a much bigger pattern emerging. In fact, many of the modern innovations related to identity on the web are actually quite connected and build upon each other in a myriad of complementary ways.</p><p>The rise of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>The core of modern identity is undoubtedly <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), the de-facto standard for user authentication and identity protocol on the internet. It’s a protocol that enables developers building apps and services to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience. Because OIDC is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework, it can also be used as an authorization solution. Its development was significant for many reasons, in part because it came with the realization that identity on the web is fundamental to many different kinds of interactions, and these interactions need simple and powerful security features that are ubiquitous and accessible. Secure digital identity is a problem that doesn’t make sense to solve over and over again in different ways with each new application, but instead needs a standard and efficient mechanism that’s easy to use and works for the majority of&nbsp;people.</p><p>OpenID Connect introduced a convenient and accessible protocol for identity that required less setup and complexity for developers building different kinds of applications and programs. In many ways, protocols like OIDC and <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> piggy backed on the revolution that was underfoot in the mid 2000’s as developers fled en-mass from web based systems heavily reliant on technologies like XML (and consequently identity systems built upon these technologies like SAML), for simpler systems based on JSON. OpenID built on the success of OAuth and offered a solution that improved upon existing identity and web security technologies which were vulnerable to attacks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">screen scraping</a>. This shift towards a solution built upon modern web technologies with an emphasis on being easy-to-use created ripe conditions for adoption of these web standards.</p><p>OIDC’s success has categorically sped up both the web and native application development cycle when it comes to requiring the integration of identity, and as a result, users have now grown accustomed to having sign-in options aplenty with all their favorite products and services. It’s not intuitively clear to your average user why they need so many different logins and it’s up to the user to manage which identities they use with which services, but the system works and provides a relatively reliable way to integrate identity on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Success and its unintended consequences</p><p>While OIDC succeeded in simplicity and adoption, what has emerged over time is a number of limitations and challenges that have come as a result of taking these systems to a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>When it comes to the market for consumer identity, there are generally three main actors&nbsp;present:</p>  Identity Providers  Relying Parties  End-Users  <p>The forces in the market that cause their intersection to exist are complex, but can be loosely broken down into the interaction between each pair of&nbsp;actors.</p><p>In order for an End-User to be able to “login” to a website today, the “sweet spot” must exist where each of these sets of requirements are&nbsp;met.</p><p>The negotiation between these three parties usually plays out on the relying party’s login page. It’s this precious real-estate that drives these very distinct market&nbsp;forces.</p><p>Anti-competitive market&nbsp;forces</p><p>In typical deployments of OIDC, in order for a user to be able to “login” to a relying party or service they’re trying to access online, the relying party must be in direct contact with the Identity Provider (IdP). This is what’s come to be known as the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID#the-idp-tracking-problem">IdP tracking problem</a>. It’s the IdP that’s responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties, not the end-users themselves. Over time, these natural forces in OIDC have created an environment that tends to favour the emergence and continued growth of a small number of very large IdPs. These IdPs wield a great deal of power, as they have become a critical dependency and intermediary for many kinds of digital interactions that require identity.</p><p>This environment prevents competition and diversity amongst IdPs in exchange for a convenience-driven technology framework where user data is controlled and managed in a few central locations. The market conditions have made it incredibly difficult for new IdPs to break into the market. For example, when Apple unveiled their “Sign in with Apple” service, they used their position as a proprietary service provider to mandate their inclusion as a third party sign in option for any app or service that was supporting federated login on Apple devices. This effectively guaranteed adoption of their OpenID-based solution, allowing them to easily capture a portion of the precious real-estate that is the login screen of thousands of modern web apps today. This method of capturing the market is indicative of a larger challenge wherein the environment of OIDC has made it difficult for newer and smaller players in the IdP ecosystem to participate with existing vendors on an equal playing&nbsp;field.</p><p>Identity as a secondary concern has primary consequences</p><p>Another key issue in the current landscape is that for nearly all modern IdPs, being an identity provider is often a secondary function to their primary line of business. Though they have come to wear many different hats, many of the key IdPs’ primary business function is offering some service to end-users (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.). Their role as IdPs is something that emerged over time, and with it has surfaced a whole new set of responsibilities whose impact we are only just beginning to grapple&nbsp;with.</p><p>Due to this unequal relationship, developers and businesses who want to integrate identity in their applications are forced to choose those IdPs which contain user data for their target demographics, instead of offering options for IdP selection based on real metrics around responsible and privacy-preserving identity practices for end-users.</p><p>This cycle perpetuates the dominance of a few major IdPs and likewise forces users to keep choosing from the same set of options or risk losing access to all of their online accounts. In addition, many of these IdPs have leveraged their role as central intermediaries to increase surveillance and user behavior tracking, not just across their proprietary services, but across a user’s entire web experience. The net result of this architecture on modern systems is that IdPs have become a locus for centralized data storage and processing.</p><p>The privacy implications associated with the reliance on a central intermediary who can delete, control, or expose user data at any time have proven to be no small matter. New regulations such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have brought user privacy to the forefront and have spurred lots of public discourse and pressure for companies to manage their data processing policies against more robust standards. The regulatory and business environment that is forming around GDPR and CCPA is pushing the market to consider better solutions that may involve decentralizing the mode of operation or separating the responsibilities of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>Identity Provider&nbsp;lock-in</p><p>Lastly, in today’s landscape there is an inseparable coupling between an End-User and the IdP they use. This effectively means that, in order to transfer from say “Sign In With Google” to “Sign In With Twitter,” a user has to start over and build their identity from scratch. This is due to the fact that users are effectively borrowing or renting their identities from their IdPs, and hence have little to no control in exercising that identity how they see fit. This model creates a pattern that unnecessarily ties a user to the application and data ecosystem of their IdP and means they must keep an active account with the provider to keep using their identity. If a user can’t access to their account with an IdP, say by losing access to their Twitter profile, they can no longer login to any of the services where they’re using Twitter as their&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>One of the problems with the term Identity Provider itself is that it sets up the assumption that the end-user is being provided with an identity, rather than the identity being theirs or under their control. If end-users have no real choice in selecting their IdP, then they are ultimately subject to the whims of a few very large and powerful companies. This model is not only antithetical to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/congress-big-tech-monopoly-power.html">anti-trust</a> policies and legislation, it also prevents data portability between platforms. It’s made it abundantly clear that the paradigm shift on end-user privacy practices needs to start by giving users a baseline level of choice when it comes to their identity.</p><p>A nod to an alternative model</p><p>Fundamentally, when it comes to identity on the web, users should have choice; choice about which services they employ to facilitate the usage of their digital identities along with being empowered to change these service providers if they so&nbsp;choose.</p><p>The irony of OpenID Connect is that the original authors did actually consider these problems, and evidence of this can be found in the original OIDC specification: in chapter 7, entitled “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">Self Issued OpenID Provider</a>” (SIOP).</p><p>Earning its name primarily from the powerful idea that users could somehow be their own identity provider, SIOP was an ambitious attempt at solving a number of different problems at once. It raises some major questions about the future of the protocol, but it stops short of offering an end-to-end solution to these complex problems.</p><p>As it stands in the core specification, the SIOP chapter of OIDC was really trying to solve 3 significant, but distinct problems, which&nbsp;are:</p>  Enabling portable/transferable identities between providers  Dealing with different deployment models for OpenID providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">Nascar&nbsp;Problem</a>  <p>SIOP has recently been of strong interest to those in the decentralized or self-sovereign identity community because it’s been identified as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">potential pathway</a> to transitioning existing deployed digital infrastructure towards a more decentralized and user-centric model. As discussion is ongoing at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> to evolve and reboot the work around SIOP, there are a number of interesting questions raised by this chapter that are worth exploring to their full extent. For starters, SIOP questions some of the fundamental assumptions around the behaviour and deployment of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>OpenID and OAuth typically use a redirect mechanism to relay a request from a relying party to an IdP. OAuth supports redirecting back to a native app for the end-user, but it assumes that the provider itself always takes the form of an HTTP server, and furthermore it assumes the request is primarily handled server-side. SIOP challenged this assumption by questioning whether the identity provider has to be entirely server-side, or if the provider could instead take the form of a Single-Page Application (SPA), Progressive Web Application (PWA), or even a native application. In creating a precedent for improving upon the IdP model, SIOP was asking fundamental questions such as: who gets to pick the provider? What role does the end-user play in this selection process? Does the provider always need to be an authorization server or is there a more decentralized model available that is resilient from certain modes of compromise?</p><p>Although some of these questions remain unanswered or are early in development, the precedent set by SIOP has spurred a number of related developments in and around web identity. Work is ongoing at the OpenID Foundation to flesh out the implications of SIOP in the emerging landscape.</p><p>Tech giants capitalize on the conversation</p><p>Although OIDC is primarily a web-based identity protocol, it was purposefully designed to be independent of any particular browser feature or API. This separation of concerns has proved incredibly useful in enabling adoption of OIDC outside of web-only environments, but it has greatly limited the ability for browser vendors to facilitate and mediate web-based login events. A number of large technology and browser vendors have picked up on this discrepancy, and are starting to take ownership of the role they play in web-based user interactions.</p><p>Notably, a number of new initiatives have been introduced in the last few years to address this gap in user privacy on the web. An example of this can be found in the <a href="https://tag.w3.org/">W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> (TAG), a group tasked with documenting and building consensus around the architecture of the World Wide Web. Ahead of the 2019 <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/09/TPAC/">W3C TPAC</a> in Japan, Apple proposed an initiative called <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2019Sep/0004.html">IsLoggedIn</a>, effectively a way for websites to tell the browser whether the user was logged in or not in a trustworthy way. What they realized is that the behavior of modern web architecture results in users being “logged in by default” to websites they visit, even if they only visit a website once. Essentially as soon as the browser loads a webpage, that page can store data about the user indefinitely on the device, with no clear mechanism for indicating when a user has logged out or wishes to stop sharing their data. They introduced an API that would allow browsers to set the status of user log-ins to limit long term storage of user data. It was a vision that required broad consensus among today’s major web browsers to be successful. Ultimately, the browsers have taken their own approach in trying to mitigate the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>In 2019, Google created their <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/">Privacy Sandbox</a> initiative to advance user privacy on the web using open and transparent standards. As one of the largest web browsers on the planet, Google Chrome seized the opportunity provided by an increased public focus on user privacy to work on limiting cross-site user tracking and pervasive incentives that encourage surveillance. Fueled by the Privacy Sandbox initiative, they created a project called <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> to explore how the browser can mediate between different parties in a digital identity transaction. WebID is an early attempt to get in the middle of the interaction that happens between a relying party and an IdP, allowing the browser to facilitate the transaction in a way that provides stronger privacy guarantees for the end-user.</p><p>As an overarching effort, it’s in many ways a response to the environment created by CCPA and GDPR where technology vendors like Google are attempting to enforce privacy expectations for end-users while surfing the web. Its goal is to keep protocols like OIDC largely intact while using the browser as a mediator to provide a stronger set of guarantees when it comes to user identities. This may ultimately give end-users more privacy on the web, but it doesn’t exactly solve the problem of users being locked into their IdPs. With the persistent problem of data portability and limited user choices, simply allowing the browser to mediate the interaction is an important piece of the puzzle but does not go far enough on its&nbsp;own.</p><p>Going beyond the current state of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>Though it is a critical component of modern web identity, OIDC is not by any means the only solution or protocol to attempt to solve these kinds of problems.</p><p>A set of emerging standards from the W3C Credentials Community Group aim to look at identity on the web in a very different way, and, in fact, are designed to consider use cases outside of just consumer identity. One such standard is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) which defines a new type of identifier and accompanying data model featuring several novel properties not present in most mainstream identifier schemes in use today. Using DIDs in tandem with technologies like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) creates an infrastructure for a more distributed and decentralized layer for identity on the web, enabling a greater level of user control. VCs were created as the newest in a long line of cryptographically secured data representation formats. Their goal was to provide a standard that improves on its predecessors by accommodating formal data semantics through technologies like JSON-LD and addressing the role of data subjects in managing and controlling data about themselves.</p><p>These standards have emerged in large part to address the limitations of federated identity systems such as the one provided by OIDC. In the case of DIDs, the focus has been on creating a more resilient kind of user-controllable identifier. These kinds of identifiers don’t have to be borrowed or rented from an IdP as is the case today, but can instead be directly controlled by the entities they represent via cryptography in a consistent and standard way. When combining these two technologies, VCs and DIDs, we enable verifiable information that has a cryptographic binding to the end-user and can be transferred cross-context while retaining its security and semantics.</p><p>As is the case with many emerging technologies, in order to be successful in an existing and complicated market, these new standards should have a cohesive relationship to the present. To that end, there has been a significant push to bridge these emerging technologies with the existing world of OIDC in a way that doesn’t break existing implementations and encourages interoperability.</p><p>One prominent example of this is a new extension to OIDC known as <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>. Current OIDC flows result in the user receiving an identity token which is coupled to the IdP that created it, and can be used to prove the user’s identity within a specific domain. OIDC Credential Provider allows you to extend OIDC to allow IdPs to issue reusable VCs about the end-user instead of simple identity tokens with limited functionality. It allows end-users to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital wallet</a> under their control. By allowing data authorities to be the provider of reusable digital credentials instead of simple identity assertions, this extension effectively turns traditional Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p><p>The credentials provided under this system are cryptographically bound to a public key controlled by the end-user. In addition to public key binding, the credential can instead be bound to a DID, adding a layer of indirection between a user’s identity and the keys they use to control it. In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when the subject’s keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user. The innovations upon OIDC mark a shift from a model where relying parties request claims from an IdP, to one where they can request claims from specific issuers or according to certain <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/trust-frameworks">trust frameworks</a> and evaluation metrics appropriate to their use case. This kind of policy-level data management creates a much more predictable and secure way for businesses and people to get the data they&nbsp;need.</p><p>OIDC Credential Provider, a new spec at the OpenID Foundation, is challenging the notion that the identity that a user receives has to be an identity entirely bound to its domain. It offers traditional IdPs a way to issue credentials that are portable and can cross domains because the identity/identifier is no longer coupled to the provider as is the case with an identity token. <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">This work</a> serves to further bridge the gap between existing digital identity infrastructure and emerging technologies which are more decentralized and user-centric. It sets the foundation for a deeper shift in how data is managed online, whether it comes in the form of identity claims, authorizations, or other kinds of <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/verifiable-data">verifiable data</a>.</p><p>Broadening the landscape of digital&nbsp;identity</p><p>OIDC, which is primarily used for identity, is built upon OAuth 2.0, whose primary use is authorization and access. If OIDC is about who the End-User is, then OAuth 2.0 is about what you’re allowed to do on behalf of and at the consent of the End-User. OAuth 2.0 was built prior to OIDC, in many ways because authorization allowed people to accomplish quite a bit without the capabilities of a formalized and standardized identity protocol. Eventually, it became obvious that identity is an integral and relatively well-defined cornerstone of web access that needed a simple solution. OIDC emerged as it increasingly became a requirement to know who the end-user (or resource owner) is and for the client to be able to request access to basic claims about them. Together, OIDC and OAuth2.0 create a protocol that combines authentication and authorization. While this allows them to work natively with one another, it’s not always helpful from an infrastructure standpoint to collapse these different functions together.</p><p>Efforts like WebID are currently trending towards the reseperation of these concepts that have become married in the current world of OpenID, by developing browser APIs that are specifically geared towards identity. However, without a solution to authorization, it could be argued that many of the goals of the project will remain unsatisfied whenever the relying party requires both authentication and authorization in a given interaction.</p><p>As it turns out, these problems are all closely related to each other and require a broad and coordinated approach. As we step into an increasingly digital era where the expectation continues to evolve around what’s possible to do online, the role of identity becomes increasingly complex. Take, for example, sectors such as the financial industry dealing with increased requirements around electronic Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies. In parallel with the innovation around web identity and the adoption of emerging technologies such as VCs, there has been a growing realization that the evolution of digital identity enables many opportunities that extend far beyond the domain of identity. This is where the power of verifiable data on the web really begins, and with it an expanded scope and structure for how to build digital infrastructure that can support a whole new class of applications.</p><p>A new proposed browser API called <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI) offers a promising solution to browser-mediated interactions that complements the identity-centric technologies of OIDC and WebID. It currently takes the form of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfill</a> to allow these capabilities to be used in the browser today. Similar to how SIOP proposes for the user to be able pick their provider for identity-related credentials, CHAPI allows you to pick your provider, but not just for identity — for any kind of credential. In that sense, OIDC and CHAPI are solving slightly different problems:</p>  OIDC is primarily about requesting authentication of an End-User and receiving some limited identity claims about them, and in certain circumstances also accessing protected resources on their&nbsp;behalf.  CHAPI is about requesting credentials that may describe the End-user or may not. Additionally, credentials might not even be related to their identity directly and instead used for other related functions like granting authorization, access,&nbsp;etc.  <p>While OIDC offers a simple protocol based upon URL redirects, CHAPI pushes for a world of deeper integration with the browser that affords several useability benefits. Unlike traditional implementations of OIDC, CHAPI does not start with the assumption that an identity is fixed to the provider. Instead, the end-user gets to register their preferred providers in the browser and then select from this list when an interaction with their provider is required. Since CHAPI allows for exchanging credentials that may or may not be related to the end-user, it allows for a much broader set of interactions than what’s provided by today’s identity protocols. In theory, these can work together rather than as alternative options. You could, for instance, treat CHAPI browser APIs as a client to contact the end-user’s OpenID Provider and then use CHAPI to exchange and present additional credentials that may be under the end-user’s control.</p><p>CHAPI is very oriented towards the “credential” abstraction, which is essentially a fixed set of claims protected in a cryptographic envelope and often intended to be long lived. A useful insight from the development of OIDC is that it may be helpful to separate, at least logically, the presentation of identity-related information from the presentation of other kinds of information. To extend this idea, authenticating or presenting a credential is different from authenticating that you’re the subject of a credential. You may choose to do these things in succession, but they are not inherently related.</p><p>The reason this is important has to do with privacy, data hygiene, and best security practices. In order to allow users to both exercise their identity on the web and manage all of their credentials in one place, we should be creating systems that default to requesting specific information about an end-user as needed, not necessarily requesting credentials when what’s needed is an authentic identity and vice&nbsp;versa.</p><p>Adopting this kind of policy would allow configurations where the identifier for the credential subject would not be assumed to be the identifier used to identify the subject with the relying party. Using this capability in combination with approaches to <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a> like <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">VCs with JSON-LD BBS+ signatures</a> will ensure not only a coherent system that can separate identity and access, but also one that respects user privacy and provides a bridge between existing identity management infrastructure and emerging technologies.</p><p>An emergent user experience</p><p>Using these technologies in tandem also helps to bridge the divide between native and web applications when it comes to managing identity across different modalities. Although the two often get conflated, a digital wallet for holding user credentials is not necessarily an application. It’s a service to help users manage their credentials, both identity-related and otherwise, and should be accessible wherever an end-user needs to access it. In truth, native apps and web apps are each good at different things and come with their own unique set of tradeoffs and implementation challenges. Looking at this emerging paradigm where identity is managed in a coherent way across different types of digital infrastructure, “web wallets” and “native wallets” are not necessarily mutually exclusive — emerging technologies can leverage redirects to allow the use of&nbsp;both.</p><p>The revolution around digital identity offers a new paradigm that places users in a position of greater control around their digital interactions, giving them the tools to exercise agency over their identity and their data online. Modern legislation focused on privacy, portability, security and accessible user experience is also creating an impetus for the consolidation of legacy practices. The opportunity is to leverage this directional shift to create a network effect across the digital ecosystem, making it easier for relying parties to build secure web experiences and unlocking entirely new value opportunities for claims providers and data authorities.</p><p>Users shouldn’t have to manage the complexity left behind by today’s outdated identity systems, and they shouldn’t be collateral damage when it comes to designing convenient apps and services. Without careful coordination, much of the newer innovation could lead to even more fragmentation in the digital landscape. However, as we can see here, many of these technology efforts and standards are solving similar or complementary problems.</p><p>Ultimately, a successful reinvention of identity on the web should make privacy and security easy; easy for end-users to understand, easy for relying parties to support, and easy for providers to implement. That means building bridges across technologies to support not only today’s internet users, but enabling access to an entirely new set of stakeholders across the globe who will finally have a seat at the table, such as those without access to the internet or readily available web infrastructure. As these technologies develop, we should continue to push for consolidation and simplicity to strike the elusive balance between security and convenience across the ecosystem for everyday&nbsp;users.</p><p>Where to from&nbsp;here?</p><p>Solving the challenges necessary to realize the future state of identity on the web will take a collective effort of vendor collaboration, standards contributions, practical implementations and education. In order to create adoption of this technology at scale, we should consider the following as concrete next steps we can all take to bring this vision to&nbsp;life:</p><p>Continue to drive development of bridging technologies that integrate well with existing identity solutions and provide a path to decentralized and portable&nbsp;identity</p>  E.g. formalization of OIDC Credential Provider to extend existing&nbsp;IdPs  <p>Empower users to exercise autonomy and sovereignty in selecting their service provider, as well as the ability to change providers and manage services over&nbsp;time</p>  E.g. selection mechanisms introduced by SIOP and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Adopt a holistic approach to building solutions that recognizes the role of browser-mediated interactions in preserving user&nbsp;privacy</p>  E.g. newer browser developments such as CHAPI and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Build solutions that make as few assumptions as necessary in order to support different types of deployment environments that show up in real-world use&nbsp;cases</p>  E.g. evolution of SIOP as well as supporting web and native&nbsp;wallets  <p>Ensure that the development of decentralized digital identity supports the variety and diversity of data that may be managed by users in the future, whether that data be identity-related or otherwise</p><p>Taking these steps will help to ensure that the identity technologies we build to support the digital infrastructure of tomorrow will avoid perpetuating the inequalities and accessibility barriers we face today. By doing our part to collaborate and contribute to solutions that work for everybody, building bridges rather than building siloes, we can create a paradigm shift that has longevity and resilience far into the future. We hope you join&nbsp;us.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A byline by Erick Pinos, Ontology’s America’s Ecosystem Lead <p>By Erick Pinos, Advisor at Wing, a credit-based cross-chain DeFi lending platform built on Ontology, and Ontology’s America’s Ecosystem Lead</p><p>The total value locked in DeFi projects is <a href="https://defipulse.com/">an estimated $38 billion</a>, while <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/">CoinMarketCap estimates</a> that the total market capitalization of DeFi tokens is nearly $70 billion. For reference, $70 billion is nearly the same amount as the entire GDP of Luxembourg, and more than the respective GDPs of Bulgaria and Croatia, per <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=true">statistics from the World Bank</a>. In short: DeFi is massive, and expanding by the day. Its expansion over the last few years has seen the advent of new technologies and better ways of managing finances: new ways of financing projects, borrowing, lending, betting, investing; the possibilities are endless. The rapid growth of DeFi has, however, highlighted some innate problems in the industry, most notably when it comes to credit scoring. It was for this reason that we developed Ontology’s OScore protocol in 2020, a self-sovereign credit evaluation system based on user data stored on the Ontology blockchain.</p><p>For years now, lending and borrowing offers individuals a vast array of new opportunities in which credit scoring plays an integral role. This makes OScore a vital missing piece to the DeFi’s puzzle, because in order to offer these products, this vital data is required so that they can be assured the purchaser or borrower will be reliable and in a position to repay&nbsp;them.</p><p>In traditional finance, the cross section between off-chain and on-chain assets and actions is not adequately established to allow users to benefit from on-chain actions while keeping their personal data safe when it comes to credit scoring. Most platforms require access to the user’s off-chain information, while their on-chain data provides insight to the platform into the user’s credit history. This is what we are solving through&nbsp;OScore.</p><p>By using OScore, users can access DeFi products and services, projects, dApps and blockchain platforms, and also manage their on-chain credit data at their will. This allows users to utilise their credit history; if a user has a positive credit history, they can utilise this data to obtain access to more rewarding financial products without placing the safety and security of their data in jeopardy. Users can also amalgamate their on-chain and off-chain credit scores to formulate a more accurate depiction of their credit score with which they can achieve even greater access to high quality financial products. Banks can also have access to quality data that provides them with a full picture of who they are lending&nbsp;to.</p><p>Enter, Wing.</p><p>With nearly $158 million currently in <a href="https://wing.finance/">total value locked</a>, Wing is a force to be reckoned with. Based on the Ontology blockchain, Wing allows users to integrate their amalgamated on-chain and off-chain credit scores, or in this case, their OScore, into Wing’s credit evaluation module. Every product pool available on Wing can then allow users to verify their own credibility, while using OScore to increase the credibility of the individual Wing product&nbsp;pools.</p><p>Pertinently, by using OScore with a user’s credit rating, each user can avoid over-collateralization, especially when they are looking to borrow from a variety of different digital asset classes. The higher their OScore, the more benefits they can glean when borrowing, such as reduced rates and additional incentives. The better the user is at engaging with and participating in the project, the more incentives they receive. For example, if a user borrows and is now making monthly repayments on time, they may enjoy additional OScore points as a&nbsp;reward.</p><p>At Ontology, not only are we proud of our efforts regarding OScore and Wing, we believe decentralized credit scoring is a necessary next step in bringing decentralized finance into the mainstream. Data safety is of increasing importance to consumers; that is undeniable. To achieve mass adoption, we must as an industry first guarantee that. Secondly, if the industry wants to become on par or fully engage with traditional finance, we must adapt to give traditional financial institutions some of the assurances and ability to carry out due diligence, while giving consumers the peace of mind traditionally offered by large financial institutions, such as ease of access and credit&nbsp;scoring.</p><p>By utilising decentralized credit scoring that ensures the safety and security of user data, we are in the unique space of getting the best of both worlds. Thanks to Wing, it is now easier than ever before to see the full picture of an individual user’s financial history.</p><p>None of this comes at the expense of each individual’s right to privacy; only information that is absolutely necessary will ever be shared with a party that needs it. These assurances are crucial in winning over the trust of the general public, end users and traditional financial institutions. It will take an all-of-industry approach to achieve these goals, and we are proud to be paving the&nbsp;way.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/decentralized-credit-rating-is-integral-to-defi-adoption-728cc2dfa8b0">Decentralized Credit Rating Is Integral To DeFi Adoption</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The following fictional passage, from a book being written in an Urbit Group called “the Aleph,” sketches out a dismal future for the human race. As an item of speculative fiction, the piece is not what one might call original. Anyone could have come up with these ideas. In fact, several already have. The Matrix is an obvious antecedent. Vonnegut isn’t far behind either. And the treacly humanism lodged beneath the bitter humor resembles nothing so much as the work of that beau monde satirist, George Saunders.</p>
<p>Really the only notable thing about it is that it was written on Urbit. And that, perhaps, has made all the difference.</p>
<p>It’s easy to be pessimistic about the future. Intellectuals, especially, are drawn to pessimism, because pessimism (falsely) implies a greater wealth of knowledge about the ways of the world. But one thing the pessimist never sees coming is a turn for the better. To wit, the future described in the below excerpt doesn’t have to take place. And Urbit is one piece of evidence for the claim that it will not.</p>
<p>The philosopher-cum-internet comedian Slavoj Zizek likes to point out that no one was really expecting the Soviet Union to collapse in 1989. In fact, the average Soviet dissident wasn’t even gunning for it. He was haggling over small reforms, pushing to get the less corrupt politicians to the top, just going about his day eating or opening a window or walking dully along. Then, kaboom. Collapse. No more USSR.</p>
<p>Then as now, the unexpected is more likely to occur than most would believe. One thing is not only possible, but an established fact: A brand new digital infrastructure is slowly, quietly being built. While U.S. political parties haggle over $1,400 disbursements for citizens, the rules of global finance are being re-written in code. While pundits debate the merits of Dr. Seuss’s lesser known titles, a global shift away from traditional publishing is gaining steam. And while users and social apps themselves pop up and down like whack-a-mole, folks are putting down roots with permanent peer-to-peer digital identities. If you’re anything like an optimist, you’ll probably want to get on Urbit ASAP and put down your own.</p>

<br>
<p>The date is January 1, 2050. The place, New York City. The vibe...subdued. Back in 2020, you made a note to yourself to take stock of the world around you here at the half-century mark. And now the time has come. What do you find? The air quality is a bit worse, the bad parts of town are a bit more dilapidated, the Knicks are still terrible—all in all, from the outside at least, not much has changed from 30 years ago. Today you wake up groggy on your self-adjusting Smart Bed (Smart Bed Never Sleeps), you make yourself a steaming pot of coffee (locally sourced, delivered within the half-hour by a drone, now that you’ve got Titicaca Prime), you shower and get ready for work.</p>
<p>But what was that dream you had last night? Only the faintest traces of it remain. A luminous rainbow, a mountain landscape, a sense of profound inner peace, mixed with euphoria, mixed with...an intense desire to go out and buy some Health Morsels cereal?</p>
<p>That’s odd. You’ve never even had Health Morsels. You open up your laptop, where you can view the activity of the iThink microchip that you got implanted in your cortex a few years ago. “Ads help Elysium provide you with free, quality sleep-monitoring. To disable ads, please upgrade to Elysium Premium.” That explains it. After all—and you pause for a moment over whether the forthcoming thought is yours or the iThink’s, before deciding that it’s much the same anyway—Health Morsels probably are delicious. And healthy, too.</p>
<p>As usual, they’re setting something on fire outside your home. Normally you’d scroll back through your Squawker feed to see what it was all about, but today you’re late for work, and anyway you’re in a pleasant haze after the Health Morsels dream—no point ruining it by poring over the latest Squawker pile-on. You glance at the awning. Ah, the bodega. Toilet paper and Juul Pods are cheaper in bulk from Titicaca anyway.</p>
<p>Another day at the office. You were never exactly passionate about content moderation, but hey, it keeps the lights on. (And since ConEd got absorbed by Titicaca, it’s been pretty important to have a Verified Income Stream.) It’s a normal day at work. Algorithms haven’t yet been able to filter out all Unverified Content—so it’s up to you the flag Unacceptable Violence, Disputed Claims, and Unfederated Currency transactions.</p>
<p>Except after your pleasant dream, it all suddenly seems so drab. You start to wonder whether there was an error last night—maybe they turned the dream levels up too high. Something from your night-time vision just won’t leave your mind, like a film strip looping over and over. It’s that river beside a sloping field, like you used to swim in when you were a kid. You can almost feel the icy cold against your skin, the sticks and mud against the soles of your feet, and then there’s the ripe, marshy scent of the riverbed. Uh oh. You realize you’re close to danger levels. This isn’t where your head’s supposed to be at. Frantically you scroll through content, seeking to moderate it. A user threatening violence against Titicaca. A stream that violates DMCA. A highly dubious Squawker claim, with no support from experts. Flagged. Flagged. Flagged.</p>
<p>Yet the river remains. You see it, you feel it, just as you feel the kiss of the sun on your shoulders, the breeze rustling through your damp hair.</p>
<p>Now you know what’s coming. You brace for it and wait. Three. Two. One. ZAP. Your iThink produces an electric shock: plenty painful but not permanently damaging—at least that’s what the Verified studies show. The river recedes from your mind. Following the shock, your iThink, as versatile a little machine as ever was invented, delivers a few milligrams of both amphetamine and oxycodone, bringing on a wonderful feeling of simultaneous alertness and relaxation. You look up at your monitor. Content moderation doesn’t seem so bad, with the stimulant and the barbiturate swirling paradoxically through your system. It’s true what they say in the ads: iThink doesn’t just make you think better, it makes you feel better. You dive back into your content moderation with renewed verve, even flagging a couple completely innocent posts just out of surplus exuberance. So what if you hardly get outside at all these days, so what if you’ll never swim in that stupid river. The fastest electronics, the Your Health and Wellbeing tracked and adjusted by an intelligence far greater than that which you could ever hope to possess, a gizmo that gives a whole new meaning to the term neural net.</p>
<p>2050 turned out to be a pretty good year after all.</p>

<p>To: Bitmark Investors &amp; Advisors<br>From: Sean Moss-Pultz</p><p>Note: This article series is taken from Sean’s quarterly letters to Bitmark investors. We share them publicly one quarter after they are written to give everyone a deeper, transparent look at Bitmark’s perspective of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Dear Investors &amp;&nbsp;Advisors</p><p>Observations (from the&nbsp;future)</p><p>This is a letter from the future. It’s August of 2021 and even though we do have a vaccine, it’s not widespread. IP disputes between the US, Germany, and China (all contesting patents) are holding back deployment while the pandemic continues to punish society. But there is some silver lining. COVID-19 was the catalyst for a desperately needed transformation. Just about every sector of society moved online, acknowledged the defects of their institutions, and began to invest in better infrastructure.</p><p>2001: A Space Odyssey, the legendary Stanley Kubrick film, opens with the “Dawn of Man” sequence where apes surround an extraterrestrial Monolith:</p>2001: A Space Odyssey, the legendary Stanley Kubrick film, opens with the “Dawn of&nbsp;Man”.<p>Apes are going… ape shit, screaming and fighting and everything else you imagine apes would do. With a bone from a dead zebra, one ape beats another over the head. More jump in and beat that ape to death. Something feels desperately wrong. Everything is escalating. You realize you are witnessing evolution in real-time. Somehow the Monolith triggered a jump in evolution, starting with tool use and then quickly becoming weaponry.</p><p>A killer ape throws a bone into the air, and it turns into a spaceship orbiting Earth — human evolution summed up by the most audacious film cut in&nbsp;history.</p><p>More Monoliths appear. One is uncovered on the moon. Humans are dispatched to have a look firsthand. Upon arrival, that Monolith triggers a high-pitched alarm that accelerates another evolution — this time the machines become intelligent. (And not very&nbsp;nice.)</p><p>Perhaps we humans didn’t stay on the moon long enough to evolve. 2001 came and went and instead of HAL we got Facebook.</p><p>Or maybe SARS-CoV-2 was our Monolith, wreaking havoc on humans, forcing us to evolve through selective pressure. Everything accelerated. Anything that could move online did move online to survive. At the same time, we built artificial intelligence into everything around us. If this continues, our world will change more unrecognizably in the next decade of the 21st century than today’s world changed from what it was 20 centuries ago.</p><p>For the first time in human history, we are all connected with our machines and fellow humans into a massive hive intelligence. Opportunities to organize and govern in radically different ways are emerging everywhere. Finally, we have our chance to solve the big problems inherited from the&nbsp;past.</p><p>But make no mistake: humanity is at a dangerous tipping point. Yes, we have the potential to create a world of prosperity, beauty, and happiness for all. But it’s also quite probable we end up like 2001 with HAL murdering the&nbsp;humans.</p><p>To make sure we create an exponentially better world, we need to engineer better rights for humans. Yet, equally as important, we also need to make sure our AIs are engineered with a sense of rights and humanity at the deepest level possible. Doing this is Bitmark’s purpose. This is Bitmark’s ambition.</p><p>Earlier this year we released the second generation of the Bitmark Protocol, renamed as Bitmark Rights System. Even though “system” is overused, the easiest way to understand gen 2 Bitmark is as a system with the following components:</p>  Rights Capabilities: programmable rights to digital resources  Enclaves: storage and computation for&nbsp;data  Charters: standards for grouping and using&nbsp;enclaves  <p>Gen 2 Bitmark was developed with Blockchain Commons. If you remember from my Q4, 2019 update, I said that Christopher Allen thought Digital Property Rights could be embedded directly into digital assets using cryptographic “Object Capabilities”. We could turn property rights in a new form of a digital bearer asset — that blew my&nbsp;mind!</p><p>That’s what we did in Bitmark gen 2. It was so important to get to a point where rights could be maintained autonomously, without the need for a centralized server. Gen 1 Bitmark, to be clear, could define rights. But we had very limited ability to constrain and enforce usage. And what we did have was centralized. Let me explain why this improvement matters.</p><p>When a system such as an OS or website is presented with a request for a resource (e.g., data, device driver, service), it needs to decide if it should actually do what is being asked. The method it uses to decide is called “access control.”</p><p>All modern computers use an access control system that separates the “things” we are talking about (designation) from what we are allowed to do (authority). Since the early 1970s, information security people have known that this approach is fatally flawed. It leads to <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=9730186e60&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">ambient authority</a> issues. Yet amazingly, it never got fixed. Before we introduced Rights Capabilities, it didn’t matter if we’re talking about Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, iOS, Android, or whatever — they all separated designation from authority.</p><p>Object Capabilities was an alternative security model proposed in the late 70s for access control. Designed to address ambient authority problems, they work by coupling designation and authority. This allows access control to be regulated by possession of the resource alone, similar to how financial resources can be accessed simply via possession of a bearer instrument.</p><p>Rights Capabilities are cryptographic Object Capabilities. They are standardized for recording, transfering, using, and programming rights to digital resources (e.g., data, files, services). Cryptography tightly couples the description of what rights are given to which entities for which things. If you haven’t been granted a Rights Capability to do something for a specific resource, you are cryptographically barred from doing&nbsp;it!</p><p>The blockchain makes Rights Capabilities autonomously transferable and auditable, without the need for a trusted third party. Rights Capabilities are also programmable. They can be monitored and modified directly in code, creating a dynamic rights ecosystem totally unlike anything in the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>You still might be thinking these are obscure technical problems. They are not. Never forget: “the cloud” is just your stuff on other people’s computers. When you put your data on another computer, totally out of your control, you want to make sure your rights are clearly defined and cryptographically enforced!</p><p>A whole range of security problems plaguing us today could be addressed using this new approach. This includes many kinds of injection attacks, cross-site request forgery, cross site scripting attacks, click-jacking, and most of the threats in the <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=9234d6cd49&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">top 10 security risks list</a>. These are all arguably manifestations of this one conceptual flaw first noticed in the&nbsp;1970s!</p><p>Development of the Bitmark Rights System was largely funded by the Taiwan Health Pilot. Finding alternative ways to fund infrastructure was a strategy I picked up from reading early quarterly reports of Tesla. Much to my surprise, I learned Tesla increased cash flows by selling electric drivetrains to Mercedes and Toyota. And even though the long-term goal is to occupy Mars, SpaceX transports cargo to and from the International Space Station to develop their infrastructure&nbsp;. Understanding how Elon Musk thinks about this gave me courage to reduce resources on our consumer apps and push as hard as possible to develop our core infrastructure.</p><p>Personal data control and processing in a Rights Capabilities paradigm looks nothing like the traditional paradigm. Let me use our Taiwan Health Pilot to illustrate some important differences.</p><p>Right now, in August of 2021, about two million people in Taiwan (roughly 10% of the population) are sharing their health data across studies in an open data network. In these studies, scientists and researchers like Dr. Ho, are using this data to make discoveries that are rapidly improving the lives of all participants.</p><p>Technically speaking, individual citizens hold their data in personal health enclaves, PHEs. Hospitals and clinics, as part of the pilot, were given Rights Capabilities to automatically push patient data into PHEs. The Health Pilot mobile app uses Rights Capabilities to pull data from personal devices, such as wearable devices or consumer health monitors. This builds up a full, longitudinal data profile. When individuals opt in to participate in studies within the open data network, their Health Pilot apps show what’s available based on their profiles.</p><p>Let’s say a match is found for a study on children with prediabetes markers. When the parent (guardian of the child) joins, they would get private, precision health recommendations. At the same time, their data safely helps advance preventative health for everyone.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Rights Capabilities to the individual’s PHE are delegated to a matching algorithm (an AI) that finds studies across the network that could help the individual or their family. When a match is found, the consent to proceed is secured, and the individual is added to the study’s Charter. Built into the Rights Capabilities are the methods for data transfers or queries that can be performed. All the regulation (think HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) is handled automatically and recorded for future&nbsp;audits.</p><p>This model of massive-scale, low-cost studies and trials was science fiction for decades. In Taiwan, thanks to the Bitmark Rights System and the support of a <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=0e69850123&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">courageous Digital Minister</a>, it’s&nbsp;real.</p><p>Bitmark’s business model is to license and support Rights Capabilities for enterprises, primarily in the medical/healthcare sector. But we also have a number of crypto companies as customers. We help them handle assets like Bitcoin or ETH. When access control goes wrong with crypto assets, there is usually no recourse!</p><p>By the way, Bitmark developed several apps based on Rights Capabilities:</p>  OurBeat. A community and rights platform for music beat makers. It stores beats in enclaves and records specific rights for them, allowing others within the community to freely reuse beats and for people outside the community to license them. This was built with&nbsp;KKBOX.  A2P. A community and rights platform for visual artists. It allows them to sell collectible digital prints, record rights, and retain their provenance using the blockchain. This was built with Casey&nbsp;Reas.  Autonomy. A community and rights platform for public health. It allows community members to store health information in personal and community enclaves while ensuring that they retain authority over that&nbsp;data.  <p>I’m not sure it’s possible to overstate the significance of building a better system for&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Rights shouldn’t be an afterthought or a necessary byproduct. Rights are the pillars of our society. They’re fundamental to civilization. They determine what we can do in society, what we can use, what powers we have, and what protections we enjoy. From free speech to property ownership, from privacy to freedom of movement, from the privilege to vote to the expectation that we won’t be discriminated against — rights embody the best parts of our humanity!</p><p>Unfortunately, rights are being eroded as we transform from a physical society to a digital society. Again, Facebook is the worst actor in this space. Hardly a month goes by without some privacy violation. Of course it’s not just Facebook, all the major social and professional networks hide from people the logic (algorithms) they use to make recommendations and guide our behaviours. You share information about yourself, but you have no control over the corporations that are reselling your information to advertising networks and other data collectors. At their core, these networks are predicated on people falling prey to addictive behaviors. They are massive AIs relentlessly solving corporate profit maximization rather than general human benefit maximizations. All costs are externalized to&nbsp;society.</p><p>But it’s not just the networks where we lose our rights. Music, books, and movies are being released online, but there’s never a secondary market: once a creator removes something from sale, it’s gone forever. One you buy something, it becomes dead&nbsp;capital.</p><p>Worse, we’re not even thinking about how we could be using the advantages of the digital world to expand on traditional rights. We could be engineering new rights that radically unlock the potential of the digital world. These new rights could be autonomously controlled by the people to whom they have been granted. As nearly all parts of our economy move online, there are enormous possibilities to create a new era of programmable rights.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is no longer science fiction. AIs are everywhere. It’s time for us to get serious about what kinds of AIs we want to foster and what kinds of values we want them to have. We cannot assume that the freedoms we want AIs to to respect and enforce will automatically emerge. “<a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=9353b7ffba&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.</a>” should never be an acceptable response from a&nbsp;machine.</p><p>That’s the mission of Bitmark: engineering rights for a better humanity. The goal of our core product, the Bitmark Rights System, is to give you a full array of rights: protecting your privileges, and using the power of the digital world to take us all to the next&nbsp;level.</p><p>That’s all for now. Stay&nbsp;strong.</p><p>Best,<br>Sean</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/bitmark-ceo-observations-q2-2020-77bf617d4818">2020 Q2: Bitmark CEO’s Observations to our Investors</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles">Bitmark’s Official Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Digital Transformation needs a narrative  Three takeaways to help define&nbsp;it <blockquote>“It will be the air we breathe. It already is, really. The question now is how to shape&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/diagnostic/home">Diagnostic</a> is a series of essays and hosted conversations exploring the challenges of building more inclusive digital economies. For hosted (virtual) conversations, like the one described below, <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou Digital</a> convenes a diverse set of experts and thought leaders with unique insights on an issue, and gives them the opportunity to explore a topic together.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pkumar26?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Praveen kumar Mathivanan</a> on&nbsp;<a>Unsplash</a><p>The relationship between digital technologies and development is a broad topic, but one that’s critical to unpack. To that end, Caribou Digital invited a group of senior level international development decision makers to have a high level discussion on the topic using <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/transformation-in-a-digital-age-9068338fd778">Caribou Digital’s five key points on digital transformation as a starting point</a>. As a group, we explored three ways to think about digital transformation: concepts, approaches and challenges. The conversation was rich and productive, with participants sharing insights and experiences. This is a summary of what I saw as the key insights and takeaways, and of course the conversation isn’t finished.</p><p>Caribou Digital dedicates this to <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/news/remembering-professor-benno-ndulu">Professor Benno Ndulu</a>, an inspirational leader of Africa’s digital transformation, who passed away the day before this meeting, because as he would say, ‘the work must go&nbsp;on.’</p> Three takeaways to define digital transformation for development  The international development community has to think&nbsp;big. <p>Approaches to digital transformation for development outcomes have to recognise that digital transformation is already happening everywhere, to everyone. As the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/pdfs/DigitalCooperation-report-for%20web.pdf">UN Secretary General’s High Level Panel on Digital Cooperation report emphasises</a>, digital transformation is enabling the age of interdependence. This means that it’s important to look beyond the usual approach of siloed sectors. As many of the participants who joined our conversation flagged, it’s less about what’s happening in agriculture or health, instead it’s important to look at it from a holistic perspective — there needs to be a joined up, cross-sectoral approach that recognises the interdependent nature of changes in government, economy and society. Approaching it from the perspective of open, inclusive and secure digital ecosystems (at Caribou Digital we like <a href="https://www.digitaldevelopment.org/digital-ecosystems">USAID’s outline of digital ecosystems here</a>) is important to elevate transformation from a narrow focus on the economy or government to a holistic, comprehensive vision for our digital&nbsp;future.</p> There has to be a move from doing to influencing. <p>Thinking about digital transformation in terms of delivery or projects is not helpful — no one organisation is in a position to ‘do digital transformation’. Instead, influencing the existing forces and already happening processes of digital transformation in countries is a better way to ensure that the transformation can be oriented towards development outcomes. Otherwise, as one participant put it, ‘If we don’t shape what’s already happening, it will spiral out of control.’ This has hugely significant implications — demanding that the sector recognises their role in shaping the overall digital landscape — beyond only the economy or the state but to also including social media and civic participation, data protection, privacy and surveillance.</p><p>The group also discussed the importance of ensuring access and connectivity — two key areas of intervention — noting that ‘If we don’t have inclusion, transformation is irrelevant.’ Another space that’s primed for influencing is digital infrastructure, with a number of participants pointing to ‘digital public goods’ efforts such as the GIZ supported UN Digital Impact Alliance’s <a href="https://toolkit-digitalisierung.de/en/ict-building-blocks-cooperation-digital-transformation/">‘Building blocks’ </a>initiative and the NORAD supported <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>. Both of these efforts are good examples of components of digital transformation, but without an emphasis on outcomes advancing connectivity and public infrastructure may not lead to benefit for individuals and&nbsp;society.</p> The international development community has to influence digital transformation for&nbsp;‘Good’. <p>There was tension and unease about the future trajectory of digital transformation. There is no guarantee about how this transformation is happening and even increased connectivity and state of the art digital infrastructure can lead to negative outcomes, as we can see in the growing use of digital connectivity to discriminate, exclude and persecute. Take privacy for example. There is debate about whether attention to privacy should be a first or second order concern given the desire to leverage digital transformation for economic growth. And while there is increased attention to regulatory approaches others emphasised the importance of broader governance and politics. These have broad implications for the glue that holds digital transformation together — trust in systems, institutions and governance. Given its centrality to use of digital systems, and the diverse<a href="https://www.dai.com/fi-cyber-user-trust-summary.pdf"> cultural and societal factors that shape perception and trust online, how can efforts to shape digital transformation maintain trust and confidence that these processes will deliver developmental outcomes?</a> These were some of the questions we asked ourselves which highlight the need to influence already happening processes of digital transformation for the good of government, the economy and&nbsp;society.</p><p>As one participant noted, digital transformation is not a neutral term. We need to ask ‘of what? For what? By whom and with what impact? We need to understand the political economy of digital transformation — especially now with the rapid pace of change. This is particularly important as it becomes clear that digital transformation has different trajectories, values and politics. If our group of participants included government representatives from China, Japan and Korea, it would have been a very different conversation, bringing different views and important voices to the table. Others emphasised the geopolitical interests behind donor interventions — ‘we see China, Europe, America, with different geopolitical interests. We think digital transformation needs to have a human centric focus with African partners.’ It is critical to define what is meant by ‘good’, by asking ‘What do we value? Efficiency and economic growth or a stable and equal society? Where is our balancing point?’</p> Key Takeaway: the international community needs to agree on a direction and set of&nbsp;outcomes <p>Digital transformation is happening, regardless of any views on it. Given this reality, the challenge for those who want to see technologies help people thrive is to define goals and influence these processes. But without a shared narrative, creating a common agenda amongst diverse stakeholders becomes challenging. This was brought up by participants in the discussion, as one said ‘I don’t think we have a convincing narrative yet on what Good Digital Transformation looks like.’ For digital transformation to strengthen human development, it will require intentional, purposeful interventions guided by an overarching narrative for our digital future. Without that guiding narrative, and without structured, strategic interventions, the process of digital transformation will amplify existing relations of power and patterns of inequity.</p> Participants <p>The following participants joined the conversation — and some who chose not to share their participation. The conversation was held under Chatham House rules, and the summary above reflects our key takeaways, not the consensus of the group. As ever, we’re deeply grateful for everyone's participation, willingness to share and contribute to this vital conversation.</p>  Elizabeth Stuart — Digital Pathways, Blavatnik School of Government  Golala Ruhani — SIDA  Bjorn Richter — GIZ  Ben Wreschner — Vodafone  Jonathan Wong — UNESCAP  Krista Baptista — DAI  Chris Burns — USAID  Emily Middleton — Public&nbsp;Digital  CV Madhukar — Omidyar&nbsp;Network  Alessandra Lustrati — FCDO  Ben Ramalingam — UK Humanitarian Innovation Hub  Greta Bull — CGAP  Kari Jacobsen -&nbsp;NORAD  Chris Locke — Caribou&nbsp;Digital  Emrys Schoemaker — Caribou&nbsp;Digital   <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-transformation-needs-a-narrative-three-takeaways-to-help-define-it-9f06dae3e3aa">Digital Transformation needs a narrative: three takeaways to help define it</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Certification Authorities and Trust Service Providers from across the globe collaborate with GLEIF to advance trust and transparency across the digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Established by the Financial Stability Board in June 2014, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) is a supra-national, not-for-profit organization created to support the implementation and use of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). GLEIF is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland.</p>



<p>GLEIF manages a network of partners, the LEI issuing organizations, to provide trusted services and open, reliable data for unique legal entity identification worldwide. GLEIF services ensure the operational integrity of the Global LEI System.</p>



<p>InfoCert completed the GLEIF accreditation in December 2019 and is a Local Operating Unit (LOU). Becoming a member of the Global LEI System via GLEIF accreditation is a globally recognized designation of commitment to data quality and customer service.</p>



<p>Accreditation is the process by which the&nbsp;GLEIF evaluates the suitability of organizations seeking to operate within the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-system/gleif-management-of-the-global-lei-system">Global LEI System</a>&nbsp;as issuers of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei">LEIs</a>&nbsp;and custodians of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/common-data-file-format">LEI reference data</a>.</p>



<p>GLEIF also makes available the technical infrastructure to provide, via an open data license, access to the full global LEI repository free of charge to users. GLEIF is overseen by the LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee, which is made up of representatives of public authorities from across the globe.</p>



 On March 2021 GLEIF announce a new collaboration with CAs and TSPs to drive the use of LEIs within digital Certificates 



<p>11 March 2021 – Basel – The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) has announced a new collaboration with Certification Authorities (CAs) and Trust Service Providers (TSPs), to drive the use of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) within digital certificates.</p>



<p>GLEIF has launched a CA Stakeholder Group to facilitate communication between GLEIF, CAs and TSPs from across the world, as they collectively aim to coordinate and encourage a global approach to LEI usage across digital identity products. Participation has already been confirmed by China Financial Certification Authority (CFCA), DigiCert Inc, InfoCert, Entrust Datacard, ICAI India, and SwissSign.</p>



<p>The collaboration announcement follows news last year that ISO has standardized the process of embedding LEIs in digital certificates. In accordance with ISO 17442-2, the CA Stakeholder Group will develop and promote best practice guidelines and use cases for LEI integration across the digital identity industry. This will help members of the group, who are all committed to incorporating the LEI into their digital identity products, to progress their own implementations. GLEIF will also welcome participants’ views on current and future LEI services.</p>



<p>The use of the LEI in digital certificates will deliver significant identity management benefits in a digital environment. Certificates linked to verified, regularly updated and freely available entity reference data by a unique, universal identifier are easier to manage, aggregate and maintain. There will also be greater transparency overall across the digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is an important step in promoting the LEI’s capacity to enhance trust and add enormous value across the digital identity management systems which power the private sector. A unified and proactive global approach to embedding LEIs in digital certificates will rapidly extend the benefits of LEI adoption beyond regulatory use cases. Our aim is for the LEI to be harnessed as an enabler of advanced transparency in digital transactions and exchanges, and for its positive impact to deliver advantage and opportunity across the economy and society. We look forward to working with our new stakeholder group members and reporting developments in this space very soon.</p>Stephan Wolf – GLEIF CEO</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>CFCA is committed to incorporating the LEI into our digital identity products and we are already advanced in our related work efforts. We fully support this industry collaboration and are happy to be part of an initiative which brings the benefits of the LEI to a broad global audience, through an enhanced digital ID ecosystem.</p>Jonathan Sun – CFCA Strategic Development Department</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>DigiCert looks forward to participating in this important initiative to advance standards that strengthen online identity protections for users. Widespread use of LEIs, among other enhancements, may improve user confidence in websites, devices and online applications and this is in the best interest of all internet participants.</p>Dean Coclin – Senior Director of Business Development at DigiCert Inc</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>InfoCert is fully behind participation in the GLEIF CA Stakeholder Group initiative. We recognise the value in the industry collaboration intended to share knowledge and coordinate efforts and actions to promote usage of the LEI within digital certificates and more widely, across the digital identity industry. We are excited to play our part.</p>Cristina Andreoli – Business Compliance Consultant at InfoCert</blockquote>



<p>GLEIF welcomes CAs and TSPs to join and participate in the CA Stakeholder Group’s quarterly meetings. For more information <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/">https://www.gleif.org/en/</a></p>

 Consensus through Collators: <br>KILT as a Nominated Proof of Stake&nbsp;Network <p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>In my previous <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/kilts-path-to-parachains-ad3be644db8a">blog post</a> I outlined why KILT needs a parachain and provided a roadmap on how we plan to roll out KILT Protocol. Here, I will provide an update on how we envision the KILT Protocol as a Nominated Proof-of-Stake network.</p><p>KILT Protocol is designed to be a fully decentralised permissionless blockchain network. That means that KILT is being built to evolve into a blockchain that is run for the community, by the community, with all decisions being made by KILT token&nbsp;owners.</p><p>Following the model used by <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a> and <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a>, in order to achieve decentralisation KILT is set out to become a Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) network. Consensus in the system (agreement on the information on the KILT blockchain) will be achieved by collators who produce “blocks” of data on KILT and pass it to the validators in Kusama/Polkadot, who then pass the information to the Relay&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>These collators will be backed by nominators — KILT token holders who trust the collators and use their KILT tokens to back them. For this system to work, a way to incentivise the collators and nominators needs to be built into the system, similar to that used by the Kusama and Polkadot networks.</p><p>In Kusama and Polkadot, validators (the equivalent of collators) and nominators receive staking rewards for participating on the network. Such rewards on Kusama and Polkadot are a result of their on-chain network inflationary mechanisms and performed in their native tokens KSM and DOT. In KILT Protocol, collators and nominators will be rewarded by a similar mechanism, receiving KILT tokens for participating on the decentralized network.</p><p>At maturity, KILT is set out to be fully decentralised and run as described above. In addition to the security provided by collators on the network, KILT benefits from a major and ground-breaking feature of Kusama and Polkadot: shared security. All parachains connected to the Relay Chain share in security of the network as a whole. This is provided by the validators and NPoS&nbsp;design.</p><p>Being part of the Kusama network also enables highly secure interactions between the KILT blockchain and other parachain projects on Kusama and, when a connecting bridge is enabled, also to Polkadot projects. This is a very valuable feature, because it puts the KILT functionality in the center of the most promising blockchain ecosystem to date. It makes KILT Credentials and DIDs easily available for an increasing number of highly valued projects, which will greatly increase the usage of&nbsp;KILT.</p> Obtaining a Parachain Lease <p>Parachain leases on Kusama and Polkadot will be obtained by <a href="https://polkadot.network/obtaining-a-parachain-slot-on-polkadot/">auctions</a> which are expected to begin soon. When a project puts down a bid for a parachain lease and wins the lease, then the bid (KSM or DOT) is locked for the duration of the lease. This means the tokens cannot be staked or used for any other purpose as long as the lease is running. At the end of the lease, the bonded KSM/DOT are automatically unlocked again and returned to the bidder. This way, the projects which obtain a lease just pay the opportunity cost of not using the KSM/DOT for other purposes during the lease&nbsp;period.</p><p>KILT aims to secure one of the early parachain slots on Kusama, so that the KILT functionality will be available for other parachains projects at the earliest possible time. Securing a Kusama parachain slot brings us one exciting step closer to KILT mainnet launch and full decentralisation.</p>

 Spherity becomes Partner in German Government’s Secure Digital Identity&nbsp;Project <p>Spherity announces that it has become a partner of the <a href="https://idunion.org">IDunion</a> project. The project is funded within the innovation framework “Showcase secure digital identities” of the German government (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy). Spherity is entrusted on the application of cloud identity technology in the healthcare industry.</p>Spherity joins IDunion Trusted Identity Ecosystem<p>IDunion aims to provide identity solutions for business, government, and citizens that are user-friendly, trustworthy, and economical. The consortium and its partners will establish a decentralized identity ecosystem for individuals, companies and machines.</p><p>Within the IDunion project Spherity is entrusted with the application of cloud identity technology in the healthcare industry. Secure and portable identities are necessary prerequisites for seamless e-health applications. In this context, secure digital identities are equally necessary for patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions.</p><p>Applying a decentralized digital identity (SSI*) approach to the management of e.g. patient data, legal requirements for data protection can be fulfilled, patient rights can be strengthened and the efficiency of digital system solutions can be significantly improved.</p><p>In the project, these decentralized technologies will be linked with central systems such as Gematik infrastructure and health insurance systems for issuing and storing certificates, so that a corresponding hybrid architecture is created. Demonstrators and field tests will be created in the areas of telemedicine, e-prescription or electronic certificates of incapacity to work or digital vaccination cards.</p><p>Spherity will further operate a node of the decentralized, heterogeneously distributed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IDunion?src=hashtag_click">IDunion</a> test network, which will be European legal framework (GDPR and eIDAS) compliant.</p> About IDunion <p><a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDunion</a> develops a basic infrastructure for the verification of identity data. For this purpose, a distributed database will be jointly operated, which will be managed by a European cooperative. The network will be set up and managed by various actors consisting of private companies, associations, cooperatives, government institutions, educational institutions and other legal entities.</p> About Spherity <p><a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a> is building decentralized digital identity management solutions to power the fourth industrial revolution, bringing secure identities to enterprises, machines, products, data and even algorithms.

			 Public securities experience high levels of trading 
<p>Public markets already have well established trading venues where digital platforms offer a wealth of opportunities for investors. Companies can file for an IPO and, albeit a lengthy and costly process, gain access to an electronic market that enables easy asset and price discovery for investors. Due to this, public markets experience high levels of trading activity. More and more, these markets are made accessible to smaller investors with new robot advisors and FinTechs offering innovative investment services, such as the well known Robinhood. However, only a few securities are made accessible: the biggest ones.</p>
 What about the millions of other private market securities? 
<p>Private market securities are very hard to access because they lack infrastructure. They operate in an industry that is extremely fragmented and still heavily reliant on paper-based processes. Old technology such as fax machines are still being used. As a consequence, the industry has poor asset and price discovery and barely any secondary trading activity. Investors miss out as private markets usually provide higher returns.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology has already opened a new and more efficient way to issue, manage and transfer digital assets. Utility tokens, cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are already accessible and traded by millions of users on centralized marketplaces such as Binance or Coinbase and on decentralized ones like Uniswap or IDEX. The ICO bubble of 2017 and the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have pushed the relevance of tokens issued on decentralized networks. More and more, money and assets are beginning to be tokenized.</p>
 Security tokens as the solution 
<p>The same technologies and protocols can be used with compliant securities: Compliance rules that govern private markets can now be programmed into security tokens. As investors need websites and mobile applications to use the blockchain easily, the arrival of high quality and compliant assets on a global blockchain infrastructure is helping many service providers and digital marketplaces emerge and scale. These are taking the form of traditional financial institutions or FinTechs that utilise and deliver the digital and compliant technological solutions for their audiences. These marketplaces are materializing to enforce the trust between issuers of tokens and investors by leveraging blockchain solutions.</p>
<p>At Tokeny Solutions, we see Digital Asset Marketplaces (DAMs) as the solution to this problem. Cryptocurrency exchanges were the first type of Digital Asset Marketplaces (DAMs) to emerge. A few of them such as Binance and Coinbase now mostly concentrate on the development of their audiences, having already successfully delivered easy-to-use and optimized web platforms for buyers and sellers of crypto-tokens. However, no one can claim to be the marketplace for security tokens. As an investor, if I want to invest in digital securities in order to lower custody fees and improve the liquidity of my portfolio, where should I go? Soon, DAMs will be the destination for these investors.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to explaining more in the next article. If you can’t wait, this is an excerpt taken from the ebook we published with CoinTelegraph, download below:</p>

           <p>When the Canadian Cookbook author and food writer <a href="https://technologyinfosec.com/world/canada/buttergate-goes-viral-putting-palm-oil-fat-supplements-in-spotlight/">Julie van Rosendaal</a> reached out on social media to ask her fellow consumers whether they noticed anything different about the texture of butter, the response from across the country was overwhelming. No, the butter was not as soft as it used to be, and yes, there was definitely a change in texture.</p>
<p>Could the cause be the pandemic, as in more people taking up baking at home? Not necessarily, for two decades Canadian farmers – and maybe in other countries as well – started using palmitic acid, a saturated fat found in palm oil, to boost milk production and increase the fat content.</p>
<p>Some scientists say that it cannot be proved that palm oil is the culprit, nevertheless the <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/dairy-farmers-lobby-asks-members-to-stop-using-palm-as-it-investigates-buttergate-1.5323703">dairy farmers lobby</a> are asking their members to stop using it during the investigation.</p>
<p>Is Palm Oil production sustainable and is consumption healthy?</p>
<p>If Palm oil could be linked to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/palm-oil-health-impact-environment-animals-deforestation-heart-a8505521.html">tropical deforestation</a>, then why continue adding it to our food. 75 million metric tons of palm oil are produced annually in Canada alone, and a staggering 90 % is used by the food industry.</p>
<p>It is also debatable whether Palm Oil is <a href="https://www.doctorshealthpress.com/food-and-nutrition-articles/health-risks-of-palm-oil/">beneficial for consumption</a>, and while the use of dairy feed supplements is in line with federal standards, there could be reason for concern regarding the implications this could have. Consumers are noticing this in the consistency of butter, but what are the implications of this – visible, tangible or otherwise – in all other dairy products? What could be the consequences to the health of the cattle, the meat industry, to the fertilizer industry and thus the environment, the water supply? What reactions does it cause to the overall human body, to baby food, to consumers with heart disease, auto-immune disease, obesity, IBS?</p>
<p>It’s a matter of Accountability</p>
<p>Today’s consumers will become more and more demanding and will require honest and accurate information regarding the products they want to purchase. If you, as a farming company and a brand name producer, are not using Palm oil or its derivatives and you can provide all the stakeholders down – and up – the supply chain, all the way to your end consumer that your products are ‘Palm Oil Free’, your customer’s choice will be easy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think people are always surprised to learn about how the food system works … and how consumer demand affects how our food is produced and made.”<br>
Julia van Rosendaal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our solutions create a Digital Thread where each item or batch will be represented by a Digital Twin. The Product DNA then follows the whole product’s lifecycle, from the first raw product producer to the logistics, transportation, the production distribution and all the way to the end consumer. Each actor in the food chain can provide and share truthful, detailed, verified and accurate information such as feed ingredients, temperature, weight, location in a transparent way, building trust both up and down the chain.</p>
<p>Customers and consumers will decide to buy your product, because you can guarantee the Authenticity and the Product History. They will have a choice to buy sustainable and eco-friendly products, especially if you can show them you – as a producer – have chosen to take a responsible choice for both the health of your customers and nature’s valuable resources.</p>

 A byline by Ontology’s Founder — Li&nbsp;Jun <p>*Note* this byline was originally published in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-guide-to-self-sovereign-identity-a-deep-dive-by-ontology">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p> What Is Self-Sovereign Identity and Why Do We Need&nbsp;It? <p>Ever since the early days of mass internet usage, questions have swirled about the nature of our online selves. Each and every one of us has countless <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/digital-identity">online personas </a>that we use to log in to various online services, from social media platforms to online banking. Just for a moment, stop and think about how many different accounts you have created across the web — a trail of digital breadcrumbs that represent your digital identity, albeit fragmented and unrecognizable.</p><p>Each time we log on to use a new service, the process is the same: we provide some of our personal information and, in exchange, we are granted a digital identity by the service provider that permits us to use their platform. But, in considering the order of this exchange, it becomes clear that something is amiss and that we’ve been doing things backwards for years. Firstly, we don’t need a company to bestow us with an identity because we have one already — surely all we should be doing is verifying that fact. And secondly, we have provided social networks and service providers with our most valuable asset — our information — and we’ve done so free of charge and without asking for much in return, besides the use of their services, which, of course, they are only too happy to&nbsp;grant.</p> The Value of Our&nbsp;Data <p>It is only in recent years that we have come to the realization that we have merely scratched the surface when it comes to the true value of our data. Do you know what your data is worth? Do you know who has access to it and how it is used? The majority of us do not know the true answers to these questions.</p><p>The topic of data privacy has gained huge momentum in recent years — the challenges of which have been compounded over the past 12 months due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. We have witnessed data challenging the likes of oil as our most valuable asset, which further bolsters the need for an education surrounding the use of our information and the way in which it’s bought and&nbsp;sold.</p><p>Every day, the world makes millions of digital transactions through online shopping, communicating via mobile apps and generally sharing information, but who decides what happens to our information and at what cost? Many of us are familiar with how organizations gather our information in order to provide a better, more bespoke customer experience. Organizations, large or small, track the activity of their customers, whether it be the number of times they visit a website, the type of items they like to buy or simply whether or not they clicked on a link in an email. This information provides them with an insight into the needs of the consumer, and can often be mutually beneficial for both parties. The information collected can then be leveraged by the organization to improve its products and services based on the customer’s unique feedback.</p><p>The concept of data collecting and sharing has the potential to take a more sinister turn when an individual is unaware of what information is being shared or sold to third parties. Contrary to popular belief, multinational companies often do not share the data they have collected from their customers, as it’s too valuable and is often what holds the key to their&nbsp;success.</p><p>For example, in a bid to be more transparent, PayPal has released a comprehensive list of third parties with whom they share customer information, including the name of the company, why they share the information and exactly what information they&nbsp;share.</p><p>It should be noted that in deciding to release this comprehensive list, PayPal is an exception: more often than not, details such as this are hidden within lengthy terms and conditions or through the acceptance of “cookies” upon entering a website. Cookies, which track website traffic, allow companies to paint a vivid picture of the visitors to a website, and are under heightened scrutiny as increased attention is being paid to data privacy, although many users blindly allow many websites to use cookies without knowing the consequences. But should the onus be on the consumer to take more responsibility when it comes to sharing their information?</p><p>In order to take on this responsibility, consumers need to be equipped with the right information and the right tools. Emerging technologies such as blockchain can play a critical&nbsp;role.</p><p>Blockchain’s ability to store information on either a public or private network enables key parties to access critical information, and then only what the individual allows. This way, the power is placed back into the hands of the individual, where they can choose who they share their data with, and to what&nbsp;extent.</p><p>So, now that we know what’s wrong with the current scenario, where does the solution lie? The alternative is a concept called Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which places control of personal information with the user, enabling them to log in to all of their online services using just one ID. No more forgotten passwords or having to hand over all your personal information; this is a concept that could dramatically change how we use the internet.</p> How Does Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;Work? <p>To better understand how SSI works and the particular benefits it provides, let’s take a look at one specific example: Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, ONT ID. Based on the specifications for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) laid out by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ONT ID provides a self-sovereign system of data authorization and ownership confirmation, thereby granting true control to the respective users of a particular asset. It can be used to generate and assign digital, cryptography-based identities to different entities such as individuals, institutions, objects and content and supports collaborative services such as distributed and diverse ownership confirmation, identification and authentication of the aforementioned entities.</p><p>In a system that utilizes SSI, all users are granted unique identifiers that they can use to manage their identity to access online services. In the Ontology ecosystem, for instance, this solution is a mobile digital ID application and decentralized framework called ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>By combining ONT ID and a mechanism that uses verifiable claims, Ontology has successfully established a decentralized trust model and a distributed trust delivery system. The system uses zero-knowledge proofs to assure that services only access the specific data they require to verify identity, thereby ensuring the privacy protection of verifiable claims. Through solutions like ONT ID, it is also possible to incorporate various authentication service agencies and facilitate multi-source authentication to achieve a more complete picture of the respective entity’s identity.</p><p>In addition to building a trust network that relies on certain central entities, different entities can also build strong trust relationships amongst themselves. Such a credibility based network is generated through mutual authentication between entities. The higher the number of successful authentications, the higher the credibility of a particular entity. High credibility ratings would make the entities more reliable and trustworthy, and authentication from a high credibility entity will equate to higher credibility for said&nbsp;entity.</p> What’s Next for Identity Solutions? <p>As with other SSI solutions, ONT ID allows users to securely manage their digital identity by storing their data locally on a phone or on trusted cloud storage with a private key that grants access only to the verified user. Once the user is set up with ONT ID, they can use this single online identity to access a range of useful products and services, such as managing digital assets, paying for concert tickets using cryptocurrency or even settling insurance payments. In time, it is envisioned that this SSI will not only be useful online, but in the physical world as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The evolution of the internet and the steady online migration of essential services such as banking and healthcare has led to a resurgence of old questions about who the true owners of our online identities are. SSI will finally put an end to this debate, putting data back in the hands of the consumer and empowering them to use it as they see&nbsp;fit.</p><p>Decentralized and backed by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain">blockchain</a>, self-sovereign identity solutions place an increased focus on verification, security and data management, and are a fundamental step towards achieving a new system where users are in control of their data and can seamlessly collaborate with enterprises while trusting that their data still belongs to&nbsp;them.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/a-guide-to-self-sovereign-identity-a-deep-dive-by-ontology-3fe0f12c3be2">A Guide To Self-Sovereign Identity: A Deep Dive by Ontology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Universal Identity has an inherent focus on human usability, which results in a unique mix of goals, ideas, and approaches to tackling the self-sovereign identity problem. As a complement to this subjective point of view, we strive to also understand the world as objectively as possible.</p><p>Our effort first aims to build a detailed map of the identity industry and underlying ecosystems, both of the historic and future versions, and with detailed drill downs into areas likely requiring significant evolution in future technology waves. Ultimately we have to understand the markets and ecosystems across multiple domains and disciplines.</p><p>This article formalizes the meta-structure (legend) of said map, through defining the concepts used in its composition. It also describes the multiple levels and layers of this map based on economic scale and varying disciplinary perspectives.</p> Methodology <p>Building the mentioned industry map is essential to our approach at Universal Identity. We take the following general approach to building understanding across a number of dimensions, as well as planning and building for the&nbsp;future:</p>  Problem — Formulate and iterate on a clear, concise and applicable problem statement. This can be achieved through, analyzing and modeling the ecosystem, markets, stakeholders, users and security, as well as understanding the what users and customers go through. As part of this effort we will have developed a multi-layer map describing the different aspect of the industry, ecosystems, markets, and products.  Solution — Define a set of products, standards and business models, based on the understanding established above. Being armed with a clear map of the industry and ecosystems, allows for a more effective solution definition.  Implementation — For each of the major ecosystem entities and their products, plan for operations, engineering, organizations and information dissemination. Start off the ecosystem by implementing the public organization’s products such as standards, reference information and source code, as well as helping any private vertical pieces required for initial&nbsp;usage.  <p>Parts of these steps may occur in parallel or out of order, however the general sequence remains as shown above. Throughout this effort the map of industry in its current and future forms comes together gradually.</p>Methodology and&nbsp;mapping Meta-map <p>The comprehensive map we are putting together should encompass all levels of activity in the industry, starting from the very top level (industry itself), continuing down to the various ecosystems, underlying markets and use-cases, and drilling down to the specific products, scenarios and features.</p><p>At all of these levels we will be able to apply the lenses, tools and perspectives described above, in order to build an even more comprehensive understanding. See the appendix for definitions of meta-subjects such as lenses, tools, perspectives and&nbsp;domains.</p>Meta-map and&nbsp;examples Levels <p>There is a certain hierarchy to the industry map with multiple levels, each corresponding to different economic activity value orders of magnitude. The exact dollar calculation for each level activity is not precise or even feasible to obtain in some cases. Nonetheless we have included approximate values for illustrative purposes only, meaning these exact figures should not be taken too seriously.</p><p>Below are the levels used in the map, followed by their estimated economic order of magnitude:</p>  Industry — $100B-$1T  Ecosystem —by technology wave and/or segment — $10B-$100B  Market— by solution or product category— $1B-$10B  Use case — $100M–$1B — may be served by multiple competing products  Product — $100M-$1B — may be satisfying multiple use&nbsp;cases  Scenario — $10M-$100M  Feature — $1M — $10M  Sub-scenario — $100K-&nbsp;$1M  Sub-feature — $10K-&nbsp;$100K   Industry <p>The industry scope represent the space of all economic activities related to a specific subject, as well as all the businesses and offerings that add value in that general area. Most often this is related set of human needs such as with the entertainment and hospitality industries. At other times it revolves around a specific set of supporting activities for other industries such as with the information technology industry, or its subset the digital identity [systems] industry. Example of the identity industry pertains to all of the businesses and offerings that focus on adding value to the greater economy through the uptake, usage and support of identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The greater space may encompass vastly different customers, modes of delivery and technologies, each of which will form a separate sub-ecosystem based on categories such as customer segments or technology waves.</p><p>Ecosystem — The ecosystem perspective focuses on the significant relations and economic interactions between the industry players. An effective way of doing this is following the flow of value between different types of players all the way to the end-customers.</p><p>These ecosystems can be further divided down into sub-ecosystems, often based on how flow of value converges within certain groups of ecosystem players. The identity space or ecosystem for examples can be divided into the consumer, business and government segments, or separately separated based on the type of technology (digital, physical, etc) and technology wave (on-premise, web 2.0,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>Technology wave — The larger sub-ecosystems of an industry are formed based on specific technology waves that transform that industry by pushing the frontiers of efficiency and significantly affecting the cost and revenue models. For example, the advent of digital packet switching in tandem with Moore’s law transformed the information systems industry, due to the dramatically lower cost of information transmission using digital technology, and lead to emergence of the internet.</p><p>Segments— We can pivot economic activity inside an ecosystem based on the final customer they serve, ignoring cross segment activities. Some ecosystems do not have significantly cross segment activity, and so can be cleanly subdivided into sub-ecosystems corresponding to each given market segment. In such cases we can safely deal with segment ecosystems as mostly separate spaces. For example the identity ecosystems for consumer and business are largely independent in terms of economic activity, so we can consider them in isolation.</p> Market <p>The market scope represents the space of all activities meant to provide offerings for a specific set of use cases. The markets generally have two sides, one side will be the providers with the offering, and the other side will be the customers, who make the final decision about purchase and usage. The offering described may take the form of one product or in more complex settings it may consist of multiple solutions or products from various providers.</p><p>Segment — Given that customers generally fall within certain categories, based on their needs and conditions, marketing professionals tend to segment the markets based on customer type. The most common segments used in large markets are consumer, business (consisting of small, mid-market, enterprise), and government (sometimes as institution and nonprofits).</p><p>Use case — With every product or solution, most often there are a handful set of use-cases that describe the way users and customers receive value through usage. These are descriptions of user interaction with the product interfaces, including the specific action that yields value per user’s cognitive processes. Our recurring activities everyday are rife with examples of use cases, such as using a social media app to consumer or publish content, or using a refrigerator to store and retrieve food&nbsp;items.</p><p>Use cases are often what is associated in customers’ minds with some type of economic or behavioral (also a form of economic) value, and significantly effects purchasing decisions. The extent of this value and its substitutes in turn determines aspects of the business model such as pricing, profit and&nbsp;cost.</p> Product <p>Product generally describes a self-containing unit that a provider offers a customer. The customer’s involvement is limited to learning about a product, and eventually making purchase decisions (positive or negative) after further learning and interactions. The provider is responsible for defining the scope of a product, the functionality it offers, its brand and positioning relative to other substitutes.</p><p>There is a lot that goes into defining, building and supporting a superior product, but it all starts with scoping the product in terms of use-cases, functionality and audience. For example, in the case of smartphones, each iPhone product line is scoped for a specific audience (with specific financial capabilities for example), and iPhone’s general use cases are targeted for non-technical consumers who want a device that just works for daily common tasks. Other products, such as say a Samsung Android phone, defines a different scope, namely for more technical users who value productivity and customization use cases as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Scenario — is a common descriptive tool used to communicate specific functionality of a product as well as its temporal relation to users and other actors along a certain class of interactions. Scenarios, at various level of granularity, can be used to breakdown and reassemble the full functionality that a product provides, and so they make the perfect scoping vehicle for the product’s internal development.</p><p>Feature — is a self-containing unit of function provided by a product for a specific purpose. These are perceived and accounted for by customers in their mental valuation and decision making process. Specific customers may value a specific feature differently based on their wants and needs. Continuing with our smartphone example, the face recognition feature may be offered on specific lines of products, with the mixed purpose of providing quicker access to the phone for productivity, as well as showcasing the latest technology for tech enthusiasts.</p> Entity <p>Entities represent the private goods or public goods organizations that may exist at various levels of the map. Generally we enumerate the following types of entities:</p>  Individual — Person or household  Business — Private business organization  Non-profit — Public good, non-profit organization  <p>For example, standards organizations are public good organizations, that exist at the ecosystem level and help in developing that ecosystem by allowing market participants to benefit from predictable interoperability rules. Technology companies are often for-profit private goods organizations that focus on introducing products to one or many markets and each of which fulfills a given use case. Customers in turn can be people or organizations depending on where in the ecosystem we are&nbsp;looking.</p><p>Worldview — In order to better understand the activities of a given entity, we can model their point of view. In the case of organizations, this is often formally and thoughtfully defined in the form of topics such as vision, mission, and goals. Building this model allows us to better predict an organization’s future behavior as part of the greater ecosystems they participate in.</p><p>Competencies — Most organizations are formed around a well-known set of competencies in a well-known domain of industry. Part of these competencies are common in a given industry, but part of them are specific to that organization’s formation. This usually allows a firm to differentiate its products and create a unique advantage.</p><p>Brand — is the most subjective aspect of and entity as perceived by individual stakeholders such as users, customers, partners, employees and investors. It consists of various sensory and narrative components such as the the visual graphics used for the brand, the lexical name of the brand itself, as well as the brand’s positioning narrative and&nbsp;tagline.</p><p>For example the Universal Identity brand is an aspirational and descriptive name for a universally interoperable digital identity protocol enabling a large and increasing number of everyday digital activities.</p> Charting a new&nbsp;course <p>As part of proposing a new solution to an existing problem, one has to provide detailed prescriptions around missing pieces or required changes in approach. In the case of proposing a new category of identity systems, based on the digital decentralization wave of technologies, we have the opportunity to describe the essential pieces of such a new ecosystem ahead of time, and to prescribe the implementation of the parts that will be essential for kickstarting it into existence.</p><p>We cannot just discuss technologies without reference to how they will solve real people’s problems. Having a list of real use-cases with associated personas and economic value for example really helps in steering technology discussions in a direction that can have a lot more business tractions. We also cannot propose technical architectures without considering the future shape of the ecosystem in terms of its players, power dynamics, and value flow&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Diving into the creation of a new ecosystem, will require understanding of the existing web 2.0 ecosystem in terms of markets, products, use cases, user experiences as well as their current real-world economic value. Part of what determines the success of such an effort is the clarity of the map visualizing its future state, and the road to get there. Every assumption and detail has to be thought out throughly and tested against historical data of previous ecosystems based on older waves of technology.</p><p>Some key determinants of success will be the correctness of predicted ecosystem structures, standards, and key entities that will drive the ecosystem’s creation and growing traction past the tipping&nbsp;point.</p> Conclusion <p>There are a number of players in the new decentralized digital identity, all aiming to build a new identity layer for the internet. However we at Universal Identity believe this can only be achieved if it is positioned to serve the identity owners and their everyday digital needs, and is ultimately designed for usability and interoperability. With this approach, we have chosen to focus on building a full understanding of the user needs before prescribing a technology solution.</p><p>With this article we are kickstarting an effort to map the identity [system] industry, and publish it as a public good. We have described and formalized the map’s meta-structure, and defined the concepts used in its composition. We intend to work with the community to fill in the missing pieces of this map. Please check out <a href="https://map.universal.id">https://map.universal.id</a> and consider contributing to this common&nbsp;effort.</p><p>We hope this approach ultimately enables a more robust solution for all players in the decentralized digital identity space as we chart a new territory together. As for us at Universal Identity, we will consult the resulting map for our initial solution proposal, as well as subsequent iterations, to the interoperable and usable decentralized digital identity&nbsp;problem.</p> Appendix — Meta-concepts <p>The so called meta-map of the industry, uses a series of high level concepts which we will define here. These helps us understand and describe the different aspects of industry realities, including with perspectives such as markets and ecosystems. The ultimate goal here is improving the vision for Universal Identity and increasing its chances of&nbsp;success.</p>Meta-concepts<p>Of course, this type of a meta-mapping and mapping exercises can be applied any other industry, though here we are specifically applying it to the identity [system]&nbsp;space.</p> Domains Domains and&nbsp;examples<p>Domains refer to high level areas of knowledge and skills that have to do with differences in nature of the main subject matters, namely: humans, technologies and the&nbsp;economy.</p>  Human — The general discipline of design and humanities deals with humans as subjects, and accounts for their unique nature in its embedded areas of knowledge and skills. This set of skills is often represented in businesses by graphical or industrial design teams under product organizations.  Technology — The general discipline of engineering aims to domesticate technologies and deal with their diversely unique natures, through its various sub-disciplines. These days, engineering organizations are a major source of competitive advantage in technology companies.  [the] Economy — The economy can be defined as the greater set of economic interactions in human society, which are mostly monetary. It is the subject of endless policy and business strategy discussions. Disciples of the more general “business” discipline, seek knowledge and skills to understand, manage and interact with aspects of the economy. Sub areas include marketing, business development, strategy, organizational management, public relations, etc.  <p>Many types of careers fit nicely within one of the above domains. One factor contributing to the above observation is the extended amount of time and resources required to master any discipline within a domain. Another factor is the fundamental differences in the nature of the domain’s subjects, which generally means that a disciple of each of these domains fits an approximate psychological profile. For example, those interested in understanding human beings are likely to become disciples of design or humanities.</p> Basic lenses <p>At the lowest level, most domains and and perspectives can be viewed and broken down using the elemental lenses described below. These are used to analyze and model the world and ultimately better predict future&nbsp;trends.</p><p>For example, the systems lens is the most prevalent way to look at the world when it comes to engineering. Or the design perspective takes advantage of the cognitive view when tackling user interactions and experiences.</p><p>Systems (mechanics) — A generalized systems-based view of analysis and modeling. It starts with viewing actors as systems that interact and which in turn have organized functional components.</p><p>Economics — A generalized economics-based view of analysis and modeling. It starts with the&nbsp;view</p><p>Cognition — A human view focusing specifically on state of human minds involved and the acts of interaction and communication between them. In most cases this view can further be broken down and recomposed back into the systems and economics views.</p><p>Probability — Is a view focused on assigning probabilities to future and seemingly random events. It is the primary view used to build prediction models in order to invest wisely in future outcomes for highest&nbsp;returns.</p> Basic tools <p>These are the fundamental tools used in most or all of the various disciplines, in order to build an objective understanding of the area, and be able to reason about applying changes to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Analysis — Breaking down areas and systems into their parts based on environmental and historical data. The process helps identify independent variables attributed to specific agents or environmental forces, as well as starting to experiment with the outcomes of making changes to those variables.</p><p>Modeling — Understanding systems and their interactions with the world by modeling their components as well as interactions. This often involves recognizing the things, patterns, actors and behaviors that consistently describe those interactions, and building objective models of these. The models can in turn be tested for validity and usefulness as their output is compared to real world historical data.</p><p>Optimization — Determining a set of goals and metrics and optimizing a known model to maximize said goals and metrics. Maximizing profit for a business model can be one example of using optimization as a tool. Waste-minimization in an operational process can be considered as another example. Simplifying a user interface for minimal cognitive overhead is yet another example of its&nbsp;use.</p><p>Prediction — Enables more effectively planning for seemingly random future events. For example, optimizing on future economic outcomes are most effective when paired with a sound probabilistic model of outcome and formal prediction mechanisms. Of course these mechanisms will be based on historic data and assumptions that may prove incorrect, however probabilistically they give us the best odds given we iterate them following learnings from external data and assumption tests.</p> Perspectives <p>Perspectives refer to the patterns and viewpoints used to understand and interact with external realities. They often nicely align with the individual disciplines represented in most major businesses, such as marketing, engineering, design etc, as reflected by organization structures at the leadership level, such as Chief Marketing, or Product, or Information etc. Officer positions.</p><p>Below are the list of these so called perspectives, in turn containing a list of significant encompassed topics:</p>  Industry — Ecosystem, stakeholders, incentives, alliances, power dynamics, game-theory, standards  Market — Audiences, needs, wants, use cases, positioning, promotion, branding, pricing, psychographics  Design — Personas, experiences, sentiment, brands, habits, mental&nbsp;maps  Security — Expected outcomes, risks, vulnerabilities, damages, mitigations  Product — Solutions, Products and services, interfaces, delivery, user-tasks, features, state and storage, specifications, support  Business model — Customers, agreements, transactions, income, costs, profits, pricing,&nbsp;strategy  Operations — Procedures, logistics, projects, waste-minimization, scenarios  Engineering — Architecture, infrastructure, building, fixing, upgrading, maintaining, monitoring, servicing, scenarios  Organization — Vision, mission, culture, leadership, functional orgs  Information — Concepts, structures, descriptions, contexts, instructions, media  Narration — Worldview, memes, media, public positions, founding&nbsp;myth  Jurisdiction — Legal entity, governance, compliance, taxes,&nbsp;lobbying  <p>And below are the definitions of each perspective:</p><p>Industry — Is the perspective of looking at the space from the macro level, generally with a focus and general economics and game theory of the various groups of players. Disciplines such as strategy, business development and part of finance are covered&nbsp;here.</p><p>Market — One can look at the space from the perspective of the individual markets where solutions and products are offered to paying customers, and where the decisions to purchase are made based on the customer’s perspective and needs, as well as the products’ position and branding.</p><p>Design — This focuses on the perspective of users and how the understand and interact with products. It considers the users’ mental maps, sentiments, interaction mechanics, and user types in the form of personas, as well as helps with define the product’s user experience.</p><p>Security — With an almost paranoid view, security focuses on all the possible undesirable outcomes in the lifetime of a service or product, and builds an understanding of which types of vulnerabilities, attacks and mitigations the product and its encompassing support should&nbsp;address.</p><p>Product — This perspective focuses solely on the surface and structure of product itself, how it is defined, built and delivered to customers. This is arguably one of the most impactful perspectives in defining the customers’ and users’ final experience with purchasing and using the product. Product overlaps with and helps converge a number of other perspectives namely industry, market, design, business model, operations and engineering.</p><p>Business model — This perspective ultimately helps understand and define the financial viability of an entity, based on understanding the customers’ economic parameters, as well as modeling other factors such as costs, revenues, profits based on the product’s features and pricing. There is a bit of overlap with industry in terms of strategy, and some overlap with marketing around&nbsp;pricing.</p><p>Operations — Focuses on predictable and consistent performance and creation of value. As such it pays special attention to things like project and program management, as well as general efforts to minimize waste in recurring processes that are the heart of a business, product and services.</p><p>Engineering — This area focuses on the sustainable building and maintenance of systems by applying technology. Expertise in topics such as architecture, infrastructure, automated servicing can create significant advantages for an organization.There may be overlaps with other disciplines around scenarios and project management.</p><p>Organization — is the perspective of guiding an organization of people to work together towards the same goal. The all-encompassing part of this perspective has to do with creating and curating a culture that is aligned with the organization’s identity. There are various areas of overlap with other disciplines such as with human resources on managing people and their aspirations, as well as with organizational management on helping develop effective leaders.</p><p>Information — focuses on compiling, organizing and disseminating information and data in a way that advances the organization’s goals. It covers compilation and organization of shared concepts, contexts and instructions that would be heavily used in the organization’s lifetime. It also covers the methods and media to make said information available, such as through a&nbsp;website.</p><p>Narrative— This area pays attention to the narratives that shape perceptions of the organization inside and outside the organization. Internally narratives shape beliefs and culture, as well as motivate members of the organization to pursue shared goals every day. Externally the narrative about the existential identity of the organization inform how all stakeholders, including the general public, customers, users, partners, and investors, relate to the brand and organization.</p><p>Jurisdiction — focuses on public policy, legal enforcement and balancing them across multiple physical (and virtual) jurisdictions. It deals with ensuring compliance with the specific jurisdictions that an organizations decides to operate within. Most commonly and organization’s legal department, or external council, takes on this role, which requires an understanding of agreements and enforcement mechanisms.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/mapping-an-industry-47d6c75486c3">Mapping the industry</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity">Universal Identity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Shyft Network is a blockchain-based solution for centralized and decentralized technologies, like decentralized finance (DeFi). It’s a technology layer that aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on private and public ecosystems.</p><p>It essentially creates a protected data transaction layer for industry and the public sector, bringing, among other things, digital identity into the 21st century. In this article, we explore the Shyft Network technology and one of it’s most relevant use cases: compliant DeFi.</p> What Is&nbsp;Shyft? <p>In a hyper-networked world, effective online trust solutions can offer users and organizations sufficient protections while providing a framework in which all parties could be assured freedom from censorship, fraud, and unsanctioned use of shared&nbsp;data.</p><p>We believe that your information is only as secure as the weakest link in the chain of connected services and devices which handle it. That’s where Shyft Network comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>Shyft Network was designed as an interoperable standard for use cases that require multiparty trust and validation. We took a fundamentally different approach to data and identity thanks to its founders’ long history with Bitcoin, dating back to early&nbsp;2010.</p><blockquote>The Shyft Network enables identity verification, validation, and the sending of credentials and other data across multiple different blockchains and networks.</blockquote><p>The true goal of identity entails not having to give entities your information to verify who you are every time you open a new account. The question we asked is, How do you derive digital identity? We baked identity into the&nbsp;network.</p> Shyft Network never keeps or touches any personal identifiable information on the blockchain. <p>We ensure that privacy of the data itself is only stored across the participants with whom you already work. Since no data sits on the network, we created an encrypted way of validating institutions to certify or validate on your behalf without violating your&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Since Shyft manages identity information in a receipt-esque system, a digital receipt acts as proof that you have hitherto worked with another participant or entity on the network. Moreover, there’s a revocation process, where the protocol can invalidate a former receipt, depending on the compliance requirements, which differ across jurisdictions and situations.</p><p>With a focus on the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), as well as the KYC compliance issues that the blockchain ecosystem faces today, we’ve set out to ensure identity information is secure so that exchanges can forward customer data without violating privacy.</p><p>Technologically speaking, the Shyft Network’s identity solution can be thought of as an OAuth2-type interface for Web 2.0 and 3.0 applications with 2FA applications. Users can negotiate the exchange of their information, giving them control over their&nbsp;data.</p><p>By enabling the secure and auditable messaging between users and trusted parties, the Shyft Network empowers these parties to onboard new users in accordance with global compliance. The trusted parties can then, assuming user consent, send proof of relevant information about users to other parties by request. User data can be protected by their personally identifiable data through an opt-in framework.</p><blockquote>Our focus is on institutions and public networks. We work with everyone from banks, institutions, exchanges, regulatory bodies, as well as central banks and governments, bridging the crypto ecosystem to the traditional world.</blockquote> Who Uses&nbsp;Shyft? <p>The Shyft Network is composed of certain types of participants: Trust Anchors, Data Owners, Data Consumers, and Shyft Ring&nbsp;Nodes.</p> Trust Anchors <p>Trust Anchors custody regulated data, which they receive from consenting Data Owners, and maintain, review, read, write, confirm, and validate it. This data forms the basis of a user’s digital identity. Trust Anchors are regulated entities, such as financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, regulatory bodies, and social media networks, which can set their own rules and work with other actors in the Shyft Network ecosystem, while individuals enjoy data&nbsp;rights.</p> Data Consumers <p>Data Consumers are those third-party services that do not custody “hard data” and are not regarded as fully-trusted parties on the Shyft Network. Data Consumers will offer Data Owners pre-approved services that require attestations of trusted data. When they request information from the network, they pay a small fee to the Data Owners and Trust Anchors in exchange for the attested information.</p> Data Owners <p>Data Owners can be individuals or entities that sign up for a service at a Trust Anchor or Data Consumer. These individuals or entities have the authentication-based right to control, share, and revoke private data via their private keys. Only they have access to these private keys, and can grant access to their data via Shyft’s consent-based framework, whereby they are incentivized to share their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Data Owners receive offers from Data Consumers for pre-approved services that require proof of trusted data. Data Consumers pay a small fee to the Data Owners and Trust Anchors for valid information.</p> The Shyft&nbsp;Ring <p>The Shyft Ring is the public-facing blockchain-enabled software for global consensus. A fork of the Ethereum codebase, we’ve incorporated our own extensions. Shyft Ring participants validate the entire state of the network as local connection nodes for non-full-node users, and complete PoW hashes to propagate blocks and establish security. The validators are incentivized based on the workload distribution necessary for optimal efficiency of the Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p> Key Network&nbsp;Features  The Shyft Block&nbsp;Explorer <p>Certain blockchain networks rely on a single block explorer. Ethereum, for instance, relies upon just EtherScan. Shyft, however, provides all nodes on the network with the tools to launch their own block explorers. This removes a potential point of failure. The Shyft Block Explorer offers a feature set previously unavailable to the ecosystem, like the option to view the individual transactions that make up “internal transactions,” which composes a critical part of the token&nbsp;economy.</p> Smart Contracts <p>Many key network functions have been regulated by a set of purpose-built smart contracts. Certain contracts facilitate KYC/AML checks, ensuring the needs of cross-jurisdictional regulators and required compliant entities.</p> Shyft Safe <p>The Shyft Safe is a smart contract powered bookkeeping software to manage and protect assets on the network so that users’ can self-custody the assets. A Safe asset is cross-attested into multiple blockchains, and addresses data invalidity and single-point-of-failure problems.</p> The SHFT&nbsp;Token <p>SHFT fuels the Shyft Network; think of it as gas that powers the engine. SHFT is a means of payment, a mechanism for bonding value, and an instrument for governance value capture. SHFT, depending on the use case, can be utilized in a multitude of ways which includes a monetary instrument and value capture system, as well as an authorization system for long-term validation.</p><p>SHFT is a currency for identity and data transmission, as well as a governance mechanism for coordination across ecosystems that enables entity-to-entity governance, compliant asset creation, and a system for compliant defi and other applications. Enabling a new side of the existing ecosystem will drastically expand the size of market participants and increase the size of asset participation across all decentralized projects, protocols, and marketplaces.</p><p>You can read more on the SHFT token&nbsp;<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shft-token-15743ba0e2d8">here</a>.</p> Interoperability <p>We built the Shyft Network with interoperability in mind, ensuring our protocol would work across the existing applications in the Ethereum environment and other networks. Therefore, we’d also be able to gain from a lot of the innovation happening.</p><p>For instance, certain blockchains might serve different business logics better than others. That’s why the Shyft Network must be compatible across blockchains. Shyft’s interoperability bridging layer works across other networks to leverage the advantages that these networks&nbsp;hold.</p><p>We create the layer that assigns and proves data. Collaborative interoperability is paramount to the Shyft Network vision so that projects can work across diverse ecosystems and ensure that they conform to certain requirements when necessary.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/shyft-network-to-build-opt-in-compliance-primitives-on-the-oasis-network-393388c51f71">Here’s </a>one example of what Shyft Network can do for the Oasis&nbsp;Network.</p> Shyft Network Use Case — Introducing Compliant DeFi <p>Our goal is to create the premiere, compliant and scalable DeFi ecosystem across centralized and decentralized markets.</p><blockquote>Traditional financial institutions strictly adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Combating The Finance of Terrorism (CFT) guidelines. As permissionless, opt-in, trustless p2p networks without a central authority to enforce these requirements, blockchain-based networks often fail to do&nbsp;so.</blockquote> The Current&nbsp;Problem <p>The current DeFi ecosystem is prone to trust issues since participants conduct activities anonymously, violating compliance requirements imposed on financial institutions.</p>  Large Liquidity Providers are blocked from interacting with the DeFi space because of regulatory constraints and lack of clarity on existing and upcoming regulations which requires them to obtain information on the source and destination of&nbsp;funds.  Similarly, platforms within the DeFi space are blocked from accessing deeper capital markets because of the small opportunity space relative to the total potential addressable market assuming regulatory compatibility.  Regulators are forced to comprehend the space through the lens of (potentially obsolete/irrelevant) loosely-matching, past environments that regulations have applied to previously.   The Shyft Network solution for&nbsp;DeFi   Identity Verification. We provide an opt-in framework for gathering, storing, and sharing user identification data on a need-by basis. Our platform acts as a trust anchor and a bridge between users, DeFi platforms, and centralized organizations by providing the required data in a secure manner. <br>We can facilitate trustless transactions in a decentralized environment by helping the parties to comply with all the regulatory requirements imposed on centralized systems. The platform achieves this by acting as a Trust Anchor that validates the personal data and transaction details by publishing their proof on the blockchain.  Creation of Compliant Assets and Asset Pools. Only verified individuals and organizations will be able to create compliant DeFi assets and asset pools such as loans, liquidity pools, derivatives, governance tokens etc.<br>The Shyft Network can function as a validator for DeFi participants. Verified players will have their addresses whitelisted, enabling them to participate, create, and have access to compliant assets.<br>Malicious and suspicious actors will be blacklisted as a precaution to other users, which is aimed at minimizing risk.  Compliant Decentralized Credit Scoring. As part of its continuous development plan for 2021/2022, Shyft Network plans to deploy a blockchain-based credit scoring method that relies on users’ data stored on nodes rather than using their credit scores from the legacy financial system.  <p>This framework will help generate better credit scores for an open and independent DeFi ecosystem. Our goal is to tackle the over-collateralization problem in DeFi, improve access to credit, and open the door for legacy lending institutions’ entry into the ecosystem.</p><p>Shyft empowers users to take data and assign or validate it against multiple different participants. It is a network based on trust so participants can derive identity or data for compliance requirements, and much more, so that crypto can thrive in the traditional world.</p><p>Bring crypto to the world with Shyft, and join the network&nbsp;today.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote>

<p>While the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems are eagerly waiting for parachain auctions, we at KILT Protocol are preparing to secure one of the first Kusama parachain slots and then launch our mainnet. Today we are happy to announce our new releases of the KILT <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/mashnet-node/releases">mashnet-node 0.24.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sdk-js/releases">SDK 0.20.0</a> as the next phase of our development.</p><p>The mashnet-node received a second runtime for the parachain and multiple updates to run on Rococo using the newest version of Substrate (3.0.0). The SDK was multilaterally improved and restructured by splitting it into several separate packages.</p> Mashnet-node: It’s parachain time! <p>These consecutive updates of our Substrate blockchain were required to sync with the official Rococo parachain testnet. Rococo has been rebooted multiple times and always required us to be on the bleeding-edge of Substrate and&nbsp;Cumulus.</p><p>Apart from that, we made major improvements to the readability and structure of three of our KILT pallets: Attestations, Delegations and DIDs. On the one hand, we refactored the on-chain data types to be distinct Structs instead of tuples. On the other hand, we replaced our custom error pallet with Substrate errors and improved the order of checking for&nbsp;these.</p><p>Moreover, we added benchmarking to all our extrinsics. During this process, we had to introduce two limits for revoking Attestations and Delegations. You now have to specify up to which limit you enable the transaction to recursively check for the parent delegation until it matches the owner of the delegation you would like to revoke. Since revoking a Delegation automatically revokes all of its children recursively, you also have to submit such a limit for the number of children. We require both these bounds in order to be able to calculate the transactions fees and weights correctly.</p> SDK: Split it&nbsp;up! <p>After switching to <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp">yarn v2 berry,</a> we decided to make use of the supported workspaces and split up the SDK into multiple packages, at least some of which are independent of each other. This enables builders to pick the exact packages they need from our SDK when they want to build on top of it, and reduces the overhead (bundle size, required dependencies etc.) of requiring the entire SDK. Moreover, we can version each package separately.</p> SDK: Transaction improvements <p>We enabled multi-transactions which allow you to trigger blockchain transactions successively in one go, e.g. you are not required to wait for one transaction to finish before calling the next one. This is accomplished by counting up the next nonce on the client-side, if possible, and by resigning transactions if the returned error from the chain is recoverable</p><p>In addition, we made all our transactions explicit. Whereas before you implicitly submitted a signed transaction when storing an Attestation or CType, revoking an Attestation or making any kind of transfer, you are now rather generating an SubmittableExtrinsic. Upon signing and submitting this, the transaction is then executed on the blockchain.</p> SDK: Add Config Service &amp; improve chain connection <p>We introduced a new Config Service that can be used to configure the node address to which you want to connect and set the log level, for now. In the future, this will be expanded whenever we introduce new configurations.</p><p>As a result, you no longer need to (and also cannot) provide an address parameter to the connection function Kilt.connect(). Instead, the configured address will automatically be&nbsp;used.</p> SDK: Use sr25519 as default identity key pair&nbsp;type <p>Whereas in our last release we added the support for <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-keys#what-is-sr25519-and-where-did-it-come-from">sr25519</a> and ECDSA signatures, we have now switched our default identity key pair type from ed25519 to sr25519. We are mainly following the direction of Polkadot. Another motivation was that it is much easier to create an sr25519-based account in the polkadot.js apps or polkadot.js browser extension. Of course, ed25519 is still supported by adding it as an option to the identity&nbsp;builder.</p><p>Since sr25519 relies on polkadot.js crypto functions, which themselves rely on an included WASM library, you need to wait for the crypto library to be ready. Thus, we added this wait to our initialization function KILT.init({…}) which combines the configuration functionality of KILT.config with asynchronously waiting until the crypto library is&nbsp;ready.</p> SDK: Add message (de-) compression <p>Another feature we have added is the possibility to compress and decompress messages. As these can be used for communication between Claimers, Attesters and Verifiers, it is important for them to be shrinkable.</p> SDK: Switch to JSON-LD based hashing algorithm <p>During the preparation of the VC-Export package we found a potential exploit where labels could be re-ordered and still lead to the same root hash. This was fixed by switching to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD">JSON-LD</a> based property hashing algorithm.</p> SDK: Remove portablegabi <p>Lastly, we decided to remove our experimental anonymous credential feature “portablegabi” which we introduced in our last release. The main reason is that the portablegabi library handles its cryptography in a Go-Wasm binary which can only be called asynchronously via callbacks. As a result, the instantiation of identities and other protocol functions had to be made asynchronous as well. Moreover, the Go-Wasm binary caused issues when using the SDK in applications like React&nbsp;Native.</p><p>This was a disappointment not only for us but also for other teams that build on top of KILT. We are already investigating alternative solutions and will keep you posted on our effort to incorporate an anonymous credential solution (which won’t be portablegabi). But this is a non-critical feature and thus won’t be part of the launch candidate. For now, our focus is to launch the KILT chain with secure code and an easy-to-use SDK.</p> Outlook   Majorly improve documentation by gathering all documentation combined in one place: <a href="https://dev.kilt.io/">https://dev.kilt.io</a>  Prepare release candidates for the chain&nbsp;launch  Do security audits for mashnet-node and&nbsp;SDK  Mashnet node: Add governance and&nbsp;staking  SDK: Improve KILT’s usage and compliance of/with DIDs and&nbsp;VCs   TLDR; <p>Mashnet-node updated from Substrate 2.0.0-rc5 to 3.0.0 (<a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/mashnet-node/releases">release&nbsp;notes</a>):</p>  Added separate parachain runtime  Added proper benchmarking  Improved recursion checks for Delegations  Simplified how to run a&nbsp;node  Cleaned up, updated and improved documentation  <p>SDK was split into multiple separate packages (<a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sdk-js/releases">release&nbsp;notes</a>):</p>  Switched to yarn v2&nbsp;berry  Improved handling of transactions, blockchain connection and&nbsp;logging  Switched default account keytype to sr25519 from&nbsp;ed25519  Fixed potential hashing exploit by using JSON-LD based property hashing algorithm  Removed experimental anonymous credential feature portablegabi  Added message compression and decompression

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>STG <a href="https://stgpartners.com/2021/03/08/mcafee-announces-sale-of-enterprise-business-to-symphony-technology-group-for-4-0-billion/" title="announced">announced</a> that they intend to acquire McAfee’s enterprise business for around $4B. The McAfee brand will continue to operate and focus on consumer cybersecurity. STG will pick up MVISION, Global Threat Intelligence, database security, unified endpoint security, CASB, CSPM, CWPP, DLP, SIEM, SWG, XDR, and policy management products and services.</p>
<p>STG <a href="https://stgpartners.com/2020/09/01/rsa-emerges-as-independent-company-following-completion-of-acquisition-by-symphony-technology-group/" title="picked up">picked up</a> RSA from Dell in September 2020. When the deal closed, STG stated that RSA would remain independent and would pursue growth in their most successful product lines: Archer, SecurID, NetWitness, and the Fraud &amp; Risk Intelligence suite. These products cover risk management, compliance, authentication, access control, single sign-on, identity governance, fraud reduction, EDR/NDR/XDR, SIEM, SOAR, and UBA.</p>
<p>In 2019, STG <a href="https://stgpartners.com/2019/04/10/redseal-announces-equity-investment-from-stg-partners/" title="became majority owner">became majority owner</a> of RedSeal, which offers security solutions for cloud, compliance, and vulnerability management.</p>
<p>STG is clearly making a major investment in cybersecurity technologies. For now, there are no indications that these companies will be merged. However, that may change after the transaction is finalized for four major reasons:</p>
 
 Functional overlaps between products: software development and maintenance costs are redundant in those areas and lead to less profitability. 
 In areas where these overlaps exist, there are product and innovation leaders and challengers. Combining capabilities into single products could make them much stronger and more competitive in the market. 
 The breadth of coverage that these products and services provide could be integrated into a suite that enable cross-selling and up-selling for current customers of each separate brand. 
 CIOs and CISOs, the buyers of these kinds of products, generally prefer integrated stack solutions to a multiplicity of point solutions. They’re easier to manage contractually and can be more cost-effective for enterprise customers. 
 
<p>To summarize: With the broad set of technologies owned by the various companies, there is a potential for building stronger, more integrated solutions and services and positioning the entity as a one-stop-shopping for major areas within cybersecurity. This will require a vision and well-thought-out strategy, underpinned by a roadmap that is consequently executed. However, with the obvious synergies across the portfolio, there is a strong potential if the various companies become fully integrated. We rate this potential as way higher than the inherent risks of any merger.</p>
<p>For existing customers, there is no immediate need for action. If the companies do not integrate and innovate, you should revisit the tools you have in place on whether they still meet your business requirements. This should be done for all software and services regularly anyway as part of a recurring portfolio review and optimization process.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an integrated approach, if done right, will enable these companies to attract more new customers and thus grow in the market.</p>

   Unite On-Prem, Cloud, and SaaS Environments With Hybrid IAM 

<p>Cloud identity and access management (IAM) is a fast-growing trend that is predicted to extend well into the future. For example, <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/global-cloud-iam-market-size-and-forecast-to-2025/">Verified Market Research</a> alone projects that, by 2027, the market for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud IAM</a> will be more than $14 billion.</p>

<p>Yet, while the cloud-based IAM market is exploding, the reality is not all roses.</p>

<p>In our last IAM 101 post, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/iam-101-series-what-are-hybrid-it-and-hybrid-cloud">What are Hybrid IT and Hybrid Cloud?</a>, we discussed the differences, benefits, and disadvantages of hybrid IT and hybrid cloud. In this post, we’ll quickly recap these challenges as they pertain to IAM. We’ll then dive into how to solve them efficiently with hybrid IAM and wrap up with how to differentiate hybrid IAM against other solutions on the market.</p>

<p>Let’s get started.</p>

 IAM Challenges Within Hybrid IT and Hybrid Cloud Architectures 

<p>From an IAM perspective, the main challenges posed by hybrid IT and hybrid cloud architectures is that they typically consist of multiple separated environments and a combination of home-grown, legacy, and modern IAM systems. However, on-premises IAM systems don’t have the capabilities to meet cloud requirements, and cloud-based IAM systems don't have the capabilities required to adapt to on-premises business processes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disjointed on-premises and cloud-based IAM systems result in siloed and duplicated identities. This makes it difficult to identify and monitor high-risk user access enterprise-wide. And, unknown risk awareness can lead to potential data breaches, fines, and other financial consequences, as well as reputational damage. Additionally, multiple disjointed IAM systems can hinder the ability to provide seamless user experiences, innovate, and move at the speed of business.</p>

<blockquote>On-premises IAM systems don’t have the capabilities to meet cloud requirements, and cloud-based IAM systems don't have the capabilities required to adapt to on-premises business processes.</blockquote>

<p>What’s the solution? A single IAM platform capable of running, managing, and unifying digital identities across on-premises and cloud environments with hybrid IT. Introducing hybrid IAM.</p>

 Unite and Secure Hybrid IT Environments With Hybrid IAM&nbsp; 

<p>Eliminating identity silos and duplicates across hybrid IT and hybrid cloud environments is critical for security, as well as for positive user experiences. Hybrid IAM is an IAM platform capable of running, unifying, and securing all digital identities across hybrid IT and hybrid cloud architectures.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>Hybrid IAM is an IAM platform capable of running, unifying, and securing all digital identities across hybrid IT and hybrid cloud architectures.</blockquote>

 3 Benefits of Hybrid IAM 

  Cost Savings: By having a single IAM platform that can run across hybrid IT and hybrid cloud architectures, you gain the flexibility to determine and control how much of your IAM infrastructure is on premises versus in the cloud at any given point. This means you can move to the cloud at your own pace without worrying about additional future IAM costs (such as migration and maintenance) or the impact it may have on user experience. 
	 Improved User Experiences: By unifying siloed identity information with a hybrid IAM platform, you can deliver a seamless and consistent user experience at any scale for any identity – no matter where the user (<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">customer</a> or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">employee</a>) identity, service, or application is located within the hybrid IT architecture. 
	 Uncompromised Security: By adding user and device context to authentication, including the ability to continuously authorize every transaction across your enterprise, hybrid IAM enables you to quickly adopt <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero-Trust and CARTA</a> (Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment) strategies. Additionally, you can&nbsp; centralize identities to improve audit and compliance with full user lifecycle management. 
  How to Differentiate IAM Providers for Hybrid IAM 

<p>When evaluating the IAM market for solutions that will solve your hybrid IT and hybrid cloud environments, it’s critical to know how to differentiate the solutions being offered.&nbsp;</p>

  Cloud-Only and Cloud-Native IAM Solutions: It’s important to note that cloud-only and cloud-native IAM solutions only run in the public cloud. This means that you’d have to move your IAM control plane to the cloud before you start realizing the value of this type of solution. Another key consideration is support for your many on-premises business-critical legacy applications and the business processes and customizations that rely on them. Unfortunately, cloud-only/cloud-native solutions leave you short in this category. 
 <blockquote>Cloud-only or cloud-native IAM solutions are not hybrid IAM. They only run in the public cloud and cannot support your business-critical applications on premises.</blockquote>

  Same IAM Vendor, Disparate Cloud and On-Premises Solutions: Some IAM providers claim that they have a hybrid offering. However their cloud and on-premises offerings are very different products. In order to cover your on-premises, cloud, and as-a-service environments, you would need to spend precious resources and time learning two or more products. You’d also have to run and maintain two different solutions, which can lead to less-than-ideal user experiences.&nbsp; 
	 Hybrid IAM Solutions: Hybrid IAM is a single IAM platform capable of running, unifying, and securing all digital identities across hybrid IT and hybrid cloud architectures. Hybrid IAM allows:
	  Cohesive coexistence and complete freedom to transition to cloud without disruption. 
		 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">IAM modernizatio</a>n with no impact to business-critical on-premises applications. 
		 Flexibility and configurability to adapt to on-premises and cloud business processes. 
	  
 <p>Currently, there’s only one true hybrid IAM solution on the market. It’s made available through <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a>, which includes our complete platform delivered as-a-service with the option to also self-manage as software and deploy anywhere. All of this is offered with a single subscription and simplified pricing model. The net-net? With Identity Cloud you’re able to cover all your on-premises, private, and public clouds, as well as as-a-service environments with one comprehensive solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spurred by an Explosion of Use Cases and High ETH Fees, Civic Joins Growing Solana Ecosystem</p>



<p>Civic Brings Digital Identity to the Future of Blockchain,&nbsp;Prioritizing Low Fees, Speed and Scalability</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO (March 11, 2021) — Civic, a leading innovator in digital identity solutions, today announced a technology integration with Solana, a project implementing a new, high-performance, permissionless blockchain. The collaboration will allow for improved privacy, regulatory compliance and ease-of-use as digital identity takes center stage as the cornerstone of the new wave of consumer-first blockchain infrastructure.</p>



<p>“Early blockchains have been good testing grounds, but with high fees and slow transactions, many consumers and applications are simply priced out of the ecosystem,” said Vinny Lingham, co-founder and CEO of Civic. “Now, with Solana, we’re making identity foundational to the blockchain and broader ecosystem that’s ready for the future and built to scale for mainstream consumption.”</p>



<p>Currently, high ETH transaction fees are blocking mainstream adoption of DeFi. These high rates more than erase any returns for the average investor, making investment in the ecosystem unattractive and unsustainable. Solana’s low fees scale as the ecosystem grows, and with Civic’s identity-based key management, key recovery and practical experience, Civic will help make financial tools more accessible to mainstream consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the identity elements Civic is bringing to the Solana ecosystem for any project to leverage, the company is also building a consumer friendly gateway to DeFi on Solana starting with a wallet experience that enhances the vision started with their mobile app on Ethereum. The wallet will offer intuitive design, identity-backed key management and a safe place to store tokens. Because of Solana’s technology, the wallet will be high-speed and have low transaction fees. The company plans to eventually merge the new wallet with its existing mobile Civic Wallet. Civic believes that identity will be a necessity for businesses in Solana’s ecosystem in order to comply with global regulations in the near future if DeFi is to truly scale for mainstream consumer adoption. These new products will offer more privacy and a more secure experience for DeFi products and other application layer technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Civic uses Identity.com’s open-source identity verification ecosystem to power its identity products. Identity.com recently announced <a href="https://www.identity.com/embedding-identity-into-the-blockchain-with-solana/">its own integration with Solana</a>, focusing on refining decentralized identities and the next version of its marketplace. Together, the organizations are building consumer-first, privacy focused frameworks for better compliance and regulation, so that more safeguards may be brought in as the industry scales.</p>



<p>“Identity verification is a key component of the web2 stack, and I am thrilled to see companies like Civic building to support a decentralized web3 world.” said Anatoly Yakovenko, President of the Solana Foundation.</p>



<p>As leaders in the decentralized identity space, Civic is focused on a few real-world applications of its blockchain-powered technology. When a user signs up with Civic Wallet, they are authenticated as a real person by securely verifying their identifiable information and incorporating groundbreaking blockchain-based technology. Once they have a Civic Wallet, users are able to selectively share parts of their verified identity with third parties, for example, purchasing age-restricted products anonymously. The company also recently launched a flexible <a href="https://www.civic.com/">identity verification product</a> that helps organizations verify identity quickly with minimal integration.</p>



<p>Solana is a fast, low-cost Layer-1 blockchain designed to scale with advancements in hardware technology. Currently, Solana can handle up to 50,000 tps with sub-second finality and transaction fees as low as $0.00001. By comparison, Ethereum supports a maximum of 15 transactions per second. Most importantly, Solana’s blazing speed and low fees scale as the ecosystem grows without sacrificing censorship resistance or security. Solana has already seen growing interest in the DeFi space with established DEXes and AMMs, such as <a href="https://projectserum.com/">Serum</a> and <a href="https://raydium.io/#/">Raydium</a>, already processing billions of user transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About Civic Technologies</p>



<p>As leaders in the decentralized identity space, Civic is focused on a few real-world applications of its blockchain-powered technology. The company offers flexible identity verification technology for businesses and is using digital identity as a gateway for decentralized finance on the Solana blockchain. Civic uses identity.com’s open-source, blockchain-based ecosystem to verify credentials. Civic was co-founded in 2015 by serial entrepreneurs Vinny Lingham and Jonathan Smith.</p>



<p>About Solana</p>



<p>Solana is a high-performance Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain focused on delivering scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security.</p>



<p>Until now, blockchains have been single-threaded computers, guaranteeing no two transactions conflict if executed in parallel. Solana unlocks concurrent GPU-parallelization for the first time, using <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fsolana-labs%2F7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda&amp;esheet=52302773&amp;newsitemid=20201008005380&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Proof+of+History&amp;index=9&amp;md5=164f8f8a07b1e1f31657a58e672464f5">Proof of History</a> (PoH), a clock before consensus, delivering high speed, low latency, and inexpensive transactions, all at layer 1 without sharding. </p>

<p>Today, Civic announced news that it is integrating with Solana blockchain. We were founded on the belief that everyone should have more control, access and privacy when it comes to their personal data. With the visionary, lightning fast, scalable Solana platform, we believe we finally have the opportunity to make identity work the way it should, as a cornerstone of blockchain infrastructure. For us, this means giving consumers an upgraded experience across the board.</p>



<p>As a startup, and as with any good business, we make progress by prioritizing our resources. For Civic, prioritizing the Solana integration means making a trade-off with another workstream. That’s why we’ve made the tough call to halt the development of our Covid-19 vaccination projects, and today we’re bittersweet to announce that we are sunsetting Health Key by Civic.</p>



<p>Last summer, when we announced Health Key by Civic, the path forward in getting the world back to work, school and daily life was unclear. Now, as the vaccine continues to roll out and variant strains develop, the way forward has continued to unfold through large, established companies and trade associations that have stepped in to fill the void. While we still know there’s a need and desire for privacy and protection when it comes to sensitive personal data, we believe that Civic’s strengths and competitive advantages will fare better in another industry. And, with the underlying power of the Solana blockchain driving our technology, we believe that Civic will be better positioned to serve&nbsp; as a gateway to the next wave of financial products.</p>



<p>So, as we bid adieu to our Health Key by Civic solution, we are proud to stand firmly with our new direction, which we believe will take Civic and identity verification to an even greater future.</p>

<p>#ThrowbackThursday</p>



<p>If medical innovators can find a way to promote trusted data-sharing that patients have control over, a world of possibility will open for more proactive and effective healthcare using IoT, AI and other enablers, says J Cromack,&nbsp;Co-founder&nbsp;and MD of&nbsp;MyLife&nbsp;Digital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The opportunities for healthcare providers to harness the latest technology and make smarter use of data are boundless.&nbsp;From pre-empting patient conditions before symptoms worsen to targeting treatments more effectively, using everything from connected ‘wearable’ devices to artificial intelligence to look for the tiniest clues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As health records that include medical images are captured digitally, and as more individuals willingly wear devices that monitor basic health signals, it becomes possible to build up a rich, connected and evolving picture of someone’s health – and trigger alerts and actions if something in the data is awry. Together, personal health apps, real-time data analytics and artificial intelligence offer a new way to think about keeping people well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s hard to imagine any downside to this – other than concerns about keeping one’s personal data safe. Medical information is among the special categories of personal data requiring careful handling under the new EU General Data Protection Regulation&nbsp;(GDPR). But address this successfully, and secure patients’ trust, and the doors to innovative new approaches to their care can swing open – to the advantage of everyone.&nbsp;</p>



 Freedom through control&nbsp; 



<p>Although tightening regulatory controls under GDPR may have set pulses racing among those tasked with safeguarding patient data, they have created an impetus to find robust approaches to personal data. Approaches that stay relevant well into the future and don’t conflict with other strategic priorities – such as improving the quality of care, driving up patient safety and doing all of this within shrinking budgets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most effective and powerful ways to stay safely within the parameters of GDPR without restricting healthcare innovation, is to make it easier for patients themselves to understand, view and have more granular control of what happens to their data. A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group found that people were much more willing to share their data if they felt confident that harmful use would be prevented&nbsp;1. Yet, as things stand, just 5 per cent of people in the UK fully grasp what personal data is being kept about them and only 4 per cent believe they have sufficient control over this, according to our own independent research conducted in April.&nbsp;</p>



 Transparency engenders trust&nbsp; 



<p>Fortunately, there is a way to address this and drive confident, compliant sharing of data that could unlock new patient benefits. While GDPR’s aim is to substantially shore up individuals’ rights over their data, it does not inherently pose barriers to data being used to its best effect. Rather, it demands that&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;are proactive and specific in&nbsp;signalling&nbsp;their intent. Then, on an ongoing basis, people must have the opportunity to review their data and how it is being used, and to adjust their permissions based on what feels comfortable and acceptable to them in the prevailing circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sense from recent studies is that the more people feel in control of their data, the more amenable they will be to give permission for its use – as long as they perceive a benefit. In the context of healthcare, if patients feel their personal information won’t be abused but could result in better, more proactive and joined-up care, then there is a strong case for consent to data share, especially when related to some of the new healthcare applications that sit outside of the usual clinical circles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this does place the onus on healthcare&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;to equip patients with the tools to view their data and to exercise their rights under GDPR. Patients are likely to be more hesitant about what they agree to if kept at one step removed. But give them easy access to their data and the means to exercise their data rights whenever they want, and patients’ sense of buy-in will increase; that is, their willingness to share their data for specified purposes.&nbsp;</p>



 Digital diabetes management shows the way&nbsp; 



<p>It’s in this context that&nbsp;MyLife&nbsp;Digital is providing the personal-data management capabilities for the Diabetes Digital Coach test-bed – one of seven high-profile NHS England pilot projects targeting 5.5m diabetes sufferers. The aim is to equip them to manage their condition better using digital tools and data. Funded under the NHS Internet of Things (IoT)&nbsp;programme, the platform will go live this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crucially, patients are completely in the driving seat. They can choose whether to share their data and with whom. Permissions are managed in a secure, central, cloud-based personal data ‘strongbox’. This can sit across any number of health-related or administration-based IT systems and connect to patient websites, mobile apps and even wearable devices. It acts&nbsp;as a single window to, an individual’s data permissions&nbsp;and enables control and audit of that information. In the great balancing act of data-based service innovation versus data-based privacy safeguarding, it’s this emphasis on an individual’s control over their own data that promises to overcome concerns and unlock public benefits.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>On Wednesday March 10th at 1am in the morning a fire started <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/faits-divers/strasbourg-important-incendie-sur-le-site-de-l-entreprise-ovh-classe-seveso-20210310" title="that destroyed a major data centre ">that destroyed a major data centre</a> that provides cloud services from <a href="https://www.ovh.ie/news/press/cpl1786.fire-our-strasbourg-site" title="OVHcloud">OVHcloud</a>. Thankfully no one was injured but this should be a wake up call for cloud service users to check that they have factored the use of cloud services into their business continuity plans.</p>
 Digital Transformation must include Business Continuity Planning 
<p>As organizations go through digital transformation, they increasingly turn to using cloud services.&nbsp; These allow them to develop new applications and create new ways of doing business without the need for capital expenditure or procurement delays.&nbsp; However, digital transformation also increases the dependency of the organization on these new digital services.&nbsp; One aspect of the digital transformation plan that is often forgotten is ensuring business continuity.</p>
<p>A key objective of IT services is that systems, data, and applications are available to authorized users when and where they are needed. The requirements for availability and the consequences of non-availability are increased by digital transformation.</p>
 Responsibilities are shared 
<p>Organizations often believe that because their applications are running in the cloud their data is automatically backed up and that the cloud service is always on.&nbsp; Neither of these assumptions is correct.&nbsp; The responsibility for security and compliance is shared between the tenant and the CSP (Cloud Service Provider).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CSP provides an SLA for the availability of their service and the tenant is always responsible for their data.&nbsp; Typical SLAs by major CSPs are around 99.99% - that may seem very high but that could mean on average 52 minutes per year that the service is not available.&nbsp; That does not include the additional time that you may need to reconfigure and restart your business-critical applications after an outage.</p>
<p>CSPs take significant steps to protect their tenants’ data including holding the data on multiple physical devices. However, if the service holding the data is down you may not be able to access it.&nbsp; In addition, if you delete the data by mistake you cannot expect the CSP to recognise this was an error.</p>
 Many possible causes 
<p>Natural disasters: earthquakes, floods and fires could have long term consequences on cloud service data centres.&nbsp; Loss of power or other utilities could render the cloud service unavailable. &nbsp;Access to the cloud service as well as the service itself depends upon communications systems which are also vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are actually 4 buildings on that site, and these appear to provide some form of co-hosting rather than being pure cloud.&nbsp; Only one of the buildings was completely destroyed but the impact of the incident has spread to services in the other buildings.&nbsp; This emphasises the need to look at physical locations and what exactly is meant by availability zones carefully when planning.</p>
 End to End Service 
<p>Use of a cloud service depends upon the infrastructure needed being available from end to end. Not only must the equipment and services at the CSP be operational, but the network and the customer equipment must also be available and working. Therefore, the cloud customer, as well as the CSP, needs to ensure the availability of components under their control as well as including cloud services in their business continuity plans.</p>
 Tenant Responsibilities 
<p>Our <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an72561/cloud-services-and-security/" title="advice to users of cloud services">advice to users of cloud services</a> is:</p>
 
 Ensure that the level of availability specified for the service meets the business requirements. 
 Include the end-to-end infrastructure and any on-premises elements involved and not just the cloud service in this assessment.

<p>The Law Gazette&nbsp;1&nbsp;has suggested that the UK Government has made&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;first statement that there will be a move away from the GDPR following the appointment of a new Information Commissioner later this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whilst it is difficult to see how realistic that is from the article, the comments made by the culture secretary Oliver Dowden could be seen both as supportive and detractive.&nbsp;He&nbsp;expects&nbsp;the new Commissioner to ‘focus not just on privacy but on the use of data for ‘economic and social goals’.</p>



<p>This can be done within the existing regulation, the problem&nbsp;to date&nbsp;has been as Dowden rightly points out:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>‘Too many businesses and organisations are reluctant to use data – either because they don’t understand the rules or are afraid of inadvertently breaking&nbsp;them.’&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>We believe that the&nbsp;current regulation gives organisations enough scope to use data for mutual benefit for both organisations and&nbsp;society as a whole. The big issue noted by the culture secretary is the lack of understanding of how to interpret and implement the rules that is hindering business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope that the remit of the incoming Commissioner is not to diminish the rules around organisations’ use of data but to provide more timely&nbsp;and practical&nbsp;guidance on how to gain value from data held whilst maintaining its protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the limited information available, it is unclear whether the UK will move away from&nbsp;a regime that currently gives us&nbsp;adequacy across Europe. We also need to be mindful that it is not just Europe that maintains data protection regulations and that there are international treaties that require such protections. We will be watching this closely to see which way it&nbsp;heads. </p>

<p>Barbados, March 10, 2021 — <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a>, the blockchain-based identity verification platform that enables compliant DeFi for institutions, has completed its latest sale round with major industry participants including Spartan Group, Coinfund and GSR. The sale garnered a lot of interest from both blockchain and crypto-based users.</p><p>The star-studded roster of participants includes Spartan Group, Bitfury, Blockchange, Morningstar Ventures, CoinFund, BlockTower, Maven 11, Connect Capital, GSR, Bering Waters, LD Capital, Ybb.io, CoinIX, TRG Capital, and Digital Finance&nbsp;Group.</p><p>What is Shyft&nbsp;Network?</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> is a public blockchain protocol designed to aggregate and embed trust and validation into data stored on public and private ecosystems, and permissioned and permissionless networks. By facilitating bridging across siloed datasets, Shyft allows for layering of context on top of data, ultimately turning raw data into meaningful information.</p><p>Shyft Network is developing regulatory-compliant tools for Decentralized Finance that bridge the gap for centralized and decentralized organizations to ease their entry into the blockchain space. The goal is to aid mainstream financial institutions venture into DeFi and participate in a compliant manner. By lowering risk and exposure to money laundering, the Shyft Network could open up the crypto industry to large capital inflows and, potentially, millions of users from the mainstream markets.</p><blockquote>“We’re excited to announce our support for Shyft. The Shyft platform can bring some of the fastest growing and creative segments of crypto to institutional audiences. We are looking forward to providing strategic backing, and building compliant infrastructure for the DeFi ecosystem. We believe it’s likely that DeFi will need scalable KYC solutions if it is to disrupt financial services on a global scale”. — Cristian Gil, Co-Founder, <a href="https://www.gsr.io/">GSR&nbsp;Markets</a></blockquote><p>Additionally, Shyft Network has been developing identity solutions that help centralized and decentralized applications become compliant with existing regulations. In this regard, they have partnered with various other entities in the space, notably virtual asset services providers (VASPs) who must comply with the FATF Travel Rule. Veriscope, Shyft Network’s proactive approach to regulatory compliance, has been applauded for its ability to bring together some of the most prominent liquidity providers in the space and to accelerate the potential mass adoption of decentralized applications.</p><p>Shyft Network’s Compliant DeFi&nbsp;Solution</p><p>This value proposition largely explains the huge interest in the Shyft Network. The platform is offering a much-needed and long-anticipated identity validation solution, that aims to open up the crypto space to mainstream institutions and&nbsp;users.</p><blockquote>“A compliance solution structured as a decentralized network is a natural fit for both networks and their centralized participants. Shyft’s early traction powerfully showcases the advantages of this approach for identity data management and transfer solutions.” — Oleg Golubov, Partner <a href="https://www.coinfund.io/">CoinFund</a>.</blockquote><p>The team behind Shyft Network agreed with this position, with their co-founder saying:</p><blockquote>“We are incredibly excited to be building the next generation of compliant DeFi solutions for the entire world; having the validation and support of these participants inspires us to do more, to deliver something truly game-changing” — Chris Forrester, Co-Founder and CTO, Shyft Network&nbsp;Inc.</blockquote><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote>

 <p>Data theft is a reality. Forgetting passwords is your daily life. This guide from <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a>, the French open source password manager, presents steps you can easily implement to minimize the impact of data theft and tips to keep you safe online in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p>And don't forget: it's 2021, you've been using the password Mom1234 or Post-it notes for years so it's high time to change it.</p>
 You should use a password manager 
<p>We all have our own way of remembering our passwords: the same password everywhere, post-it notes, a google doc or even your year's calendar. Some use variations of the same password depending on the website, others save them on their browser. The method you have chosen may be just right for you. And changing your online habits is not always easy.</p>
<p>However, using a password manager such as <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a>, Dashlane, LastPass, 1Password or Keepass is becoming more and more common.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: it's a tool that does its job perfectly.</p>
 Find out what makes Cozy Pass different from other options available on the web 
<p>While storing your passwords in your browser may seem like the easiest solution, it doesn't always offer the ability to sync your keychain to find it wherever you need it, on your phone or on the go.</p>
<p>The "Sign in with Gmail" option and other social network login options make you dependent on platforms that use this option to collect more and more data about your habits. Password managers are the most secure option.</p>
<p>Unlike other solutions, password managers automatically enter your login, personal and payment information, saving you a lot of time.</p>
 The only universal solution 
<p>At the launch of <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a>, some Cozy users told us that they were already using the Apple Keychain or Chrome, and that they didn't see the need for a password manager.</p>
<p>When you're surfing the web, a pop-up window appears asking you to save the password, and you click yes or no. When you come back to the web later, you'll see a pop-up window asking you to save the password. When you come back to this page later, your password may be saved.</p>
<p>But you'll run into a problem when you try to log into an account from your iPhone while browsing the web with Safari. The passwords you saved on Chrome are then not available. Even worse, the passwords saved in Keychain may be different! You might even find yourself in a situation where you reset a password because you can't access a certain account, which makes the password registered in Chrome invalid.</p>
<p>This situation can drive you crazy and is not sustainable over time.</p>
<p>Maybe you use Chrome at home, but if your company network only allows Internet Explorer or Firefox, your passwords stay "at home".</p>
<p>Users of <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a> can easily access all their passwords on all platforms, whether they use a PC for work, a Mac at home, an Android device or an iPhone. Cozy Pass works on all devices and all browsers. So your passwords follow you wherever you go. No black boxes. No duplicates. Only you have control over it.</p>
<p>What you need to remember: With our personal and professional lives becoming more and more digital, where the vast majority of people use several devices in different ecosystems, a password management solution that wants to be effective must work everywhere, which is the case of the various password managers available on the market.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the differences and advantages of each one.</p>
 The different password managers 
<p>Cozy Pass is a password manager integrated to a <a href="https://cozy.io/en">private and secure personal cloud, Cozy</a>. French and open source developed by Cozy Cloud, your passwords are encrypted from end to end of all data stored and hosted in France.</p>
<p></p>Auto-fill with Cozy Pass<p></p>
 
 
<p>it saves and fills in all your passwords in one click when you browse the Internet,</p>
 
 
<p>it synchronizes your passwords between your computers, browsers and phone: they are now accessible at any time and from anywhere,</p>
 
 
<p>it simplifies the recovery of your data within your Cozy by proposing you the brands to connect for which you already have an account,</p>
 
 
<p>it avoids manual handling when you change your password: the connector configured within your Cozy will immediately receive the update,</p>
 
 
<p>it easily imports your passwords stored in your browser or in another manager</p>
 
 
<p>it uses an open-source and audited protocol from <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>. No black box effect!</p>
 
 
<p>it enters for you the right identifiers each time you browse the web and simplifies your online shopping!</p>
 
 
<p>last but not least, your passwords and other data are hosted on French servers.</p>
 
 
<p>Managing passwords is not just about saving a few of them so you don't have to type them in again. Password management is about taking back control of your digital life and therefore of your online sites. This is already the mission of Cozy, the personal cloud that integrates the Cozy Pass application.</p>
 Save time and money 
<p>Password managers allow you to access your accounts wherever you are, while ensuring that your information is secure. Last but not least, by automatically entering all your passwords, personal data and payment information on the web, this tool saves you a lot of time that you would otherwise waste filling out endless forms and searching for credentials that you forgot.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that unlike other password systems, password managers automatically enter your personal data, payment information and passwords, making it easy for you to move from one site to another.</p>
<p></p>
 Comparison 
<p>We won't lie to you: we just launched Cozy Pass and some features like password sharing or the web version are not yet available (but planned!). Users who want to focus on ease of use and ergonomics will turn to paid services especially when they have a professional use (sharing passwords with their team for example) and when their company offers them a solution paid in advance. The big names in this field are <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a>, <a href="https://1password.com/en/">1Password</a>, <a href="https://www.lastpass.com">LastPass</a> and <a href="https://keepass.info/">Keepass</a>.</p>
 Dashlane 
<p>Dashlane is probably the most complete service. Its interface is clear and pleasant to use. It offers interesting additional features to those offered by Cozy Pass:</p>
 
 the possibility to store notes or attachments in a secure way (up to 1 GB of storage space) 
 alerts when a password can be compromised, when a site communicates about a data leak or an attack 
 monitoring of the dark web. Dashlane analyzes the data published on the dark web, and verifies that your accounts and passwords are not part of it 
 the possibility to change your password in 1 click, for the main websites 
 a VPN, to secure your connection, for example on public wifi 
 sharing passwords with other people, and the possibility to add trusted contacts to your account 
 several premium offers (individual, family and business) 
 but...hosting your data on Amazon AWS 
 
 LastPass 
<p>LastPass is a popular password manager solution.</p>
<p></p>LastPass solution web interface<p></p>
 
 a modest price for most of the functions expected from a password manager whether for individuals (€2.90 per month or €3.90 per month) or for companies (from €2.90 per user/month to €7.50 per user/month) but soon LastPass will limit the number of synchronised devices (mobile OR laptops). 
 an extension compatible with a number of browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge, as well as on smartphones with an application on iOS, Android, and even Windows Phone. 
 Host your data on Amazon AWS 
 
 1Password 
<p>1Password is for Mac and iPhone users.</p>
<p></p>1Password solution web interface<p></p>
<p>It is possible to synchronize your passwords between your Mac and iPhone via your wifi network. The synchronization is then done on the local network, and not via the internet. For Apple users, this can be a good compromise between a Keepass and a service a little more modern and pleasant to use. While keeping control over where the data is stored.</p>
<p>For the rest, 1Password looks like Dashlane. With a few less features (no VPN, no darkweb monitoring).</p>
 
 If you travel a lot, 1Password also offers a roaming feature. You delete your sensitive data from your device while you travel. And you restore them when you arrive. 
 Available on Windows, Mac, Linux, and even ChromeOS for Chromebook owners. 
 
 Keepass 
<p>Keepass is a well-known password manager, free and open source.</p>
<p></p>Keepass solution web interface<p></p>
<p>Its great strength: it is known to be one of the most secure. In fact, it is the only one whose security has been audited by the ANSSI (National Agency for Information Systems Security).</p>
 
 Keepass is open source, which allows to audit its code. No black box effect like Cozy Pass. 
 Keepass allows you to keep control of where your passwords are stored... like <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a>. 
 
<p>You know everything. Thanks for reading! I hope this article has motivated you to install a password manager (Cozy Pass of course!) and change your digital habits.</p>

 Digital Property Rights with Bitmark NFTs — Evolving The Artist’s Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement <p>On March 19th, at 10AM PST, Bitmark is proud to <a href="https://feralfile.com">launch Feral File</a> with the software art exhibition Social Codes curated by renowned artist and Processing programming language co-creator Casey Reas. The following is adapted from <a href="https://feralfile.com/close-ups">Close-Ups on Feral&nbsp;File</a>.</p>Social Codes curated by Casey Reas, featuring artists Andrew Benson, LIA, Dmitri Cherniak, Raven Kwok, Anna Carreras, Manolo Gamboa Naon, Maya Man, Frederik Vanhoutte, Saskia Freeke, Dave Whyte. (Image courtesy of Dmitri Cherniak.)<p>At Bitmark, we believe that agreements around digital property (data, artwork, collectibles) cannot be resolved purely through traditional legal contracts or technology-based smart contracts. Legal contracts can’t handle the fidelity of digital assets (such as defining and enforcing the boundaries of digital property) at scale, technology-based smart contracts can’t handle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_contracts">incomplete nature of contracts</a>. No contract, and thus no software code, no matter how well constructed, can account for every possible contingency. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">The DAO</a> highlighted this issue on the Ethereum blockchain several years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>This is why Bitmark NFTs combine the best of software code (technology) and property law to create robust agreements for all stakeholders. For example, <a href="https://feralfile.com">Feral File</a>, the Bitmark-secured NFT art marketplace, builds upon the classic 1971 legal agreement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Reserved_Rights_Transfer_and_Sale_Agreement">“The Artist’s Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement</a>.” Feral File’s “<a href="https://feralfile.com/docs/artist-collector-rights">Artist + Collector Rights</a>” evolves that agreement for the digital age. It uses the blockchain to record each edition and transfer of ownership.</p><p>Here’s how Bitmark’s code and law work together:</p>  A blockchain record (Bitmark NFT) defines and connects rights to an asset. This is similar to a “bundle of rights” from traditional property&nbsp;law.  Each edition from Feral File contains a unique agreement, digitally signed by the collector and the artist. This agreement is hashed along with the artwork itself to form a unique identifier that is recorded in the Bitmark Blockchain.  Secondary sales are also standardized in the agreement. This allows artists to take part in the value created when their work appreciates.  <p>Our hypothesis is that by cryptographically linking artworks with their legal agreements, we can establish a more sustainable and transparent market for digital artworks. The Bitmark blockchain was purpose-built to process the rights around digital assets at scale. It is more energy efficient, less expensive, and faster at these transactions than other solutions while remaining decentralized, secure, and censorship resistant.

<p>The traditional mortgage process can feel cumbersome to borrowers and loan officers, especially when the digital solutions dominating our lives have us accustomed to fast, convenient, and simple processes. Slow and complex mortgage workflows are more than inconvenient and unfortunately all too common. They require input at every step, back and forth between multiple partners even for some of the simplest tasks. Traditional, manual mortgage processes can also hinder lenders from reaching the full potential of their organizations.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">Finicity Lend</a>’s Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) enables lenders to build a simple, streamlined mortgage verification experience with the flexibility to adapt to different mortgage lending use cases and enhance the lending experience for all.</p>
 The Drawbacks of Yesterday’s Mortgage Process 
<p>Gathering documents, calling employers, and conducting manual verifications add time to the origination process and can be a source of stress for prospective borrowers who have to hunt down paperwork. All that paper shuffling can also <a href="https://www.mba.org/x142727.xml">increase the chance of fraud and risk</a> for lenders. High-friction lending experiences are frustrating for borrowers who have become accustomed to digital experiences in all aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>And while adopting a digital mortgage solution can simplify this otherwise cumbersome process, adapting digital solutions can be daunting when your organization is accustomed to a particular traditional workflow. Do you have to ditch everything about your current process? Are the returns of a digital mortgage solution worth the time and resources to transform your organization?</p>
<p>Let’s find out.</p>
 Finicity MVS: The Simple and Flexible Mortgage Verification Experience 
<p>Finicity Lend’s Mortgage Verification Service addresses these problems with traditional mortgage lending and the concerns lenders face when confronted with the thought of changing their workflow. It comes down to two key components that have been core to MVS’s development from the beginning: simplicity and flexibility.</p>
 MVS Simplicity 
<p>Thanks to Finicity’s open-banking platform, MVS can deliver the financial data necessary for accurate, GSE-accepted, reliable verification of assets, income, and employment. And it gets better: MVS enables lenders to receive the verifications they need with only a single permissioning experience by the consumer, from multiple data sources. Even adding paystub data to bank and payroll data for a more comprehensive picture of income can still only take one permissioning experience that feels right at home in the digital lifestyle of today’s borrowers.</p>
<p>Data-driven verifications cut the risk of manual verifications and toss out the paper chase that came with ‘paper-based’ (from actual paper to digital documents) processes. The all-in-one, one-touch experience further streamlines and simplifies the lending process and improves the overall experience for both borrowers and lenders, potentially <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty">cutting up to 12 days</a> off the origination timeframe.</p>
 MVS Flexibility 
<p>Every lending scenario is as different as the borrowers that come to you. These unique scenarios mean that there can’t be a one-size-fits-all digital mortgage solution. It needs to be flexible. MVS is flexible enough to adapt to unique mortgage lending use cases and workflows and balance the appropriate level of borrower friction, optimizing the overall process.</p>
<p>With MVS, lenders can request only the data they need to validate income, assets, or employment, or they can request all the verifications at once. No need to sort through unnecessary information to assess a borrower’s risk. For example, a refinancing may not require the asset verification necessary with a new home purchase. MVS provides what you need, when you need it, and in the best, most simplified way with clean, easy-to-read reports.</p>
<p>And while MVS’s one-touch experience is ideal, some use cases or customer experiences require more than one permissioning experience with the borrower. Some consumer flows, for example, only require asset data in one step, and then <a href="https://www.finicity.com/how-digital-mortgage-lenders-streamline-verification-of-income-with-fintech/">request income data</a> separately. Or, your flow may attempt a complete verification from transactions only, and you may return to the borrower for a second permissioning experience for paystub data later. MVS can as easily adapt to these two-touch scenarios as the one-touch experience, enhancing lender flow rather than replacing it, and allowing lenders to balance friction with borrowers on their own terms.</p>
<p>Regardless of the permissioning experiences required for accurate and reliable risk assessment, borrowers and lenders will always enjoy a streamlined, fast, secure permissioning process through Finicity Connect for less friction and more time saved. Thanks to this flexibility, MVS helps lenders balance what you believe is the best experience for the borrowers with the tools you need to get the highest possible verification success rate.</p>
<p>With Finicity’s MVS, you can enjoy the benefits of a streamlined, simplified, and flexible digital mortgage experience without sacrificing what makes your lending process unique to your organization. And to top it all off, you get the most accurate data, courtesy of open banking and consumer permissioning. Enhance your lending with <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Finicity Lend’s MVS</a>.</p>

That includes movies, too,&nbsp;BTW.</p> 2. RIP&nbsp;cookies Photo: The Creative&nbsp;Exchange<p>Google has officially killed the cookie.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/google-says-it-wont-track-you-directly-in-the-future-as-it-phases-out-cookies.html">CNBC</a>:</p><blockquote>Google on Wednesday clarified its plans for targeted advertising, promising not to use other ways to “track” users around the internet after it ends support for cookies in Chrome by early&nbsp;2022.</blockquote><blockquote>The company said in a blog post it will only use “privacy-preserving technologies” that rely on methods like anonymization or aggregation of data. Google announced plans in January 2020 to end support for third-party cookies, which fuel much of the digital advertising ecosystem, in its Chrome browser within two&nbsp;years.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-privacy-pr-move-the-informations-tech-briefing">The Information’s briefing</a> is a bit skeptical:</p><blockquote>For one thing, there was little real “news” here. The online ad giant announced the main part of this a year ago. Today’s announcement was a follow-up, confirming that a particular kind of digital ad targeting is likely to die. More to the point, the impact of Google’s new approach is much more limited than people might realize. When you’re within Google’s walls — on search, YouTube or maps — you can still be tracked. That’s true for Apple, which helped kick off this privacy push but is also building its own ad-sales business on the App Store and Apple News, as well as other ad-based platforms like Snap or Pinterest. All of those platforms will still have detailed pictures of their users’ activities, which they can deploy in selling&nbsp;ads.</blockquote><blockquote>Yes, it will be harder for anyone to build a profile of you based on your cross-web browsing habits. So for instance, in the future your search on a recipe website may not lead to a related ad being shown to you when you’re on a news site. But Google could still use your search activity to target YouTube ads at you. Is one necessarily worse than the&nbsp;other?</blockquote><p>What’s undeniable is the impact this will have on the ad industry. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-to-stop-tracking-individuals-web-browsing-precision-ad-targeting-2021-3">BI</a>:</p><blockquote>While Google acknowledged that other providers may continue to offer advertisers the ability to track individuals across the web, its decision could still upend the digital advertising industry, which has long relied on these types of tracking technologies.</blockquote><blockquote>Temkin said that Google believes these types of tracking methods don’t “meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term investment.”</blockquote><blockquote>The plans throw a wrench into advertising-industry efforts to create cookieless “universal identifiers” that use more privacy-conscious methods of user tracking, such as encrypted email addresses or login information. Shares in The Trade Desk, which created the Unified ID 2.0, for example, were trading down more than 7% on Wednesday morning.</blockquote><blockquote>Google’s rivals and other participants in the advertising ecosystem have been watching Google’s moves closely. The UK’s competition regulator is even investigating a complaint from an advertising-industry group alleging that Google’s decision to remove third-party cookies from Chrome and replace them with technologies from its Privacy Sandbox would limit competition in the digital ad market. Other companies have been adding feedback and discussing their own proposals for cookie alternatives in subcommittees of the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, a key web-standards group.</blockquote><p>And as <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> notes, this is awesome validation for GlobaliD’s vision:</p><blockquote>This is really big news. It’s the end of an era when it comes to monetizing with tracking. This is Google admitting they will change their model, paving the way for identities and control around your own data. Apple already won that battle with Facebook. And now Facebook will lose another fight with Google/Android.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/tim-wu-white-house.html">A Leading Critic of Big Tech Will Join the White&nbsp;House</a>  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-investigates-apple-over-suspected-anti-competitive-behaviour">CMA investigates Apple over suspected anti-competitive behaviour</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-d1b78a14-7eb5-4737-9310-fd707cbf7b08.html">Arizona’s crusade against app&nbsp;stores</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-privacy-pr-move-the-informations-tech-briefing">Google’s Privacy PR Move: The Information’s Tech&nbsp;Briefing</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebooks-1-billion-kustomer-acquisition-faces-extensive-antitrust-review">Facebook’s $1 Billion Kustomer Acquisition Faces Extensive Antitrust Review</a>   3.

Greg’s&nbsp;take:</p><blockquote>Ripple’s well reasoned response (read pg 1–8) to the SEC complaint. The logic is crystal clear: If a fiance receives a diamond ring for an engagement, they don’t mistakenly believe that their lover has given them an investment in the De Beers diamond mining company. A diamond is NOT an investment contract with De Beers. Nor is XRP an investment contract with&nbsp;Ripple.</blockquote><blockquote>The SEC’s pretense that they are protecting investors or fostering capital formation by destroying the very things that Congress invoked them to defend is a caricature of what has gone amiss with the administrative state. Hopefully justice will be done with clarity for all other worthy blockchain endeavors.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchanges-discussed-xrps-status-with-sec-ahead-of-listings-ripple-says">Ripple: Exchanges Checked XRP Status With SEC Before Listing — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/ripple-wants-in-on-central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdc/">Ripple wants in on Central Bank Digital Currencies — Ledger Insights — enterprise blockchain</a>   4. What we can learn from China about the creator&nbsp;economy. <p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-china-embraced-the-creator-economy-before-the-west-did">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Executives at Facebook, Twitter and Snap recently realized that if they don’t help the people who produce videos and other content for their apps make money, these creators will take their talents, fans and potential revenue streams somewhere else.</blockquote><blockquote>In China, mobile video apps figured that out six years ago. That’s when Kuaishou, which started as an app for teenagers uploading 8-second videos to share with friends, overhauled its product so the teens could also stream themselves live and be paid directly by their fans via tips. That move propelled Kuaishou (pronounced “kwai-show”) to a public market capitalization of $170 billion after an initial public offering in Hong Kong last month. Hurst Lin, a venture capitalist who sits on Kuaishou’s board and whose firm’s early $40 million investment in the company is now worth around $15 billion, told The Information in an extended interview that Kuaishou’s move to tipping wouldn’t have happened if not for a desire for “revenge” against a&nbsp;rival.</blockquote><blockquote>Necessity also drove the direct-payment model. At the time, China’s online advertising market was still too small to support mobile video apps, let alone individual content creators. And the idea of tipping performers who stream themselves live was pioneered in China before the smartphone era by a company previously known as&nbsp;YY.</blockquote><blockquote>When Lin’s VC firm DCM first invested in Kuaishou in 2014 at a $60 million pre-money valuation, “we had no idea if Kuaishou was going to have any commercial value,” he said. The teens who used it at the time mostly hailed from China’s smaller, less affluent cities. But the app’s daily active users have since grown by at least 30 times to 300&nbsp;million.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-china-embraced-the-creator-economy-before-the-west-did">Why China Embraced the Creator Economy Before the West&nbsp;Did</a>   5.

Given that Square has a growing cryptocurrency business via Cash App, and has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into bitcoin itself.

It is hard to argue that the current day Internet isn’t the best it can be. However bad it is, we can fix it and make it a healthy digital space. That is the objective of the&nbsp;<a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/">Public Data Spaces Conference</a>: to foster cooperation between organisations and developers to tackle the task of making the Internet a better, safer and more collaborative place.




 




“<a href="https://publicspaces.net/timetable/event/building-connections/">Building Connections</a>” is one of the sessions at the conference that will explore these important themes. Given so many initiatives exist that form a part of what we need, such as Redecentralize network, MyData Global, Mozilla, CC, how do we best connect?




 




How do we create a ‘network of networks’ where people are able to find their complement and find what they need?&nbsp;<br><br>How do we evaluate what is relevant and what isn’t?&nbsp;<br><br>What are the best ways of working together and building on each other’s work?&nbsp;<br><br>A panel moderated by&nbsp;<a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/sander-van-der-waal/">Sander van der Waal</a>&nbsp;(Waag) will provide the opportunity to discuss and address these important questions and will include the following:&nbsp;




 





  <a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/andre-wilkens/">André Wilkens</a>&nbsp; – Director of the European Cultural Foundation  <a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/solana-larsen/">Solana Larsen</a>&nbsp;– Mozilla Foundation  <a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/ian-forrester/">Ian Forrester</a>&nbsp; – R&amp;D @ The BBC&nbsp;  <a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/katryna-dow/">Katryna Dow&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;Founder &amp; CEO of Meeco  





 




<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a> is also a member of the <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> Board, and active member of the community since its formation. <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is also a founding member of <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org">Data Sovereignty Now</a>, as is MyData. <br><br>As a result, Katryna brings a unique cross community perspective on how common goals and shared values bring people and organisations together.&nbsp;




 




MyData Global is an award-winning international non-profit. The purpose of MyData Global is to&nbsp;empower individuals by improving their right to self-determination regarding their personal data. It is based on the&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData Declaration</a>.




 




MyData Global&nbsp;has over 100&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/list-of-organisational-members/">organisation members</a>&nbsp;and close to 400 individual members from over 40 countries, on six continents, facilitating the 2000+ strong MyData Global community working on the ethical use of personal data. MyData is both an alternate vision and guiding set of technical principles.




 




<a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org/">Data Sovereignty Now</a>&nbsp;is a relatively new initiative. It was formed in late 2020 through a coalition of leading Europe-based technology companies, research institutions and not-for-profit organisations. The goal in joining forces is to enable a more equitable digital economy. Both Meeco and MyData Global&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/new-coalition-launches-campaign-for-data-sovereignty-now/">are founding members</a>, demonstrating the power of aligned collaboration.&nbsp;

 Freedom, Privacy and the Covid Pandemic 
<blockquote><p>How do you provide your populace with freedom whilst you’re still controlling the pandemic? Well, we now have technology around for that and unfortunately still they’re absolutely right. Have you got COVID? The question is have you been in contact with someone, do you have symptoms? As easy as that, how are they doing this at the moment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write on a piece of paper when you get to the place, use no we can’t do that, that’s not the right way todo it, let’s let’s use an app so they, belatedly a lot of countries have an app but those apps are centralised, taking data on people and they were rejected. So what we found is proliferation of those devices was especially in the UK, the centralised version the UK came out with was rejected by the public and didn’t get any uptake and it wasn’t illegal not to have it, it was seemed to be a duty but unless you’re in some of the more authoritarian countries where actually it is illegal then you must do it, otherwise wouldn’t turn you, there wasn’t that uptake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you need to do is provide technology which doesn’t infringe on the civil liberties, IE. a decentralised system but provide technology which will be give you the ability to move around, so a freedom pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now imagine the pass and this is what BLOK Solutions have been trying to provide through BLOK bias science and the and the BLOK pass, a decentralised freedom pass that you can use and say I haven’t got COVID, whether that’s a vaccination or whatever and you can use it not only to go into work you can use it also to get in to the cinema you can use it to get on the bus, you can use it if you’re a teacher to say, actually I’m free of this and I should be able to teach my children or conversely that the people around you, the teachers working around you have been scanned and they have a passporting system which is providing privacy to the individual but providing protection to the community from the pandemic and those tools are now available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BLOK BioScience has with BLOK paths the first and only so far, completely self-sovereign and certified by ID 2020 which is the World Health Organisation backed organisation that looks after self-sovereign identity solutions, certified as the only one in the world at the moment that can provide that health pass at the moment, so we believe we’re not only protecting people’s identities and their data but we’re also protecting or giving the tools to industry and to governments to be able to protect their populations and to be able to get the country’s industries going again.</p></blockquote>

				  When we eventually look back at the legacy of Covid-19, what technological change will we see? What’s happening now that will define the coming decade?&nbsp;  
			   
				
				
				 <p>When it became apparent that Covid-19 would scale to a problem of world historical proportions, speculation immediately turned to its legacy. Pandemics are agents of change, and in our mass adaptation to new challenges, we would quickly discard practices and processes whose rationale for existing conflicted with immediate needs; we would adapt new technologies to wider use; we would innovate.</p>
<p>While the legacy of Covid-19 is a work in progress, we can identify a strong signal of systemic change that the pandemic has accelerated: decentralization.</p>
<p>Decentralization was quickly normed as a logistical necessity for business, as company offices became no-go areas and workers were forced to recreate their jobs from their kitchens and spare rooms. While this created new problems—rickety VPNs were not up to the task of connecting administrators and developers to their work or providing robust network security—the big “surprise” was that productivity didn’t fall off a cliff; it turned out that many workers were more productive from home because they were spending more time working.</p>
<p>Yes, hours and hours of Zoom meetings weren’t and aren’t necessarily fun, and for some tasks being in a room with colleagues is vastly more efficient; but teleconferencing wasn’t a radically new concept that required a new set of processes to master (where failure occurred, it was more a question of forgetting to follow old norms, like putting on your pants). People had the equipment they needed—computers and phones—if not quite the network infrastructure to connect them; but they adapted to significant behavioral change because the technology made it relatively easy for them to do so. Offices will return because business has social drivers; but the future looks like it will offer far more decentralized work opportunities than before.</p>
<p>This is a massive behavioral and economic shift, at least for information workers. The commute, the clock-in, the be-seen-to-be-sitting-at-your-desk paradigm is over. It now looks unnecessary, expensive, and inefficient. It didn’t measure the right things in terms of productivity—and we have a massive natural experiment to prove that against—what?—a commonly shared intuition that if you weren’t watching your workers they would skive off. Working from home will, of course, create a new set of problems, and some will be solved by being in a social work setting some of the time. But we think differently now because different now works better.</p>
<p>These shifts in the way we live seem to happen all of a sudden and yet with little fuss, perhaps because the underlying principles, the big ideas as tectonic plates, have been grinding away beneath our feet for a long time, creating lots of small shockwaves and incrementally triggering us to do things differently. And when you start thinking about decentralization, you begin to see its inexorable force everywhere. What is a 401k except a decentralized retirement mechanism? People once relied on a single company pension; now they rely on returns from many companies. Uber decentralized taxi services; AirBnB decentralized hospitality; both decentralized trust because the aggregate rating of all or many users is more likely to be trustworthy than a single rating or small number of ratings.</p>
<p>Much as the poet Yeats wondered how to tell the dancer from the dance, it is difficult to separate the idea of decentralization from the technology to implement it. It is hard to imagine how to decentralize a currency without a blockchain. Needs drive technology—but technological innovation creates opportunities to solve problems and to do things that were once unimaginable.</p>
<p>In this, decentralization’s frontier is identity. And we have finally reached it. Decentralized identity answers the question “how can we use the many to authenticate the one?” In this case, the many is a complex stack composed of distributed ledger networks, communications protocols, cryptographic keys, and apps; the one is you or some fact about you that you want to prove to someone else, identity.</p>
<p>Online, we’ve been living with centralized identity since the birth of the Internet. We create an identity profile and a password to access it, and someone else holds that information and—to try and prevent identity fraud—other facts about you. The more valuable the service you access, the more of your identity you have to hand over to continually prove you are who you say you are. The failures of this way of doing things are legion, from data hacks to abuse of privacy.</p>
<p>But much as a company staff that doesn’t need to all show up in the same physical space to work, decentralized identity means the attributes that we use to prove our identity don’t all need to show up in a central data silo to verify that we are who we say we are. This is possible because the content of an identity (such as the personal information about you in a passport) doesn’t need to literally stand for the form of that identity (the passport itself). The technology enables the form and ownership of the passport to be verified without the need to access the content. This means that decentralized identity is able to create uniqueness out of an otherwise infinitely copyable digital world.</p>
<p>Conceptually, that’s an enormous shift—no more passwords, profiles, or third-party storage. Every interaction involving identity can be direct, unique, and verifiable. And at the front end, it requires no technological heavy lifting. It may be tough to understand at the back end, but it is experienced by the user through forms and behavior that will be familiar and intuitive to anyone who uses apps or instant messaging.</p>
<p>If Covid-19 drove the decentralization of our working selves, that work is now driving the need for decentralized identity. One of the biggest technical headaches in managing a decentralized workforce is identity management—or, “is our remote workforce really who they say they are when they log on?” This challenge is driving adoption of zero-trust security practices, which require continuous identity verification for access to a network. What makes such verification easy? Decentralized verifiable credentials (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAT85zebRLM&amp;list=LLtwBqR2xCF583_xVy4isxSQ&amp;index=2&amp;t=2202s" title="The Future of Privacy and Security: Decentralized Identity and Zero Trust">Listen</a> to Indicio.tech CEO Heather Dahl discuss decentralized identity and zero trust with Chase Cunningham, Chief Strategy Officer of Eircom Software at a recent Washington DC Hyperledger Meetup).</p>
<p>With zero trust becoming the dominant paradigm in cybersecurity (a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/insights-zero-trust-network-security/" title="Current state of Zero Trust">recent</a> Forrester survey for Cloudflare found that 80 percent of security leaders said their organizations were committed to adopting zero trust), expect to see verifiable digital credentials increasingly employed to manage workforces—and then be adapted to manage other complex processes, services, and products.</p>
<p>More obviously, expect to see decentralized identity provide a compelling solution to the current dilemma over Covid-19 test or vaccine “passes” for travel. While a specific vaccine pass raises issues over social equity and liberty, the immediate and compelling value proposition of a decentralized Covid-19 test credential is that it enables health provider information to be directly sent to and held by an individual without any need for a third party to store it or manage it.</p>
<p>This eliminates the problem of health data privacy regulation. And because the credential’s form—its specifications and the unique way it proves ownership—are written to a blockchain, it is virtually impossible to forge or tamper with the contents. The user gets to decide who they share their data with—be it a border official or an airline or a restaurant—and it can be as easy as presenting a QR code for a negative test. The back-end infrastructure does all the authentication.</p>
<p>Think about what this means: Companies don’t have to store personal data to make identity verification work. The risk for being out of compliance with GDPR and other data privacy law disappears. People have a way to prove that they have been tested or vaccinated without giving their data to a tech giant.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity will make our increasingly decentralized lives easier. Or maybe our decentralized lives will make decentralized identity easier. Or both. Either way, this big idea is happening now.</p>

<p>This is the second in a series of blogs providing edited extracts of key points made by Mydex CIC in its response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>. The first one addressed the question “<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of&nbsp;data?</a>”</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>The central plank of Mydex CIC’s consultation response is that the UK needs to build a new layer of data logistics infrastructure that:</p>  Includes citizens in the workings of the data economy, empowering them with the ability to collect, store, use and share data about themselves independently of any data controllers they may have data relationships with.  To achieve this, the Government needs to ensure that every citizen is provided with their own personal data store, which enables citizens to collect, store, share and use their own data, under their own control, for their own purposes, independently of any organisation that may have collected data about&nbsp;them.  These personal data stores should be designed to act as neutral, enabling nodes in a vibrant data sharing network, whereby citizens can obtain copies of their data held by organisations and can forward relevant elements of this data (such as Verified Attributes) to other data users under their control, as and when beneficial and necessary.  <p>Such a citizen empowering data logistics infrastructure is key to enabling <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">a MUMU data economy to grow</a>: one where the right personal data can flow to and from the right parties at the right times, in ways that protects citizens’ privacy and make them active participants in service provision.</p> Benefits of the new personal data infrastructure <p>Ensuring every citizen is provided with their own personal data store would <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/killing-many-birds-with-one-stone-6dc5ae40c556">kill many birds with one stone</a>. Specifically, it&nbsp;would:</p>  Enable order of magnitude reductions in friction, effort, risk and cost for both bona fide service providers and&nbsp;citizens  Ensure built-in privacy and data protection for all processes involving the collection and use of personal&nbsp;data  Ensure built-in fair pre-distribution of power and rewards relating to the collection and use of personal data, resulting in inclusive economic growth, enabling social inclusion and helping to tackle the digital divide and ‘poverty&nbsp;premium’  Act as a platform for innovation, enhancing capabilities, capacity and flexibility   Cutting costs <p>The most compelling immediate reason to introduce personal data stores is their cost-cutting potential.</p><p>By enabling citizens to easily, safely and securely obtain electronic copies of data held about them by organisations (as per the data portability provisions of GDPR/Data Protection Act) a personal data store-based data logistics infrastructure would enable data ecosystems to move from ‘make afresh every time’ to ‘make once use many times’ modes of operation.</p><p>Under the current organisation-centric system, if an organisation needs to know something about an individual it has to obtain the necessary information for itself, even though another organisation might have already obtained the same information. Very often, organisations don’t need the actual information itself: they just need confirmation that a particular piece of information is valid, up-to-date and correct (e.g. that an individual is over 18, lives at a particular address, has a valid driving licence, has passed certain exams, is entitlement to certain benefits, etc).</p><p>Responsible organisations that have already checked information can easily and cheaply generate secure electronic tokens verifying these bits of information. These are called <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">‘Verified Attributes’</a>. Enabling this information to be ported to a personal data store and forwarded to other service providers, would eliminate vast amounts of duplicated effort for both service providers and service users, significantly reducing the time, money and effort they invest in collating and confirming the data they&nbsp;need.</p><p>The Scottish Government has already successfully conducted tests to confirm the technical viability of such a process in its <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Attribute-Prototype-Report-new.pdf">Verified Attribute prototype</a>. The prototype</p><blockquote>“enables public sector organisations to provide individuals with verified attributes, for individuals to store these attributes in their own Attribute Store, and for these individuals to be able to share these attributes with other public sector service providers as and when&nbsp;needed.”</blockquote><p>Because of the way these verified attributes work (using secure API links) other parties can rely on the accuracy and provenance of this data without having to undertake their own checking processes or asking citizens to fill out yet another form. (Some people say that such a process cannot work, asking who takes liability if a piece of shared data happens to be wrong. In fact, relying on data provided by other people happens in multiple processes all the time without any liability model. Whether to accept the information is down to the user’s own assessments of related&nbsp;risk.)</p><p>By enabling the sharing of Verified Attributes and other data, personal data stores render many previously essential data processing tasks unnecessary (thereby freeing up time and resources) while enabling service providers to access more, better quality data, more quickly. The potential power of this approach is demonstrated by the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Smart-Entitlements-Research-Recommendations-and-Report-for-the-Scottish-Government-FINAL.pdf">Scottish Government’s work on ‘smart entitlements’</a> which examines just how big the opportunity is and how to realise&nbsp;it.</p><p>The sharing of verified attributes also cracks the problem of online identity: an ‘identity’ is simply an accepted collection of verified attributes.</p> Built-in privacy and data protection <p>It is now universally accepted that citizens should be able to assert more control over how their data is collected and used. Compliance with new data protection regulations remains a major challenge. By creating mechanisms that ensure that personal data is shared and used by the citizens whose data it is, a new personal data store based data logistics infrastructure would ensure privacy and data protection by&nbsp;default.</p><p>A failure to build such citizen empowering personal data infrastructure can only result in ‘more of the same’ problems.</p> Rebalancing the workings of the data&nbsp;economy <p>It is now widely recognised that status-quo approaches to the collection and use of personal data have resulted in huge competition- and growth-restricting, unfair and socially divisive imbalances of power and reward. There is now ongoing debate as to how to ‘fix big tech’ with the UK’s Competition and Market Authority recommending the creation of a new Digital Markets Unit to curb the power of big tech data monopolies.</p><p>While regulatory intervention is part of the answer, regulation alone can not do the job. We also need to embed new, fairer ways of working into day-to-day data management practices. Providing every citizen with a personal data store achieves this, ensuring fair pre-distribution of power over personal data and resulting rewards.</p><p>The Financial Times recently observed much effort is now going into ‘fixing big tech’.&nbsp;But:</p><blockquote>“The real game-changer would be if Europe could pioneer the creation of a radically different and more decentralised data economy.”</blockquote><p>A personal data store-based data logistics infrastructure would achieve this decentralisation.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1N9kVpPWT48YZFFx3uBEU_xcrt20YLaFi">The Future of Citizen Data Systems</a> report by the Government Office for Science, notes research that using such an approach may be closest to economically optimal, citing an economic modelling study&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>“investigated how different models of data control could affect how far data is shared when consumers prioritise both their privacy and gains from use of their data. A scenario where consumers control their use of data was closest to optimal, with maximised benefits from data sharing and privacy. Consumers kept some data private, but shared other data with many more organisations and companies, compared to a scenario where firms controlled data.”</blockquote><p>One important aspect of this rebalancing is tackling the poverty premium. Currently, data exclusion is a major cause of social exclusion. Those with the greatest needs for access to services are also those who have to spend the greatest amounts of time, effort and money filling in application forms, trying to find data and prove credentials. By enabling individuals to build up banks of pre-verified facts about themselves — facts that they can reuse when applying for services — the new data infrastructure would go a long way to enabling social inclusion.</p> A platform for innovation <p>Organisations use data for many different purposes e.g. for the purposes of measurement, analysis, decision-making, operations planning, coordination and implementation, and administration to manage their operations better. Enabling individuals to do the same with their own data would open up a tidal wave of innovation.</p><p>Individuals should be able to collect, store and use their own data for the same purposes (of measurement, analysis, decision-making, operations planning, coordination and implementation, and administration) in order to manage their lives better. <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-practical-vision-for-personal-data-empowerment-1d366ed792f">This applies across all ‘life departments’</a> whether it is managing a home and dealing with suppliers, making big financial decisions such as planning for retirement, coping with long-term illnesses such as diabetes or cancer, or advancing their education and&nbsp;careers.</p><p>Personal data stores enable service innovation in such areas by enabling citizens to safely and efficiently combine data from many sources, and to add extra information about themselves (e.g. plans, preferences, goals) to build rich new-to-the-world person-centric data assets that weren’t possible before (because previously the data was dispersed across many different organisations).</p><p>The Government has already recognised some of this innovation potential with its Open Banking initiative. However, with Open Banking, data is ported from one organisation to another and never back to the individual whose data it is. This is a very restricted form of data portability which requires costly and heavy regulatory oversight and risks creating a complexity catastrophe as it tries to scale. It also actually reduces individuals’ control over their data. As individuals’ data gets spread across an increasing number of different organisations, it gets more and more difficult for individuals to keep tabs on their&nbsp;data.</p><p>In contrast, personal data stores allow a person’s data to be aggregated around that person, making it possible for service providers to gain permissioned access enhanced, enriched data sets to provide enhanced, enriched, personalised services. Given that this information is critical to service provision across every major sector of the economy including financial services, health, public administration, transport, education/skills development, housing and leisure, this has the potential to become a significant driver of innovation and economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Once every citizen has been provided with their own personal data store, the Government will have created personal data infrastructure with near infinite flexibility: the ability to handle any data for any purpose. With the infrastructure in place for example, when the Government introduces a new policy requiring access to data (as happened with the Covid pandemic) it can use the infrastructure to enable the right information to get to and from the right people at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>Given that companies like Mydex CIC have already built the infrastructure that is needed to achieve all the above, there is now no good reason why the UK Government cannot implement provision of this new infrastructure at&nbsp;speed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-we-need-new-nationwide-personal-data-infrastructure-56513fb6daf4">Why we need new, nationwide personal data infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The Basics <p>Verus is among the easiest cryptocurrencies to stake and earn rewards. Unlike many staking systems your Verus is completely accessible while it’s staking, it isn’t locked up, inaccessible, or out of your control in any way. You just have to flip a switch in your wallet to turn it on, and your Verus remains in your wallet the whole time, and can be spent at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>Verus uses a novel consensus mechanism called <a href="https://verus.io/technology/verus_proof_of_power">Proof-of-Power</a> (PoP) which is a hybrid half Proof-of-Work (PoW), half Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system. Half of the blocks are mined using VerusHash, and the other half are “minted” via staking. This means that both miners and stakers are doing the work to process transactions and secure the network, and that attackers would need BOTH a significant share of mining hash rate AND of the available supply of Verus (VRSC) to attack the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Every block has a chance of being won by staking, and over time it averages out that half of the blocks are solved by mining and half by staking. The average block time on Verus is 1 minute. If you stake a block you’ll get the block reward and any transaction fees paid by users to have their transactions processed. At the time of writing, the block reward is 12 VRSC, and there is a halving (the reward drops in half) approximately every two years, the last of which was in November&nbsp;2020.</p><p>The chances of staking and receiving a block reward for any given block are proportional to the amount of Verus you’re staking. There is no minimum amount of Verus required to stake, and any funds kept in a transparent address or a VerusID that have been there for at least 150 blocks (about 150 minutes) may be used to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Your wallet must be running, connected to the internet, and synced with the Verus blockchain with staking enabled in order to stake. Addresses/wallets should only be staked from a single computer. By default staking is disabled to prevent unintentionally staking from multiple computers or creating problems with accounting for staked funds when they’re not expected.</p> Staking Requirements <p>To stake successfully your wallet must meet these requirements:</p>  Funds held in one or more transparent addresses or VerusIDs in the&nbsp;wallet  Wallet is running, online, synced to the Verus blockchain on a system with an accurate system&nbsp;clock  Staking is enabled in the wallet&nbsp;software   Verus Desktop (GUI) Staking&nbsp;How-To <p>To enable staking in the Verus Desktop wallet you’ll open the wallet and go to the Mining tab. Here on the mining dashboard you can enable staking by clicking the icon of the dollar sign with the slash through&nbsp;it.</p><p>Or, from the mining dashboard you can click on Verus on the left side, then toggle staking on in the main interface.</p><p>That should get you staking. With staking enabled you’ll get a dashboard showing estimates for potential staking returns given the current network conditions that looks like&nbsp;this:</p><p>The calculator is always only an estimate, since the whole system is based on statistical averages over time, and dependent on changing network conditions. In particular, these estimates and your results will vary based on how much Verus is being staked on the rest of the network by all participants in any given&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Notice in that calculator that it shows only a portion staking — this is because a portion of the balance is unavailable for staking, having recently staked, and will be available again in 150 blocks. For more information on this aspect see the UTXO Details section&nbsp;below.</p><p>You’ll know you’ve successfully staked when you see staking transactions and rewards in your transaction list, and when your balance goes up accordingly.</p> Verus Command Line (CLI) Staking&nbsp;How-To <p>You might prefer to use Verus on the command line, either to run on much lighter-weight hardware or headless systems, for the ability to script and integrate with Verus, or just for more granular control over your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>This assumes you are already familiar with the command line and have verusd running and have met the other prerequisites for being eligible to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>You can enable staking in a running wallet using this&nbsp;command:</p> verus setgenerate true 0 <p>This will turn your mining threads down to zero if you were mining. If you want to also re-enable solo mining you can follow this&nbsp;with:</p> verus setgenerate true X <p>where X is the number of threads you want to mine&nbsp;with.</p><p>You can disable staking AND mining&nbsp;using:</p> verus setgenerate false <p>You can get your current staking/mining status&nbsp;using:</p> verus getmininginfo <p>which will return something like&nbsp;this:</p> { <br> “blocks”: 1424603,<br> “currentblocksize”: 0,<br> “currentblocktx”: 0,<br> “averageblockfees”: 1.20011909,<br> “difficulty”: 1004965568496.515,<br> “stakingsupply”: 41243165.47632869,<br> “errors”: “”,<br> “genproclimit”: 0,<br> “localhashps”: 0,<br> “networkhashps”: 351834027116,<br> “pooledtx”: 1,<br> “testnet”: false,<br> “chain”: “main”,<br> “generate”: true,<br> “staking”: true,<br> “numthreads”: 0,<br> “mergemining”: 0<br>} <p>The “stakingsupply” figure is an estimate of how much Verus has been staking on the whole network recently. Your approximate chances of staking any given block can be calculated by dividing your eligible staking balance (funds at least 150 blocks old in transparent addresses or IDs) by the staking&nbsp;supply.</p><p>To enable staking after verusd is restarted you can add the following to your VRSC.conf file:</p> mint=1 <p>or pass -mint to verusd when launching it.</p> Enabling StakeGuard <p>StakeGuard is a system for <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e">solving the Nothing-at-Stake problem</a>. By configuring StakeGuard you have a chance of receiving the ill-gotten staking rewards from those who are trying to cheat the network (or potentially from those who make the mistake of staking their wallet from different computers at the same time, since the network can’t tell these two cases&nbsp;apart).</p><p>To enable StakeGuard on the Verus Desktop GUI go to the main wallet screen for Verus and click the green Receive button under Private Balance. Then click the copy icon for an address you’d like your StakeGuard proceeds to go to. If you don’t yet have a private address, click the “new private address”&nbsp;button.</p><p>With your private address copied, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to enter settings, then click on Coin Settings on the left. Make sure Verus(VRSC) is selected in the dropdown right below the settings icon. Then paste your private address into the StakeGuard address field and save your&nbsp;changes.</p><p>That’s it for the&nbsp;GUI.</p><p>To enable StakeGuard in the CLI wallet you’ll edit your VRSC.conf file and add a z-address in a line formatted like&nbsp;this:</p> cheatcatcher=ZADDR <p>or pass it as a parameter to verusd when launching using the parameter like&nbsp;so:</p> -cheatcatcher=”ZADDR”  UTXO Details <p>A few notes on some of the finer points of staking — you can ignore this part and do just fine with staking, but this might be useful to you if you’re looking for the slightly deeper&nbsp;dive.</p><p>The balance in your wallet is made up of the sum of the transactions that have been sent to an address or VerusID in your wallet that haven’t been spent. When you’re staking it is actually each individual <a href="https://blog.komodoplatform.com/en/whats-utxo/">unspent transaction output (UTXO)</a> that’s eligible to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>When a UTXO stakes it is actually spent, being sent back to the same address again. This means it still shows up in your balance, but it becomes ineligible to stake again for 150 blocks. For the next 150 blocks after a stake you’ll notice that the value of the UTXO that staked will be missing from your eligible staking balance, but also notice that your other UTXOs remain eligible to stake during this&nbsp;period.</p><p>For this reason, if you’re staking a large balance you’ll likely have better staking performance by making sure your balance is split up between multiple UTXOs — by having sent it to the wallet in multiple transactions rather than a single large transaction or otherwise redistributing it within the wallet. This keeps a larger portion of your funds available for staking while the successful stakes have to wait 150 blocks to be available for staking again. There are quickly diminishing returns here though, and having too many small transactions can decrease your wallet’s efficiency in scanning all of them for eligible stakes. My recommendation is to not bother breaking up any UTXOs smaller than 5,000&nbsp;VRSC.</p><p>The odds of each individual UTXO staking are independent, and proportional to their value. This means that one 10,000VRSC UTXO has the same odds of staking as a group of ten 1,000VRSC UTXOs.</p> Verus Vault <p>Verus Vault will soon move from Testnet to the main Verus network. Verus Vault allows a VerusID to be locked and prevented from spending until it is unlocked and a specified cooldown time has passed or a specific block height is reached, or until the ID is revoked and recovered. Verus Vault allows the funds in a locked ID to stake, so users protecting their funds this way won’t miss out on staking opportunities.</p> Currencies and&nbsp;PBaaS <p>Also on the Verus Testnet right now is functionality for creating and trading using currencies. I recommend starting with this article on <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/vbasics-verus-defi-118da0b13f35">Verus DeFi</a> to understand more. It is mentioned here to make it clear that currencies on Verus will not be able to stake; only Verus can stake. Also, Verus that resides in the reserves (the liquidity pool) of a fractional currency is unable to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) chains have their own coin, which is mineable and/or stakeable on that chain, but not on the Verus network directly.</p> Fees and the Fee&nbsp;Pool <p>In addition to the block reward miners and stakers are rewarded with the fees users pay to have their transactions processed by the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Another Testnet feature that will soon migrate to the main Verus network is the fee pool. The fees that go to the miners and stakers (such as transaction fees, ID registration costs, and others) will go into the fee pool, and each miner or staker will get to take 1% of what is in the fee pool along with their block reward. This makes mining/staking proceeds from fees more stable over time, rather than having occasional blocks with high fees from high-fee events like ID registrations. It also helps align incentives by making sure no potentially malicious miner or staker might want to mine for a previous block if the fees were particularly lucrative, since those fees are averaged out over&nbsp;time.</p> Troubleshooting <p>If you believe you’re having problems with staking here are a few things to&nbsp;check:</p>  Check your eligible staking balance. Funds in a private address (z-address) aren’t eligible to stake. Also any funds received, transacted with, or staked within the last 150 blocks aren’t eligible. So keep these in mind when assessing your eligible balance. If there’s a discrepancy between your wallet balance and your eligible staking balance not explained by these considerations, there might be something to investigate with the help of the <a href="https://verus.io/discord">community-support or staking channels on the Verus&nbsp;Discord</a>.  Check to ensure that staking is enabled. If you’re using the command line wallet or if you want to look under the hood on the Verus Desktop wallet use the getmininginfo command to see that staking is enabled (“staking”:true) (on the CLI: verus getmininginfo&nbsp;; in the GUI wallet: Settings-&gt;Coin Settings, then run getmininginfo in the command&nbsp;window).  Check your system clock to make sure your time is accurate.  Check in with the community on the <a href="https://verus.io/discord">Verus Discord</a>. If you describe your issue in the community-support or staking channels they’ll be able to help, or can put your mind at&nbsp;ease.  <p>One point of confusion worth reviewing — staking on Verus doesn’t provide a steady trickle of proceeds, instead it is all-or-nothing in each block, earning the full block reward plus fees each time, and the frequency with which you stake a block is based on the amount of Verus you have staking. It’s also all a matter of statistical averages, you may have lucky periods and dry spells, the specifics of when you stake and when you don’t are matters of utter randomness and should even out over long periods of time as a matter of averages. If you have a relatively small amount of Verus your staking rewards may be very infrequent, but there’s always a chance, and over a sufficiently long time there’s a good chance you’ll stake at some&nbsp;point.</p><p>Good luck and happy&nbsp;staking!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-beginners-staking-guide-efbbdc4de951">Verus Beginner’s Staking Guide</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

They seek to link the attributes of a token’s initial distribution to their adoption as measured by on- chain metrics such as wallet total locked value and market capitalization. Utilizing data from across the blockchain they hope to find meaningful insights that can be used to guide and predict the future growth of decentralized protocols.</p><blockquote>We're excited to be partnering up with Bloom to unearth data driven insights into how a token's initial distribution will affect their market adoption in the short and medium term.</blockquote><p> - Lawrence</p> Research Grant: Token Economics <p>Award amount: 5 ETH | Winner: Square 1</p><p>Square 1 is a podcast and content series that aims to surface the design patterns present in today’s token networks, DAOs, decentralized products and communities. The platform seeks to create information that is insightful for crypto-natives and approachable for crypto-novices, alike. Square 1 has completed audits of MakerDAOs governance system and is continuing to focus on similar audits across a number of prominent platforms and DAOs within the community.</p><blockquote>I’m extremely encouraged and grateful for Bloom Network’s early support of Square 1. They’ve proven to be an amazing team to work with. </blockquote><p>– James Duncan</p> Build Grant: Unsecured Lending Vaults <p>Award amount: 20 ETH | Winner: Tilly Loan</p><p>Tilly Loan is an unsecured lending platform that leverages both on-chain and off-chain components to not only bring the value of DeFi to the real world but to democratize modern credit infrastructure for emerging markets. Tilly Loan is building an open banking platform in Africa, seeking to correct the many issues it has identified with how lending is performed throughout the region. The platform allows anyone to draw a credit line from an Aave credit delegation vault based on a risk assessment performed using the individual’s traditional financial data.</p><blockquote>The Bloom team brings a wealth of expertise in decentralized identity and credit infrastructure; the grant not only supports initial development of the platform but the mentorship and guidance is invaluable. </blockquote><p>– Victor Akinwande</p> Build Grant: Utility Experiments <p>Award amount: 10 ETH | Winner: Steven Yuan</p><p>Steven’s project aims to determine if a tokenized and decentralized identity platform like Bloom can help local governments build new tools to deter fraud and malicious actors from pushing their agenda in public meetings. As a remote-first lifestyle set about by the events related to COVID-19 allow everyday citizens to dial into government meetings, Steven’s project seeks to validate and incentivize good citizens to participate, while creating a medium to allow this at the government level.</p><blockquote>As a deep advocate for design thinking, I strongly believe that good research and critical thought into the problems that Bloom could potentially solve are the precursor to ensuring that the protocol will thrive in the future. This grant will help us thoroughly study the needs in this space, as well as set up incentivized experiments to determine if we are able to effectively address those needs. </blockquote><p>– Steven Yuan</p> Stay Tuned <p>We’re excited to see how these projects innovate in their respective fields and expand on their initial thesis. We intend to follow up and provide an update on our blog to keep our community informed on their progress and their eventual outcome. We also plan to do similar grants for other topics in the near future, especially as we see the space rapidly evolving with new and novel uses cases appearing overnight. These are exciting times for cryptocurrencies and the larger blockchain sector, and we envision the increased need for decentralized digital identity solutions in the near term and future.</p><p>Please email <a>grants@bloom.co</a> if you'd like an invite to our discord to collaborate with our community and stay up to date with the latest announcements.</p>

<p>This past Thursday March 4th we had the opportunity to hear from one of the industry’s youngest rising talents. Dylan Steck <a href="https://twitter.com/Dylan_Steck">@Dylan_Steck </a> is the creator of <a href="https://t.co/hOwfaKQ8oV?amp=1">Cortex</a>, an organization whose mission is creating what he calls valuable <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/tools-for-action-6475cf3343f1">Tools for Action</a>.</p> What are "Tools for Action"? <p>Tools for Action are implementations designed with the goal of helping people organize their thoughts, and ultimately their actions, in the same way a "Tool for Thought" does. Recently, we wrote about <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/zettelkasten-method-and-digital-notetaking/">Zettelkasten</a>, the Tool for Thought conceived by a prolific German academic that's been embraced by Roam Research enthusiasts (often dubbed the #RoamCult).</p><p>Dylan wants to take these existing Tools for Thought and build upon them to create new and effective action-oriented tools. A key part of Cortex’s mission is to prioritize the repurposing of existing tools. From the Cortex website:</p><blockquote>Cortex is a value-based technology organization. We want to reassemble tools to democratize knowledge and creation. All of the work that we do is led by a guiding thesis: we can re-purpose pre-existing tools to solve the easiest problems without starting from scratch.</blockquote><p>Between his interest in supporting portable and secure user data across the internet as well as empowering users to create without being encumbered by the burden of starting-from-scratch, Dylan is a natural friend of the Fission community. </p> Watch the video <p>Check out the video below where we hear from Dylan and get to see and hear what he’s working on first hand. There’s also a lively discussion after Dylan’s presentation where many members of the community chimed in on Dylan’s work and the future of Tools for Action. </p><p>Also be sure to stop by the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/cortex-tools-for-action-by-dylan-steck/1499">Fission forum</a> where we have a thread dedicated to the event and Dylan’s work with Cortex.</p> Weekly Fission Video Chats <p>Fission hosts weekly video chats with invited presenters. <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">View the upcoming events and register to join us »</a></p><p></p>

<p>In five minutes, anyone can have a Ghost blog up and running, with media uploads hosted on IPFS thanks to Fission.</p><p></p>
<p>Thinking of starting a Ghost blog but leaning towards "nah, too much work"?</p><p>Here's how you do it with <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/heroku-ipfs-ghost">Fission's Ghost Blog Starter</a>: click a button, choose a URL, watch a couple of spinners do their thing, and voilà: a production-ready Ghost blog instance is live on Heroku in less than 5 minutes.</p><p>Best of all? Image and video uploads—which aren't supported by default on Heroku due to its read-only filesystem—are built-in and work seamlessly. The <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/interplanetary-fission">Fission Heroku Add-on</a> takes care of everything without intervention, creating a new Fission account for your blog, handling media uploads, and serving those assets for you on HTTPS and on the peer-to-peer IPFS network.</p> Going Headless <p>Ghost is a great platform for authors, with almost a decade of accumulated improvements in user experience.</p><p>One shortcoming though is that it doesn't scale beyond a single server:</p><blockquote>Ghost doesn’t support load-balanced clustering or multi-server setups of any description, there should only be one Ghost instance per site.<br>— <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/faq/clustering-sharding-multi-server/">Ghost documentation</a></blockquote><p>Caching pages and serving them via a content delivery network (CDN) is one way to mitigate this. But if content has to be turned into static files and served from the edge anyway, why not go a step further and decouple Ghost, the authoring interface, from the code that generates those files based on the content?</p><p>That's the Headless CMS approach, where a <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">static site generator</a> pulls the content from the content management system and builds the pages that can be served super-fast at scale at the edge. This opens up the possibility to tap into a rich ecosystem of frontend development tools and components (like React and others) for a much richer content experience, along with security and performance benefits.</p><p>On a previous post, we described how we're moving our own blog to a <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/headless-ghost-blog-fission/">Headless Ghost + Next.js</a> setup. This allows us not only to make the best out of what the frontend can do, but also to showcase how Fission enables personalization at the edge, something that used to be possible only with dynamically-rendered server-hosted websites.</p><p>By using our <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/heroku-ipfs-ghost">Ghost blog starter</a>, you can try this setup for yourself and follow along as we continue to share tools, process, and lessons on our own path to a webnative publishing experience.</p>

 Irene Adamski, Blockchain Expert at German Blockchain Association and Bundesblock, on Self-Sovereign Identity <p>In the eleventh episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we had a conversation with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ireneadamski/?originalSubdomain=de">Irene Adamski,</a> General Secretary, German Blockchain Association, Bundesblock. Irene is responsible for Partnership Development &amp; Regulatory Affairs at <a href="https://jolocom.io/about/">JOLOCOM</a>, a Berlin-based company that focuses on developing Self-Sovereign Identity solutions. During this discussion, she explains the relationship between digital identities and self-sovereign identity, how it can help citizens across the globe, and the role of big tech in creating digital identity solutions. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> What is a Digital Identity, and how can it be decentralized? <p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-identification-a-key-to-inclusive-growth#">A 2019 report by</a> McKinsey states that Digital identification, or “digital ID,” can be authenticated unambiguously through a digital channel, unlocking access to banking, government benefits, education, and many other critical services. The risks and potential for misuse of digital ID are real and deserve careful attention. When well-designed, digital ID enables civic and social empowerment and makes possible real and inclusive economic gains — a less well-understood aspect of the technology.</p><p>Irene mentions that Identity is something that can go into a vast context. As a digital concept, it is a lot more about actual specificity. Everyone knows the idea: one person, one vote, and which is one of the central tenets about how we have started to arrange society and to live together with each other. But with the digital sphere, we are now in an age where you cannot be 100% certain that the person or the entities you are interacting with right now is actually:</p>  A) a&nbsp;person  B) a person distinct from the other&nbsp;one  <p>The question is, what do you want to trust? So, in the digital sphere, how can we be sure that we identify the correct person and an actual human being as a&nbsp;person?</p><p>“How do we make sure that we can stay true to this idea of one person, one voice in the internet age? Can this be decentralized? Yes, it can. And I believe it must because otherwise, it’s tough to get back to this one person, one voice, one vote, kind of idea we are striving for,” probes&nbsp;Irene.</p><p>“Digital identity is something we all have with online banking, with logging into different accounts, whether social media or via the service platform. How to decentralize is the question at the moment. We are seeing many platforms holding our account information and ensuring that data stays private and that there is no leak and that they are handling it appropriately and just be working so far, but we see more and more problems.”</p><blockquote>The idea is to have a decentralized autonomous identity where we can have our data’s power, while the data we are generating online is to basically go into something that we are also slightly familiar with from the physical world. And that is a division of power. This is where the idea of Self-Sovereign Identity comes into as a&nbsp;concept.</blockquote> Do Digital Identities solve socio-economic problems? <p>Digital identities are already helping in certain areas but are not fully decentralized. “ For example, the app I have for the train service in Germany, the Deutsche Bahn — I can get updated information about my tickets, I can make the reservation, and I can switch reservations. I am doing that because I have a digital identity account with them. In mobility sharing services such as rental bikes, I’m also using my digital identity to use their services. I have a digital ID with the tax authorities, which lets me handle my taxes from my computer’s comfort at home. All of that is already a digital identity.”</p><p>But the path to a decentralized digital identity is still far-fetched. Irene says that what has just been described as decentralized digital identities is just starting across the world. And Germany is currently beginning a pilot project in which Jolocom is taking part. “In the larger scheme, for three years, different companies and consortiums, and groups are working on providing this kind of decentralized, secure, SSI identity to citizens to help with municipal services and other things. That is something that’s going to start later this year and then go for two or three years, depending on the different projects.”</p> Are GDPR and digital identity&nbsp;friends? <p>GDPR was about privacy preservation, ensuring that control over our private personal data doesn’t go to unauthorized entities and be as beneficial or benevolent as they want to be. And there are certain data sets to which they shouldn’t have access. Because if they have access to it, it’s always possible that less than benevolent entities get access to it. GDPR is about the principle of privacy and data autonomy. And here definitely, this is in alignment with the principles of Self-sovereign identity. So one of them is autonomy, and another one is privacy. These aspects are going hand in&nbsp;hand.</p> The role of big tech in creating decentralized digital identities <p>We have millions and billions of digital identities already in place and probably multiply exponentially in the next couple of years. To handle this kind of influx of data and identity actors and entities, that is something where we need big tech, definitely just to be able to handle all of these things. They have the infrastructure in place to scale on these kinds of numbers. Understandably, big tech is going there, only because the market will be almost the same as the world’s population, if not larger because we have one person who has more devices than just one. This explains why it’s good that they are in this field and why it’s natural and understandable that they want to move into this&nbsp;field.</p><p>On the other hand, where do we need big tech? The cause for concern is, of course, the idea that if you have central authorities able to access specific data, it can quickly lead to the question of whether I want other people to have access to this data or these devices. And in some cases, we might not care, and in some cases, we might want to care very much because you always have to think about these things, especially from the regulatory point of view, from the worst-case scenario.</p> The user experience to use Digital Identities <p>Digital identity is something a lot of us already have. If we are talking about, for example, using an SSI wallet, it’s quite similar. And, of course, you need to get yourself comfortable with the entire concept. Setting up the account in your Jolocom wallet, for example, is slightly a few more steps than usual. It does not just generate a password — you are being issued a private key that you need to write down if your phone gets stolen or lost or is broken. Once you are set up after a while and have walked through the eight to 10 steps — it’s as simple as scanning and using and showing QR&nbsp;codes.</p> Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast: <p>1: 50–7.05: What is a digital identity, and how it be decentralized?</p><p>7.05–10.10: How many digital identities can one person&nbsp;have?</p><p>10.10–12.50: How can decentralized digital identities help citizens in solving socio-economic problems?</p><p>12.50–15.30: Are Digital Identities and GDPR&nbsp;friends?</p><p>15.30–20.35: The role of big tech in managing decentralized digital identities</p><p>20:35–23.20: Role of Jolocom in creating decentralized digital identities</p><p>23.20–25.00: Public sectors role in creating decentralized digital identities</p><p>25:00 onwards: The user experience of using a decentralized digital&nbsp;identity</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

					 Indicio expands decentralized identity workshops and introduces new certification program 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Responding to strong demand, Indicio now offers certification upon completion of its virtual, instructor-led decentralized identity training.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Technology provider Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation advancing decentralized identity, today announced a new professional certification program. Program participants completing Indicio’s popular instructor-led workshops, including the newest workshops on the open source Hyperledger Aries <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/">Mediator Agent</a> and <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/hyperledger-aries-sees-new-coordinated-effort-to-produce-complete-mobile-agent/">Mobile Agent</a>, are awarded certificates of completion issued in the form of a verifiable credential.</p>
<p>“We first envisioned Indicio training as the gateway to understanding decentralized identity,” says Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. ”Decentralized technology, its terminology, and its technical process can be confusing to grasp on your own, even though the actual process of issuing, holding, and verifying credentials is surprisingly easy. So our thought was that we should give people the opportunity to learn about decentralized identity through hands-on activities guided by an experienced instructor. It turned out that this delivered the ‘aha’ moment for workshop participants and inspired them to want to know more.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Building this into a certificate program recognizes the need and the demand for systematic training in our field,” says Dahl. “And it only makes sense the certificate is issued in the form of a verifiable credential, using the <a href="https://entrustient.com/">EntTrustient</a> platform, an innovator in credentials for governments, education, employment, travel, health, and finance industries.”</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to support the issuance of Indicio’s training credentials for participants who’ve successfully demonstrated skills attainment and program completion.” says Tim Dutta, Chairman, and CEO of Entrustient, “Indicio’s workshops are designed to enable the next generation of trained professionals to be fluent in decentralized identity technology. By using Entrustient’s innovative, redundant, and decentralized distributed blockchain ledger platform, recipients of these credentials will now have full agency and the ability to provide a proof presentation of their earned accomplishments, to any third-party verifying organization that relies on certifications from Indicio, the original credential issuer.”</p>
<p>Expanding decentralized identity curriculum</p>
<p>The evolution of Indicio’s training workshops comes as companies and organizations are increasingly seeing decentralized identity as the solution to the longstanding challenge of verifying identity online, a critical process that has only become more urgent with the impact of the Covid pandemic on all aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>Designed for participants ranging in technical experience, skill level, and area of specialization, Indicio’s workshops provide the groundwork needed for both business and engineering team members to build and run decentralized networks and the applications that run on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants will receive a Certification of Completion and a verifiable credential that can be shared with peers and networks across social platforms and add ‘Decentralized Identity’ to their resumes.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>Indicio’s instructor-led workshops provide:</p>
 
 Hands-on learning covering each step of decentralized identity: These courses cover topics ranging from the fundamentals to network operations and agent mediation, with more courses expected to be added throughout the year.

<p>Ah, Multi-factor Authentication. MFA.  Pronounced “em-eff-ayyyyy”</p>
      
<p>From the admin to the end-user, everybody loves MFA. Well, not entirely.</p>
      
<p>You know who really loves MFA? The password. So much so, that the two are practically married. </p>
      
<p>Chances are your company is already using MFA. You may think it solved your password problem, but do any of these sound like pain points?</p>
      
  Password resets  User account lockouts   Credential reuse  Login friction   MITM attacks  MFA bypass   Phishing  
      
<p>So much for solving the password problem.</p>
      
<p>Despite widespread MFA adoption, password problems are at an all-time high.</p>
      
  
      
<p>The fact is, MFA didn’t replace the password. It made a huge improvement in security posture, but most MFA methods are built on top of passwords. That means most MFA is just adding one shared secret on top of another shared secret. </p>
      
<p>As more companies try to eliminate the use of passwords they come to a stark realization: that their multi-factor security products have actually married them to the use of passwords, which are an awful security foundation. </p>
      
<p>A question they ask is, “How do we move away from passwords and ensure multi-factor security?”</p>
      
<p>The short answer is <a href="https://www.hypr.com/true-passwordless-mfa/">Passwordless MFA</a>. You can just <a>skip ahead</a> to the part where you divorce the password. </p>
      
<p>If you prefer to read on, let’s look at three common authentication methods — OTP (one-time password), push, and SMS — and explore how each of these is just another iteration of a password.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 One-Time Passwords (OTP) 
      
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/time-based-time-password-totp-otp/">One-Time Passwords (OTP)</a> are a string of digits or a code that is generated on either hardware security tokens like a smart card or key fob, or as soft tokens, meaning mobile device apps that display the numbers. After a user has entered a username and password, they are prompted to input a valid OTP in an additional login field as proof of possession. If the OTPs match, the user can access the account or system.</p>
      
 OTP Password Based MFA Apps 
      
<p>How is an OTP like the password? </p>
      
<p>First, like the password, an OTP is based on the concept of a shared secret. </p>
      
<p>Second, it’s literally in the name: One-Time Password.</p>
      
<p>As the name suggests, OTPs can only be used one time and usually expire after 30-to-60 seconds. They’re certainly more secure than user-created passwords, which can be weak and/or reused across multiple accounts. However, they still rely on a user password.</p>
      
<p>OTPs are sometimes mistaken for “passwordless” authentication, but really, they’re just passwords in disguise (it’s in the name after all). They still require a password as well as a shared secret. Which means they’re still vulnerable and subject to a variety of attacks, such as MFA phishing, mobile malware, keyloggers or <a href="https://www.hypr.com/man-in-the-middle/">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 SMS 2-Factor Authentication 
      
<p>SMS text messages are the most common OTP delivery method today. With SMS, OTPs are delivered to the user’s smartphone via text message, negating the need for a separate piece of hardware. As most people have a mobile phone of some kind, avoiding the cost of a hardware token has led many service providers to adopt SMS for large-scale consumer use.</p>
      
 <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-banks-are-moving-away-from-sms-one-time-passcodes/">Source: ZDNet</a> 
      
<p>But, similar to OTP, SMS relies on a user having a password and a shared secret, making it a less than ideal method of authentication. An OTP message could be delivered to the wrong mobile phone or your mobile phone could be stolen or compromised. SMS messages can be intercepted via SS7 network attacks, or mobile malware can be used to steal an automated SMS OTP.</p>
      
<p>In fact, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://www.hypr.com/de-nistify-800-63b-aal/">stopped recommending the use of SMS</a> as a strong second factor in July 2016. In the EU, German banks have already begun <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-banks-are-moving-away-from-sms-one-time-passcodes/">phasing out the use of SMS OTP</a>.</p>
      
  
      
<p></p>
      
 Push Authentication 
      
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/push-authentication/">Push authentication</a> is another mobile-centric authentication method whereby the service provider sends the user a notification to their mobile phone. The user then only has to tap the screen to get access to the account or system. Push authentication relies on the user having possession of mobile phone and the ability to unlock the phone, with a decentralized PIN or a biometric method such as a fingerprint or face recognition.</p>
      
<p>So, it must be passwordless, right? </p>
      
  
      
<p>PUSH authentication can be used as part of a passwordless system if the solution is built upon PKI or certificate-based authentication. But in most cases today, PUSH authentication is an MFA mode layered on top of additional shared secrets including (you guessed it) a password.</p>
      
<p>PUSH notifications have also been the subject of recent attacks, with malicious hackers targeting users who may unwittingly approve a dubious PUSH notification prompt for a transaction or login request. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks/">Learn more about PUSH Attacks</a>.</p>
      
<p>In a recent <a href="https://get.hypr.com/2021-state-of-passwordless-security-report">report</a> we found that 9% of survey respondents reported a rise in PUSH attacks since they moved to a remote workforce.</p>
      
<a href="https://get.hypr.com/2021-state-of-passwordless-security-report">Source: The 2021 State of Passwordless Security</a>
      
<p></p>
      
 How to Divorce the Password 
      
<p>Companies are adopting a Passwordless approach to Multi-factor Authentication. Through what we call <a href="https://www.hypr.com/true-passwordless-mfa/">True Passwordless MFA</a>, HYPR customers are able to combine several factors:</p>
      
  Something you are: your fingerprint, face scan, or other biometric recognition.  Something you have: your smartphone, which acts as a physical FIDO token, similar to a security key or smart card.  Something you know: a decentralized PIN that’s also stored safely on your device.&nbsp;  
      
<p>Deploying True Passwordless MFA has allowed for 300% faster login speeds, a steep drop in fraud and phishing, and reduced friction across the user base.</p>
      
<p>By combining <a href="https://www.hypr.com/mobile-initiated-authentication/">mobile-initiated login</a> with a powerful FIDO-Certified architecture, the HYPR Cloud Platform is enabling IT leaders across the globe to ditch the password. The best part? It works with their existing IAM infrastructure, meaning there is no need to rip and replace what’s working for you. That makes the separation from passwords painless, less costly, and all the more amicable. </p>

 MicroWorkers’ integration of ONTO Wallet completes the latest phase in their joint venture with Ontology to promote users’ access to additional payment&nbsp;options <p>To further their mutual aim of empowering microworkers across the globe, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, public blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data, and global freelancing marketplace leader <a href="https://www.microworkers.com/">MicroWorkers</a> (MW), have announced the completion of the latest phase of their collaboration. Following the initial confirmation of the partnership in February 2020, this latest phase of the collaboration saw Ontology work closely with Microworkers to oversee the integration of its ONTO Wallet with the MicroWorkers platform, thereby enabling users to receive their rewards through methods other than PayPal and Payoneer, and increasing access to capital for many around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The global online freelancing market is growing rapidly and members of the burgeoning industry are utilizing blockchain technology to make their platform and marketplaces more efficient. Today’s announcement comes at a time of heightened interest in crypto participation and sees MicroWorkers leverage the Ontology blockchain to support its growing AI demands and enable workers and employers to use their ONTO digital wallets to receive and send crypto payments. MicroWorker users are also able to securely store and share their account history and reputation score through their <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a> on-chain, allowing for cutting-edge encryption while placing sole control of the data in the hands of the user. With the initial test phase of the integration now completed, these services will soon be available to all MicroWorkers users.</p><p>Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, stated, “We are proud that this partnership will enable the users and employers of MicroWorkers to get paid through <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO</a> app, showcasing Ontology’s blockchain and identity platform as a way to deliver these much-needed services at a time when micro workers most need&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Using their ONTO digital wallet, MicroWorkers users can withdraw Binance USD (BUSD) digital currency, and then deposit euros into their debit cards. This greatly expands the amount of withdrawal methods and currency types available for users of MicroWorkers, giving them greater choice over how they get paid for their work. There are also a number of other benefits for users, including a significantly lower withdrawal fee rate, which at 2% is lower than other withdrawal methods on the current MicroWorkers platform. In an effort to attract more users to participate in the initiative, a number of additional benefits will be offered, including the elimination of card opening fees and the wider availability of digital currency rewards. Finally, an income certificate can be generated on ONTO with one click, which provides convenience for users when seeking related jobs, and also makes ONTO’s functions more demonstrative.</p><p>Commenting on the integration, Nhatvi Nguyen, CEO of MicroWorkers said, “By enabling this integration with Ontology, we are making significant strides in terms of how our workers can get paid. We believe that this development will promote a new level of financial freedom among our platform users and enable them to benefit from the number of exciting new services that we have in the pipeline. We see blockchain and digital identity as hugely important, and we’re dedicated to leveraging these emerging technologies to provide micro workers around the world with the best possible experience.”</p> About MicroWorkers <p>MicroWorkers is an innovative online platform that connects employers and freelancing workers from all around the world. MicroWorkers is the #1 alternative to Amazon Mechanical Turk and is accessible to enterprises and freelancers in over 190 countries globally.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/microworkers-integrates-ontologys-onto-wallet-to-facilitate-additional-payment-options-for-workers-1163291af76c">MicroWorkers Integrates Ontology’s ONTO Wallet To Facilitate Additional Payment Options For Workers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Quantum computing is one of those topics that always seem to exist just out of our reach. Well over a decade ago we were promised that a real quantum computer will appear just in a few years, and for most people, this feeling remains the same even now. But is this assumption correct? Do we really need to wait a few years more until the fastest, biggest, and most reliable quantum computers will finally find their way into every industry? Or is it something we should already be considering today?</p>
 Understanding (or at least trying to) quantum computing 
<p>Now, I will not attempt to explain how quantum computing works in this post: in fact, we’ve already tried that in an <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/quantum_computing_threat" title="episode of the KuppingerCole podcast on this subject">episode of the KuppingerCole podcast on this subject</a>. Also, I won’t even pretend I can understand much of quantum physics and its underlying mathematics despite having a degree in it. But one crucial thing that must be reiterated is that quantum computing is based on principles fundamentally different from classical computers and thus is not meant to be a replacement for existing computer algorithms. When reliably working and sufficiently powerful quantum hardware becomes available, it will not magically make existing programs or computational methods run faster.</p>
<p>In reality, the most interesting potential applications for quantum computing are problems that are practically impossible to solve with traditional methods in any feasible amount of time. Various problems in the field of chemistry and nanotechnology are among popular goals; the so-called quantum annealing can be used for solving various optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem. Finally, the notorious integer factorization problem, if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" title="solved with quantum algorithms">solved with quantum algorithms</a>, can undermine the reliability of public key encryption. This hypothetical advantage over classical computers is somewhat awkwardly referred to as “quantum supremacy”.</p>
 Quantum Supremacy – does it even mean anything? 
<p>Well, at least it is no longer hypothetical: back in 2019, Google has claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy by solving a problem on a quantum computer in 200 seconds, which would take a classical supercomputer 10,000 years to complete. In December 2020, Chinese scientists have performed boson sampling (I wish I could explain what it even means!) in 20 seconds, which allegedly would take 600 million years of traditional computation. So, does it mean that powerful and useful quantum computers are already a reality?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not that easy. First, demonstrating quantum supremacy does not require solving a practically useful problem. Also, real physical quantum computers are very sensitive to imperfections in the underlying hardware and the influence of the environment. Without introducing special quantum error correction methods, large-scale quantum computing is still practically impossible (think of working with a classical computer that crashes every second). Combined with the enormous difficulties of scaling quantum computers to thousands or millions of qubits needed to implement useful algorithms, it may look like the majority of organizations shouldn’t even worry about practical applications for at least another five years…</p>
<p></p>
 Should I start with quantum computing today? 
<p>And again, the answer is not that easy. Even if your business isn’t planning to benefit from quantum computing yet, there are some aspects of it that you have to consider anyway. The most obvious one is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/n40521" title="crypto-agility">crypto-agility</a>. Even though the currently used encryption algorithms have not been compromised yet, the chance that it can happen very shortly is high enough. Standards bodies are already working on evaluating and standardizing quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, NIST is planning to release their first standard next year already. Vendors working in this area are already implementing the necessary changes in their encryption platforms to make the migration to post-quantum cryptography easier. If your organization keeps encrypted data in the cloud, you should at least be aware of these developments.</p>
<p>But what if you want to start with quantum computing properly? Sure, the current generation of hardware isn’t yet suitable for tasks like cracking public encryption, but surely certain “less glamourous” problems like improving the efficiency of fertilizers and car batteries or modeling financial markets can already be tackled. Where do you get a quantum computer? How do you learn to operate it? Are they available as-a-service?</p>
<p>Yes, they are! In fact, quantum computing as a managed service is perhaps the only sensible option for the next few years. The actual hardware is quite complicated and delicate, requiring a team of experts to operate. Also, a substantial part of today’s quantum applications is running simulations on traditional hardware, which is only feasible at the cloud scale. It is no wonder that all major cloud service providers currently offer at least some kind of a managed environment for researching and experimenting with cloud computing. Google and IBM are perhaps the leaders in developing their own technologies, while Microsoft and AWS have open ecosystems with solutions from multiple 3rd party vendors. Smaller companies like the Canadian D-Wave might offer their own “quantum clouds” as well.</p>
 Choosing the right partner 
<p>The biggest question is thus not “should I start with quantum computing today” but rather “whom should I choose as the strategic partner”. I’m afraid nobody can currently give a definitive answer for this today as every aspiring vendor has their own advantages. <a href="https://quantumai.google/" title="Google">Google</a>, for example, was the first one to achieve quantum supremacy. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/" title="IBM">IBM</a> offers perhaps the most comprehensive long-term roadmap for a full stack of QC services. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/quantum/" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> focuses on an open ecosystem with universal high-level tools that can work on hybrid computing architectures. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/braket/" title="Amazon">Amazon</a> is attracting developers with a free tier for quantum simulation.</p>
<p>In the end, the choice is entirely yours. One thing is certain though: quantum computing is no longer science fiction. Even today, many companies can already reap tangible benefits by becoming early adopters, hiring the right talent to develop new algorithms and applications, and partnering with the right providers to get access to the actual quantum hardware. Perhaps, with more mature hardware and diverse application scenarios, we’ll end up with a “multi-quantum” reality just like we have with the cloud in general. Will this lead to an emergence of a universal framework for quantum computing similar to Kubernetes? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Press Release:</p>



<p>UK-based consent and preference management platform, MyLife Digital will join forces with leading European consent management platform (CMP) provider Usercentrics to deliver a truly unified consent and preference management solution. The new partnership between the two industry giants will bring improved, more transparent experiences to users while also offering organisations simple integration patterns for facilitating better use of data.</p>



<p>By integrating Usercentrics CMP, MyLife Digital will provide a comprehensive consent and preferences management solution, providing one of the only platforms to simultaneously offer a consent and preference management for both valuable first-party data and cookies, pixels and other web technologies. With its Identity Access Management solution, through its partnership with Auth0, MyLife Digital will be in a unique position to offer an authenticated consent and preference management service that will provide a unified view of cookie consent and first-party consent and preferences, linked to an individual’s identity.</p>



<p>In bringing together their respective solutions, MyLife Digital and Usercentrics are striving to create greater transparency in what is currently a very opaque landscape. By introducing greater clarity and simple options for the consumer to update their consents and preferences, the two firms make it easier for individuals to understand what data is collected and held about them and why, ultimately delivering a better privacy experience and building trust.</p>



<p>J Cromack, co-founder and Managing Director of MyLife Digital, said, “It’s a very exciting time at MyLife Digital with both Forrester and Gartner predicting 2021 will be the year privacy becomes an imperative. Partnering with a best of breed provider like Usercentrics is an important part of our plan. Being able to offer an authenticated, consent and preference management service which provides a unified view of all consents and preferences linked to an individual’s identity across an organisation is a game-changer for those businesses who want to retain and build the utility in their data. Our goal has always been to help our customers deliver greater transparency and empower their consumers to make informed choices through data understanding, which builds loyalty and trust.”</p>



<p>Forrester states that privacy will be ‘an imperative’ in 2021, while Gartner believes that ‘a proactive approach to privacy and data protection’ will be essential for businesses to build consumer trust in a post-pandemic landscape.</p>



<p>According to Forrester, many organisations may be opening themselves up to risk this year as they seek rapid recovery solutions following twelve months of uncertainty and disruption. The leading market research firm predicts that businesses will demonstrate an ‘ever-increasing appetite to collect, process, and share sensitive personal data from consumers’ in a bid to make smarter, more informed, data-driven decisions to facilitate growth in the new normal.</p>



<p>However, at the same time, it is also expected that regulatory activity will increase rapidly over the next year. With the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) now being considered the global standard, many countries are beginning to build their own data privacy and protection laws, resulting in a growing need for businesses to fully understand how to remain compliant when collecting and storing data from customers across the globe.</p>



<p>Hanna Waldenmaier, Vice President of Global Partnerships at Usercentrics says, “Since the GDPR came into force, user consent has been the legal basis for data-based marketing. Without valid user consent, the use of cookies, pixels, or other technologies for marketing purposes is not permitted. At Usercentrics, we want to make it as easy as possible for customers to comply with legal requirements and continue to conduct data-driven, performance marketing. Furthermore, customers should have the possibility to not only collect consent easily but also be sure that the consent and preference status is accurate at all times in order to secure compliance. With MyLife Digital, we have now gained a partner with many years of expertise in the area of consent and preference management, and together we can offer companies the best possible support.”</p>

 SPID e CIE : come arrivare alla svolta per le imprese nel 2021 



<p>Si tratta di un evento facente parte di una importante campagna di comunicazione legata alla scadenza del 28 febbraio per l’adozione di #SPID e #CIE come unico sistema di identificazione dei cittadini per l’accesso ai propri servizi digitali.</p>



<p>L’obiettivo è quello di sensibilizzare sempre di più le imprese ad aderire nel 2021 a #SPID e #CIE, come nel 2020 hanno aderito i cittadini.</p>



<p>Verranno trattati ed approfonditi alcuni dei temi chiave identificati da ClubTI Milano come prioritari:</p>



<p>1. Aggregatori di servizi privati SPID e CIE: chiave per lo sviluppo di un vero mercato dove le imprese possano chiedere e offrire servizi di autenticazione con queste identità.</p>



<p>2. Attribute Authority: opportunità di innovazione e integrazione dei processi digitali grazie a modelli di autorizzazione applicativa con SPID e CIE imperniati sugli attributi dell’individuo e dell’impresa. Tratteremo in quest’ambito anche i profili SPID per uso professionale e aziendale e per persone giuridiche.</p>



<p>3. Firme con SPID e CIE: situazione e raccomandazioni per le imprese</p>



<p>4. Identità europee a standard eIDAS per l’accesso ai servizi digitali delle imprese italiane.</p>



<p>5. Open Data sull’uso di CNS, SPID e CIE nelle pubbliche amministrazioni: opportunità per identificare servizi digitali ai cittadini e alle imprese, innovativi e integrati tra imprese e pubbliche amministrazioni.</p>

   Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native, Java framework for building high-performance web, serverless, and native apps. It uses Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation and aggressive optimizations like classpath scanning, configuration reloading, and application bootstrap pre-configuration during the build process. This results in impressive startup performance. In other words, a Quarkus app starts up super fast!

  <p>Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native, Java framework for building high-performance web, serverless, and native apps. It uses Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation and aggressive optimizations like classpath scanning, configuration reloading, and application bootstrap pre-configuration during the build process. This results in impressive startup performance. In other words, a Quarkus app starts up super fast!</p>

<p>Like Spring and Micronaut, Quarkus can take advantage of GraalVM to transform a JVM-based application into a native executable, improving the overall performance even more!</p>

<p>Such performance gains allow the Java platform to be competitive in serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments by building Supersonic Subatomic Java applications.</p>

<p>Quarkus uses Java standards (like <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile">MicroProfile</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jax-rs">JAX-RS</a>) and best of breed libraries (such as <a href="https://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> and <a href="https://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>). It even has support for <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a>’s annotations.</p>

 Quarkus + JHipster = Fast Java Made Easy 

<p>Development history has demonstrated gluing components together can be challenging. Developers love when you provide them enlightened opinions, and this is where JHipster comes in.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">JHipster</a> is a community-driven, full-stack development platform for generating, developing, and deploying modern web applications and microservice architectures.</p>

<p>The default backend framework in JHipster is Spring Boot, but more and more options are appearing. One of these options is the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-quarkus">JHipster Quarkus blueprint</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Among others, one of the key capabilities that’s determined JHipster’s success is its extensibility via blueprints. A blueprint acts as a JHipster plugin and lets you override the default behavior to produce a new “flavor.”</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin">JHipster’s Kotlin blueprint</a> is, for instance, a popular add-on that developers like to use.</p>

<p>Thanks to blueprints, the possibilities are infinite. This is why JHipster even has non-Java implementations (like <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-nodejs">Node + NestJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-dotnetcore">.NET Core</a>.</p>

<p>This post will walk you through the steps to use JHipster, the Quarkus blueprint, and OAuth to build a native and secure full stack application.</p>

 Create a Java Application with Quarkus 

<p>You’ll need to install a few things before you get started.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11+</a> 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js 12+</a> 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI 0.8.0+</a> 
 

<p>Install JHipster and its Quarkus blueprint using <code>npm</code>:</p>

   <code># Install JHipster globally
npm install -g generator-jhipster@6.10.5

# Install the JHipster Quarkus blueprint
npm install -g generator-jhipster-quarkus@1.1.1
</code>   

<p>The <code>jhipster-quarkus</code> command is now available as a shortcut for <code>jhipster --blueprints quarkus</code>. You can see all its options with the <code>--help</code> command.</p>

   <code>$ jhipster-quarkus --help
</code>   

 Generate a JHipster Quarkus Application 

<p>To begin, generate a JHipster app with a Quarkus backend. Open a terminal and create a directory for your application.</p>

   <code>mkdir okta-jhipster-quarkus-example &amp;&amp; cd okta-jhipster-quarkus-example
# oh-my-zsh users: take okta-jhipster-quarkus-example
</code>   

<p>You can invoke the <code>jhipster-quarkus</code> command to start the application creation wizard.</p>

   <code>jhipster-quarkus
</code>   

<p>For this tutorial, the key question will be the one regarding authentication.</p>

<p></p>

<p>JHipster Quarkus allows you to use JWT (with user management in the application database) or OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Authentication via identity providers like Keycloak and Okta. OIDC stands for OpenID Connect and is a thin layer on top of OAuth 2.0. Its primary purpose is to provide authentication and identify the user.</p>

<p>Below is an example of wizard answers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After you answer all the questions, JHipster will generate your application code and run <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to generate the same as I did for this tutorial, you can copy the following JSON into a <code>.yo-rc.json</code> in your <code>okta-jhipster-quarkus-example</code> directory, and run <code>jhipster-quarkus</code>.</p>

   <code>{
  "generator-jhipster": {
    "promptValues": {
      "packageName": "com.mycompany.myapp",
      "nativeLanguage": "en"
    },

    "otherModules": [
      {
        "name": "generator-jhipster-quarkus",
        "version": "1.1.1"
      }
    ],
    "enableTranslation": true,

    "blueprints": [
      {
        "name": "generator-jhipster-quarkus",
        "version": "1.1.1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This file contains all the answers to JHipster’s initial questions, and will allow you to generate your app without any prompts.</p>

 Make Sure OAuth 2.0 / OIDC with Keycloak Works 

<p>Among other files, JHipster Quarkus generates a set of Docker Compose files to help you bootstrap a dev environment tailored for your freshly generated application. It even imports Keycloak default data with users and apps, so you don’t have to.</p>

<p>Keycloak is the default OIDC engine used by JHipster, and you can run it in a Docker container.</p>

<p>Start a Keycloak container using the command below:</p>

   <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
</code>   

<p>With Keycloak up and running, you should be able to log in. Start your app using Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>You can see the app starts in <code>3.351s</code> and contains a vast list of Quarkus extensions (including <code>oidc</code>).</p>

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favorite browser and click the sign in link.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will be redirected to Keycloak to log in. Enter <code>admin/admin</code> when prompted for credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After successfully authenticating, you’ll be redirected back to your Quarkus app.</p>

<p></p>

 How JHipster Quarkus OAuth 2.0 Support Works 

<p>One of the challenges when developing a JHipster blueprint like the Quarkus is finding the sweet spot between reusing existing mechanisms and custom implementation.</p>

<p>Since Day 1, JHipster has integrated modern web application frameworks (Angular, React, or even Vue.js) with de-facto standard Java-based technologies, like Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.</p>

<p>The JHipster Quarkus OAuth 2.0 implementation relies on a <code>login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> redirect URI, which Spring Security expects. Doing server-side authentication is highly recommended since it’s a lot more secure (because the browser does not have to manage any credentials or store any access tokens).</p>

<p>In JHipster Quarkus, to reuse the front applications as-is and implement a server-side OAuth 2.0 flow, the backend had to expose these two HTTP routes. This is why JHipster Quarkus has a <code>UserOauth2Controller</code> controller and customized Quarkus OIDC properties to make everything work properly.</p>

<p>This is the kind of integration pitfall developers don’t want to waste time on. The collective intelligence of the JHipster community converges highly-efficient opinions, which explains the platform’s popularity and quality.</p>

 Integrate JHipster Quarkus with Okta 

<p>In this section, you’ll learn how to use Okta as an OAuth 2.0 / OIDC provider. Okta has two options for configuring an OpenID Connect (OIDC) application. You can either go through the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">developer console</a> or use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a>.</p>

 Use the Okta CLI to Configure JHipster 

<p>The Okta CLI automates all the JHipster + Okta configuration for you. You can install the Okta CLI using popular package managers.</p>

<p>macOS (via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>):</p>

   <code>brew install --cask oktadeveloper/tap/okta
</code>   

<p>Linux (via Flatpak):</p>

   <code># Add Flathub repo
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

# install the package
flatpak install com.okta.developer.CLI

# add this to your appropriate dot file
alias okta="flatpak run com.okta.developer.CLI"
</code>   

<p>Windows (via Chocolatey):</p>

   <code>choco install okta -version 0.8.0
</code>   

<p>You can also just pipe it to bash:</p>

   <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okta/okta-cli/master/cli/src/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
</code>   

<p>Open a terminal, navigate to your Quarkus app’s directory, and run <code>okta register</code> if you don’t have an Okta developer account. If you already have one, run <code>okta login</code>.</p>

   <code>$ okta register
First name: Daniel
Last name: Petisme
Email address: daniel.petisme@gmail.com
Company: Okta
Creating new Okta Organization, this may take a minute:
OrgUrl: https://dev-9323263.okta.com

To set your password open this link:
https://dev-9323263.okta.com/welcome/drpt2SjbRAPR-gvVHhnm
</code>   

<p>If you already have an Okta developer account, run <code>okta login</code>. Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code> in your Quarkus app’s directory. Accept the defaults when prompted for redirect URIs.</p>

   <code>$ okta apps create jhipster
Application name [okta-jhipster-quarkus-example]:
Redirect URI
Common defaults:
  Spring Security - http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta
  Quarkus OIDC - http://localhost:8080/callback
  JHipster - http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc
Enter your Redirect URI(s) [http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc, http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc]:
Enter your Post Logout Redirect URI(s) [http://localhost:8080/, http://localhost:8761/]:

Creating group: ROLE_USER
Creating group: ROLE_ADMIN

Okta application configuration has been written to: /Users/daniel/workspace/okta-jhipster-quarkus-example/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default. They aren’t necessary for this tutorial, but there’s no harm in leaving them in.</p>

<p>The Okta CLI will create an <code>.okta.env</code> in the current directory.  If you look at it, you’ll see that it contains several OIDC-related keys and values.</p>

   <code>$ cat .okta.env
export QUARKUS_OIDC_AUTH_SERVER_URL="https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export QUARKUS_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="0oa5ozjxyNQPPbKc65d6"
export QUARKUS_OIDC_CREDENTIALS_SECRET="KEJ0oNOTFEUEFHP7i1TELLING1xLm1XPRn"
export QUARKUS_OIDC_AUTHENTICATION_REDIRECT_PATH="/login/oauth2/code/oidc"
export JHIPSTER_OIDC_LOGOUT_URL="https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/logout"
</code>   

<p>Source the file to set environment variables and start your application with Maven.</p>

   <code>source .okta.env
./mvnw
</code>   

<p>Make sure to add <code>*.env</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> so you don’t commit your client secret!</p>

<p>Once it’s started, open an incognito window to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and sign in. You’ll be prompted for your Okta credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After authenticating successfully, you’ll be redirected back to your app. You should see your email address displayed on the homepage.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Okta CLI streamlines JHipster’s configuration and does several things for you:</p>

 
   It creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs 
   It makes <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   It adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   It creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>What if you dislike the command line? Don’t panic; I have your back! The Okta CLI is easy to use, but you might want to use a UI to configure things. That’s why I’ll go through each step to configure an OIDC application that works with JHipster Quarkus.</p>

 Use Okta’s Developer Console to Configure JHipster 

<p>If you don’t have an Okta developer account, you need to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">sign up</a>. It’s nothing fancy: first name, last name, email, a strong password, and you’re ready to go.</p>

<p>Once logged in, you arrive in your developer console:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Expand Applications on the left nav, then go to Applications &gt; Add Application &gt; Create New App to start the app creation wizard.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select Web and OpenID Connect. Then click Create.</p>

<p>You now need to provide some application settings.</p>

 
   Name: Whatever you want, but “JHipster Quarkus” sounds cool 😎 
   Login redirect URIs: Where Okta will redirect the user’s browser once authenticated.
Set it to <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code>, as this is what’s configured by default 
   Logout redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> This is where the user will land after they log out 
   Group assignments: Which groups can use this application 
 

<p>Use the default values for the rest of the settings.</p>

<p>When you’re happy with your application, click Done. The next screen will show your application details.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The most important values are:</p>

 
   The client credentials (client id and client secret). They allow your Java application to authenticate against Okta services for user authentication and authorization flows. 
   The Okta domain from which Quarkus will derive the OAuth / OIDC endpoint URLs. 
 

 Create User Groups 

<p>Now it’s time to create user groups. Out of the box, JHipster requires two groups:</p>

 
   <code>ROLE_USER</code>: for the authenticated users 
   <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code>: for the authenticated users with administrator privileges on the application 
 

<p>In your developer console, go to Directory &gt; Groups. Click on Add Group and create the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> group.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, add the <code>ROLE_USER</code> group.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’re done with the user groups; now, let’s add users.</p>

 Create Users 

<p>To see the difference between an admin user and a regular user, create users in each group. Using the Okta developer console, go to Directory &gt; People.</p>

<p>Click on Add Person. Start by creating an <code>Administrator</code> user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The key points are to associate the <code>Administrator</code> user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> group.
For this tutorial’s sake, use the <code>Set by Admin</code> password strategy to define an initial password the user will have to change.</p>

<p>I recommend using the Set by User strategy with an activation email in a real-life context.</p>

<p>Now, add a regular user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure the <code>User</code> person is a member of the <code>ROLE_USER</code> group. It’s important to use a valid email address for password recovery purposes.</p>

<p>Go to Applications &gt; JHipster Quarkus and click on Assignments. Assign the users you just created.</p>

 Add a Groups Claim to the ID Token 

<p>The last thing you’ll need to do is configure a groups claim that includes a user’s groups in the ID token. Go to Security &gt; API and click on default. Go to Claims &gt; Add Claim. Enter the following values:</p>

 
   Name: <code>groups</code> 
   Include in token type: ID Token 
   Value type: groups 
   Filter: Matches regex with a value of <code>.*</code> 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click Create.</p>

<p>The Okta configuration for JHipster is now complete!</p>

 Configure Quarkus OIDC for Okta 

<p>At this point, you have a JHipster Quarkus Application running and configured to use Keycloak as its identity provider.</p>

<p>Let’s change it to use Okta.</p>

<p>First, you need to log out from the JHipster web application to prevent cookie collisions.
Go to Account &gt; Sign Out.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can leave the application running. Quarkus provides what they call a Dev Mode which hot reloads any source or resource file whenever they are updated. It’s super slick!</p>

<p>Edit <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> and find the following OIDC configuration section.</p>

   <code># OAuth 2.0 and OIDC
quarkus.oidc.enabled=true
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/
%dev.quarkus.oidc.client-id=web_app
%dev.quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=web_app
quarkus.oidc.application-type=hybrid
quarkus.oidc.authentication.scopes=profile,address,email,address,phone,offline_access
quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path=/
quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path=/login/oauth2/code/oidc
quarkus.oidc.authentication.restore-path-after-redirect=false

jhipster.oidc.logout-url=http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/logout

%test.quarkus.oidc.client-id=dummy
%test.quarkus.oidc.application-type=service
%test.jhipster.oidc.logout-url=some-dummy-logoutUrl
</code>   

<p>The above values are for Keycloak. You need to update the following properties to integrate your application with Okta.</p>

 
   <code>quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url</code>: The Okta’s API root URL derived from the OIDC application domain. 
   <code>quarkus.oidc.client-id</code>: The OIDC application’s client ID. 
   <code>quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret</code>: The OIDC application’s client secret. 
   <code>jhipster.oidc.logout-url</code>: In JHipster, the browser will initiate the logout. The backend needs to expose this information (for now, it can’t be retrieved using OIDC discovery). 
 

<p>After you update this file, your properties should look similar to the following:</p>

   <code># OAuth 2.0 and OIDC
quarkus.oidc.enabled=true
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default
quarkus.oidc.client-id=0oaajhdr9q9jxbBM95d6
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=NEVERSHOWSECRETS
quarkus.oidc.application-type=hybrid
quarkus.oidc.authentication.scopes=profile,address,email,address,phone
quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path=/
quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path=/login/oauth2/code/oidc
quarkus.oidc.authentication.restore-path-after-redirect=false

jhipster.oidc.logout-url=https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/logout
</code>   

<p>Restart your application go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. Click on sign in, and you’ll be redirected to an Okta login page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter the <code>admin</code> username and the password you set. Okta detects it’s the first time you’ve logged in and asks you to update the password. Once done, you’ll be redirected to your Quarkus application.</p>

<p></p>

 Go Native with Quarkus and GraalVM 

<p>The final step of this tutorial is to package your Java application as a native executable. Once again, JHipster has your back, and everything is done for you.</p>

<p>Simply run Maven’s <code>package</code> command with the <code>native</code> profile:</p>

   <code>./mvnw package -Pnative -DskipTests
</code>   

<p>You know, we know, everybody knows, we skipped the tests so this demo works flawlessly. Please do NOT skip the tests in a production context. 😅</p>

<p>If you’re not using a JDK with GraalVM included, you’ll get an error:</p>

   <code>[error]: Build step io.quarkus.deployment.pkg.steps.NativeImageBuildStep#build threw an
 exception: java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot find the `native-image` in the 
 GRAALVM_HOME, JAVA_HOME and System PATH. Install it using `gu install native-image`
</code>   

<p>The easiest way to solve this is to use <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> to install Java 11 with GraalVM.</p>

   <code>sdk install java 21.0.0.2.r11-grl
</code>   

<p>Then, run <code>gu install native-image</code>:</p>

   <code>$ gu install native-image
Downloading: Component catalog from www.graalvm.org
Processing Component: Native Image
Downloading: Component native-image: Native Image  from github.com
Installing new component: Native Image (org.graalvm.native-image, version 21.0.0.2)
</code>   

<p>Once this process completes, rerun the Maven package command.</p>

   <code>./mvnw package -Pnative -DskipTests
</code>   

<p>The native compilation takes a long time. You might want to go for a walk, get a cup of coffee, or do some pushups.</p>

<p>If you’d rather stay at your computer, here are some other activities you might try:</p>

 
   Check out the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-quarkus">JHipster Quarkus Blueprint project</a> 
   Explore the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta developer site</a> 
   Go through <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/">the excellent Quarkus guides</a> 
 

<p>After roughly three minutes, the native executable should be ready:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Start it as a native executable using <code>target/*runner</code>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>💥 Boom! Your good old-fashioned Java application starts in 1 second! 🚀</p>

<p>Remember, I talked about memory gains? Below is a command to get the memory consumption in megabytes.</p>

   <code>$ ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color jhipster | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'
30951 46M ./target/jhipster-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
31433 0M grep --color=auto --exclude-dir=.bzr --exclude-dir=CVS --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.hg --exclude-dir=.svn --color jhipster
</code>   

<p>Your application is consuming &lt; 50MB of memory. 💃🏻</p>

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and make sure everything works. Then, enjoy your success!</p>

 Go Further with JHipster Quarkus

<p>by Shannon Appelcline.</p><p>In the last few years, headlines have blared that Bitcoin has grotesque energy costs. The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (Footnote 1) currently estimates 78 TWh a year. More importantly, in these years of climate change, which is a real, global crisis, they note a carbon footprint of 37 Mt CO2. The sensationalist headlines usually note that this is the same as New&nbsp;Zealand.</p><p>Though these numbers may be technically correct, that’s the worst type of correct, because the headlines are pure clickbait. They create outrage without offering context and in doing so create a false impression. Here’s some of what they’re&nbsp;missing.</p><p>For a FAQ that more specifically focuses on Bitmark’s limited energy consumption, see our “<a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/bitmark-blockchain-energy-usage-q-a-aeda13537228">Bitmark Energy&nbsp;Q&amp;A</a>”.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Consumption is Nothing Compared to the Traditional Financial Industry</p><p>The US alone has 9 million people working in the financial industry(2). Compare that to the 8,000 people who work in One World Trade Center, or the 15,000 people who work in the Empire State Building, and the staggering scope of that work force becomes obvious: it’s 750 huge skyscrapers worth of energy usage. Add in every stock exchange, every computer, every router, and every credit card machine not already included in those counts. Add in some fraction of the 200,000–300,000 armored vehicles worldwide that carry cash from one location to another (whose carbon emissions are likely worse than SUVs, which created more than 700 Mt CO2 in 2018(3)). Move on to the processes that create physical financial resources: gold mining creates&nbsp;.8T of CO2 for every 1 ounce of gold mined(4). Multiply that by the 2,500 tons of gold mined each year(5), and you get another 6.4 Mt CO2. (Mind you, that doesn’t even count the millions of tons of toxic waste such as cyanide and mercury released into the environment by gold and other metal mining(6).)</p><p>Obviously, none of these comparisons are apples to apples. Not all financial offices are in skyscrapers, not all of those offices use the same amounts of energy, not all cities have the same proportion of green energy production, not all armored vehicles are used in the financial industry, not as many armored vehicles fill our roads as SUVs, and not all gold is used financially. However, the difficulty in creating a precise comparison demonstrates why those poorly considered headlines about Bitcoin are possible: Bitcoin is transparent, so it’s easy to see the costs, while the traditional financial industry is full of secret subsidies.</p><p>Still, we can see enough in these partial views to heavily imply that Bitcoin’s consumption is a bare fraction of that of the traditional financial industry. With that in mind, clickbait headlines start to look a lot like the traditional financial industry punching down at a scrappy newcomer.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Consumption is Comparative to Video Gaming and Video Streaming</p><p>Another way to look at Bitcoin’s usage is to compare it to other computer energy uses. Lawrence Berkeley National Labs estimated that video gaming in California alone used 4.1 TWh of electricity each year(7). Crypt0Events extrapolated that to estimate that video gaming energy usage was 33.5 TWh yearly in the US and 104.7 TWh worldwide: 50% higher than Bitcoin(8).</p>Bitcoin vs Video Games, Energy and Carbon Emission Comparisons<p>Streaming video is another technology that has received a lot of clickbait headlines regarding its energy usage. Some estimates have put its energy usage in the hundreds of TWh, but pushback on that has revealed deep flaws in the methodologies of studies trying to estimate this usage(10). We should be similarly leery.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Consumption is Relatively Clean</p><p>A simple count of Bitcoin’s energy usage, besides not offering meaningful comparatives, also ignores the fact that Bitcoin’s energy usage is relatively clean. The majority of Bitcoin’s energy comes from renewable hydroelectricity in China that was not otherwise being used. Ya’an in China recently demonstrated this by sending out a call for blockchain users because they had 16.3 TWh of energy that was going to waste every year(11). Their overall production is 41.5 TWh of renewable energy production in a year, which is half of Bitcoin’s consumption, just from one city. Based on areas where Bitcoin mining occurs, a 2019 report put overall renewable usage conservatively at 74.1%(12).</p><p>Not All Blockchains are&nbsp;Equal</p><p>If the general arguments about Bitcoin’s energy usage are deeply flawed for all the things they don’t say, this is even more true for arguments against other uses of blockchains, which tend to be much smaller scale. For example, Bitmark’s crypto-rights blockchain calculations are considerably easier than Bitcoin’s(13): Bitcoin currently has a difficulty of more than 21T while Bitmark has been running less than 1G: about 20,000x less. This difference comes about because of the lower total hashing power of the Bitmark network: because there are less computers, or less powerful computers, less work is needed to secure the blockchain. The amount of energy required is correspondingly lower.</p><p>Blockchain is a Tool of the&nbsp;Future</p><p>Here’s the thing: we believe that the current arguments against the energy consumption of blockchains are badly framed clickbait headlines that don’t correctly consider how the energy is generated, how it’s used, and how that compares to other usages. Maybe our references have convinced you of that, maybe&nbsp;not.</p><p>But even if those clickbait headlines were accurate, even if the usage was as horrible as they suggest, even if all blockchains used the same energy as Bitcoin, they’d still be a great&nbsp;deal.</p><p>Blockchains are a technological revolution. They give us the ability to collaborate, and permanently record that collaboration, at a global scale. They allow us to remake our world’s infrastructure to better complement the borderless internet, and to do it in a way that doesn’t give corporations all the power. They ensure that changes in political power can’t change our recorded history. They allow us to have rules without&nbsp;rulers.</p><p>At Bitmark, we use blockchains to create crypto-rights, allowing you to manage finances, health data, creative licenses, and more without requiring you to depend upon a corporation, a registrar, or even a government. Bitcoin similarly allows individuals to manage their own payments and receipts without credit card companies or online payment services getting in the way (and potentially controlling what can be bought or&nbsp;funded).</p><p>Blockchains are the future of independence on the internet, of allowing us all to work together to make a better society. We’re just seeing the leading edge of that with Bitcoin. There is so much more to come, with Bitmark’s Crypto-Rights systems being just a few ideas among&nbsp;many.</p><p>Because we’re on the cutting edge, this work is still growing. Yes, there may be inefficiencies in blockchains currently. Yes, the energy costs may be too high: in a global crisis we can’t solely say that we’re no worse than anyone else. We want to be part of the solution too. But the first cell phones were bricks, the first personal computers had 4 kB of RAM, and the first commercial solar panels were 2% efficient. Obviously, there will be improvements in blockchains too, if we support this technology and incentivize its&nbsp;growth.</p><p>We reject the clickbait framing of current arguments against the energy consumption of blockchains. We all need to, because we can’t allow this revolutionary technology to be set back by someone trying to sell ads on their&nbsp;website.</p><p>Blockchain is an essential part of the future. We need to focus on that big picture, so that we can support independence of action and the creation of new rights, so that we can match those rights with the boundary-less nature of the digital internet, so that we can collaboratively work together in new ways — so that we can remake the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Footnotes:</p>  Digiconomist.

 Zero Trust is a buzzword with which cybersecurity folks are quite familiar. I understand, you’re surprised. Zero Trust has nothing to do with the Amazon packages your spouse hides from you.

<p>Zero Trust is a buzzword with which cybersecurity folks are quite familiar. I understand, you’re surprised. Zero Trust has nothing to do with the Amazon packages your spouse hides from you. Rather, in 2009, John Kindervag (Forrester Research) introduced the concept of a “zero trust model,” in response to rising security challenges. Zero Trust can be summarized in four words: never trust, always verify. The main assumption Kindervag made is that traffic within an enterprise’s network cannot be more trustworthy by default than traffic coming from the outside. He was spot on, it turns out. After all, 60 percent of data breaches actually come from insiders.</p>

 February Edition <p>Welcome to our monthly roundup —February edition, as always I’m bringing you the scoop of the month. If you have been reading the regular updates we share in Telegram or Twitter, you probably already know that we’ve now got a working Elemental Chat application and that we are hard at work preparing the Holochain and Holo infrastructure so that we can release it to all hosts. We are almost&nbsp;there!</p><p>If you’re wondering what exactly we’ve been working on at Holo and Holochain this past month — the wait is over! Let’s jump right&nbsp;in.</p> Elemental Chat is&nbsp;live! <p>The first Dev Pulse of the new year is going to be a short one. That’s not because nothing’s happening — in fact, it’s partly because there’s a lot going on, and I need to get back to it. Holochain RSM is growing up, and it’s time for both veteran and new devs to start developing on it. (That means that new developer documentation is coming&nbsp;soon!)</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 90— <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/elemental-chat-is-live/">Elemental Chat is&nbsp;live!</a></p> HDK is stable (for&nbsp;now) <p>The big news is that the core team’s work on the HDK, Holochain’s standard library for building DNAs, has slowed down and shouldn’t see any big changes for a while. Work is now shifting back to core features, such as sharding the&nbsp;DHT.</p><p>In the meantime, the Holo team is getting Elemental Chat ready for Holo hosting. They’ve also enabled the Host Console on all HoloPorts (read on to find out&nbsp;why).</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 91— <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-91-hdk-stable-for-now/">HDK is stable (for&nbsp;now)</a></p> Moving HoloFuel up on the&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Yes, you read that right! We are actually ahead of where we expected to be in some ways. While it is taking a while to complete infrastructure testing because that is one of the most complex aspects of our work, we have been able to move many other activities forward. Because of that we decided to shift the HoloFuel application up in the roadmap. Here is what it looks like with the new changes. <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">Check it out on our website where you will find more&nbsp;details</a>.</p> More Dev Documents are&nbsp;out   To install the new RSM go&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/">here</a>.

<p>As more of our critical work and personal functions go online, the risk of data and security breaches continues to increase. In 2019, there were <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/">over 1400 data breaches reported</a> that exposed nearly 165 million records, many of which included passwords and personal information.</p>

<p>While security specialists bear much of the responsibility in ensuring their organizations are handling sensitive data properly, web developers at all levels must take part as well. By understanding fundamental concepts like hashing and password management, developers can help minimize security risks to their users and businesses.</p>

<p>Hashing is an important but often misunderstood concept in computer programming. In this comprehensive guide, I’ll share everything you need to know about password hashing, generating hashes and salts, storing hashed passwords, and implementing password hashing in Python. Finally, I’ll show you how you can use hashes to validate users locally or with a third-party authentication tool <a href="https://www.okta.com/">like Okta</a>.</p>

 What is a Hash? 
<p>If you’ve taken a computer science course on data types, you’ve probably heard of hash tables and hash functions. A hash table (or hash map) is a data storage pattern that maps a calculated hash index to each given key. This allows you to lookup values in a table if you know their key. Python’s dictionary data type <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2000-March/048085.html">is implemented as a hash table</a>, so you are probably already using hash tables without knowing it.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">Hash functions</a> are how keys in hash tables are calculated. When hashing a piece of data, the hash function should be able to take an arbitrary length of data and map it to a fixed-length index that is unique to the value. In the context of hash table data storage, a programmer can access stored values by knowing the keys and calling the hash function.</p>

<p>In practice, hash functions are useful for a wide variety of tasks, including compression, data storage, checksums, and password storage. In the rest of this guide, I’ll focus on cryptographic hashes and their role in passwords.</p>

 Password Hashes 
<p>If you have users logging into your site, you likely ask them to create an account with a password. As a developer, you need a way to verify a user by their password later, but storing the password in plaintext <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lin.3021/file/ISPEC15.pdf">opens you up to massive problems if your database is ever compromised</a>. Attackers could use the passwords to access all the other data you store for your users or gain access to other accounts the user owns, especially <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/05/08/reuse-passwords-enterprise/">if they reuse their passwords</a>.</p>

<p>This is where cryptographic hash functions come in. If you run a plaintext password through one of these functions, it will convert the string into a unique, irreversible, fixed-size bit array. This hashed password can then be stored in your database, and even if attackers gain access to your database, they shouldn’t be able to quickly figure out your users’ passwords.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no hashing strategy is perfect. Given enough time and access, attackers can still deduce hashed passwords using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow tables</a> or <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/brute-force-attack">brute force attacks</a>. This is why it’s important to use the most up-to-date hashing algorithms and salt your passwords before you hash them. In the next section, I’ll cover salting, and later in this guide, you’ll learn about the various hashing algorithms available and when each might be appropriate.</p>

 Salting Hashes 
<p>If an attacker gets access to your hashed passwords and figures out which algorithm you used, they can look up the hashes in a rainbow table. If you don’t believe me, just google for a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=2c6c8ab6ba8b9c98a1939450eb4089ed">hash like this</a> and see how many results come up that reveal the password to be <code>abc123</code>. While modern hashing algorithms increase the time it takes to generate and lookup data in these tables, once attackers have your database, they can apply as much computing power as they can afford to the job.</p>

<p>Salts are long, randomly generated byte arrays added to each password before they’re hashed and stored. Salting passwords correctly makes <a href="https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/blog/thwart-rainbow-table-attack/">rainbow tables virtually useless</a> because each password will have a unique salt that the attacker does not have access to.</p>

<p>While any long, random byte array added to your passwords before hashing improves security, there are a few ways to increase the effectiveness of your salts. For example, you can add a unique salt to the front and back of each password, you can increase the length of your salt, or you can add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)">a separately stored “pepper”’</a> to each password.</p>

<p>Typically, salts are stored in your database alongside each user’s password. The problem with this approach is that attackers who get your database probably also get your salts. This means they can re-compute rainbow tables using the stolen salts. Even if it takes longer, an attacker might be motivated enough to do it anyway.</p>

<p>In response to this problem, you can create another long, random byte array called a “pepper” and store it in a separate location on your server (outside your database). Then, you can add this pepper to each password in addition to the salts.</p>

<p>Another way to spread out the information attackers would need to figure out your users’ passwords is to apply multiple hashing algorithms to the password. For example, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/webdev/2012/06/08/lets-talk-about-password-storage/">in 2012, Firefox wrote about its two-step hashing process</a> which uses HMAC and bcrypt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The local salt is a random value that is stored only on the server, never in the database…If an attacker steals one of our password databases, they would need to also separately attack one of our web servers to get file access in order to discover this local salt value…As a second step, this hashed value (or strengthened password, as some call it) is then hashed again with a slow hashing function called bcrypt.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Security almost always involves a risk and cost tradeoff. The important takeaway from salting is that spreading out the information attackers would need to deduce your passwords improves security but increases maintenance costs. For example, if your pepper is ever compromised, you’ll need to eventually re-hash all the passwords or ask users to change their passwords immediately.</p>

 Hashing in Python 
<p>Now that you understand what hashing is and how it is used in conjunction with salting to store passwords securely, you are ready to get specific. In this section, I’ll show you how to apply common hash functions in Python and some of the important considerations you should make when choosing a hash function.</p>

 DIY Hashing Algorithms vs. Libraries 
<p>While you might think it would be interesting to implement your own hash functions from scratch, this is not a good idea in practice. The <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a> summarizes the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Writing custom cryptographic code such as a hashing algorithm is really hard and should never be done outside of an academic exercise. Any potential benefit that you might have from using an unknown or bespoke algorithm will be vastly overshadowed by the weaknesses that exist in it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Creating a modern, secure hash function requires quite a lot of esoteric code, and any small error could carry a critical security risk. If you’re curious, though, you can read the Python implementations of <a href="https://blog.jpolak.org/?p=1985">MD5 here</a> and <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/37648/python-implementation-of-sha1">SHA1 here</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Python has a robust choice of libraries available that implement cryptographically secure hash functions. In the examples below, you’ll see how two of them <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/">bcrypt</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html">hashlib</a> work. Both are open-source and widely recommended by security professionals and software developers alike. While bcrypt is a community-maintained module, hashlib is actually part of Python’s standard library.</p>

<p>I’ll share interactive examples of five of the most common password hashing algorithms in Python in the following sections. All of the Python code below is running in your browser. Feel free to edit and change the code you see! As you go through the code, you’ll see some of the pros and cons to each approach and why some of these algorithms are no longer recommended for password hashing in 2021.</p>

 MD5 
<p>Created as a general purpose cryptographic hash function, the MD5 algorithm has since been found vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance">collisions</a>, making it much easier for attackers to exploit. Because of this, MD5 is no longer recommended for password hashing.</p>

<p>That said, plenty of legacy systems still use the algorithm, so developers are likely to come across it. When you do, you’ll have to decide <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/118114/should-passwords-be-automatically-reset-when-the-underlying-method-changes">how you want to upgrade your hashing algorithm</a>, but because MD5 is still so common, I’ll show you a couple of examples here.</p>

 Hash Only 
<p>First, if you simply want to hash a password using MD5, you need to convert the password string to bytes (here I’m using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects"><code>bytes</code> function for Python 3+</a>) and then pass it into the <code>md5</code> function in the <code>hashlib</code> module:</p>

import hashlib
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

hashed = hashlib.md5(bytes(password, "utf-8"))

result = {
    "algorithm": "MD5",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>Because MD5 creates a fixed-length 128-bit value, you have to convert it to a human-readable format if you want to <code>print</code> it. This example uses Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html"><code>json</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html"><code>base64</code></a> libraries to print out the hash in the format that Okta uses for loading user hashes into Okta, so you should see output that looks like this::</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "MD5",
    "value": "KqqDNf0DDgVKmOOyxYUrNA=="
}
</code>   

 With Salt 
<p>While you’ve seen that adding a salt to your passwords before hashing them theoretically increases security, it <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/61516">doesn’t make MD5 any more secure in practice</a>. Your salted passwords are still vulnerable to collisions, and because MD5 hashes can be generated so quickly, rainbow tables can still be used to decipher hashed passwords.</p>

<p>That said, you may see a salted MD5 hash like this in legacy code:</p>

import hashlib
import secrets
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)
salted_password = bytes(password, "utf-8") + salt
hashed = hashlib.md5(salted_password)
result = {
    "algorithm": "MD5",
    "salt": base64.b64encode(salt).decode("ascii"),
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>This example uses the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html">secrets module</a> to generate  16 random bytes that are appended to the end of the password before it is hashed.</p>

<p>The output of this salted and hashed password will be a new 128-bit value that, when base64 encoded, will look something like the result below:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "MD5",
    "salt": "R0lGODlhAQABAAAAADs=",
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": "pqTUVToGARL1yM3/jthCHA=="
}
</code>   

<p>You’ll notice that the output from the sample code doesn’t match the example above. In fact, every time you make a change to the code, you’ll see that the output changes. This is good and exactly as expected. To get the benefits of salting your passwords, you must use a unique salt for each password!</p>

<p>That said, if you want to see how the output was generated above, you can change the salt to the same value that was used to compute the example by changing line 8 in the example above to look like this:</p>

   <code>salt = b"\x47\x49\x46\x38\x39\x61\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00;"
</code>   

 SHA-1 
<p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a> creates a slightly longer hashed output (160-bit) than MD5, it is no longer considered cryptographically secure either. It’s vulnerable to collisions, and in 2020, researchers estimated that anyone with $45,000 worth of cloud computing power <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf">could successfully break SHA-1 signatures used for validating TLS certificates</a>.</p>

<p>Like MD5, there’s still plenty of legacy systems using SHA-1 hashing algorithms, though, so you may see it in older Python code.</p>

 Hash Only 
<p>While the output is slightly longer (a 40-character hexadecimal string) than MD5, using SHA-1 involves roughly the same process:</p>

import hashlib
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

hashed = hashlib.sha1(bytes(password, 'utf-8'))
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-1",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>When hashed with SHA-1 and encoded with base64, the password <code>test password</code> will look like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-1",
    "value": "LOsCqF9tTebCiy5Z/aiG1Sba+w0="
}
</code>   

 With Salt 
<p>Not much changes when you add a salt to your password before applying SHA-1 hashing. It’s still not significantly more secure, and the process is equivalent to doing the same in MD5:</p>

import hashlib
import secrets
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)
salted_password = bytes(password, "utf-8") + salt
hashed = hashlib.sha1(salted_password)
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-1",
    "salt": base64.b64encode(salt).decode("ascii"),
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-1",
    "salt": "R0lGODlhAQABAAAAADs=",
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": "1cijegMYbE7L/WkUxkHjQ+/p1M0="
}
</code>   

<p>As with the salted MD5 example above, the salt must be unique to each password you hash. However, if you want to get the exact same output as our example output, you can change line 8 in the example code to look like this:</p>

   <code>salt = b"\x47\x49\x46\x38\x39\x61\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00;"
</code>   

 SHA-256 
<p>As vulnerabilities in SHA-1 and MD5 became apparent in the late 1990s, researchers went to work on the next generation of cryptographic hashing functions. This effort resulted in the NSA’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">publication of the SHA-2 algorithms in 2001</a>. SHA-256 is one of these functions and is in widespread use today.</p>

<p>Since SHA-1 was proven insecure for SSL certificate validation, SHA-256 <a href="https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/difference-sha-1-sha-2-sha-256-hash-algorithms/">has been adopted</a>. SHA-256 also <a href="https://medium.com/@makhmud.islamov/use-cases-for-hash-functions-or-what-is-sha-256-83036de048b4">plays a role in blockchain technology and Bitcoin specifically</a> as a way to hash data and create Bitcoin addresses.</p>

<p>While SHA-256 has valid use cases, it is <a href="https://dusted.codes/sha-256-is-not-a-secure-password-hashing-algorithm">not really meant to be used in hashing passwords</a>. While collisions have not been proven, and unique salts can make rainbow tables ineffective, high-end hardware can still generate billions of SHA-256 hashes every minute. This allows attackers with access to your hashed passwords to use brute force to look for matches and decipher your users’ passwords.</p>

 Hash Only 
<p>Despite this inherent weakness, you are still likely to see SHA-256 used for hashing passwords. The implementation is basically the same as SHA-1 using hashlib, but the output will be a base64 encoded 256-bit object:</p>

import hashlib
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

hashed = hashlib.sha256(bytes(password, 'utf-8'))
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii")
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look like this:</p>
   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "value": "C0fGmxAzSY1fM/X32Xu2oxJhNHUWKfTQGFwRXbRMCU4="
}
</code>   

 With Salt 
<p>If you are forced to use SHA-256 for some reason, adding salt is essential. This requires attackers to have another piece of data and increases the amount of time required for brute force attacks:</p>

import hashlib
import secrets
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)
salted_password = bytes(password, "utf-8") + salt
hashed = hashlib.sha256(salted_password)
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "salt": base64.b64encode(salt).decode("ascii"),
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "salt": "R0lGODlhAQABAAAAADs=",
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": "6ONMDzdYZltRuM8j0EaG0eUgY0ooPj/m09MqlnGJ3AQ="
}
</code>   

<p>As with the examples above, the salt must be unique to each password you hash. However, if you want to get the exact same output as our example output, you can change the line in the example code where the <code>salt</code> is defined to look like this:</p>

   <code>salt = b"\x47\x49\x46\x38\x39\x61\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00;"
</code>   

 With Salt and Pepper 
<p>I mentioned “pepper” above, which adds another layer of entropy and length to your password before hashing. Typically, pepper is stored on your server, independent of your database. Something like an environment variable is common:</p>

import hashlib
import secrets
import base64
import os
import json

DEFAULT_PEPPER = "Qk0eAAAAAAAAABoAAAAMAAAAAQABAAEAGAAAAP8A"
password = "test password"

salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)
pepper = base64.b64decode(os.getenv('PEPPER', DEFAULT_PEPPER))
salted_and_peppered_password = bytes(password, "utf-8") + salt + pepper
hashed = hashlib.sha256(salted_and_peppered_password)
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "salt": base64.b64encode(salt + pepper).decode("ascii"),
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii")
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>Example output:</p>
   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "salt": "R0lGODlhAQABAAAAADtCTR4AAAAAAAAAGgAAAAwAAAABAAEAAQAYAAAA/wA=",
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": "gWVt3W2f5I83NLwYtyf3Ac0uomcY+bymCd6IEaJoS+8="
}
</code>   

<p>Salt and pepper can be added to the beginning or end of the original password. There’s no substantive difference from a security standpoint, so pick one and obviously, be consistent.</p>

 SHA-512 
<p>SHA-512 uses the same method as SHA-256 to hash strings into fixed 512-bit objects (128 hexadecimal characters). A longer output size means an even higher resistance to collision and length extension attacks, so while both SHA-256 and SHA-512 are still not known to have any inherent security vulnerabilities when used properly, SHA-512 should, in theory, remain harder to break for longer than SHA-256.</p>

<p>Still, like SHA-256, SHA-512 is primarily meant to be used to establish file authenticity and not for password hashing. It can be done, though, so let’s take a look at the algorithm in Python.</p>

 Hash Only 
<p>Again, you can use hashlib to hash a string or password with SHA-512:</p>

import hashlib
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

hashed = hashlib.sha512(bytes(password, 'utf-8'))

result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-512",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-512",
    "value": "Z73OpRFbwfE/zOD3C+OGmlv0j+p77N2+zBeKUgjcFzYuaji1NHGHkP7biq6h11Knn5wJqHAzLLhG+4DTEJMdBQ=="
}
</code>   

<p>One thing to think about as you use more secure hashing algorithms like SHA-512 is the length of the hashed password. While database storage is cheap (and only getting cheaper), if you put a 64 or 100-character limit on your password field for some reason, using SHA-512 will be a problem. <a href="https://www.diwebsity.com/2019/08/10/password-security-standards/">Never truncate a password</a> before or after hashing in an attempt to fit it into your database. Make your database fields appropriate for the length of text you need to store.</p>

 With Salt 
<p>Like SHA-256, if you’re using SHA-512, you should definitely add a salt to reduce the risk of rainbow table attacks. Fortunately, the process is exactly the same as it is in the cases above:</p>

import hashlib
import secrets
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)
salted_password = bytes(password, "utf-8") + salt
hashed = hashlib.sha512(salted_password)
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-512",
    "salt": base64.b64encode(salt).decode("ascii"),
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look something like this:</p>
   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-512",
    "salt": "R0lGODlhAQABAAAAADs=",
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": "hbLCeyPt0GQtKno0yPjby7NJqjilLH5M/pTlOxN8aNn4GiH12+wYLvCUg1HTaypcd8lLuiCNsKmwtTvKNxo0yw=="
}
</code>   

 Bcrypt 
<p>The MD5 and SHA families of hash algorithms <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/46552">are meant to be fast</a>, so they’re primarily used to verify file signatures and certificates where delays would mean a poor user experience. While they’ve been used as password hashing methods in the past, this is no longer considered best practice because algorithms that can generate hashes quickly are inherently more vulnerable to hackers who calculate billions of hashes to perform brute force attacks.</p>

<p>Algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a> were purpose-built to slow down this kind of attack. Bcrypt embeds a salt into each hash and implements a “cost factor” that lets developers increase the security of their hashes (by trading off a longer hash generation time). Adding a half-second delay every time to a user’s login time probably won’t bother your users much, but a half-second delay will slow hackers down dramatically when they’re trying to generate billions of hashes.</p>

 Hash with Salt 
<p>Unlike the previous algorithms discussed, bcrypt requires a 128-bit salt (which is Radix-64 encoded as 22 characters) to hash a password, so there’s no option to hash without one. Fortunately, most bcrypt packages include helpers that will generate the salt for you.</p>

<p>Python doesn’t include a bcrypt implementation in its standard library, so you’ll need to import one. Here I’m using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/">bcrypt</a> which I installed with <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a>:</p>

import bcrypt
import json

WORK_FACTOR = 2
DIGEST = 3
SPLIT_POSITION = 22

password = "test password"

salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
mcf_bytes = bcrypt.hashpw(bytes(password, 'utf-8'), salt)
mcf = mcf_bytes.decode("utf-8").split("$")
result = {
    "algorithm": "BCRYPT",
    "workFactor": int(mcf[WORK_FACTOR]),
    "salt": mcf[DIGEST][:SPLIT_POSITION],
    "value": mcf[DIGEST][SPLIT_POSITION:],
    # "original": mcf_bytes.decode("utf-8"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "BCRYPT",
    "workFactor": 12,
    "salt": "JRTqctXrmURv1zqEjMX8Uu",
    "value": "6FU1hdF4DOr3vbwyEvx8JW9eSKUvvSO",
}
</code>   

<p>Note that <code>bcrypt</code> encourages the best practice of creating a salt for each password by giving you the <code>bcrypt.gensalt()</code> function. However, like with our other examples, if you want to see how I got the example output above, you can have bcrypt use the same salt as you see in the example.</p>

<p>As you can see, the resulting hash from bcrypt is a little different from the strings generated by previous algorithms. Bcrypt uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description">a very specific structure</a> for its hashes, which allows you to increase the work factor and define the hash algorithm in the hash itself. This can be useful if later versions of the bcrypt algorithm implement bug fixes or improvements.</p>

 Choosing a Password Hashing Algorithm 
<p>While bcrypt is a secure and appropriate option for hashing your passwords, there will always be <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/28/lets-talk-password-hashing/">varying opinions</a> on the “best” way to implement password security on the internet. Other viable options include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">Argon2</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, your password hashing algorithm should:</p>

 
   Consistently produce the same hash for the same input string 
   Be unique to each possible password given 
   Work quickly enough for end-users 
   Slow down attackers who gain access to your hashed passwords 
 

<p>There may be no such thing as a “perfect” password hashing algorithm for all time, though. As computing power increases and becomes cheaper, researchers will have to continue building stronger hashing algorithms.</p>

 Using Hashed Passwords 
<p>Now that you understand how to hash a password properly in Python, it’s time to talk about how you’ll actually use these hashed passwords. In practice, there are three typical workflows you might face when dealing with hashed passwords.</p>

 Storing Hashed Passwords 
<p>When a user signs up for your service, they will typically enter a username and password in plaintext. When they click “submit,” the username and password are sent to your server (hopefully, over an encrypted SSL connection) where you should:</p>

 
   Validate that the password meets your <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/Creating-a-Password-Policy?language=en_US">password requirements</a> 
   Hash the password using your chosen algorithm 
   Save the hashed password, salt (if needed), and username to your database 
   Return a success message to the user 
   Either log the user in immediately or ask to log in using their new password 
 

<p></p>

<p>If you’re using a SQL database, you should store the hashed password as a <code>BINARY(X)</code>, where <code>X</code> is the length of the binary generated by your hashing algorithm (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5882472/977192">60 in bcrypt’s case</a>). Storing the password in binary could be important as <code>CHAR</code> fields in some character encodings do not distinguish between capital and lower-case letters.</p>

<p>It’s also important to note that if you use bcrypt, you don’t need to store your salts <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6833165/977192">as it builds them into the hash</a>.</p>

 Validating Hashed Passwords 
<p>Once you’ve stored a user’s hashed password, you are ready to validate it next time they log in. Typically, the password validation flow looks like this:</p>

 
   User enters username and password on the login page 
   The username and plaintext password is sent to your server over an encrypted SSL connection 
   You retrieve a user (with their password and salt) from your database by their unique username 
   You hash the plaintext password using the same salt 
   You compare the hashed password stored in your database with the one submitted on the login page 
   If they match exactly you can safely proceed with user authentication 
 

<p></p>

<p>Many hashing libraries take care of some of these steps for you. For example, bcyrpt includes <a href="https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt/#password-hashing">a <code>checkpw</code> function that compares a binary plaintext password to your stored hash</a>. When available, you should use these built-in functions because they’ll prevent you from making errors in your password validation logic.</p>

 Importing Users with Hashed Passwords into Okta 
<p>Finally, you may someday need to import user accounts with hashed passwords into a third-party service like <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta’s</a>. User authentication often starts relatively simply, but as you start to build more complex and secure features, you’ll realize that it takes a lot of work to maintain. Okta can handle password resets, forgotten passwords, enterprise SSO, JWTs, and much more for you, making it much easier to maintain a secure and scalable authentication process.</p>

<p>To import existing users with hashed passwords into Okta, you’ll need to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-imported-hashed-password">make a <code>POST</code> request to their <code>/users</code> endpoint</a>. The payload of your request should include the user’s email, profile information, and details about their password and the algorithm used:</p>

<p>Use this command to create a user in Okta named “Isaac Brock” that has a password with the value of “test password” - note that the value of the “hash” part of the payload exactly matches the example above!</p>

   <code>curl -v -X POST \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
-d '{
  "profile": {
    "firstName": "Isaac",
    "lastName": "Brock",
    "email": "isaac.brock@example.com",
    "login": "isaac.brock@example.com",
    "mobilePhone": "555-415-1337"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password" : {
      "hash": {
        "algorithm": "BCRYPT",
        "workFactor": 12,
        "salt": "HrtURKVYwHEOR/PMBBakyu",
        "value": "51qdkp4j1j0NoqwlXhHhCfiM1dqxUP2"
      }
    }
  }
}' "https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users?activate=false"
</code>   

<p>Okta’s API will return a user ID, which you can then store in your database. Now, instead of validating a user’s username and password yourself every time they log in, you can pass the request over to Okta or <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Settings/custom-okta-hosted-sign-in-page.htm">use an Okta-hosted sign-on screen</a>. Once Okta authenticates the user, you can use their user ID to look up profile data you maintain in your own database.</p>

<p>You can use this same pattern to create users with pre-existing hashed passwords. Just change the value of the “hash” portion of the payload to any password that was hashed using code as you saw in the examples above.</p>

 Learn More 
<p>While this guide takes you deep into password hashing in Python, there are still many password security topics that I haven’t covered. For example, how do you set strong password requirements? Should you validate that users aren’t reusing compromised passwords? What other password hashing algorithms are out there? Here are a few more resources you should check out:</p>

  <p>ForgeRock has a rich history of transforming the digital identity experiences for the most successful companies on the planet. The announcement of Okta’s intent to acquire Auth0 underscores the importance of this market. It’s more exciting than ever to be part of ForgeRock as we execute on our mission of helping organizations create digital identity experiences that are frictionless and intuitive while still protecting the security of the enterprise in a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a> environment.</p>

 We’re in a Better Position than Ever Before to Lead the Way 

<p>In light of the news, I was reflecting on what we hear consistently from customers. Based on research and experience, some things have become crystal clear. To support the future of work and digital transformation, ForgeRock is uniquely poised and ready to help customers meet their requirements as they embark on their modernization journey.</p>

 User Experience and Security – Without Compromise 

<p>Today’s end user won’t tolerate a poor experience, and businesses can’t risk security vulnerabilities. When you try to balance security and experience, you usually end up with an approach that’s mediocre at best. At ForgeRock, our purpose is to help users safely and simply access the connected world. We help organizations deepen their relationships with their customers and improve the productivity of their workforce – all while growing revenues and saving costs; increasing security and compliance; and reducing fraud and risk. Using our unique <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access Trees</a>, our customers can avoid compromise and deliver exceptional and secure experiences.</p>

 A Purpose-built, Enterprise-grade IAM Platform&nbsp; 

<p>This means support for any kind of identity: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">consumers</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">services, or things</a>. It means support for key functionality: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity management</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access managemen</a>t, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a>. It means providing powerful extensibility, configurability, scalability, and performance. It means protecting applications and application programming interfaces (APIs). And it means integration support for any kind of app, whether modern microservices-based, mobile, web, or legacy. This is what you get with ForgeRock.</p>

 Cloud-based Solutions that Support Hybrid IT 

<p>According to a soon-to-be released survey of more than 300 IAM decision makers at large organizations, 98% of respondents who have adopted cloud-based IAM solutions have experienced challenges mapping and integrating them into their existing processes and legacy systems. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-your-business-transformation-catalyst">Customers want a platform</a> that they can integrate into their current reality while modernizing their infrastructure. With our simplified pricing model, ForgeRock enables customers to consume our technology as a cloud service, deploy into self-managed environments – or both. Customers can deploy identity management where and how they need it to support their hybrid architectures.&nbsp;</p>

 Control Over Data&nbsp; 

<p>To meet global security and regulatory requirements, organizations require flexibility in how they consume identity services and where their data is stored. Customers want to be sure the performance of their environment is not affected by others. They need assurance that their data is not comingled, and they want to avoid nosy and noisy neighbor problems. ForgeRock’s <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">unique cloud architecture</a> does just that, while providing customers the time to value they have come to expect from a cloud-based service.</p>

 Acceleration of Digital Transformation by Putting an End to Identity Silos&nbsp; 

<p>As customers push to modernize, they are struggling with how to manage the numerous identity silos that crop up across their organizations. We call this <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/bring-digital-identity-out-shadows-fuel-digital-transformation">Shadow Identity</a>, and it leads to poor customer experiences and increased security risks. Our industry has spent decades tearing down silos of identity in order to unify identity in customers’ environments in order to provide better experiences and reduce security risks. Understandably, these companies are moving fast, but it is imperative that they take a strategic view of identity that will support their goals today and in the future. ForgeRock enables organizations to harmonize their identity while enabling business agility to move fast.</p>

<p>No matter what the business driver is – &nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/your-iam-future-in-the-cloud-checklist">cloud adoption</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a>, or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">modernization</a> – ForgeRock is uniquely equipped to deliver world-class business outcomes on a global scale without compromise. We believe the news this week solidifies our position as the only identity solution provider that can set the identity standard for enterprises: One platform, Any identity.</p>

   Differences, Benefits, and Disadvantages of Hybrid IT and Hybrid Cloud 

<p>Organizations are rapidly adopting hybrid IT and hybrid cloud architectures. In fact, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/document/3991263">Gartner</a> predicts that spending on public cloud services in 2021 will total more than $304 billion. And, as it pertains to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">identity and access management (IAM)</a>, <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/global-cloud-iam-market-size-and-forecast-to-2025/">Verified Market Research</a> projects that, by 2027, the market for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud-based IAM</a> will be more than $14 billion.</p>

<p>With these significant numbers in mind, let’s review the differences between hybrid IT and hybrid cloud as well as the benefits and disadvantages of each.&nbsp;</p>

 The Difference Between Hybrid IT and Hybrid Cloud 

<p>Here are simple definitions of hybrid IT and hybrid cloud.</p>

  Hybrid IT: A type of IT architecture that consists of infrastructure, applications, and services located on premises within an enterprise data center, as well as one or more private cloud(s) and public cloud(s). 
	 Hybrid Cloud: A type of IT architecture that consists of applications, services, and systems located in private cloud(s) and public cloud(s). 
 <p>Put another way, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/thomas_bittman/2012/09/24/mind-the-gap-here-comes-hybrid-cloud/">Gartner</a> defines hybrid cloud as “a cloud computing service composed of some combination of private, public, and community cloud services, from different service providers.”</p>

<p>Note that the main difference between hybrid IT and hybrid cloud is the on premises data center component. However, if an on-premises environment is running as a cloud service within an enterprise’s data center, then it would be considered private cloud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Importantly, a hybrid IT architecture is a superset of hybrid cloud. Meaning hybrid IT may contain a hybrid cloud environment(s) within it.&nbsp;</p>

 Benefits of Hybrid IT and Hybrid Cloud 

<p>With a hybrid IT architecture you get to choose which environment to use for specific applications. You can leverage the data residency, privacy, and control of on-premises architectures as well as the agility, flexibility, and scalability of cloud computing that best suits your organization.</p>

<p>With on-premises environments, you have complete control over data within the confines of your data center. You determine what data is private and on which physical servers it should reside. You can also parse data needed for certain applications and can even limit data to certain servers that have special cryptographic hardware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the flip side, for applications that do not need an extreme level of security and control, running them in a cloud environment is a better option. The flexibility and agility of the cloud allows you to create and use server instances dynamically as needed. This frees you from investing in large data centers, from spending money to keep excess capacity on hand for sudden growth, and from waiting for weeks and months for new hardware to start any new projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cost savings is another benefit of hybrid IT and hybrid cloud. You realize these cost savings as you reuse investments already made in your existing on-premises infrastructure, and only pay for the capacity you use with cloud.</p>

 Disadvantages of Hybrid IT and Hybrid Cloud 

<p>While the benefits above are significant enough to drive the majority of enterprise organizations to adopt hybrid IT and hybrid cloud, there are disadvantages. A major downside is that hybrid IT and hybrid cloud architectures typically consist of multiple separated environments and a combination of home-grown, legacy, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">modern IAM systems</a>. However, on-premises IAM systems don’t have the capabilities to meet cloud environment requirements, and cloud-based IAM systems don't have the capabilities required to secure on-premises environments.</p>

<p>Disjointed on-premises and cloud-based IAM results in siloed identities. This makes it difficult to identify and monitor high-risk user access enterprise-wide. Unknown risk awareness can lead to potential data breaches, fines and other financial consequences, as well as reputational damage. Additionally, multiple disjointed IAM systems can hinder the ability to provide seamless user experiences, innovate, and move at the speed of business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want your organization to be successful in today’s fast-paced, highly digital world, it’s critical to address these risks. How do you do that?</p>

<p>With hybrid IAM. Hybrid IAM is a single IAM platform capable of running, managing, and unifying digital identities across on-premises and cloud environments with hybrid IT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In our next IAM 101 Series blog post, we’ll cover the basics of hybrid IAM. Until then, learn more about how the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">ForgeRock Identity Platform can be used flexibly within any deployment model: on premises, any cloud, and as-a-service</a>.</p>

It intends to build on existing standards and looks to provide flexibility for multi-metal producers to include materials intended for the production of metal products other than of principal covered metals at their site(s) as&nbsp;needed.”</p><p>Producers and traders of these metals will be required to implement the five-step due diligence process defined in <a href="https://www.oecd.org/corporate/mne/mining.htm">the OECD Guidance,</a> and will have to follow principles of continual improvement, accountability, engagement, inclusivity, transparency, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This is a global standard that will impact companies extracting, producing, and trading the principal materials, and it officially comes into effect in&nbsp;2023.</p><p>While there will be challenges for those companies who need to comply with the new standard, we believe that this is a step in the right direction for the metals and minerals industry. At Peer Ledger, we support companies in responsible supply chain management and due diligence. Our <a href="https://peerledger.com/supply-chain">MIMOSI Connect</a> platform is a highly flexible blockchain traceability tool that enables companies to capture important metrics along their supply chain and comply with standards. We believe that supply chain transparency is not only good for the planet but good for business. We are excited to support more companies in their adoption of responsible supply chain management.</p> References   The Copper Mark, Multi-metal Coalition Publishes Joint Standard to Respond to LME Responsible Sourcing Rules.

<p>#ThrowbackThursday&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below is an article from 2018 highlighting the best ways for development teams to tackle GDPR compliance whilst&nbsp;minimising&nbsp;the impact on your existing processes and teams. A great summary of best practice and cultural improvements to keep yourselves protected and ethical when working with sensitive data.&nbsp;</p>



 Practical guidance for developers to shape their GDPR strategy&nbsp; 



<p>What final steps should system architects and developers take now to ensure they have all bases covered?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the huge volume of publicity there’s been around General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), there was a heightened sense of concern at a developer event I attended recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of&nbsp;the&nbsp;session,&nbsp;several people came forward, asking for clear guidance on what GDPR means at a practical level for developers and architects working with people’s personal data. Despite having made various preparations, they wanted to understand how other companies are addressing the common problems, recommended thought processes when evaluating work, and how to more fully address the risks and issues in their decision-making.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t help that this is chiefly a compliance exercise. So, while companies&nbsp;recognise&nbsp;they must put in place robust measures, they don’t really want to expend more energy or budget on this than they need to. So how can they cover themselves comprehensively, without taking too much of their resources and focus from the core functionality and differentiating qualities of their products?&nbsp;</p>



 Practising&nbsp;a duty of care&nbsp; 



<p>In my last conference&nbsp;presentation&nbsp;I threw my wallet into the audience, reeling off my expectations of the person who caught it – as its temporary custodian. Keep it within sight, don’t pass it on to anyone else, and so on. When people share personal data with us, they have similarly reasonable assumptions. That custodians of their personal assets treat them with respect and will not abuse the access privileges they’ve been given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In sharing something about themselves, individuals might hope to enjoy greater convenience and a more&nbsp;personalised&nbsp;service, for instance. If those benefits feel real, the trade is a fair one and everyone is happy. But if all they get in return is unsolicited third-party marketing or a general sense of unease that someone might hack into their personal details, people’s desire to disclose information about themselves diminishes. Empowered by the new provisions under GDPR, they may take steps to ensure their data is locked down or deleted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that becomes a hassle for everyone concerned – including the customer who receives a poorer service and the company that is forced to take a big step backwards in its customer intimacy and the sophistication of its marketing.&nbsp;</p>



 Covering the basics&nbsp; 



<p>When Uber had 57 million customer accounts stolen in a major breach of its security, it turned out to be because developers had stored customers’ passwords in GitHub, a central portal for managing version control for application source code. Although all developers know not to do this kind of thing (another common error being to use real data in testing), pressures to deliver features to deadlines can prompt development teams to cut corners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GDPR compliance at a practical level, then, isn’t about board-level box checking and a badge on the company website. It’s about understanding where and how systems and processes touch and use sensitive personal data, and then putting operational checks in to ensure that nothing is left to chance. And this must be tasked to people who know what they’re doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news is that there’s a lot of practical&nbsp;help out&nbsp;there if companies want to manage GDPR themselves – to ensure that suitable security and data protection is built&nbsp;into&nbsp;a development team’s pipeline of checks, before code goes live. Tools and tips include the ‘privacy by design’ protocol, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and SANS Institute vulnerability checklists.&nbsp;</p>



 Balancing innovation and housekeeping&nbsp; 



<p>The other alternative is to simplify your GDPR position by letting someone else be the keeper of people’s personal data, their permissions and how these are managed. Development communities already&nbsp;recognise&nbsp;the convenience of third-party logins for managing access to applications (‘log in using Facebook’, for example).&nbsp;So,&nbsp;one practical workaround to GDPR is to extend a similar approach to personal data management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given that no business came to dominate its market through its ‘world-beating compliance’ credentials (a condition of doing business, rather than a differentiator), it may well be better to hand the responsibility to an expert.&nbsp;Certainly,&nbsp;it would alleviate a whole heap of worry for developers who, in an agile-obsessed, fast-fail world, have enough on their plates delivering the latest service innovation.&nbsp;I’ll&nbsp;be picking up this theme at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bihlRzNIo5k">Devoxx in London, which takes place May 9-11</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MyLife&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;has a developer API&nbsp;programme. Let&nbsp;our&nbsp;platform handle key aspects of security and management of personal data and&nbsp;people’s&nbsp;rights so that you can focus development effort on customer features.

Okta’s solutions are designed for organizations that want to quickly enable cloud-delivered identity and seamlessly interoperate with other SaaS applications.</p>
<p>Auth0 had a different entry point into the realm of IAM. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80329/auth0-platform/" title="Auth0 was aimed at developers">Auth0 was aimed at developers,</a> both in functionality and their marketing approach. Auth0’s founders knew that this was an underserved market. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80111/consumer-identity-and-access-management-solution/" title="Consider a case where a company needs to expose one or two major applications to consumers">Consider a case where a company needs to expose one or two major applications to consumers.</a> They don’t think they need a full-blown Consumer IAM (CIAM) solution. They just want to wrap an identity layer around those applications and open them up for business. This is Auth0’s forte and what has driven their unicorn level success. Auth0 has been a pioneer in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lb80501" title="identity fabric architectures">identity fabric architectures</a> and a leading <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc79012/identity-api-platforms/" title="Identity API Platform">Identity API Platform</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Okta has both enterprises and SMBs as customers – those who want cloud-native, scalable, and interoperable solutions that are easy to deploy and maintain. Okta has integration, or out-of-the-box connectors, for many, many SaaS apps. For organizations moving to the cloud, they make it easy to take identity there as well.</p>
<p>Here are the strengths each has:</p>




<p>Okta</p>


<p>Auth0</p>




<p>Highly scalable, cloud-native identity services</p>


<p>Strong emphasis on cloud but with on-prem options</p>




<p>Lots of SaaS connectors in marketplace</p>


<p>Code snippets for easy custom application integration</p>




<p>Rapid onboarding of customers</p>


<p>Identity fabric architecture</p>




<p>Focused on security</p>


<p>API-first from the beginning</p>




<p></p>
<p>Okta and Auth0 have different origins and different approaches, but both have had great success in IAM. Though the stated price seems high, Okta will in time realize that their investment adds capabilities to their portfolio that will appeal to additional customer prospects, as well as add to their customer base.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/tolbert/ma-activity-in-cybersecurity-and-iam" title="Every major acquisition in IT brings the question of what happens to the purchased company and its technology">Every major acquisition in IT brings the question of what happens to the purchased company and its technology.</a> Auth0 will reportedly operate somewhat independently at first, while integration options are evaluated internally. In cases of large acquisitions in the past within this industry, some buyers make the move to pick up customers and market share only. The purchased product essentially disappears. In this case, given that Auth0’s go-to-market strategy and customer base are quite different from their own, Okta would fare best at integrating Auth0 technology and adding the GTM strategy to their own, rather than allowing those to disappear.</p>
<p>Though CIAM emerged from IAM as a result of evolving requirements, we are starting to see movement from both CIAM and IAM vendors toward offering more unified solutions, with an emphasis on cloud-delivered services. From a functionality combination perspective, this acquisition of Auth0 by Okta could be very good for customers. Time will tell how this pairing will work out.</p>
<p>This move reduces the number of large vendors in IAM markets such as IDaaS, CIAM, and Authentication Services. However, as we have seen in recent Leadership Compasses, there are new and regional vendors appearing to address emerging requirements in those specialties. For more information, see our very recent Leadership Compasses on <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80062/enterprise-authentication-solutions/" title="Enterprise Authentication">Enterprise Authentication</a>, <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80257/access-management/" title="Access Management">Access Management</a>, and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80040/ciam-platforms/" title="CIAM Platforms">CIAM Platforms</a>.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole will follow this and other news in the IAM field. In fact, new reports covering vendors and cloud-delivered IAM services will soon be published.</p>

 AERGO-Xangle,’Permanent storage of public announcement records on the blockchain’… Increase transparency in information disclosure and strengthen investor protection <p>Xangle, a virtual asset information portal based on public disclosure data, announced on February 4th that it plans to record project disclosures on the public blockchain AERGO, a blockchain platform for enterprises. With this collaboration, Xangle aims to store disclosure records on the blockchain, improve transparency of disclosure services, and increase protection for investors.</p><p>Xangle plans to develop a mirroring service based on the DTT Alliance (Decentralized Trusted Timestamping), a data verification alliance, and record the disclosures on the AERGO mainnet blockchain.</p><p>This is expected to secure higher transparency and security than the existing public announcement service. It is also possible to implement a ‘blockchain native’ public announcement service that detects various on-chain activities such as token burns or large-scale movements, records it on the AERGO mainnet, and disclose&nbsp;it.</p><p>There have been many instances where investors incurred losses due to unreliable information uploaded by various projects. In certain projects, the contents of the presentation were altered or the notices deleted. Due to these reasons, it has been difficult to make investment decisions based on trust and reliability of information.</p><p>When disclosures are recorded on the AERGO mainnet, issues around deletion or manipulation of investment prospectus can be prevented. In addition, investment decisions can be better made with information that can be trusted, as the information has been recorded on the immutable trustless public blockchain. Recording on the public blockchain will alleviate concerns of monopolization of public information.</p><p>Xangle has been archiving records of project disclosures published on it’s own platform. Once archived, it was not possible to modify or delete any changes, and if there were any changes, it has been published in the form of ‘corrective disclosure’. Xangle has kept public records as transaction details are permanently recorded on the blockchain ledger.X</p><p>Xangle is the only domestic and foreign virtual asset disclosure information portal, and aims to integrate and standardize information so that information can be viewed more transparently when the value of digital assets is transacted across borders and languages. In Xangle, you can view off-chain and on-chain information of more than 2,000 blockchain projects, and about 8,000 public announcements have been published.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-xangle-permanent-storage-of-public-announcement-records-on-the-blockchain-increase-bc230d33cf0d">AERGO-Xangle,’Permanent storage of public announcement records on the blockchain’… Increase…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>We all know that communication is the most critical success factor of any human undertakings, and IAM initiatives are no exception. However, whether you are:</p>
 
 a manager trying to explain its IAM strategic program to top management, 
 an architect trying to make IAM efficiently and securely serve the information system, 
 an engineer trying to explain IAM technological challenges to colleagues, 
 a vendor trying to increase the value of its IAM product for his customers, 
 a researcher trying to push forward our understanding of IAM, 
 
<p>…the one critical thing we are all missing is a consistent and accurate vocabulary. Throughout decades of academic work, many authors proposed definitions for IAM terms and concepts. Yet, as a discipline, as an industry, as a career specialization, and as a research field, we failed to consolidate this and build a reference IAM dictionary, allowing us to communicate with precision and clarity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session, I will present you with the TOME community project. Its goal is to become that reference dictionary. It is built as an open wiki to allow all experts to contribute. It is free of charge and licensed under Creative Commons to facilitate its widespread adoption. It is rooted in science with pervasive references from the literature to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
 Learning objectives 
 
 See how numerous, inconsistent and confusing IAM terms are in everyday usage 
 Realize how developing a clear and accurate vocabulary may contribute to the success of IAM 
 Get acquainted with the TOME IAM dictionary initiative and understand how to contribute

  <p>Leveraging what you have and extending it by new services and architectures to support today’s and tomorrow’s business demand on IAM.</p>
<p>IAM (Identity and Access Management) is no longer just an administrative tool or a solution supporting your regulatory compliance requirements. It is a business enabler, as well as an IT enabler. It is a central element of every cybersecurity strategy. It enables managing and access control for everyone from employees to consumers and everything from things to software robots. It is a foundation for your success in digital transformation. It also enables IT transformation, by managing access to all the clouds and services you have to deal with.</p>
<p>But: How to get to a modern IAM form where you may be today? What to preserve, what to extend, what to add, what to retire? And how to do such a migration in a way that you can serve the business demand rapidly, while gaining the time you need for more complex migrations – and while preserving investments in times of tight budgets?</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, will discuss these aspects and explain how the paradigm of an Identity Fabric can help you in successfully modernizing your IAM, at your own pace. He also will shed a light on the state of the market and the maturity of offerings serving the Identity Fabrics model.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-fabrics-future-proofing-iam-2021-03-03-kuppinger"></a>

  <p>In the early years of this millennia Finland was already at the forefront in utilizing strong authentication for online services. Banks had been issuing two-factor authenticators to their customers already in the '90s. These means of strong authentication were quickly adopted by public and private sector services that required more than passwords. Mobile network operators began to offer PKI based SIM authentication. These two solutions and their somewhat legacy protocols conquered the strong authentication market and were the de-facto methods subscribing to or accessing services. Advances in technology, eIDAS, PSD2, and user expectations required a complete overhaul of the strong authentication landscape for the whole country. What happened and why? What were the lessons learned?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-fabrics-future-proofing-iam-2021-03-03-ihalainen"></a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Oracle has unveiled new interesting capabilities in the Oracle database today, which they refer to as <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/database/how-to-achieve-crypto-secure-data-management">Immutable and Blockchain tables</a>. While I am not entirely convinced by the names they have chosen, I can absolutely get behind the overall Crypto-secure data management concept that has emerged along with them.</p>
<p>Whenever people discuss various applications of cryptography for information protection, they almost inevitably tend to think about encryption or, in other words, protecting the data’s confidentiality. However, while keeping the data out of reach of unauthorized persons is arguably the most important task of cybersecurity and compliance, it is not the only one. The CIA triad of information security refers to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data as the three principles that must be applied in balance to ensure full protection.</p>
<p>Oracle databases already have a multitude of security features to ensure data confidentiality including encryption and data masking, access management, and threat prevention – that’s why the company was recognized as one of the leaders in our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lc80294">Leadership Compass on Database and Big Data Security</a>. The same applies to availability – the Oracle Autonomous Database was basically designed for this purpose. However, data integrity is a trickier subject. There are multiple ways malicious actors, especially company insiders or administrators, could modify corporate data stored in databases without ever tripping any security controls – after all, how would a database firewall distinguish an illegal modification of financial data from a valid transaction?</p>
<p>Blockchain has become the go-to solution for such challenges in recent years. At least in its original sense, Blockchain is just a data structure specifically designed to be resistant to modifications in its data using timestamps and cryptographic hashes of previous blocks to record new ones. Often, however, the name is associated with public distributed ledgers that were created specifically for multiple, potentially untrusted parties working without central oversight.</p>
<p>This is why, by the way, I don’t think calling the new immutable and cryptographically verified tables in the Oracle database “Blockchain tables” was such a good idea. While technically correct, it can be somewhat misleading since Oracle does not rely on distributed ledgers for this implementation. What it does is to provide additional security controls for data that by design is required to be immutable and to prevent malicious insiders from tampering with it, even if they have all the necessary access rights and encryption keys at hand.</p>
<p>Such data can be anything from financial transactions to IoT sensor measurements – but until now you would need to write it into a separate ledger, either a “proper” distributed Blockchain or a specialized database like Amazon’s Quantum Ledger DB. Of course, distributed Blockchains require a dedicated and potentially expensive infrastructure to maintain, but even in a centralized ledger, your data is still stored in a separate information silo. Oracle’s new table types however are for all intents and purposes just like other tables in a relational database, only with additional protection features. They support all kinds of operations (other than modifying existing records, obviously), can be queried using standard SQL, and do not need to be exported to yet another location to run analytic workloads.</p>
<p>In addition to making records in a table immutable and signed with cryptographic digests, functions were added to simplify data verification – both through the database engine or independently through external utilities to ensure that even hacking the database itself won’t help the malicious actors.</p>
<p>Additionally, to prevent storing falsified data in a blockchain table using stolen credentials, the database can optionally allow users to sign each record with their private keys and countersign them with Oracle’s keys to ensure that the data was not manipulated anywhere between the user and the database. Cryptographic digests can be automatically distributed when a new row is inserted – over email or an API. They can even be exported into a public distributed ledger. This ensures that even large-scale manipulations, when whole databases are replaced to hide malicious activities, can be promptly uncovered.</p>
<p>Anyway, even if the new immutable and blockchain tables have less to do with “The Blockchain” than the name implies, I would argue they come with nearly all the benefits of a distributed ledger but without its massive overhead and isolation from traditional relational databases. The new capabilities are now available both in the latest Oracle Database 21c and the previous 19c release, at no extra cost for the customers.</p>

<p>A DID Method geared for privacy, formal verification, and scaling to billions of identifiers by using off-chain updates.</p><p><a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce</a> and <a href="https://tqtezos.com/">TQ Tezos</a> are jointly releasing the <a href="https://did-tezos.spruceid.com/">draft specification</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/did-tezos">initial implementation</a> of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> based on the Tezos blockchain. We began our collaboration with TQ Tezos and the wider Tezos ecosystem <a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/announcing-decentralized-identity-on-tezos-4bf266a7af3f">in August</a> to take full advantage of Tezos’ production-tested proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, ability to perform protocol upgrades, and toolsets for formal&nbsp;methods.</p><p>We welcome review of our <a href="https://did-tezos.spruceid.com/#why-a-tezos-did-method">Tezos DID Method specification</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/master/proposals/tzip-19/tzip-19.md">TZIP-019 companion specification</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/did-tezos">open-source implementation</a> based on <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">DIDKit</a>. A special thank you goes to Michael Klein of TQ Tezos, a co-author of this body of work, whose contributions have made this possible.</p> Quick Feature&nbsp;Overview <p>Tezos Namespace maps directly to the Tezos DID Namespace. Tezos-based DIDs are tz1, tz2, tz3, and KT1 account addresses simply prefixed with did:tz:. For example, tz1aaYoabvj2DQtpHz74Z83fSNjY29asdBfZ just becomes did:tz:tz1aaYoabvj2DQtpHz74Z83fSNjY29asdBfZ.</p><p>Tezos DIDs can be used immediately without sending any on-chain transactions. Anyone who generates a new Tezos address can use it as a DID without owning any tez, no exchange or KYC necessary. For readers familiar with the DID ecosystem, this can be thought of as did-key or did-peer with public key hash-based identifiers and a well-defined process for on-chain grafting. In short, Tezos DIDs exist by default but their properties can be optionally updated by their controllers on the Tezos blockchain, or by using signed off-chain inputs.</p><p>On-chain data minimization. Spruce takes the position that when it comes to user data, only the absolute minimum amount necessary should be stored on public blockchains. For this reason, the initial release allows only one verification method for authentication as the DID controller, and one service endpoint for linking to a protected service directory. Off-chain rotations for the same two properties are also specified, based on <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-spec-extensions/blob/master/parameters/signed-ietf-json-patch.md">signed JSON patches</a> or Tezos transactions depending on the desired security&nbsp;model.</p><p>Support for completely off-chain trust frameworks. Off-chain rotations and authorities means that the Tezos DID method allows for complete DID usage (create, read, update, deactivate) without a single transaction being sent to any public blockchain, maximizing user privacy and reducing the attack surface area. This is a common requirement we have encountered working with our customers in enterprise environments and in the public sector, who also appreciate that tz3 accounts are based on the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/elliptic-curve-cryptography">NIST recommended P-256&nbsp;curve</a>.</p> Formal verification <p>The specification defines the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/did-tezos/tree/main/contract/taquito">DID manager smart contract</a> which handles the on-chain updates to the DID document. It rotates the verification methods and service endpoints only when signed off by the active key. Anyone can pay for and send the Tezos transaction on behalf of someone else because the signed authorization is contained in an input parameter to the smart contract, similar to a&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/tzip-17-permit-497afd9b0e9e">permit</a>.</p><p>The DID Manager, like all Tezos smart contracts, is expressed in <a href="https://tezos.gitlab.io/alpha/michelson.html">Michelson</a>, a stack-based, statically typed, and functional programming language. One crucial distinction between Michelson and other smart contract languages is its facilitation of end-to-end formal verification, which has allowed the development of supporting formal verification frameworks including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08671">Mi-Cho-Coq</a> and <a href="https://runtimeverification.com/blog/formal-verification-framework-for-michelson/">K-Michelson</a>.</p><p>We are actively working with TQ Tezos and other groups within the Tezos ecosystem to scope candidate properties and create correctness proofs for them. This can demonstrate immunity from the vulnerabilities responsible for many blockchain attack vectors, including transaction ordering attacks, reentrancy bugs, and violations of state-transition invariants. By next quarter, we expect to have preliminary results incorporated into our implementation’s continuous integration and testing&nbsp;harness.</p> Scalability and P2P Messaging <p>We believe that there will exist billions of DIDs actively used by people, IoT devices, software agents, and ephemeral identities on a per-interaction basis. It should be cheap and easy to create one or more DIDs uncorrelated with any aspects of your identity except for what you specifically choose to&nbsp;reveal.</p><p>You might want to create a new identifier to share with someone you just met at a party to allow them to securely contact you without giving out your email or phone number. A cloud-based software agent might want to do the same thing but thousands of times per day and with other software agents. Supporting these off-chain structures in a standardized, unified way via emerging P2P and scalability protocols was a central commitment of our design&nbsp;process.</p><p>Concretely, the Tezos DID Method supports off-chain updates to the DID document that can be hosted on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree protocol</a> based on CRDTs, on top of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a>, or using DHT approaches such as in <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did-orb</a>. Tezos DIDs will also be able to communicate with each other privately and securely using <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap">TorGap</a> (via tz1’s ed25519 keys) or&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging">DIDComm</a>.</p> Tezos ecosystem integrations <p>Tezos wallet integrations. We are working with wallets, including <a href="https://wallet.kukai.app/">Kukai</a>, to integrate support for the Tezos DID method and W3C Verifiable Credential-enabled workflows using DIDKit. This will allow Tezos users to privately demonstrate their digital credentials as a way to securely authenticate to services (i.e., “Login with&nbsp;Tezos”).</p><p>Baker credentials. We are collaborating with organizations such as <a href="https://baking-bad.org/">Baking Bad</a> to allow Tezos bakers to receive credentials demonstrating their baking history and reputations. With the Tezos DID method, these credentials can now be issued directly for use with their baker addresses or accounts authorized by their baker addresses. Bakers will be able to use their Tezos DIDs to update their metadata in a registry.</p><p>Cross-chain credentials. Blockchain users with impressive on-chain transaction histories can’t do much with them on-chain or off-chain. By using a Tezos DID, a user can demonstrate their cross-chain activity such as participation in DeFi (trading, LP) and games in order to be eligible for rewards from services and platforms in the Tezos ecosystem.</p><p>NFT authenticity verifications. The combination of credentials issued by social proofs and Tezos DIDs can allow NFT artists to demonstrate their identity for a specific Tezos account. This ensures that an artist can endorse the authenticity of their own digital creations over time, not just at time of issuance of an NFT, and in so doing reduce the ability of fraudulent digital assets to deceive purchasers.</p> Future development <p>As the Tezos protocol upgrades and the ecosystem continues to mature, we expect to make improvements to the DID method that would be difficult to replicate in other ecosystems.</p>  We are working with engineers from TQ Tezos and the wider Tezos ecosystem to prove correctness of select properties of the DID manager smart contract as part of our integration testing.  With the recent addition of <a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/tezos-edo-upgrade-network-effects-5adc20075de4#:~:text=Edo%20is%20the%20first%20Tezos,indexers%2C%20libraries%2C%20etc.)">shielded transactions in Edo</a>, it is possible to transfer assets anonymously with DID-based peer-to-peer verifications that leave no on-chain connection strings by using service endpoints.  We are closely tracking the work of the <a href="https://github.com/simplestaking/tezedge">TezEdge</a> team to enable pure Rust transaction forging in&nbsp;DIDKit.  Based on feedback from early Tezos DID users, we will be proposing our own updates to the Tezos protocol that can specifically improve support for decentralized identity.  <p>If you would like to discuss how to use the Tezos DID Method for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to leave us a&nbsp;message.</p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>Aperte ufficialmente le iscrizioni per partecipare a This is me Hackathon_21, iniziativa creata da &nbsp;<a href="https://www.dizme.io/">DizmeID</a> Foundation in collaborazionecon <a href="https://www.cariplofactory.it/">Cariplo Factory</a>, Algorand, Fabrick, InfoCert, Legal Hackers, Sweet Legal Tech, Ben, next generation currency, blockchain4innovation, B Holding Boost Heroes, A.P.S.P. e CRAD.</p>



<p>This is me Hackathon_21 prende le mosse da un problema molto attuale: oggi la nostra identità digitale è costituita da un volume sempre crescenti di dati e informazioni sensibili su cui spesso non esercitiamo un effettivo controllo. Azioni semplici e quotidiane, come iscriversi a una newsletter o effettuare un pagamento online, nel panorama digitale attuale si traducono nella condivisione di dati personali sensibili, di cui spesso ignoriamo l’effettiva titolarità.&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://www.cariplofactory.it/?page_id=8318&amp;preview=true"></a>



<p>Sulla scia di queste tematiche This is me Hackathon 21 mira a migliorare la tutela dei nostri dati online, attraverso idee originali e soluzioni innovative, promuovendo lo sviluppo di un nuovo modello di identità per un reale controllo della nostra privacy e dati personali.</p>



 Come si svolge? 



<p>This is me Hackathon_21 si articola su cinque challenge, definite in funzione dei ruoli che ciascuna persona fisica può assumere relazionandosi con gli attori di uno specifico contesto digitale:</p>



  Government to Citizen: soluzioni per il Cittadino che si relaziona con la Pubblica Amministrazione.  Business to Consumer: soluzioni per il Consumatore che accede a servizi retail, finanziari, assicurativi, utility, telco.  Business to Employee: soluzioni per lo studente che si relaziona con enti di istruzione e formazione o per il lavoratore che interagisce con l’ecosistema aziendale.  Business to Business: soluzioni per il legale rappresentante che opera in nome e per conto di una persona giuridica.  Business to Thing: soluzioni per il controllo e la gestione di asset digitali e non.  



 A chi si rivolge This is me Hackathon_21? 



 Startup 



<p>Competizione dedicata ad aziende. Le startup e organizzazioni potranno proporre una Soluzione che estende un prodotto/servizio esistente oppure realizzare una Soluzione ex-novo. In entrambi i casi la Soluzione dovrà indirizzare uno dei casi d’uso proposti nelle varie Challenge.</p>



 Talenti 



<p>Competizione dedicata a software developer ed innovatori, sia singoli individui che team già organizzati. I Talenti proporranno una Soluzione originale in risposta ad uno dei casi d’uso proposti nelle varie Challenge.</p>



 LegalTech 



<p>Studi legali e singoli professionisti esperti di digital compliance potranno partecipare al contest scegliendo uno dei casi d’uso previsti dalle Challenge e sviluppando uno studio di fattibilità che indirizzi i vincoli normativi dello specifico contesto.</p>

 Cybersecurity Summit Live 2021 



<p>In questi tempi incerti, dovuti ai cambiamenti imposti dalla pandemia di Coronavirus, il ruolo della Cybersecurity assume un ruolo di primo piano, ma vi sono anche gli aspetti legati alla sicurezza (Safety) e alla Continuità operativa del Business da tenere in considerazione.</p>



<p>Se il primo bisogno è stato soddisfatto con un ampio ricorso allo&nbsp;Smart Working, rimane oggi il tema di&nbsp;innalzare la Resilienza&nbsp;delle infrastrutture e dei servizi per il Digitale, in uno scenario in cui i&nbsp;Rischi cyber&nbsp;diventavano giorno dopo giorno più pericolosi. Tutto questo rende sempre più sfidante garantire il Trust,&nbsp;assicurare&nbsp;la Continuità del Business,&nbsp;rispondere alla Compliance e&nbsp;abilitare una&nbsp;Trasformazione digitale&nbsp;sicura&nbsp;dell’azienda.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Durante il “CYBERSECURITY SUMMIT LIVE 2021” del prossimo 9 Marzo 2021, The Innovation Group&nbsp;commenterà il&nbsp;livello di maturità della Cybersecurity raggiunto nelle organizzazioni italiane.</p>



<p>Il&nbsp;summit, giunto alla sua nona edizione,&nbsp;sarà&nbsp;in Diretta Streaming e affronterà i seguenti temi:</p>



  Il&nbsp;Perimetro&nbsp;di Sicurezza Nazionale cibernetica: stato dell’arte del regolamento, prossimi sviluppi&nbsp;  I Rischi per la&nbsp;Privacy: cosa implicherà in futuro&nbsp;il cambio di Informativa di WhatsApp?&nbsp;  Il&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;e la cybersecurity. Quale aiuto da&nbsp;automazione&nbsp;e intelligenza artificiale&nbsp;(AI)&nbsp;  The new&nbsp;identity. Innovare l’approccio all’Identity e Access management (IAM)&nbsp;&nbsp;  Resilienza&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Compliance&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Trasformazione digitale&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Trust:&nbsp;come bilanciare la spesa&nbsp;in cybersecurity?&nbsp;  La sicurezza della&nbsp;Supply&nbsp;Chain:&nbsp;le&nbsp;best&nbsp;practice&nbsp;per il terzo millennio&nbsp;  IoT&nbsp;security: certificazione e nuovi scenari di gestione del rischio dell’internet delle cose&nbsp;  Innovare il&nbsp;SOC&nbsp;e il&nbsp;CERT, elevare la cultura della sicurezza in azienda.&nbsp;

Typically, employees sign on to multiple business applications to do their jobs, such as messaging and email accounts, HR functions, intranet sites, financial records, etc. With SSO, they can access all of the resources they need with one set of login credentials, eliminating the need to remember or enter a unique password for each account.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-148-a-ripple-bombshell-clubhouse-and-the-rise-of-digital-cults-68d45b0d0867">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  NFTs  It’s a good time to be a&nbsp;creator  It’s not about content, it’s about&nbsp;Groups  Tweet of the&nbsp;week  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. Three letters:&nbsp;NFTs <p>What’s an NFT? NFT stands for non-fungible token. All that really means is that it’s one of a kind. (Bitcoin, on the other hand, is fully fungible. You don’t care what bitcoin you have, as long as you have it. It’s perfectly replaceable with any other bitcoin.)</p><p>A couple quick primers on&nbsp;NFTs:</p>  <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/">OpenSea — NFTs</a> (via /junhiraga)  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/what-are-nfts">Coindesk — What are NFTs?</a> (via&nbsp;/laura)  <p>NFTs aren’t really a new thing. In the real world, you have airline tickets — the last first class window seat. And we all know about domain&nbsp;names.</p><p>What’s changed now is the introduction of blockchain — which enables qualities such as interoperability, tradeability, and provable scarcity.</p><p>When applied to the digital world, it’s no wonder that images, audio, and video clips are the most popular category for NFTs. We’ve existed in an environment where all content is easily reproducible, pigeon-holing the industry into a very narrow range of business&nbsp;models.</p><p>NFTs change everything. (Insert smart contracts. Wow!)</p><p>And so — NFTs are super hot right now. (As /j pointed out, even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dFgZwpeokk">YouTuber Logan Paul is in on&nbsp;it</a>.)</p><p>Like this 10-second video clip <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9">that just sold for $6.6&nbsp;million</a>:</p><blockquote>In October 2020, Miami-based art collector Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile spent almost $67,000 on a 10-second video artwork that he could have watched for free online.

It’s also a good time to be a&nbsp;creator <p><a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/creators-this-is-your-time-396411">According to Keith Teare</a> (via /gregkidd):</p><blockquote>Are you a creator? Do you produce a newsletter? Videos? Podcasts? Clubhouse meetings? A Blog? Tweets? Other posts&nbsp;online?</blockquote><blockquote>If you answer yes to any of the above you are a creator and, as the title to this week’s That Was The Week says, this is your&nbsp;time.</blockquote><blockquote>Tools for creators have evolved consistently. Blogger, WordPress, Tumblr, Podcast tools, Video making tools, live streaming tools, Newsletter Tools, and more, go back many&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>Recent increases in Podcasting and Newsletters are driving awareness that creator generated content is going through a renaissance. And now the major players have noticed. Since Spotify acquired Anchor.fm and SubStack launched to acclaim, the need to serve the creator has surfaced as a major theme of innovation.</blockquote><blockquote>Clubhouse is simply another offering into the creative content platform&nbsp;space.</blockquote><p>And here’s Packy McCormick on the burgeoning creator&nbsp;economy:</p><blockquote>If you’ve spent much time on the internet recently you might have noticed something: it’s gotten really fast-paced and really fun. It just keeps getting faster and funner. Bitcoin, Clubhouse, NFTs, unicorn startups galore, the Creator Economy. Each feels simultaneously like a potential fad and a nascent revolution.From the eye of the storm, it’s hard to tell exactly what it means. Will digital artists continue to mint millions from NFTs? Will Creator Economy startups continue to raise early stage rounds at dizzying valuations? Will consumer social apps need top-tier influencer founders to cut through the&nbsp;noise?</blockquote> 3. As someone who creates content regularly, I can tell you that it’s a grind. And that’s also why the answer to the creator economy is&nbsp;Groups. <p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/content-alone-will-kill-the-creator-economy">Here’s The Information</a> on how “content alone will kill the creator economy”:</p><blockquote>In this context, when a creator has a choice between focusing on content alone or building a community too, they should absolutely choose a community as early as possible and work to develop a network&nbsp;effect.</blockquote><blockquote>In a community, members build relationships with each other, solve problems and master skills together. They come back as much for each other as they do for the next newsletter, video or course. They may initially come for what the creator produces, but they stay to talk, explore and build things with members who are near them, similar to them and who care about the same&nbsp;topics.</blockquote><blockquote>The hints of what’s possible for Richardson’s unique take on being an American are surfacing now in the comments section of her newsletter. Users pay her $5 a month, or $50 a year, for a subscription that permits them to post comments and join her community. The desire for people to connect more deeply in a space controlled by a creator they trust and away from the war for attention on Facebook points us to a more interesting future.</blockquote><blockquote>Just ask best-selling author and blogger Luvvie Ajayi Jones, Peter Diamandis of XPRIZE fame and Adriene Mishler of Yoga with Adriene, who have all found a bigger opportunity by bringing a community to their corner of the Internet. They’re selling digital subscriptions that include content, courses, events and community, all brought together in one place under their brand for their members to build relationships with each other on topics ranging from career planning to yoga and frontier technology. The result is a better product for their members and more reasons to come&nbsp;back.</blockquote><p>So yeah, don’t just make content. Start a Group. Build a community.</p> 4.

<p>2020 accelerated the adoption of many remote and digital solutions across nearly every industry. And while mortgage lending has some catch-up to play relative to some other industries in adopting digital solutions, change is happening, and it’s happening fast. Even if you’re not adopting digital mortgage solutions, many of your competitors are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But digital adoption can certainly come with its own challenges. These barriers, however, are not impenetrable, and a targeted approach to overcoming barriers to digital adoption can set you on your way to enjoying all the benefits of a digital mortgage experience.&nbsp;</p>
 Why Adopt Digital Mortgage Solutions? 
<p>Digital adoption in mortgage lending involves integrating a digital mortgage solution, such as a digital verification of assets, or transforming a traditional workflow to a digital-first model. Digital solutions enable lenders to verify income, assets, and employment without the high-friction interactions with borrowers that were complicated by pandemic restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As digital mortgage solutions have proven during the pandemic, digital adoption enables mortgage lenders to be more nimble and adapt to unexpected disruption in the market. Digital adoption also streamlines the origination process. Fannie Mae found that digital verifications can <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty">reduce cycle time by up to 12 days</a>. And that real-time data is more accurate and helps mitigate fraud and credit risk. Digital adoption has also picked up traction as it better satisfies the expectations of today’s digital consumers.</p>
<p>So what’s keeping more mortgage lenders from adopting digital solutions?&nbsp;</p>
 Barriers to Digital Adoption 
<p>Changing a mortgage lending workflow is no light task. Even if you see the benefits to digital mortgage adoption, it’s another issue entirely to actually implement digital solutions and strategies. Understanding the barriers standing between you and a successful digital adoption is the first step toward targeting and overcoming these challenges and enjoying the many returns of a digital mortgage process. Let’s take a look at some of the most common barriers to digital adoption.</p>
 1. Apprehensive Teammates and Borrowers 
<p>Frequently, the barrier to digital adoption isn’t so much technical as it is about the apprehension of the teammates who will be using the solutions and the prospective borrowers who will give their trust to the solutions. Although many consumers already share their financial data digitally, allowing access to bank account data can be intimidating for borrowers. The fact is, loan officers, processors, underwriters, and other team members may just be more comfortable with their well-worn traditional workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overcoming this barrier will require showing teammates that the returns of digital adoption far outweigh the growing pains, and assuring borrowers that the secure consumer-permissioning process actually empowers them with greater control over their financial data. It also helps to integrate a simple-to-use verification technology like Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) that <a href="https://www.finicity.com/finicity-mvs-the-smart-simple-mortgage-verification-experience/">simplifies the entire verification process</a> into a one-touch experience.</p>
 2. Integrating Technology with Traditional Systems and Workflows 
<p>At the core of digital adoption is leveraging innovative technology and solutions that enhance the mortgage experience. Adapting to new technology, however, can become a barrier when you’ve been relying on the same traditional solutions for decades. Technology must also be able to integrate with a lender’s loan origination software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, while any adoption involves some learning curve MVS is built to be intuitive and quick to integrate. And as a one-touch solution for mortgage verifications, MVS makes adaptation easy. No more using multiple processes to get the necessary information. Everything you need is in one streamlined process.</p>
 3. Changing Trusted Processes 
<p>Trust is an integral element of mortgage lending. Borrowers trust lenders with personal information and with the hope and stress of one of the most significant decisions of their lives. And you trust your tried-and-true process to deliver a low-risk, accurate origination. Traditional processes may be out-of-date, slower, and potentially higher-risk than newer processes, but it can nonetheless be difficult to leave that familiar process behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, digital adoption doesn’t necessarily involve abandoning everything about familiar processes. Instead, adoption enhances those processes. For example, <a href="https://www.phmloans.com/">Prosperity Home Mortgage</a> has implemented a hybrid lending model. They leverage Finicity’s digital verification solutions for a streamlined, competitive experience, but they also still prioritize in-person guidance for borrowers to personalize their lending experience. Prosperity maintained trusted, familiar priorities while augmenting their overall process with digital solutions.</p>
<p>Solutions like MVS also ease the enhancement of trusted processes by enabling a single process to verify assets, income, and employment. That process is also built to satisfy and exceed the expectations of today’s digital borrowers, which means this new verification solution will feel more comfortable and seamless than traditional paper-based processes.</p>
 4. Disjointed Strategy and Poor Change Management 
<p>Some lenders may have already overcome the other adoption barriers and may be on their way to integrate digital mortgage solutions. However, a disjointed adoption strategy or poor change management can become another barrier to successful adoption. Weak buy-in to the digital adoption at different levels in the organization can slow down the adoption process and prevent proper training and effective synergy between teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cohesive digital adoption strategy and effective change management involves demonstrating the benefits of digital adoption from the top of your organization on down. Successful adoption requires commitment and coordination from all. MVS can smooth out that commitment and coordination by reducing the amount of change being instituted with a single simple process, making the overall adoption easier to manage.</p>
<p>Target these digital adoption barriers and you’ll be on your way to a successful digital adoption and all the benefits that come from digital mortgage. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Service</a> can help you do just that. </p>

<p>What does a prolific 20th-century German scholar have to do with digital note-taking? Turns out quite a bit. We're looking at the note-taking system known as "Zettlekasten," and how you can use <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/announcing-tiddlywiki-on-fission/">Fission and TiddlyWiki </a>to create your own version. </p> <p>This is Niklas Luhmann. Niklas was a prolific scholar and writer--he wrote and published more than 70 books and more than 400 scholarly articles.</p>This is Niklas Luhmann<p>Niklas Luhmann was such an intellectually productive badass because of the relatively ingenious yet straightforward note-taking method he developed known as “Zettelkasten.” Like so many other German words, Zettelkasten as a word is both literal and perfectly descriptive. “Zettel” means slip or note, and “kasten” means box. In essence, the Zettelkasten method is about creating a box (or any storage receptacle) in which to keep notes.</p> How Zettelkasten works <p>To use the Zettelkasten method, you only need three simple things:</p>  A way to take notes  A system with bidirectional linking  A collection of tags  <p>That’s it! But now, let’s break down each piece a little bit.</p> A note-taking system <p>Luhmann was old school--he owned no computers and used paper, pens, and a typewriter for most of his impressive writing career. He didn’t even type very quickly--he used the hunt and peck method.</p><p>In fact, his Zettelkasten was literally a box of notes in the form of a piece of furniture--sort of like a card catalog.</p>Not Luhmann's Zettelkasten, but you get the idea<p></p><p>While Luhmann’s Zettelkasten was a piece of furniture stuffed with slips of paper, today, the concept translates very well to any of the many digital note-taking systems available. Web apps like Evernote, Notion, and Google Keep offer free or low-cost ways to take notes on desktop or mobile devices. TiddlyWiki is also a great option because of it’s bidirectional linking power, which is the next crucial ingredient of a Zettelkasten.</p> A system with bidirectional linking <p>So what is bidirectional linking? It’s exactly what it sounds like--the ability to connect ideas back and forth to each other in more than one direction. One popular option of a program with this capability is the paid product Roam Research; however, TiddlyWiki offers bidirectional linking function in its free, open-source program.</p> A collection of tags <p>The last component of a Zettelkasten is a collection of tags, or labels, for your thoughts/entries. We’re used to seeing tags used frequently with blog posts or online articles. On the Fission blog, we use categories like security, apps, open-source, or headless to help readers find relevant content. Categorizing your ideas with different tags allows you to find relevant information in a note-taking system quickly. And because one idea may have more than one tag, you can easily find the relevant idea from any number of search terms.</p> Using TiddlyWiki for Zettelkasten <p>The great thing about TiddlyWiki is that it gives us the three things we need to use the Zettelkasten system.</p>  A note-taking method.  Bidirectional linking  A system of Tags  <p>TiddlyWiki offers a note-taking method with its simple interface with entries called “Tiddlers.” A new Tiddler looks like this:</p><p><br></p><p>Tiddlers are simple to tag. In our example, I added three different tags--open source, super rad ideas, and TiddlyWiki:</p><p></p><p>Let’s create a second note. This one is titled “Even New Tiddler.” And for this one, I only added one tag--Super rad ideas:</p><p><br></p><p>Now, if you search for Tiddlers with the tag “Super rad ideas,” both of our Tiddlers come up in the search results:</p><p></p> TiddlyWiki and Fission <p>As you can see, TiddlyWiki provides a simple and effective way to organize your notes using the Zettelkasten method. And now that TiddlyWiki is building a version of the TiddlyWiki app on the Fission platform, users will have a web native option to share content across browsers and devices. You get all of the benefits of TiddlyWiki’s open-source program for note-taking, tagging, and bidirectional linking, while Fission acts as a flexible container for your Zettelkasten. And Fission’s strong encryption keeps your data secure and protected.</p><p>We are working on this project out in the open. You can check out the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">TiddlyWiki group on the Fission forum</a> to keep track of this project. You can look for the launch of TiddlyWiki for Fission later this spring!</p><p>Also, check out the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/478735028319158277">Fission Discord</a>, where we are having lots of exciting conversations with other devs about current projects and all things open source.

					 <p>The Trinsic Wallet is a <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) digital wallet. People use it to receive, store, and share digital credentials. The Trinsic Wallet was the first <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-digital-wallets/">SSI digital wallet</a> to prove interoperability and has become one of the most-used SSI wallets globally. Not only is the wallet easy-to-use for end users, but it is extremely functional for developers who are interacting directly with the Trinsic platform since it works seamlessly with <a href="https://trinsic.id/an-introduction-to-trinsics-apis/">Trinsic’s APIs </a>and <a href="https://trinsic.id/an-introduction-to-trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>. The following is a brief overview of what the Trinsic Wallet can do and how your organization can take advantage of it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Collect credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>We all carry around a leather wallet that carries cards inside. The Trinsic Wallet does that same thing for digital cards. These digital cards, or “credentials” could be a passport, driver’s license, health insurance card, etc. But the Trinsic Wallet can store more than just the “digital versions” of the cards in your leather wallet. It can store any kind of personal data in the form of a digital credential. For example, the Trinsic Wallet could carry login credentials, vaccination and test result credentials, licensing credentials, supply chain certifications, and more. These credentials are stored on the device, so no one but the end user has access to them—not even Trinsic as the wallet provider. To learn more about these “verifiable credentials”, check out this <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">blog</a> or refer to our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">documentation</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Share credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Continuing with the leather wallet analogy, the reason people carry around wallets is so they can use the contents inside them. Usually the contents of our wallet are used to prove things about ourselves to access goods and services. The Trinsic Wallet enables end users to do the same thing, but the process is paperless and more secure for all parties involved.<br><br></p><p>When an organization requests information from an end user, the end user can decide whether to accept or reject the request. If the request is accepted, the wallet will find the relevant data from all of their credentials that is needed to fulfill the request. This means only the information that is needed is shared with the organization and nothing more. For example, the end user might share their birth date from their driver’s license but not their driver’s license number or address. The end user has full control over what kind of information they share and with whom. Best of all, the information that is shared can be instantly authenticated.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Connect with others 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Finally, the wallet enables end users “to connect” with others. Connections are super-private, securely-encrypted communication channels used between two parties. You can share credentials and messages through this channel with a high degree of trust. Connections are super helpful when parties need to interact frequently, but if the relationship isn’t long-term, <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">connectionless credential exchange</a>&nbsp;is sometimes a faster, more convenient way to interact.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Unique advantages 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The Trinsic Wallet has some advantages that make it unique from some of the other digital wallets out there.<br><br></p>  Based on interoperable, open standards: This gives end users the capability to seamlessly receive and share credentials with any organization that is also using community-driven SSI standards for verifiable credential exchange (i.e., the organizations do not have to be using the Trinsic platform to issue credentials to or request information from the Trinsic Wallet). In fact, the Trinsic Wallet was the first mobile app that met the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-commitment-to-interoperability-ahead-of-iiw/">Aries interoperability profile</a>.  No vendor lock-in: Just like people can change out their leather wallet for a new one whenever they want, the same can be done with the Trinsic Wallet. End users can easily export their credentials from the Trinsic Wallet and import them into another Aries-based digital wallet that supports <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">import/export functionality</a>.  Free: It is free to download and immediately use for iOS and Android.

<p>Should countries develop national strategies for data in order to release its full potential? If so, what should they look&nbsp;like?</p><p>The British Government is currently mulling responses to its consultation about a new UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">National Data Strategy</a>. The decisions it arrives at will affect developments for many years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Mydex CIC provided comprehensive answers to questions asked by this consultation. To help promote debate, we’re publishing edited versions of these answers in a series of&nbsp;blogs.</p><p>Other blogs in this series are: <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-we-need-new-nationwide-personal-data-infrastructure-56513fb6daf4">Why we Need New Nationwide Personal Data Infrastructure</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/transforming-the-system-a-roadmap-for-practical-implementation-411e8821ed19">Achieving Change at Scale</a>. (Meanwhile, to see some of the practical work we are doing, <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click here</a> to catch up on progress on the Macmillan My Data Store&nbsp;Pilot.)</p> We need two strategies, not&nbsp;one <p>The first point made by our submission is that we need two national data strategies — one for personal data and one for non-personal data. A national data strategy that talks about ‘data’ in the abstract and fails to distinguish between non-personal data and personal data is a sure fire recipe for confusion and error because they require very different treatments. Any attempt to treat them as if they are one and the same is akin to developing an ‘energy’ strategy that treats electricity and gas as the same because they are both ‘energy’. The results could be explosive and very damaging.</p> Many users, many&nbsp;uses <p>The second, critical point we made is that our society is at a tipping point in data management — one that can either be managed well or&nbsp;badly.</p><p>The consultation paper contained an important insight: a recognition that the “full value [of data] is not being realised because vital information is not getting to where it needs to be.” The big question that follows is ‘what needs to be done to rise to this challenge?’ What follows is a summary of what we&nbsp;said.</p><p>To be successful, the Strategy needs to grasp a nettle. The main reason why vital information is not getting where it needs to be is that our data economy has evolved to be an organisation-centric ‘One User One Use’ (OUOU) system — whereas, thanks to the inner logic of data itself, it needs to operate as a ‘Many Users, Many Uses’ (MUMU) data ecosystem.</p> Characteristics of&nbsp;OUOU <p>The digital economy first evolved with organisations collecting, storing and using the data they needed to pursue their particular purposes. This resulted in a data landscape that is overwhelmingly organisation-centric, with large quantities of data collected and used almost exclusively by large organisations, operating via a series of separate data silos. The inevitable result of this structure is that the uses of this data are restricted to the priorities and purposes of the organisations concerned. It is a ‘one user, one set of uses’&nbsp;system.</p><p>While this approach has unleashed many benefits, it has also created built-in structural limitations and restrictions on what data assets are created, how they are used, by who. Other parties, including citizens, SMEs, charities, researchers and other organisations cannot access the data they want/need. Key stakeholders, particularly citizens, are effectively excluded from taking part in the workings of the digital economy and from directly benefiting from the collection and use of&nbsp;data.</p> Characteristics of&nbsp;MUMU <p>It is in the nature of data that it can be used many times without being ‘used up’. Therefore it can potentially be re-used by many different parties for many different purposes. In this context, the current organisation-centric restrictions on who can access data and what they can use this data for represent a fundamental architectural, structural and infrastructural constraint on the data economy’s ability to evolve and flourish. We need to shift to a Many Users, Many Uses data ecosystem.</p><p>A simple analogy sums up the National Data Strategy’s core challenge. So far, the data chick has grown and evolved inside the protecting nurturing shell of OUOU — an organisation- centric data architecture. To mature and flourish, it now needs to break out of that&nbsp;shell.</p><p>The importance and nature of this <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">shift from OUOU to MUMU</a> is highlighted by the recent <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-citizen-data-systems">The Future of Citizen Data Systems</a> report by the Government Office for Science, which notes&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>“Data about people, here referred to as citizen data, is increasing rapidly in volume and variety. The effective use and sharing of such data has the potential to bring huge benefits to the economy and society as a whole: boosting productivity and trade, enabling innovative products, improving public service delivery and informing scientific research.</blockquote><blockquote>“However, the shifting data landscape is challenging for policymakers to navigate. Data collected for one purpose can be used many times over for a range of other ones, and government policy in one area can have unintended impacts elsewhere. Restrictions of data sharing can sometimes mitigate risks of privacy breaches and misuse. However, the linking together of new types of citizen data — across the boundaries of industry, government, and our personal lives — offers some of the greatest opportunities.”</blockquote><p>The big question is how to realise these benefits. The National Strategy for Data needs to recognise that the full benefits of MUMU cannot be realised solely by increasing data sharing between existing organisations. The system itself needs to re-set, to shift from exclusivity (‘organisations only’) to inclusivity (in particular, including citizens whose data it&nbsp;is).</p> Far-reaching reform <p>For this to happen we need far-reaching structural, architectural, infrastructural and institutional reform. Key elements of this reform agenda&nbsp;include:</p>  Structural Add new data actors/stakeholders capable of collecting, storing and sharing data independently of existing ‘data controller’ organisations. This includes enabling citizens to be able to build up their own data assets in their own personal data stores and enabling new data trusts or foundations to access and use data for a broad array of non-commercial purposes, including scientific and medical research. Adding new stakeholders to the workings of the system would turn today’s data landscape of multiple, isolated parallel data silos into an expanding set of linked data nodes in a vibrant data sharing&nbsp;network.  Architectural Recognise the need for increasing differentiation of functions and divisions of labour in data collection, storage and use, particularly the increasing separation of data storage from use. As specialist data storage services (including personal data stores) develop, they can enable multiple different parties to access the same data for a range of different purposes. The need to separate data storage from data use is recognised in t<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/vindicated-cb897fb4e94b">he EU’s new Data Governance Act</a>. The National Data Strategy is the UK’s opportunity to also grasp this nettle. If it fails to do so, it risks lagging behind the EU in the development of a world-leading data driven&nbsp;economy.  <p>The strategy also needs to recognise the need for other specialist support services such as the development of metadata standards to ensure and reassure data users of the nature and quality of the data they are accessing, and data directories to help data users find and access the data they&nbsp;need.</p>  Infrastructural Develop independent, neutral data logistics infrastructure that achieves the above: that enables the right data to flow to and from the right parties in the right formats at the right times. Personal data stores are an essential part of this. We would go a long way to achieving this if every individual was provided with their own personal data store, where they can collect, store and share their own data under their own&nbsp;control.  Institutional Build the institutions capable of making and enforcing the rules, safeguards, standards, processes and incentive structures relevant to the types of data in question. This is needed to ensure safe, fair, trustworthy and efficient data sharing between multiple&nbsp;parties.   A job for Government <p>The creation of MUMU-enabling data sharing infrastructure and institutions extends beyond the remit, boundaries and goals of any particular organisation. It needs Government support and facilitation. In particular, it requires the resolution of collective action dilemmas that arise from the organisation-centric structure of the current&nbsp;system.</p><p>For example, it is in the interests of every user of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">verified attributes</a> (that confirm details about an individual) that organisations holding these attributes enable them to be shared. But it may not be in the immediate interests of each particular organisation holding these attributes to enable such sharing. Result: verified attributes are not shared and all individuals and service providers that could use them lose out. Such collective action issues threaten to block progress towards the goal of increased data sharing and&nbsp;use.</p><p>Together, the reforms and developments outlined above point to the creation of a data landscape and ecosystem that is very different to what we see today. In particular they shift the focus of innovation from particular organisations’ uses of data to the structural, architectural, infrastructural and institutional innovations needed to deliver&nbsp;MUMU.</p><p>They also point to a new direction of economic growth — opening up all the opportunities for data use that OUOU systems and structures currently stifle.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">How to unleash the full potential of data?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Par où commencer ? Par le commencement tout simplement !  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Il y a des questions qui reviennent souvent, telles que : Qu’est-ce qu’un certificat confiance ? Pourquoi doit-on passer par une application pour s’authentifier ? Qu’est-ce qu’une Progressive Web App ? Comment peut-on gérer plusieurs sites à la fois et cela, sur différents environnements web avec Unikname ? Autant d’interrogations auxquelles l’équipe Unikname prendra le temps d’y répondre en live.</p>
<p>L’objectif du premier épisode de cette série de Webinars est de prendre le temps de vous expliquer le fonctionnement de la solution Unikname. L’occasion de découvrir (ou pas) les étapes à suivre pour débuter avec l’authentification nouvelle génération de Unikname, en quoi est-elle si différente des autres et surtout les briques fonctionnelles qui s’y cachent.</p>

			<p>As you may know, it’s already been possible for an investor holding a position in a T-REX security token to execute a “simple transfer” instruction to another white-listed investor: they simply need to select both the number of tokens to transfer and the counterpart’s wallet. The T-REX system then instantly performs a provision-check on their position, verifies that the counterpart is indeed whitelisted for the token considered and, upon submission and signature, the simple transfer instruction is sent to the blockchain for execution on a peer-to-peer basis.</p>
<p>However, some issuers and asset managers have confirmed to us that they need to assert more control over this type of transfer. Essentially, before the transfer is executed, they need to be able to authorize or reject the transfer between the two investors. This final “go” might be needed for various reasons, including checking pre-emption or veto rights for instance. We at Tokeny have listened to this request and are now introducing “conditional transfers” as part of our product offering.</p>
<p>An investor will initiate a conditional transfer exactly in the same way they initiate a simple transfer and the system will perform the same provision- and eligibility-checks. However, before the transfer is executed on the blockchain, an authorization request will be sent to the issuer (or his processing agent) for the transaction’s release or rejection. In case of rejection, a reason has to be provided and communicated to the investor. This is how it works:</p>

		 
	 
                      
	 
		 
			<p>It is up to the issuer of the T-REX security token to determine whether their token/s will allow for simple or conditional transfers. Investors will obviously only be able to instruct the type of transfers relevant for a specific token.</p>

<p>The documentary The Social Dilemna produced by Netflix focuses on the sordid aspects of our ultra-connected lives and it's bound to be disturbing.</p>
<p>Between the docu-reality that features a contemporary family and inlays by experts, this film dissects the workings of social networks. At a time when Whatsapp is changing its terms and conditions of use, it's always instructive to understand why... The interviewees, some of whom are still working in this field, express themselves on the current consequences of technology (interference in elections and disinformation that is growing exponentially) and draw a dark picture of the future that awaits us if we don't change our habits.</p>
<p>As is often the case in this type of documentary or docu-drama, producers do not skimp on the means to hammer their message. On the program: an anxiety-provoking soundtrack, poignant scenes and hard-hitting statistics that seem to be attributable to social networks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, apart from this debate on the real place of the Internet and social networks in the evils of our time, this film paints a very accurate picture of how technology has shaped the modern world. Here's what we need to remember about The Social Dilemna :</p>
 If it's free, you are the product 
<p>Contrary to the adage, which fortunately is now beginning to erode, free services (search engines, social networks, etc.) are not aligned with the interests of its users. The Social Dilemna, social media platforms are companies that use a three-step business model :</p>
<p>Commitment: the goal is to capture your attention in the application<br>
Who doesn't remember the former Google employee <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_how_a_handful_of_tech_companies_control_billions_of_minds_every_day">Tristan Harris</a> who became an active activist and an alarm bell about the manipulation of our minds by tech giants.</p>
<p>Growth: the goal is for you to invite your friends and family to join the application.</p>
<p>Advertising: the goal is to offer you advertising in the application.</p>
<p>For a user, these three "acts" provide a better understanding of how different platforms and applications work. Their purpose is to hold our attention as long as possible, to encourage us to invite others and to expose us to advertisements as we use them. On this last point, it is important to note that advertisers do not aim to generate immediate sales. Indeed, as explained in the documentary <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier">Jaron Lanier</a>, a pioneer of virtual reality, social networks have the ability to gradually and imperceptibly change our consumption habits.</p>
<p>Advertisers use this power to modify and predict our future actions, which amounts to influencing our behaviours.<br>
For <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff">Shoshana Zuboff</a>, PhD student and author of <a href="https://www.zulma.fr/livre-lage-du-capitalisme-de-surveillance-572196.html">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, "Internet actors speculate on the future behavior of users" as some companies do on the price of oil. We tend to focus all our attention on the management of personal information. Yet the most valuable asset for these platforms is our behavioral data.</p>
 All our online activity is "dissected" 
<p>The Social Dilemna reminds us that no action taken online goes unnoticed: the giants of the Internet know what we consult and how long we consult it. When we browse online, algorithms study our activity to find out how to capture our attention. These results then allow them to make us stay longer on the sites and applications we use. It is thanks to this that advertisers can understand each person's habits and use them to their advantage.</p>
 When a handful of people decide for us... 
<p>We then imagine that the Internet is controlled by a divine force pulling the strings... no, it is not Gods but a handful of individuals who execute, participate in increasing the number of users, in monetizing their data.</p>
<p>This documentary features Justin Rosenstein, former engineer for Google and Facebook and co-creator of the "Like" button. This initially seemingly innocuous invention, originally designed to increase commitment, is now a global symbol of recognition that, for many users, has a direct impact on their self-esteem. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rosenstein">Justin Rosenstein</a> admits that at the time they had no idea of the consequences that could ensue... It reminds me of another Tristan... Nitot, ex-Mozilla, <a href="https://cozy.io/fr/">Cozy Cloud</a> and Qwant who spoke about the dopamine generated by this famous button in <a href="https://vimeo.com/251654559">one of his famous lectures</a>.</p>
 Internet widens the gap on divisive issues 
<p>On the Internet, the current discourse reflects an increasingly divided society, especially on divisive issues. On this point, the mechanisms (or algorithms) that govern social networking platforms are being singled out. As we have seen above, these platforms seek to capture your attention for as long as possible. To do this, they use algorithms that analyze your behavior when dealing with different types of content. Thanks to the data collected, the service can then offer you new information and publications that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, the documentary The Social Dilemna takes the example of videos of conspiracy theories and the role played by social media in the rise of their crazy theories, the latest conspiracy theories around the non-re-election of Trump or the Qanon phenomenon in the United States. When a video ends, platforms such as YouTube automatically suggest new content: users are then "hypnotized" by a continuous flow of information going in the same direction. This uninterrupted cycle of suggestions is often managed by an algorithm that will not try to find out if the suggested content is true. However, some platforms, such as Twitter, have deployed fact-checking software to combat this phenomenon. When a publication is considered "dubious" by such a tool, a warning message is displayed. Unfortunately, this is sometimes not enough to stop the problem. Misleading information is everywhere on the Web, so every claim, however far-fetched, is bound to be corroborated somewhere on the Internet. The result? The result is that users on both sides of the web are increasingly distancing themselves from each other and the gap is widening.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that the search bar in browsers takes into account your usage history. For example, Google's auto-suggest feature means that if a user types "flat earth" into the search bar, the suggestions displayed will be influenced by their usage behavior, geographic location, and the data Google has collected about them.</p>
<p>Faced with this reality, some experts interviewed in The Social Dilemna are very pessimistic about future consequences, citing the possibility of civil war - the recent intrusion into the Capitol in Washington proves it.</p>
 But then what to do? 
<p>Not everything is to be thrown away with the bath water. Alternatives are emerging - the influx of Whatsapp users who have just changed their terms and conditions of use (to the benefit of its parent company Facebook) to the Signal messaging service is testimony to this collective awareness. This documentary offers advice on how to limit our addiction to social networks, twist the neck to misinformation and complicate the task of the algorithms that predict our behaviors.</p>
<p>To be less addicted to social networks, the best reflex is to deactivate your notifications, as advised by almost all the experts interviewed in this documentary.</p>
 
 
<p>Use a search engine that does not record your activity, such as <a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a>, <a href="https://www.startpage.com/fr/">StartPage</a>...</p>
 
 
<p>Remove the Chrome extensions (which follow your behavior) and prefer the Firefox browser to Google's browser.</p>
 
 
<p>Do not click on recommended videos and click traps. #Resist</p>
 
 
<p>Cross-check the information of an article before sharing it and verify the reliability of its source.</p>
 
 
<p>Limit the amount of time spent on the screens each day (for adults and children alike).</p>
 
 
<p>Put your phone at the entrance of the house in silent mode (when you have finished your work day), unplug it during the night . Until about 15 years ago, we lived without social networks, without solicitations... So it's possible!</p>
 
 
<p>Choose tools that respect your privacy (<a href="https://blog.cozy.io/fr/je-change-mes-habitudes-numeriques-avec-cozy-cloud/">Cozy Cloud is one of them but we are not alone</a> and learn how to better control your data.</p>
 
 
<p>Of course, the ideal would be to delete all its social networks and other thieving applications of our time but let's go like Kaizen and its method of small steps. A habit sets in after 21 days and it's hard to get rid of the convenience offered by these "tools", especially at a time when telecommuting and the fall of the much-lamented "social relationship" is so common.</p>
 It's all about security 
<p>Start watching this documentary (on Netflix, to top it all off!) and listen and/or read other content that is just as rich in information and pedagogy, because the key word is digital education and its excesses.</p>

<p>Dock has decided to extend the token migration until midnight (GMT) on the 31st of March 2021. We are extending the migration window by around 3 weeks to ensure those who haven’t migrated yet have sufficient time to do so. For those who are migrating directly, you can continue to use the Dock <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/token-migration">migration portal</a> and accompanying <a href="https://docs.dock.io/token-migration/migration-tutorial/migration-tutorial">migration tutorial</a>. As we’ll discuss in the next section, Binance will also assist their users with the migration prior to the 31st of March. </p><p>Exchanges</p><p>Current exchanges supporting the newer mainnet token are <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/exchange/dock_btc">Huobi</a>, <a href="https://trade.kucoin.com/DOCK-BTC">Kucoin</a> and <a href="https://www.gate.io/trade/DOCK_USDT">Gate.io</a>. Binance has already <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/758e3d56c5f747fdbf5eeebfd509dc54">confirmed their support</a> and that they will be supporting the mainnet token prior to the migration window closing. Those with DOCK ERC20 tokens currently on Binance can leave them on the exchange at their choosing and they will be migrated by Binance on your behalf. Binance will confirm specific timings in the coming weeks. </p><p>Moving forward </p><p>Those who have been following Dock will know that the Dock mainnet token represents a key part of the network and already provides utility. It acts as an integrated payment mechanism for performing network operations, a way to reward validators who provide their resources to the network by producing blocks and confirming transactions, and as a voting mechanism within Dock’s <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-future-in-decentralized-governance/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=Token_Migration_Extension">decentralized governance</a>. </p><p>As outlined in our recent <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-2021-roadmap/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=Token_Migration_Extension">roadmap post</a>, Q2 2021 (between April and June) will see Dock transition to Proof of Stake and with that we’ll provide the community with one of our most requested features, <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">staking</a>. We’ll also be building a new Dock wallet during the course of this year with our v0.1 release planned for Q3. This will not only facilitate the storage and transacting in DOCK tokens, but it will also be a place to store W3C-compliant verifiable credentials. </p><p>Stay safe out there</p><p>Although we are nearing the end of the migration process it is still important that we all remain vigilant and keep our crypto safe. Extraordinary events like a token migration can represent an opportunity for scammers to part you from your tokens if you don’t take care.
