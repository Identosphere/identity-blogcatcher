<p>Hybrid cloud has become the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure">IT infrastructure</a> of choice, providing the interoperability and portability organizations need to access data where and when they need it. Yet navigating the complexities of building and managing a hybrid environment poses unique challenges. To capture the most value from hybrid cloud, business and IT leaders must develop a solid hybrid cloud strategy supporting their core business objectives.&nbsp;</p>



 Hybrid cloud architecture 



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> computing environment combines and unifies <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/public-cloud">public cloud</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/private-cloud">private cloud</a> and on-premises infrastructure to create a single, flexible IT infrastructure:&nbsp;</p>



 
 On-premises infrastructure&nbsp;(also referred to as “on-prem”) is a traditional form of computing infrastructure that includes on-premises <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers"></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> and computing resources that a business owns and operates at its own physical location. 



 Public cloud infrastructure&nbsp;is a&nbsp;type of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> where a third-party cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Services, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure) makes computing resources—like ready-to-use software applications, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a>, enterprise-grade infrastructures and development platforms—available to users over the public internet. 



 Private cloud infrastructure&nbsp;is a dedicated cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third party.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Modern hybrid cloud environments also include orchestration and management tools. These software applications integrate off-premises and cloud-based environments to deliver unified cloud deployment and management capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud computing services and management products fall into three primary categories:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</a>&nbsp;offers applications hosted on a cloud server and distributed to end-users over the public internet. Common SaaS product examples include Zoom (for video conferencing) and Google Drive (for file management). 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas#:~:text=Infrastructure-as-a-Service">Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)</a> offers consumers fundamental compute, network and storage resources on demand. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas">Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</a>&nbsp;offers complete hybrid cloud platform capabilities for developing, running and managing applications. 
 



 The hybrid multicloud model 



<p>Today most enterprise businesses rely on a hybrid multicloud environment.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">Multicloud</a>&nbsp;is a cloud computing solution that combines public cloud services from more than one cloud vendor and is portable across multiple cloud providers’ cloud infrastructures. A hybrid multicloud approach creates greater flexibility and reduces an organization’s dependency on one vendor, therefore preventing vendor lock-in.</p>



<p>Hybrid multiclouds are typically built on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/open-source">open-source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">cloud-native</a>&nbsp;technologies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>. Also known as “k8s” or “kube,” Kubernetes is a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">container orchestration</a> platform for scheduling and automating the deployment, management and scaling of containerized applications. Hybrid multicloud cloud environments also include tools for managing workloads across multiple environments. These include single consoles or dashboards that help create a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/single-pane-of-glass">single pane of glass (SPOG)</a> so teams can easily view and control resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A hybrid multicloud environment supports <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices (or microservices architecture)</a>, the cloud-native architectural approach in which a single application comprises many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components or services. Microservices enable faster development and deployment of software because each service can be developed and deployed separately. For instance, a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> team can quickly scale or extend an application’s functionality by adding new microservices without having to add a line of code or affecting other aspects of the application. Examples of industries that have switched from monolithic architecture to microservices include subscription-based streaming services like Netflix, which uses microservices to track user activities, their history and other data to make real-time recommendations for enhanced engagement and better customer experiences.</p>



 Building a successful hybrid cloud strategy&nbsp; 



<p>Every organization must contend with its own infrastructure, distinct workloads, business processes and workflow needs. To that end, developing a hybrid cloud strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach but must be tailored to meet individual business needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To map out a successful hybrid cloud strategy, here are a few critical steps:</p>



 1. Create a vision 



<p>The initial phase of a hybrid cloud strategy should center on defining a clear and compelling hybrid cloud vision plan that reflects both immediate and long-term business goals. For instance, organizations can capitalize on a hybrid cloud environment to improve customer experience, comply with regulations, optimize costs, enhance data security and more.</p>



<p>Start by carefully analyzing your existing systems, applications and workforce skills. Identify the current and emerging business and technology challenges that a hybrid cloud approach could address and allow you to achieve digital transformation without significant disruption or downtime. Does your company need services to accelerate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration#:">cloud migration</a>? Or are you looking to accelerate business transformation by leveraging cloud-native technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers">containers</a> and microservices to optimize and modernize your workloads?</p>



 2. Outline business use cases 



<p>A well-defined hybrid cloud strategy should clearly articulate potential business use cases that would bring overall benefits to your organization. Many enterprise businesses use a hybrid cloud approach for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/backup-disaster-recovery">backup and disaster recovery</a>, which involves periodically creating or updating one more copies of files, storing them in one or more remote locations, and using the copies to continue or resume business operations in the case or of data corruption, cyberattack or natural disaster.</p>



<p>Hybrid cloud-based backup and disaster recovery solutions can support both on-premises and cloud-based production environments. For instance, hospitals and health systems used to store all of their business and medical records on-premises. In response to rapid data growth, healthcare entities have turned to hybrid cloud as an effective way to better help store and secure data in a private cloud. Additionally, healthcare&nbsp;and medical providers now governed by <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">HIPAA</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) regulations must retain redundant business and medical records. A hybrid cloud setting is ideal for extensive cloud storage and cloud backup, as both capabilities ensure business continuity and data recovery (BCDR) to protect sensitive data in the event of a disaster. </p>



<p>Another potential use case to consider when mapping out a hybrid cloud strategy is cloud bursting, a configuration between a private cloud and public cloud that uses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/load-balancing">load balancing</a>. This technique is used to redirect traffic overflow when spikes in demand require more computing power, thus eliminating the need for over-provisioning. Online retailers, for example, can use cloud bursting during peak holiday shopping seasons by shifting necessary workloads to public cloud infrastructure where processing demands won’t exceed capacity.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Determine cloud migration needs 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration">Cloud migration</a> has become a pivotal business imperative for streamlining IT operations, implementing cost-saving measures and accelerating overall digital transformation. To create a successful cloud migration, organizations should create a workflow that includes comprehensive planning, execution and optimization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While each company’s exact cloud migration approach is different based on their business and technology needs, several migration strategies can help streamline the process. These strategies&nbsp;include “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/lift-and-shift">lift-and-shift</a>” (the process of migrating an exact copy of an application or workload from on-premises to public or private cloud), refactoring (modifying an application by leveraging cloud-native capabilities) or rebuilding new applications to re-architect as needed.</p>



 4. Assess workloads 



<p>In cloud computing, a workload refers to any service, application or capability that consumes cloud resources (e.g., virtual machines, databases, applications, microservices and nodes). A hybrid cloud strategy includes assessing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workload">workloads</a> and determining where you want to locate them in a hybrid cloud environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Workloads involving web content, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/big-data-analytics">big data analytics</a> and AI are ideal for a hybrid cloud infrastructure. For instance, hybrid cloud can help accelerate <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> for customer service. By supporting access to high-performance computing resources&nbsp;needed to support large volumes of customer data, hybrid cloud enables technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-agent">virtual agents</a> to deliver personalized answers and recommendations and offer tailored suggestions and solutions to enhance the customer experience.</p>



 5. Choose the best cloud service partners 



<p>Translate your vision into an action plan by carefully choosing the right cloud service providers. Your hybrid cloud provider should help you bridge private and public infrastructures by supporting technology you may already have in place, such as virtualized machines, to create minimal downtime and limit costs.</p>



<p>By choosing a unified hybrid cloud platform approach, your organization can harness a full range of services. Choose a hybrid cloud management platform that can run on any cloud and an orchestration tool that spans clouds to support workloads that can be deployed seamlessly across a multicloud environment for optimal business and operational performance. Then align your multicloud ecosystem partnerships under one strategy to bring together the best cloud services and technologies.</p>



 6. Evaluate overall costs 



<p>Bear in mind that cloud service providers offer different pricing models and service levels to help you align cloud IT resources and costs with application needs and business value. These pricing models include a range of service costs—including cloud storage costs, platform costs, server costs and software maintenance costs—that are often complicated and need to be evaluated carefully. For instance, some public cloud providers charge extra for data egress (e.g., removing data from the cloud), which makes the act of switching cloud providers more expensive.</p>



<p>Cloud service provider costs can climb higher than anticipated, especially with multiple vendors involved, which is why monitoring&nbsp;cloud spend is critical. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-cloud-cost-optimization/">Cloud cost-optimization</a> software tools can help monitor workload demands for maximum cost-efficient performance.</p>



 7. Weave in robust security 



<p>The IT industry has traditionally relied mainly on perimeter security strategies like firewalls to protect valuable resources, such as user data and intellectual property. A hybrid multicloud infrastructure where resources are distributed throughout multiple IT environments with many endpoints (including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">IoT</a> devices and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">edge</a> environments) with varying levels of visibility and control calls for an end-to-end&nbsp;holistic security approach. Organizations need to implement a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/zero-trust">zero-trust</a> framework where data must also be <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">encrypted</a> to ensure only valid users can access it.</p>



<p>Overall, your hybrid cloud strategy must include&nbsp;a unified security program that steers business initiatives, optimizes security resources and transforms operating culture to be security first. Today, hybrid cloud security platforms combine <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> to ingest high volumes of complex security data, enabling near-real-time threat detection and prediction.</p>



 8. Consider compliance and regulatory standards 



<p>Building a hybrid cloud strategy includes incorporating the regulatory environment specific to your industry. For instance, companies that must adhere to <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> compliance can specify locations where data is not permitted to reside, whether in a public or private cloud, and tailor data migration and protection rules accordingly. The beauty of a hybrid cloud environment is that it offers organizations the agility to keep up with the ever-evolving regulations that alter rules governing the use and storage of personal data.</p>



 Key hybrid cloud benefits 



<p>A hybrid cloud approach helps businesses achieve significant benefits, including the following:</p>



 
 Scalability:&nbsp;Use public cloud compute and cloud storage resources to scale up quickly, automatically and cost-effectively. 



 Business acceleration: Harness the latest cloud technologies, such as generative AI&nbsp;and&nbsp;machine learning, to gain a competitive edge. 



 Developer productivity: Enable DevOps and other teams to collaborate with greater agility and velocity. 



 Infrastructure efficiency:&nbsp;Carry out mission-critical digital transformation initiatives like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">application modernization</a> (i.e., shifting legacy apps to the cloud). 



 Risk and compliance management: Draw on the latest cloud-based security and regulatory technology tools to ensure&nbsp;data protection. 



 Long-term strategic flexibility: Meet ever-changing market demands and integrate new cloud-based technologies with ease as they emerge.

 In November 2022, the European Banking Authority issued its guidelines for the use of remote entry solutions in the banking and financial sector. High-level or substantial identification schemes and qualified electronic signature solutions took the spotlight. So what’s the difference between these two solutions? How do you choose? PVID vs QES: Which solutions are best for banking and financial relationships? 



 A changing regulatory environment: an overview. 



 The six requirements of the Monetary and Financial Code. 



<p>Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) sets out six means of customer identification, to ensure that the customer enters into a remote relationship in complete confidence. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking establishment</a> must apply at least two of these measures (generally number 1 plus another complementary measure) in order to comply with local <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">anti-money laundering directives</a>.</p>



 







 European Banking Association recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Since October 2, 2023, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2022/EBA-GL-2022-15%20GL%20on%20remote%20customer%20onboarding/1043884/Guidelines%20on%20the%20use%20of%20Remote%20Customer%20Onboarding%20Solutions.pdf">European Banking Association (EBA) has been recommending the use of solutions</a> such as qualified electronic signatures and substantial or high-level identification schemes, such as PVID, in order to strengthen the fight against fraud when entering into a relationship.</p>



 The position of the AMF and ACPR in France.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In line with the EBA’s recommendations, the authorities that regulate the French financial market, Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) and L’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de (ACPR), point out the vulnerabilities notably linked to the first installment in the fight against fraud. However, this third measure remains compliant, and is often perceived as less burdensome in terms of user experience, and simpler for regulated institutions to implement, than the measures outlined by the EBA.</p>



 Focus on complementary entry methods. 



<p>Following the EBA’s recommendations, solutions such as qualified electronic signatures and substantial or high-level identification schemes like PVID are favored by regulators when it comes to guaranteeing a more secure entry into the relationship. But what exactly does this mean? Let’s take a closer look.</p>



 Qualified electronic signature.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> offers the highest level of security and guarantee of all electronic signatures. It reliably identifies the signatory and protects it against falsification or alteration. It uses a qualified certificate issued by a certified supplier and it is a particularly robust solution from an anti-fraud point-of-view, and inclusive from a user experience point-of-view.</p>



<p>How does the solution work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The user takes a picture of his or her identity document&nbsp;  The user’s face is then captured on video&nbsp;&nbsp;  Finally, the user signs his or her contract electronically  



 







 PVID certified by ANSSI.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In March 2021, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">ANSSI issued a set of requirements for Remote Identity Verification Service Providers (PVID)</a>. The aim of this certification is to create a uniform, trusted service offering for identity verification providers. This solution is built for security, and is designed to limit identity fraud and advanced forgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does the solution work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The user takes a video capture of his or her document and face.&nbsp;  These captures are then automatically and manually verified by an agent specialized in document and identity fraud.&nbsp;  A file of evidence is built up, and a verdict is reached on the authenticity of these captures and on the identity of the person concerned.  



 







<blockquote><p>Financial operators need to strike the right balance between having a system that filters out as many fraud attempts as possible, while letting legitimate customers through.</p>Baptiste Forestier – Head of Compliance &amp; DPO at Hero</blockquote>



 The choice of solution: PVID vs QES. 



<p>To strike the right balance, both PVID and Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) offer substantial advantages, as mentioned above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-certification-interview/">IDnow is one of the few certified providers</a> of both electronic signature and identity verification solutions who can help you achieve compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our qualified e-signature solution boasts broad geographical coverage and an easy-to-use workflow, while meeting the main needs of today’s financial players: compliance, fraud prevention and an optimized customer experience.</p>

 Steps for building a successful AI strategy 



<p>The following steps are commonly used to help craft an effective artificial intelligence strategy:</p>



 Explore the technology 



<p>Gain an understanding of various AI technologies, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">generative AI</a>, machine learning (ML), natural language processing, computer vision, etc. Research AI use cases to know where and how these technologies are being applied in relevant industries. List issues AI can address and the benefits to be gained. Note the departments that use it, their methods and any roadblocks.</p>



 Assess and discover 



<p>Understand the organization, its priorities and capabilities. Review the size and strength of the IT department, which will implement and manage AI systems. Interview department heads to identify potential issues AI could help solve.</p>



 Define clear objectives 



<p>What problems does the organization need to solve? What metrics need to be improved? Don’t assume AI is always the answer, choose business objectives that are important for the business and that AI has a track record of addressing successfully.</p>



 Identify potential partners and vendors 



<p>Find companies in the AI and ML space that have worked within your industry. Create a list of potential tools, vendors and partnerships, evaluating their experience, reputation, pricing, etc. Prioritize procurement based on the phases and timeline of the AI integration project.</p>



 Build a roadmap 



<p>Create a roadmap that prioritizes early successes that will bring value to the business. Choose projects based on identified practical needs. Determine the tools and support needed and organize them based on what’s most crucial for the project, specifically:</p>



 
 Data: Make a data strategy by determining if new or existing data or datasets will be required to effectively fuel the AI solution. Establish a data governance framework to manage data effectively. 
 



 
 Algorithms:&nbsp;Algorithms are the rules or instructions that enable machines to learn, analyze data and make decisions. A model represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm. Determine who will deploy algorithms and design, develop and validate models, as expertise is needed to effectively manage these tasks.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Infrastructure: Determine where your AI systems will be hosted and how they will be scaled. Consider whether to deploy on your own infrastructure or on third-party platforms. 
 



 
 Talent and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-process-outsourcing">outsourcing</a>: Assess the readiness of and skills gaps within the organization to implement AI initiatives. Determine if a talent pipeline exists to fill roles such as data scientists and developers or if skills can be developed internally through training. Also assess if certain tasks, such as deployment and operations, should be outsourced. 
 



 Present the AI strategy 



<p>Present the AI strategy to stakeholders, ensuring it aligns with business objectives. Attain buy-in for the proposed roadmap. Clearly communicate the benefits, costs and expected results. Secure the necessary budget to implement the strategy.</p>



 Begin training and encourage learning 



<p>Start upskilling ai teams or hiring individuals with the right AI expertise. Encourage teams to stay updated on the cutting-edge AI advancements and to explore innovative problem-solving methods.</p>



 Establish ethical guidelines 



<p>Understand the ethical implications of the organization’s responsible use of AI. Commit to ethical AI initiatives, inclusive governance models and actionable guidelines. Regularly monitor AI models for potential biases and implement fairness and transparency practices to address ethical concerns.</p>



 Assess and adapt 



<p>Keep up with the fast-paced developments of new products and AI technologies. Adapt the organization’s AI strategy based on new insights and emerging opportunities.</p>



<p>Following these steps will enable the creation of a powerful guide for integrating AI into the organization. This will allow the business to take better advantage of opportunities in the dynamic world of artificial intelligence.</p>



 







 



 Common roadblocks to building a successful AI strategy 



<p>Several issues can get in the way of building and implementing a successful AI strategy. Their potential to impede the process should be assessed early—and issues dealt with accordingly—to effectively move forward.</p>



 Insufficient data 



<p>How and where is your data, really? AI models rely heavily on robust datasets, so insufficient access to relevant and high-quality data can undermine the strategy and the effectiveness of AI applications.</p>



 Lack of AI knowledge 



<p>A lack of awareness about AI’s capabilities and potential applications may lead to skepticism, resistance or misinformed decision-making. This will drain any value from the strategy and block the successful integration of AI into the organization’s processes.</p>



 Misalignment of strategy 



<p>If the AI initiatives are not closely tied to the organization’s goals, priorities, and vision, it may result in wasted efforts, lack of support from leadership and an inability to demonstrate meaningful value.</p>



 Scarcity of talent 



<p>Professionals are needed to effectively develop, implement and manage AI initiatives. A shortage of AI talent, such as data scientists or ML experts, or resistance from current employees to upskill, could impact the viability of the strategy.</p>



 AI strategy and IBM 



<p>Recent developments within artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated the scale and power of this technology on business and society.

<p>Have you been reading about digitally verifiable credentials and wanted to know more about them? Are you interested in digitally verifiable credentials but do not know how to get started? Well, then, you are at the right place – this blog post is all about getting started with verifiable credentials and seeing how they change how credentialing is done.</p>



<p>Credentialing is a simple enough workflow we all understand – an organisation issues the credentials to a recipient. In turn, the recipient can present, share or exchange the credentials to seek new opportunities, services and other things. Today, along with printed credentials, there are digital credentials as well – these are often in PDF and can be easily stored and exchanged. Verifiable credentials improve this workflow – they are secure, tamper-evident data representations that help anyone verify the credentials’ issuer and authenticity.</p>



<p>MARK Studio from Dhiway is a credential lifecycle management platform which empowers issuers to design, issue and manage verifiable documents as blockchain-anchored credentials. Including the blockchain as a system of record leads to immutable records, and thus these are tamper-evident. With MARK Studio, anyone can create certificates online and quickly issue them through well-thought-out steps. Transitioning from traditional print-ready credentialing flows to blockchain credentials could be daunting. So, MARK Studio has a Free plan to try out the workflows before committing to adoption. You can sign up to <a href="https://studio.dhiway.com/auth/register">FREE PLAN</a> and get started. The videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dhiwaynetworks">YouTube channel</a> can help you build and issue your first verifiable credential.</p>



<p>MARK Studio comes “batteries included” with over 60 templates and designs to choose from when creating Learning and Education Records (LERs), Skilling and Knowledge Records and Workplace Experience Records. Starting the credentialing journey with MARK Studio ensures that while you get a feel for verifiable credentials, you look at all kinds of records and data that need provenance – and you are soon on your way to verifiable documents. The verifiable documents issued on MARK Studio help reduce the risk of data abuse and thus add value to your data governance strategies. With secure blockchain-anchored credentials now readily available, you can even look at needs such as temporary passes, event passes and IDs to be designed and issued on MARK Studio.</p>



<p>Verifiable credentials on the CORD network blockchain enable recipients to request, receive, store and exchange a whole set of documents they collect as a learner and in their professional roles. The ease of machine verification, data security and integrity, and combining various sets of credentials into a need-based verifiable document (a “digital resume”) makes it a compelling proposition for all key stakeholders – the issuer, the verifier and the recipient. Today, many organisations are switching to blockchain-anchored verifiable credentials with MARK Studio – sign up and try it out for yourself.</p>

<p>Identity and access management (IAM) is a crucial security component and a business enabler for the modern enterprise — but it’s clear that current systems are falling short on both fronts. Enterprises remain rife with legacy systems, technology silos, and manual and disconnected processes that were never intended to cope with today’s complex identity environment. New threat vectors, often aided by generative AI, exploit the gaps in this patchwork of systems, with increasingly alarming consequences.</p>  
<p>A robust identity security strategy requires the consolidation of a broad set of identity assurance capabilities into a unified approach. A new position paper by industry analyst Simon Moffat of the Cyber Hut explores the current state of IAM security and proposes guidelines for organizations to build a comprehensive Identity Assurance approach that can tackle these challenges.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Key Findings  
 Enterprises Face Multiple Operational and Identity Security Challenges  
<p>The current technological landscape has become increasingly complex, characterized by hybrid deployments, fragmented technology silos, and inadequate visibility and metrics. Employee onboarding and credential management processes remain manual and disjointed, creating friction and security gaps. The rising volume and variety of remote work and people supply chains puts further strain on systems and business.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Outdated Authentication and Identity Verification Processes Prevalent  
<p>Authentication stands out as a critical pinch point in user interactions, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Many organizations employ multiple MFA solutions without a clear pathway to consolidation or adoption of phishing-resistant passwordless authentication.</p> 
<p>Moreover, the lack of coherence and continuity in identity verification and validation processes severely impacts business and security, leading to issues such as cumbersome employee verification, fraud, credential theft, account takeover, and data breaches.</p> 
 The Need for Converged Identity Assurance  
<p>A comprehensive <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> strategy involves viewing authentication in stages of maturity, moving from siloed and coarse-grained methods to relying on an assured identity that is continually verified. The goal is to reduce fragmentation and trust boundaries, and overlay existing authentication with verified identities on an ongoing basis.</p> 
<p>By embracing a converged Identity Assurance approach, organizations improve identity security, accelerate adoption of Zero Trust principles, improve IAM productivity, and reduce their compliance exposure.</p>

 What happened? 
<p>On December 16th Truffle Security disclosed a <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of/">Google OAuth vulnerability</a> that allows employees, even after leaving a company, to retain access to applications like Slack and Zoom. The vulnerability arises from the ability to create Google accounts where the email address has the domain of the corporate organization but does not actually belong to that organization. This poses a risk to organizations, service providers like Zoom and Slack, and Google itself.</p>
 How does it work? 
<p>1. First, the user must have an account in your corporate Google workspace, such as <a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a></p>
<p>2. Then the user creates a new personal Google account, using their existing email, but they add “+something” to the user name part of the email, eg. <a href="mailto:user+something@example.com">user+something@example.com</a>. Because Google will essentially ignore anything after the + in an email address, the user will be able to receive all the verification emails in their corporate inbox. (They need to do this in advance of leaving the organization.)</p>
<p>User must click “Use your existing email” and use the alias user+something@example.com</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Now the user can use this google account to sign into 3rd party apps under the corporate domain. This is possible because many of these 3rd party apps only verify that the domain part of the email used when logging into the account is a known corporate account. (<a href="mailto:user+something@example.com">user+something@example.com</a> ⇒ domain = <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a>)</p>
<p></p>
 Was YeshID Affected? 
<p>No, users attempting to use this technique to log into YeshID would not be successful.</p>
 Recommendations 
 Detection 
 
 If your organization has tools to perform an email search (such as the Security Center Investigation Tool in Google Workspace), look for emails sent to addresses containing your domain and a “+” symbol to detect these shadow account creations. 
 Review the user lists in the applications your organization uses to look for accounts with email addresses containing a “+” symbol to detect users who may have exploited this vulnerability. 
 
 Prevention 
 
 If your organization uses applications that allow any user to sign in as long as they are from your domain, consider disabling that feature. For example, in Slack: <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115004856503-Manage-how-people-join-your-workspace">https://slack.com/help/articles/115004856503-Manage-how-people-join-your-workspace</a> 
 Switch the application to use SAML for SSO if possible 
 
<p>Regular auditing of your user environment is important and YeshID can help. Out-of-domain accounts are visible through our <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/yeshid-integrations-an-easier-way-to-manage-app-access-for-smbs/">integration functionality</a>.

<p>How is consumer-permissioned data driving the digital evolution in lending? In this video, Mastercard’s Executive Vice President, Open Banking, North America Markets Andy Sheehan and Tearsheet’s Zach Miller get into the details of Mastercard’s lending priorities: inclusion, transparency and security. What do they look like in practice?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two discuss Mastercard’s strategy and role in the open banking space, and how Mastercard is building out a new network of consumer-permissioned data as a trusted source for consumers and small businesses. This network works alongside traditional payment networks and identity networks, so that consumers can put their information to work across the ecosystem, accessing the tools to enhance their financial lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sheehan breaks down how Mastercard is leading the industry in creating next-generation API connections to financial institutions and overlaying its open banking network with Mastercard’s unique capability mix.&nbsp;</p>

				  Remove the need to set up and manage your own mediator so you can focus on helping your customers benefit from verifiable data and identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio Proven® provides customers with powerful, scalable communication features that allow them to cryptographically authenticate the parties in any interaction before data is shared.</p>
<p>This secure, bidirectional communication between people and organizations using mobile devices is made possible by a mediator. It’s like a post office for a decentralized ecosystem: every message goes to the mediator, which is then able to find individual end users to create a secure connection and deliver the message. Mediation drives decentralized communication — and in a privacy-preserving way too, as the “Post Office” can’t open the messages, even if it wanted to.</p>
<p>With a hosted mediator in Indicio Proven®, customers can choose to let Indicio run the Post Office, which makes deploying a verifiable data solution faster, scaling it easier, and managing it simpler.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that while we say “message,” we are not confined to simple texts or written messages. How you use this secure connection is largely limited by your imagination. Among the use cases Indicio has helped facilitate are offering proof of funds for financial transactions, sharing proof of membership for an organization or rewards program, and sharing proof of age for purchasing goods, without actually sharing birthdate or other personal information.</p>
<p>Historically, Indicio has helped customers set up their own mediator for management by their internal teams. Due to customer feedback, Indicio Proven® now provides this feature as a professionally-managed service. This makes Indicio Proven an even simpler and more powerful way to implement decentralized identity technology, enhancing scalability, ensuring uptime, and freeing users to focus on delivering transformative verifiable data solutions to their customers.</p>
<p>Whether your mediator is hosted and managed by your team or Indicio, the messages it delivers are private by design. Each message is encrypted to the end recipient, and is not visible to the mediator.</p>
<p>Who its for</p>
<p>This mediator service is for customers that just want to “set and forget” their decentralized identity solution. Indicio will handle the day-to-day management of any mediation your solution requires and ensure the mediator has the latest updates.</p>
<p>Why use Indicio’s mediator services</p>
<p>Professionally managed: Indicio has years of experience in the decentralized identity field and boasts a 99.97% uptime on our network. You won’t need to worry about the day-to-day specifics of mediation, but should any problems come to your attention you will have a direct line to a team that leads the development of the technology.</p>
<p>Built for scale: The new mediator service has been tested with up to fifty thousand simultaneous connections per customer, and our team can easily scale it to as many connections as you need.</p>
<p>Live message delivery: Often mediators will only allow for a momentary connection to an end user to deliver a message and then sever that connection. Indicio’s mediator service allows for users to stay connected to your service for a set amount of time, resulting in receiving messages faster and a better customer experience.</p>
<p>How to get started</p>
<p>Our team prides itself on setting our customers up for success. We have found a <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">quick consultation with our team</a> to align on goals for your solution to be the most effective way to learn more about Indicio Proven® and how you can best use the Hosted Mediator Service.</p>

<p>Many enterprises struggle to derive real value from their cloud journeys and may continue to overspend. Multiple <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/404314/94-of-enterprises-are-overspending-in-the-cloud-report.html">analysts</a> have reported that over 90% of enterprises continue to overspend in cloud, often without realising substantial returns.</p>



<p>The true essence of value emerges when business and IT can collaborate to create new capabilities at a high speed, resulting in greater developer productivity and speed to market. Those objectives require a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/tenets-of-it-modernization-for-business-agility-speed-and-productivity/">target operating model</a>. Rapidly deploying applications to cloud requires not just development acceleration with continuous integration, deployment and testing (CI/CD/CT), It also requires supply chain lifecycle acceleration, which involves multiple other groups such as governance risk and compliance (GRC), change management, operations, resiliency and reliability. Enterprises are continuously looking for ways that empower product teams to move from concept to deploy faster than ever.</p>



 Automation-first and DevSecOps-led approach 



<p>Enterprises often retrofit cloud transformation elements within existing application supply chain processes rather than considering new lifecycle and delivery models that are suited for speed and scale. The enterprises that reimagine the application lifecycle through an automation-first approach encourage an engineering-driven product lifecycle acceleration that realizes the potential of cloud transformation. Examples include:</p>



 
 Pattern-based architecture that standardizes the architecture and design process (while teams have the autonomy to choose patterns and technology or co-create new patterns). 



 Patterns that address security and compliance dimensions, ensuring traceability to these requirements. 



 Patterns-as-code that help codify multiple cross-cutting concerns (this also promotes the inner source model of patterns maturity and drive reusability). 



 DevOps pipeline-driven activities that can be utilized across the lifecycle. 



 Automatic generation of specific data needed for security and compliance reviews. 



 Operational-readiness reviews with limited or no manual intervention. 
 



<p>As enterprises embrace cloud native and everything as code, the journey from code to production has become a critical aspect of delivering value to customers. This intricate process, often referred to as the “pathway to deploy,” encompasses a series of intricate steps and decisions that can significantly impact an organization’s ability to deliver software efficiently, reliably and at scale. From architecture, design, code development,&nbsp;testing to deployment and monitoring, each stage in the pathway to deploy presents unique challenges and opportunities. As you navigate the complexities that exists today, IBM® aims to help you uncover the strategies and target state mode for achieving a seamless and effective pathway to deploy.</p>



<p>The best practices, tools, and methodologies that empower organizations to streamline their software delivery pipelines, reduce time-to-market, enhance software quality, and ensure robust operations in production environments will all be explored.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/blog/accelerate-release-lifecycle-with-pathway-to-deploy-part-2">The second post in this series</a> provides a maturity model and building blocks to help enterprises accelerate their software supply chain lifecycle in the ever-evolving landscape of enterprise cloud-native software development.</p>



 Pathway to deploy: Current view and challenges 



<p>The diagram below summarizes a view of enterprise software development life cycle (SDLC) with typical gates. While the flow is self-explanatory, the key is to understand that there are several aspects of the software supply chain process that make this a combination of waterfall and intermittent agile models. The challenge is that the timeline for build-deploy of an application (or an iteration of that) is impacted by several first- and last -mile activities that typically remain manual.</p>







<p>The key challenges with the traditional nature of SDLC are:</p>



 
 Pre-development wait time of 4-8 weeks within architecture and design phase to get to development. This is caused by:
 
 Multiple first-mile reviews to ensure no adverse business impacts, including privacy concerns, data classification, business continuity and regulatory compliance (and most of these are manual). 



 Enterprise-wide SDLC processes that remain waterfall or semi-agile, requiring sequential execution, despite agile principles in development cycles (for example, environment provisioning only after full design approval). 



 Applications that are perceived as “unique” are subject to deep scrutiny and interventions with limited opportunities for acceleration. 



 Challenges in institutionalizing patterns-based architecture and development due to lack of cohesive effort and change agent driving, such standardization. 



 A security culture that affects the speed of development, with adherence to security controls and guidelines often involving manual or semi-manual processes. 
 
 



 Development wait time to provision environment and CI/CD/CT tooling integration due to:  Manual or semi-automated environment provisioning.    Patterns (on paper) only as prescriptive guidance.  
 
 Fragmented DevOps tooling that requires effort to stitch together. 
 
 



 Post-development (last-mile) wait time before go-live is easily 6–8 weeks or more due to:  Manual evidence collection to get through security and compliance reviews beyond standard SAST/SCA/DAST (such as security configuration, day 2 controls, tagging and more).   
 
 Manual evidence collection for operation and resiliency reviews (such as supporting cloud operations and business continuity). 



 Service transition reviews to support IT service and incident management and resolution. 
 
 
 



 Pathway to deploy: Target state 



<p>The pathway to deploy target state requires a streamlined and efficient process that minimizes bottlenecks and accelerates software supply chain transformation. In this ideal state, the pathway to deploy is characterized by a seamless integration of design (first mile), as well as development, testing, platform engineering and deployment stages (last mile), following agile and DevOps principles. This helps accelerate deployment of code changes swiftly and automatically with necessary (automation-driven) validations to production environments.</p>



<p>IBM’s vision of target state prioritizes security and compliance by integrating security checks and compliance validation into the CI/CD/CT pipeline, allowing for early detection and resolution of vulnerabilities. This vision emphasizes collaboration between development, operations, reliability and security teams through a shared responsibility model. It also establishes continuous monitoring and feedback loops to gather insights for further improvement. Ultimately, the target state aims to deliver software updates and new features to end users rapidly, with minimal manual intervention and with a high degree of confidence for all enterprise stakeholders.</p>



<p>The diagram below depicts a potential target view of pathway to deploy that helps embrace the cloud-native SDLC model.</p>







<p>Key elements of the cloud-native SDLC model include:</p>



 
 Pattern-driven architecture and design institutionalized across the enterprise. 



 Patterns that incorporate key requirements of security, compliance, resiliency and other enterprise policies (as code). 



 Security and compliance reviews that are accelerated as patterns and used to describe the solution. 



 Core development, including the creation of environments, pipelines and services configuration (which is driven through platform engineering enterprise catalog). 



 CI/CD/CT pipeline that builds linkages to all activities across pathway to deploy lifecycle. 



 Platform engineering builds-configures-manages platforms and services with all enterprise policies (such as encryption) embedded as platform policies. 



 Security and compliance tooling (for example, vulnerability scans or policy checks) and automation that is integrated to the pipelines or available as self-service. 



 Generation of a high degree of data (from logs, tool outputs and code scan insights) for several reviews without manual intervention. 



 Traceability from backlog to deployment release notes and change impact. 



 Interventions only by exceptions. 
 



 Pathway to deploy drives acceleration through clarity, accountability and traceability 



<p>By defining a structured pathway to deploy, organizations can standardize the steps involved in supply chain lifecycle, ensuring each phase is traceable and auditable. This allows stakeholders to monitor progress through distinct stages, from initial design to deployment, providing real-time visibility into the program’s status. Assigning ownership at each stage of the pathway to deploy ensures that team members are accountable for their deliverables, making it easier to track contributions and changes, as well as accelerating issue resolution with the right level of intervention. Traceability through the pathway to deploy provides data-driven insights, helping to refine processes and enhance efficiency in future programs. A well-documented pathway to deploy supports compliance with industry regulations and simplifies reporting, as each part of the process is clearly recorded and retrievable.</p>

<p>As enterprises embrace cloud native and everything as code, the journey from code to production has become a critical aspect of delivering value to customers. This process, often referred to as the “pathway to deploy,” encompasses a series of intricate steps and decisions that can significantly impact an organization’s ability to deliver software efficiently, reliably and at scale.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/blog/accelerate-release-lifecycle-with-pathway-to-deploy-part-1">The first post in this series</a> navigates the complexities and uncovers the strategies and target state mode for achieving a seamless and effective pathway to deploy.</p>



<p>This post expands on the topic and provides a maturity model and building blocks that help enterprises accelerate their software supply chain lifecycle in the ever-evolving landscape of enterprise cloud-native software development.</p>



 Pathway to deploy roadmap 



<p>To realize an accelerated pathway to deploy, there are several moving parts and stakeholders that must come together. We recommend a 4-stage roadmap for implementation, as shown in the figure below.</p>







 Stage 1: Development automation 



<p>Infrastructure automation (IaC) and pipeline automation are self-contained within the development team, which makes automation a great place to start. In this stage, the focus is building an enterprise catalog of continuous integration, deployment and testing (CI/CD/CT) and Ops patterns with necessary tooling integrations to automate core development and testing activities. Given enterprise complexity, the most difficult part of this stage is the automation of testing capabilities (wherein test data preparation and execution of test cases across multiple systems is mostly semi-automated). Overall Cloud Capability Centre (CCC), or the equivalent core team, plays a significant role in driving change with application and platform teams.</p>



 Stage 2: Institutionalize pattern-driven model 



<p>CCC (or its equivalent) works with the architecture board to establish a suite of repeatable patterns (including atomic patterns representing individual cloud services, as well as composite application patterns comprising of multiple cloud services). The architecture review process (along with other related review processes) is modified to institutionalize pattern-centric architecture representations with a backlog established for different groups (such as platform engineering and CCC) to build these patterns as code. This helps adoption and acceleration. Over time, the applications being represented appear as a set of patterns that standardizes development models across the board. In addition, teams such as business continuity, resiliency and security will leverage those patterns (for example, highly available multi-region architectures) to recognize and accelerate approval gates with a standardized approach. They key to this alignment is the co-creation of these patterns between participating organizations.</p>



 Stage 3: Self-service and cross-functional integration 



<p>Enterprises have many organizations that want to see that cloud applications follow their guidance and best practices. This stage focuses on integrating cross-functional teams (such as security, compliance and FinOps) through automation, tooling, codified patterns or self-service options. This builds on the earlier stages to emphasize meaningful participation between teams. The key aspects of this stage are to:</p>



 
 Build and align high-availability patterns with resiliency teams where reviews get accelerated, demonstrating adherence to these patterns. 



 Codify security and compliance requirements into the patterns and guardrail them on the platform as set of policies. 



 Address validation by integrating tooling, such as vulnerability scans, policy check tools (like cloud formation guard for AWS) and container security with the pipelines following shift-left principles. 



 Enlist enterprise records teams to study a set of data classification and retention patterns and enlist FinOps teams to assess for appropriate tagging and quota adherence. 



 Build AuthN/AuthZ integration patterns that abstract nuances and standardize authentication and authorization of applications, data and services. 



 Automate firewall via generation of resource files from IaC execution &amp; importing them to firewall systems as described <a href="https://aganguly.medium.com/hybrid-cloud-modernisation-connectivity-as-code-firewall-automation-7c7f80a61c13">here</a>. 



 Platform Engineering enterprise catalog offering multiple self-serve capabilities. 
 



 Stage 4: Automated pathway to deploy 



<p>This stage focuses on decentralization and decoupling of various enterprise groups while simultaneously integrating them through automation and DevSecOps. One example is the automation of change management processes, including automated release notes generation, where the system autonomously constructs comprehensive change review checklists by aggregating data from multiple interconnected systems. This results in trust, efficiency and accuracy in reviews. This holistic approach represents a significant leap in operational efficiency and risk mitigation for the enterprise.</p>



 Pathway to deploy: Building blocks of the cloud-native model 



<p>Let’s explore a few use cases that showcase pathway to deploy acceleration.</p>



 Use case 1: Persona-centric IaC codification 



<p>Persona- and patterns-based IaC codification can accelerate both development and review phases. The figure below represents multiple stakeholders in an enterprise who have different concerns and requirements for cloud native workloads.</p>







<p>It takes a lot of development time for product teams to manually code for each of these concerns, not to mention the time it takes for stakeholders to manually review each area. Codifying these in hardened discrete or composite patterns provides product teams the right Bootstrap code and acceleration, creating stakeholder trust and review efficiency.</p>



 Use case 2: Shift-left security and policies validation 



<p>Automate security, compliance and other policies for infrastructure as part of CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that deployed infrastructure will be aligned to enterprise policies even before it is deployed. There are multiple approaches provided by cloud providers and open-source tooling that can accomplish this (including <a href="https://www.checkov.io/">Checkov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard">Cloud formation guard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag">cfn-nag</a>). Typically, security teams codify policy validation rules, and product teams integrate policy validation within CI/CD/CT pipelines before the infrastructure is provisioned to cloud environment.</p>



 &nbsp;Use case 3: Automated compliance evidence collection for reviews 



<p>Cross-functional cloud platform, security and compliance teams build automation that enables evidence collection, accelerating security and compliance reviews. This would typically require leveraging Cloud APIs to query information from deployed cloud resources, as well as building compliance evidence and posture. Such capabilities could allow product teams to execute such automation in a self-service model or via DevOps pipelines and identify compliance posture, along with capturing review evidence automatically.&nbsp; The maturity level increases when evidence capture is executed automatically and the review is in a completely hands-free mode.</p>



 Use case 4: Integrated patterns and pipeline toolkit 



<p>Composite cloud-native patterns like AWS Active-Active Serverless APIs require several discrete patterns to come together. These patterns include:</p>



 
 Cloud services, such as Route53, API Gateway, Lambda, Dynamo DB, IAM, CodeDeploy, CodeBuild, CodePipeline and CodeCommit. 



 Nonfunctional Requirements, such as AuthN/AuthZ, multi-region active-active deployment, security at rest and in transit, tracing, logging, monitoring, dashboards, alerting, failover automation and health checks. 



 Integrated enterprise tooling, including Code Quality, SAST, DAST, Alerting, Test Management, tracking and planning. 
 



<p>A one-click solution would allow product teams to select the right pattern, which will create the necessary Bootstrap code that integrates several codified patterns as described in prior use cases.</p>



 Pathways to deploy: Delivery approach 



<p>For a delivery model to realize pathway to deploy, the CCC (or equivalent) must work with multiple organization groups as shown in the figure below.</p>







<p>Pathway to deploy delivery model would comprise of the following steps:</p>



 
 Define the entire path to deploy process through a set of application lifecycle phases, activities, deliverables and dependent groups involved. 



 Define and standup multiple squads focusing on different aspects on the pathway to deploy. 



 Plan fora flex model within the squads to bring in supporting groups as required. 



 Build a backlog for each of the Cloud Capability Center squads and initiate capability development. 



 Align to the 4-stage maturity model so enterprises can track maturity. 



 Establish product teams and relevant stakeholders as part of the backlog refinement and prioritization. 



 Ensure that automation adoption is continuously focused. The success of pathway to deploy depends on building the automation and getting it adopted. 



 Build central knowledge management and planning management around pathway to deploy. 



 Make it easier for product teams to incorporate these activities into their delivery plans (with for project tracking and agile collaboration tools such as Jira). 



 Build a measurement system for pathway to deploy phase gate SLAs and continuously track SLA improvement (as pathway to deploy capabilities mature over a period). 
 



<p>By considering why cloud transformation may not yield full value, and identifying release lifecycle acceleration as a key challenge, this narrows down the focus to pathway to deploy. Pathway to deploy can be a common vehicle that facilitates multiple groups to accelerate the entire software supply chain lifecycle beyond the development and testing lifecycle acceleration that exists today. A 4-stage roadmap has been defined where initial stages focus on DevSecOps and patterns adoption, and advanced stages mature towards product engineering culture. It is &nbsp;recommend that product teams collaborate with participating enterprise groups in a decentralized manner to leverage automation and self-service. The maturity model encourages organizations to incrementally scale by starting small, and our delivery approach brings predictable outcomes to this complex journey.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>In today’s interconnected world, trust in the digital landscape is more crucial than ever. A secure and trustworthy online environment becomes paramount as we increasingly intertwine our lives with the internet, from personal interactions to complex financial transactions and healthcare decisions. Recognizing this critical need, Continuum Loop, in collaboration with CIRA, has authored a new report, “<a href="https://www.cira.ca/en/resources/documents/state-of-internet/a-trust-layer-for-the-internet-is-emerging-a-2023-report/">A Trust Layer for the Internet is Emerging.</a>”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report, the result of the collaboration between <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrellodonnell/">Darrell O’Donnell</a> of Continuum Loop and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueslatour/">Jacques Latour</a> from CIRA, emerges as an essential resource for those innovators and early adopters leading the charge in digital innovation and strategy. It offers a comprehensive exploration of the challenges and solutions in building trust online, tailored to meet the needs of technical and business professionals in internet-centric organizations.</p>
<p>This pioneering document addresses the growing trust crisis in the digital realm, where the proliferation of fakes, frauds, and forgeries has significantly eroded public confidence. Our report highlights the path forward to restore and enhance trust in the internet, ensuring its role as a reliable and safe platform for future generations.</p>
 The Decline of Trust: A Wake-Up Call 
<p>It’s a concerning reality: trust in the internet is at an all-time low. In recent years, Canadians’ trust in the internet has plummeted from 71% to 57%, mirroring a global trend. The increase of fakes, frauds, and forgeries fuels this erosion of trust. This isn’t just a statistic; it has become a call to action. Organizations suffer when trust wanes, with some experiencing dramatic decreases in market capitalization after trust-related incidents.</p>
 Unveiling the Emerging Trust Layer 
<p>The report introduces an innovative concept: developing a ‘trust layer’ for the internet. This layer is a harmonious blend of technical trust (like encryption and signing) and human trust (like governance). It’s about creating a digital environment where parties can mutually authenticate each other, knowing confidently who they’re dealing with.</p>
 Trust Registries: Anchoring Digital Trust 
<p>A pivotal aspect of this trust layer is the role of trust registries. Trust registries provide authoritative answers within digital ecosystems, bridging the gap between technology and human trust. Furthermore, the concept of Registry of Registries (RoR) is explored to create an interconnected web of trust across various ecosystems.</p>
 From Wallets to Trust: A Paradigm Shift 
<p>Originally intended as an update to the 2019 “The Wallet Report,” the focus of this study shifted to the more critical issue of building trustworthy systems on the internet. It’s a response to the growing awareness that while security is essential, more is needed for establishing trust.</p>
 Navigating the Path to an Enhanced Trust Layer 
<p>The journey to build a trust layer on the internet, as outlined in the report, is challenging but vital. It requires a delicate balance of technical trust and human trust. The report underscores the importance of governance in maintaining trust and the critical role of trust registries in anchoring trust within digital ecosystems.</p>
 A Call to Action 
<p>The report concludes with a powerful message: we can reverse the decline in internet trust. By developing a trust layer, we can once again rely on the internet as a secure and trustworthy platform. It’s a shared responsibility to build and maintain this trust layer, not just for the benefit of digital ecosystems but for society as a whole.</p>
 Rebuilding Trust in Our Digital World 
<p>While the path ahead is challenging, the blueprint for a trustworthy internet is becoming clearer. Through the collaborative efforts of Continuum Loop and CIRA, we have charted a course towards an internet that balances technical trust with human trust, underpinned by the essential role of trust registries. These components are not just parts of a system but the pillars upon which we can construct an inherently reliable and secure digital realm.</p>
 Technical and Human Synergy: The Heart of the Emerging Trust Layer 
<p>The success of the emerging trust layer will not be measured solely by its technical strength but by the trust it fosters in our digital relationships. Developing and nurturing this trust layer is a collective responsibility with significant promise for revolutionizing digital ecosystems and enriching our society.</p>
<p>As we embark on this journey to reforge trust in the digital landscape, we do so with a clear understanding of the transformative potential of the trust layer and trust registries. This report is more than an analysis; it is a call to action for creating a future where trust is the cornerstone of our digital interactions. The time to act is now – to shape a functional and fundamentally trustworthy internet.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 The Internet’s Trust Deficit Needs to Be Repaid: Key trust-related decisions in the internet’s evolution were delayed or ignored, leaving the digital realm needing more essential capabilities to establish trust. 
 The Necessity of Trust Registries: Trust registries, including the innovative concept of a Registry of Registries (RoR), are crucial in creating a web of trust across ecosystems and anchoring the trust layer. 
 Ecosystem Diversity: Each digital ecosystem operates uniquely, and trust registries help unify diverse players and governance structures. 
 Leveraging Existing Systems: Existing systems hold the answers needed to establish trust; the challenge lies in accessing and integrating this information.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>In our Artificial Intelligence (AI) journey, much like the timeless question "Quo vadis, Domine?"-meaning "Where are you going, Lord?"-we find ourselves at a crossroads, questioning the direction of our technological trajectory. So as we traverse the AI landscape, we should ask ourselves, "Where is our AI going, and what are the implications for us?"</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, when the path forward may seem uncertain, well-structured legal frameworks provide a basic roadmap. These frameworks not only provide clarity on the permissible boundaries of AI development and application, but also serve as foresight tools that anticipate potential challenges and pitfalls. As I argued in a previous <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/balancing-innovation-and-regulation">blog</a>, law generates a dialectical process wherein the tech industry, responding to legal constraints, presents its antithesis by seeking new solutions, ultimately leading to a synthesis that reconciles legal requirements and fosters human agency.</p>
<p>Consequently, nations around the world are trying to figure out how to adapt to and capitalize on these evolving technologies. Unfortunately, while the impact of AI is global, many countries have yet to publish comprehensive AI regulations and policies. This gap presents both challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>On the one hand, embracing standardized regulations could foster global collaboration, addressing ethical concerns and privacy issues. On the other hand, the absence of clear guidelines may hinder the progress of global AI initiatives, potentially leading to misuse, fragmented approaches, and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Therefore, by exploring and comparing recently published AI regulations, individuals and organizations can proactively navigate the evolving landscape. This approach allows them to stay ahead of the curve, respond resiliently to change, and integrate practices and solutions that may not have been adopted in their home countries.</p>
 Implications of the EU’s AI Act 
<p>On December 8, 2023, after more than 36 hours of negotiations, a political agreement was reached on the EU's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act. The AI Act adopts a "risk-based approach" that prioritizes the regulation of the use of AI over the technology itself, with the aim of protecting European values and the rule of law. The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai">legislation</a> sets clear obligations based on the potential risks and impact of AI systems.</p>
<p>Key provisions include:</p>
 
 Prohibition of biometric categorization systems using sensitive characteristics (for example, political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, race) 
 Restriction on untargeted scraping of facial images for facial recognition databases 
 Ban on emotion recognition in workplaces and educational institutions 
 Prohibition of social scoring based on personal characteristics 
 Prohibition of AI exploiting vulnerabilities based on age, disability, or socioeconomic status 
 Use of biometric identification systems (RBI) in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes 
 Citizens' right to launch complaints and receive explanations about decisions based on high-risk AI systems 
 Transparency requirements for general-purpose AI systems, including technical documentation and compliance with EU copyright law 
 
<p>The AI Act focuses on risk assessments for AI systems, with obligations increasing based on the potential risk to individual rights or health. The agreement introduces transparency requirements for all general-purpose AI models and imposes tougher regulations on more powerful models. In essence, the EU AI Act strategically adapts its regulatory intensity based on the perceived risk levels associated with different AI systems.</p>
<p>By doing so, the legislation seeks to strike a balance between fostering innovation, ensuring transparency, and mitigating potential harms arising from advanced AI technologies. This nuanced approach reflects the EU's commitment to responsible AI governance and aligns with its broader initiatives to establish a trustworthy and ethical AI landscape.</p>
<p>The AI Act won't take effect until two years after final approval by European lawmakers, expected sometime in early 2024. Moreover, the AI Act will apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</p>
<p>The law's global influence is expected to extend as a blueprint for other nations navigating AI regulations. However, by not fully banning live facial recognition, the EU's decision has drawn <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/12/eu-blocs-decision-to-not-ban-public-mass-surveillance-in-ai-act-sets-a-devastating-global-precedent/">criticism</a>, with Amnesty International deeming it a "hugely missed opportunity" and expressing concerns about potential global repercussions, particularly in the realm of human rights and civil liberties.</p>
 Decoding the American AI Regulatory Landscape 
<p>The U.S. AI regulatory landscape is characterized by a mix of existing federal and state laws, frameworks from various federal agencies, and a growing number of state-specific laws. It is also characterized by a decentralized approach, in contrast to the EU's top-down approach.</p>
<p>The legislative approach to AI is centered on an "incentive-based" strategy, with policymakers seeking to create conditions that will retain AI developers. The emphasis on incentives reflects a concerted effort to prevent the potential shift of AI development to competing nations, highlighting the delicate balance between promoting innovation and avoiding national security issues.</p>
<p>Despite the polarized and challenging political environment in the U.S. in recent years, both parties in Congress have consistently supported AI governance efforts. This bipartisan commitment reflects a shared recognition of the transformative potential and strategic importance of AI.</p>
<p>While the EU's AI law is in its final stages, the U.S. is unlikely to pass a comprehensive national AI law in the near future. Instead, a flurry of executive actions is expected. The outcome may not be a broad national AI law, but rather a nuanced, domain-specific regulatory landscape that navigates the complexities of AI governance.</p>
<p>For example, in October 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">order</a> on AI. The order mandates prominent AI developers to disclose safety test results and pertinent information to the government. Furthermore, government agencies will establish standards to guarantee the safety of AI tools before their public release, accompanied by guidelines for labeling AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Biden's directive extends the momentum generated by voluntary commitments from major tech companies, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which had pledged to ensure the safety of their products before launch. In addition, the U.S. government is expected to increase spending on AI and AI research, especially in the defense and intelligence sectors.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole, we foresee that while private companies may implement their "responsible AI" initiatives, potential AI trade frictions with the EU may arise. Moreover, concerns linger about enforceability and binding measures, with critics highlighting potential disparities with the more stringent measures adopted by the EU in the recently adopted AI Act.</p>
 Balancing Acts: Concluding Thoughts 
<p>The dominance of major AI players in the US raises concerns about the delayed availability of powerful AI models in the EU, potentially impacting technological and economic development in the region. This dichotomy also underscores the global competition in AI, with China and Russia potentially adopting different, and less democratic-oriented, approaches. The question arises: can safety be adequately ensured through legal frameworks alone, especially when considering the divergent strategies employed by major players in the AI arena?</p>
<p>Exploring this critical angle prompts a deeper reflection on the effectiveness of legal frameworks in balancing safety concerns with the rapid development and deployment of advanced AI technologies, especially in the context of varying global approaches. The global AI debate involves geopolitical competition, national security, and economic competitiveness. Therefore, the answer to ensuring safety in AI may involve a multifaceted approach that goes beyond legal regulations, incorporating international collaboration, ethical standards, and shared best practices</p>
<p>Despite differing approaches to AI regulation, both the US and EU share the common goal of ensuring safe and democratic AI, fostering the potential for aligned transatlantic regulatory approaches. The EU-US Trade and Technology Council demonstrates early success in collaborating on trustworthy AI metrics and methodologies, emphasizing the need for further alignment and knowledge sharing. It is therefore essential that the EU and the U.S. align their approaches in key areas, given their combined influence on global AI governance.</p>

We will answer them below. But first, one a backgrounder to provide&nbsp;context.</p> Background: Focus of Ocean Predictoor / DF&nbsp;Team <p>The main goal of the Ocean / Predictoor / DF team right now is: make it easy &amp; obvious to earn $ as a trader, using Predictoor.</p>  Once it happens, there will be strong organic demand for the feeds, which in turn drives sales, which in turn drives predictoor income  This also means we’re spending less time on other potential things: detailed blogs, AMAs, webapp, analytics. Focus&nbsp;focus.  In short, $ success for traders will drive success everywhere else.   Questions &amp;&nbsp;Answers <p>Here are the Q’s, along with our A’s. Some answers won’t have full detail; that’s because we’re focusing on the “make it easy to make $”. Success there will drive the&nbsp;rest.</p><blockquote>How is a transaction counted?</blockquote><p>We submitted a list of smart contract addresses to dappradar.com. Whenever one of those has a tx against it, it’s&nbsp;counted.</p><p>The addresses we submitted are: the Ocean datatoken contracts for each of the 20 prediction feeds, plus a couple&nbsp;more.</p><blockquote>Are the Ocean predictoor ‘farming’ rewards part of the transactions if so how much do they account&nbsp;for?</blockquote><p>Payout of Predictoor Data Farming rewards is a small fraction of txs. However the $ incentive is likely a key driver for near-term traction.</p><p>If you’re a predictoor submitting prediction transactions, you can make $&nbsp;via:</p>  Organic sales  Sales from Predictoor Data Farming&nbsp;rewards  Others’ stake slashed when they are&nbsp;wrong.  <p>Of these:</p>  (3) evens out to about zero if your accuracy is about the same as others, and your <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7">stake doesn’t exceed your cut of expected&nbsp;sales</a>.

<p>On November 8th, the European Council and Parliament reached a provisional agreement on the new framework for a European digital identity (eID).</p>
<p>Over a decade in the making, we Europeans are now finally taking a fundamental step so that all EU citizens can have a unique and secure digital identity. This is a key advancement for the European Union to be a global leader in the digital identity field, enabling all 27 member states to reap the benefits of digitalisation.</p>
<p>The new European digital identity wallets will enable all Europeans to access online services throughout Europe with their own national digital ID, without having to use private identification methods or unnecessarily sharing personal data. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles help to assure that only information that needs to be shared will be shared. Security and privacy are paramount to any electronic identity ecosystem, and I have previously highlighted some of the concerns and trade-offs in the first of this EUDI blog series; <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="Introducing European Digital Identity (EUDI): The Future of Secure and Accessible Identity">Introducing European Digital Identity (EUDI): The Future of Secure and Accessible Identity</a>.</p>
 Understanding the EUDI Wallet Pilots 
<p>Running in parallel with the legislative track are the actual pilots of the EUDI wallets and end-user services. This is a great advantage from many perspectives, not least striving to avoid the fate of eIDAS v1, which suffered from the ‘chicken-and-egg’ problem from the start. It is surprising how the pilots have flown under the radar despite there being over 250 private corporations and public authorities participating in the four largest pilots alone, supported with €46 million investment from the EU Commission, as discussed in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3556">Provisional Political Agreement EU Commission article</a>.</p>
 EUDI Pilot Categories 
<p>The pilots can be broadly divided into three categories: User Authentication, e-Signing, and Website Authentication or Qualified Web Authentication Certificates (QWACs). As the last category is outside European control and looking increasingly unimplementable, I will focus initially on the User Authentication and E-Signing.</p>
<p>Beside the QWACs, a wide range of use cases are part of the EUDI pilot projects. These include:</p>
 
 Using the wallets to host user credentials for accessing government services 
 Activating SIM cards for mobile network services – in those countries which forbid anonymous SIM cards 
 Signing B2C and G2C contracts 
 Facilitating travel via digital driving licences and identity documents 
 Presenting educational credentials previously standardised under the Bologna agreement 
 
<p>All together, these use cases highlight the broad applicability of the EUDI. Basic user authentication is but a small part of its capabilities.</p>
<p>The European Commission has acknowledged that a digital identity can be used for much more than authentication to existing services. It frequently plays a part in the EUDI’s wide capabilities, as convenience features even at the highest level. For example, in the <a href="https://state-of-the-union.ec.europa.eu/state-union-2020_en">2020 State of the Union address</a>, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, highlighted how users will be able to use the EUDI wallets to file tax returns, check into hotels, rent cars, and securely open bank accounts across borders. Looking further, a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/pdf/efip/Digital_identity_update.pdf">European Central Bank policy brief on the European Digital Identity Framework</a> suggests that the EUDI wallet will include support for the Digital Euro.</p>
 The Four Major EUDI Pilots 
<p>There are several multi-year pilot projects running, of which the four largest are introduced below. In the first phase, which is currently ongoing, the pilots are centred on individual identities and the most common B2C use cases. After the launch of the EUDI for private persons, it’s expected that it will (at last) be the turn of organisational identity.</p>
 <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EWC</a> – EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium 
<p>The EWC pilot is coordinated by Sweden with the involvement of 18 Member States and Ukraine. It is a major undertaking that involves 15 public entities and 40 private organisations. The pilot is centred around travel and tests the storage and display of digital travel credentials and instant payments. First becoming an alternative to, and later replacing, European passports is not a realistic goal at present. But since a national identity card is a valid travel document within the EU, accepting EUDI as a travel document within the Schengen zone (the 27 European countries that have removed the need for passports and many other types of border control at their mutual borders) would be a much more realistic development.</p>
<p>The Digital Euro will be a central component of the EUDI instant payment system, scheduled to launch in 2027+. The Digital Euro seeks to bring instant electronic payments to the masses. However, it will not be as big of a change in the Nordics as in other countries, due to electronic payments already being the default. The Euro represents not value but debt; most of the European money supply exists purely in the digital domain already.</p>
 <a href="https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/">POTENTIAL</a> – Pilots for European Digital Identity Wallet Consortium 
<p>The POTENTIAL Pilot is coordinated by Germany and France with the involvement of 17 Member States and Ukraine. It is the largest of the pilots and involves over 50 public entities and over 80 private organisations. The pilot will use the EUDI wallet for several use cases around user authentication including; accessing government services, opening a bank account, e-prescriptions and Digital Driving Licences.</p>
<p>The Digital Driving License is a good example of how having a widely available, strong digital identity opens up a whole range of possibilities for enriching the identity with additional attributes. In this case, using the Digital Driving License to operate motor vehicles within the EU. Every country already has a database of valid licenses granted by the national authorities, so enabling the end user to present this data alongside their digital identity replicates the function of a dedicated physical driver’s license card. This makes tasks like car rental a faster and less error-prone process. It also allows end users to prove both their identity and their vehicle operation licenses online, without the need to send photos of their documents alongside selfies holding those documents to the third party – a goldmine for any identity thief.</p>
 <a href="https://www.nobidconsortium.com/">NOBID</a> – Nordic-Baltic eID Wallet Consortium 
<p>Interestingly the NOBID Pilot is led by Norway, a non-EU country, with eight member states also involved. Overall, it involves 5 public entities and over 15 private organisations.</p>
<p>The pilot will focus on a single use case: the use of the EUDI wallet for the authorisation of payments for products and services by the end user. Unlike the EWC, it will concentrate on addressing the issuance of wallets, the provision of payment means by financial institutions, and the secure and convenient acceptance of payment in a retail (B2C) context.</p>
 <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/">DC4EU</a> – Digital Credentials for Europe Consortium 
<p>The DC4EU Pilot is led by Spain and involves nearly all other member states, as the pilot trials the use of the EUDI wallet in the educational sector and the social security domain. The pilot project aligns with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/ESSPASS">European Social Security Pass</a> and <a href="https://europa.eu/europass/en/node/2128">the European Learning Model</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/consortium/">tens of universities</a> from around Europe together with government officials and research associations, the pilot is clearly focused on the higher education sector. Technically it is very different from the other pilots, as it trials the use of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure</a> (EBSI) in the context of the EUDI wallet. Educational records could be especially suitable for a distributed database model, because educational degrees are revoked only under extraordinary circumstances and the range of educational institutions is very broad – from small private institutions to massive state-run universities and polytechnics. The project is scheduled to run until April 2025, and they also maintain a handy list of <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/outputs/">related acronyms</a> on the project site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EUDI pilots are well underway and will continue to late 2024 with some even heading into 2025. It is clear then that the original 2024 launch date for the EUDI is not tenable, at least when talking about a mass launch. But I do hope that by this time next year, there will be a limited release available in order to truly start exploring the capabilities and practical features of the EUDI ecosystem. The potential scale of the EUDI is immense but is certainly doable – as the credit card industry has proven, for example.</p>

 We sit down with our Brazilian-born, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow Francisco Martins to discuss what’s next for the Brazilian gambling market, and how gambling platforms can prepare for the new era of gambling regulation. 



 



 On December 12, the Brazilian Senate finally passed its Brazilian gambling regulations for sports betting. What took so long?&nbsp; 



<p>Until this week, there had been no enforceable or documented Brazilian gambling regulations due to a blanket ban on gambling in the country since the 1940s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the ban, however, gambling was a prevalent pastime, and casinos were big businesses that pulled in celebrities worldwide. The ban, introduced in 1946, came from President Eurico Gaspar Dutra; a man heavily influenced by his wife, who was a devout Catholic, and thought poorly of games of chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continued pressure from the general populace saw some restrictions lifted in intervening years, such as:&nbsp;</p>



  Legalization of a non-commercial bingo in 1971.<br>  Legalization of horse racing and the betting associated with it in 1984.<br>  Creation of a state-owned lottery system in 1996.&nbsp;  



<p>Poker was exempt from the 1946 ban as it was deemed a game of skill. Alongside the above, social betting and fantasy betting are legal under Brazilian gambling laws; however, they are entirely unregulated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ban was met with strong resistance, and underground gambling soon became a thing. The game of choice to this day is Jogo do Bicho, a simple lottery-style game that began in 1892. Jogo do Bicho began as a fun game played outside a zoo but is now an unofficial yet popular numbers game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Brazilian gambling restrictions only ever applied to gambling operators headquartered in Brazil, the domestic ban essentially provided a window of opportunity operators headquartered abroad to target Brazilian customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Introducing this new regulatory framework has therefore been fraught with difficulties for new and existing operators across the globe. To help meet some of these challenges, a nonprofit organization called ABRADIE was created to ensure the Brazilian gambling and iGaming landscape remained safe and free from corruption.</p>



 What would you say was the main catalyst for change? 



<p>I think there were two main reasons for change: public opinion, and the realization that the Brazilian economy was missing out on major tax revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the first, as online gambling and iGaming grew in popularity, so too did public sentiment toward regulation revision. People began to regard the regulations as archaic, and openly challenged that online gambling should be exempt. In a way, it was, as online gambling and iGaming have been allowed in Brazil, provided the operators were headquartered outside the country. In 2018, the winds of change began to blow in Brazil’s way, and a plan was proposed to introduce new gaming legislation in Brazil. The proposed project allowed basic fixed odds sports betting, but with the caveat that actual legislation was a work in progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The income generated from online gambling in Brazil is predicted to be more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">$1.5 billion in 2023</a> – an increase of over 200% from 2022. Understandably, that’s a lot of tax revenue that the Brazilian authorities are missing out on. Predictions now point toward a sustained period of rapid growth. The Brazilian economy is struggling (having dropped from the <a href="https://brazilian.report/liveblog/2022/03/04/world-biggest-economies/">world’s 7th largest to 13th in just over a decade</a>), and the revenue boost from opening the country up to the iGaming sector is too good to not take advantage of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also worth mentioning that besides the economic boost, the regulation will also have a positive effect on:&nbsp;</p>



  Safer gambling: Invariably, when regulations are deemed necessary, it is an indication of inherent risk in the industry, for example fraud and other criminal activities. Enforcing strict and well-documented regulations will make the Brazilian gaming space safer and more secure.  



  Attract investors: Establishing online gambling and sports betting regulations opens the Brazil market to new and diverse investors. Setting a framework for gambling regulations ensures a competitive and fair landscape, for new and old entrants, while preventing companies from running unethical practices and promotions to build their iGaming brands.  



 What are your thoughts on the new regulations? Do you think they are clear enough? 



<p>The regulations are a significant step toward Brazil’s modern online gambling landscape. However, they only extend to fixed odds sports betting, and not online gambling. Casinos will also remain illegal for the time being, but further changes are expected in the coming years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the ban on bonus bets is an interesting decision. Sign-up bonuses are often used by operators to entice customers to register for their platform, however they are also exploited by criminals. [Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse in our blog here</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new rules also prohibit companies without a license from advertising. The content of advertisements must follow new guidelines, and any company found to be in breach of guidelines will have it removed from the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I do think is smart are the new payment rules that have been designed to try and dismantle Brazil’s huge illegal gambling market. Only operators authorized by the Central Bank can offer payment services, and players are only able to send money to a bank account that is headquartered in Brazil.</p>



 So, what’s new? How can operators comply with the new Brazilian gambling regulations? 



<p>The first requirement is for an operator to be based in Brazil. Foreign operators will be barred from offering regulated gambling. This will ensure the Brazilian government is able to collect the taxable revenue (operators will be liable to pay 12% revenue tax.) Operators are also mandated to meet a range of integrity, responsibility and honesty requirements as proposed by the ABRADIE and IBJR and are therefore required to be a member of a sports integrity body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other requirements operators will be forced to comply with include having a minimum value of share capital and being able to pass several technical requirements.</p>



<p>Players will also be pleased to learn that there will be 15% tax on the amount that bettors win, which is a major reduction on the 30% tax that Brazilian Minister of Finance Fernando Haddad originally said he wanted.</p>



<p>Operators that wish to comply with the new sports betting regulations can do so by getting a Brazilian gambling license, which will set them back BR$30 million (US$6.1 million) for five years of validity. Learn more about the complexities of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/#:~:text=The%20only%20forms%20of%20permitted,to%20be%20active%20in%20Brazil.">Brazilian gambling license structure in our blog, here</a>.</p>



 What challenges do you foresee regarding the opening of the Brazilian market? 



<p>Introducing sports betting regulations in Brazil will not be without its challenges and risks. As the illegal and unregulated gambling industry is already thoroughly established, one of the primary issues that must be confronted is underground gambling and removing the risk of fraud or match-fixing. Brazilian sports have seen their share of scandals and controversies that would make anybody nervous about entering this newly opened market without a rigid and protective framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world of iGaming is driven by the financial aspect. The challenge will be to balance the economic benefits of online betting legislation with the social responsibility to keep everybody safe. Safety relates to being safe from fraud and other financial crime, but also to ensure they engage in responsible gambling. </p>



<p>I think discussions regarding Brazil’s gambling market will continue throughout 2024, especially as online gambling was omitted in the regulation. </p>



 How does Brazil’s gambling regulations compare to other markets? 



<p>The best way to understand how to thrive in a new market is to study the landscape of existing markets. The<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/"> UK Gambling Commission</a> has created an established model that makes an excellent study for the Brazilian authorities. Malta is another location that has created a great regulatory model to tackle the challenges of being a smaller location with a heavy reliance on international business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each country in LATAM is adopting and updating its regulations at a different place. Argentina, Bolivia, and Nicaragua are three countries with various existing regulations and are actively working to expand them. Mexico is another that has the framework in place for rapid iGaming growth and would present good case studies, offering realistic region-proof market entry strategies that can be easily customized for the Brazilian landscape.</p>



 What role will technology play in the&nbsp;new era of online gambling in Brazil? 



<p>As further regulatory changes come into play, and new global markets continue to slowly but surely open, one key way that operators can prepare for the future is by incorporating robust identity verification technology that enables operators to conduct thorough <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer checks</a> and process international and local documents and data, such as the Cadastro de Pessoa Física (Brazilian tax number).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of facial recognition technology in identifying the identities of bettors and required taxation will also become standard practice.</p>



<p>Navigating the online world and covering the range of potential issues is mission-critical for anybody looking to create a new set of iGaming regulations. An online business is present in many countries and, therefore, must be aware of and compliant with the relevant regulations and legislations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with a solid system that can accommodate the different requirements of different regulatory bodies is essential. Anti-money-laundering compliant identity verification and fraud prevention are hot topics and even more prevalent when entering a new market that has been active but unregulated for several years.<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/)"> IDnow has the tools</a> that help make the transition into the Brazilian iGaming space as seamless as possible.</p>



 What’s next for Brazil’s gambling regime? 



<p>Revenue is already up by 200% from 2022 and is expected to double again by 2027. As the industry expands and technology advances, regulations must adapt to remain ahead of the curve, where possible, to maintain player and operator safety. As these laws change and people’s views toward online gambling evolve, so will the different definitions of what is covered. Many Brazilians would love to see casinos return.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By implementing a Brazilian gambling regulation process, the initial upturn for the economy will be immediate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The road ahead of the iGaming culture in Brazil is not without its challenges. Initiating change takes time and knowledge.&nbsp;The online gaming sphere is fraught with complexities, such as ensuring that a solid multi-jurisdictional identity verification platform is in place to protect anything entering the space. Solid identity-proofing systems are imperative for anybody looking to enter the emerging LATAM market, as each new jurisdiction will bring its own requirements. Having a dependable system programmed to deal with a region’s requirements means setting a solid foundation for safe and stable growth in that market.</p>

   Anycasting an authoritative DNS service isn’t always the right answer. Learn how to improve the performance and reliability of your digital properties in mainland China.  
 The post Why you shouldn’t use Global Anycast DNS in China appeared first on IBM Blog. 
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>


<p>Anycast is a standard, table-stakes feature of every authoritative DNS service. It makes sense:&nbsp;inbound queries should always be routed to the best available servers—usually the ones that are geographically closest. Yet, there is one glaring exception: China.</p>



<p>The internet in mainland China is walled off from the rest of the world. Any DNS query that crosses into or out of mainland China must pass through a series of filters and other controls before it can be passed along for resolution. These filters and controls impose a gigantic performance hit—if the query is allowed to resolve at all.&nbsp;</p>



 <a></a>The risks of Global Anycast DNS in China 



<p>Several authoritative DNS providers deal with this issue by extending their network into mainland China so they can resolve traffic inside mainland China. These additional points of presence (PoPs) are attached to a global anycasted network but primarily serve users in mainland China due to the use of geographic traffic steering.</p>



<p>At first look, this approach seems logical. Since anycast DNS queries in mainland China will be answered by the nearest server, the more PoPs in China you have, the more likely you are to respond from a server that sits inside the system of filters and controls.</p>



<p>This approach isn’t foolproof. Global brands serve up applications, services and content from nearby countries as well. Even with a large number of PoPs in mainland China, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) often sends users in mainland China to resolving servers in neighboring countries based on prevailing internet conditions and the number and cost of “hops” needed to find the resolver. When that traffic goes across the system of filters and controls, the performance hit is significant.</p>



<p>In this sense, anycasting an authoritative DNS service in mainland China is a bit of a crapshoot.&nbsp;If you’re not deliberately directing users in China to a domestic server, there’s always going to be a risk of poor performance.</p>



 <a></a>The NS1 Connect approach: Nameserver Acceleration 



<p>IBM® NS1® offers a distinctive approach to resolving DNS queries in China—one that removes the risk of anycast-induced performance issues by geolocating the query source. We call it Nameserver Acceleration.</p>



<p>NS1’s DNS infrastructure is essentially two separate but related networks: NS1’s anycasted <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/managed-dns">Managed DNS service</a> and our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dns-for-china">Managed DNS for China</a> offering. Instead of blindly relying upon BGP to find a resolver, we use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dns-traffic-steering">our own traffic steering technology</a> to figure out which network should respond to a query.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a request comes from China (as determined by geolocating the source IP), it is answered by one of our DNS servers in China. If not, the request is answered by a server on our global anycasted network.</p>



 <a></a>How Nameserver Acceleration works 



<p>When a user in mainland China initiates a DNS query, the first “hop” goes to a local resolver. In the second “hop”, the resolver does an IP address lookup.</p>



<p>This second hop is where BGP often routes traffic to a nearby country. NS1 adds a step to the resolution process to ensure that doesn’t happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Normally, the nameserver for the top-level domain (TLD) returns both a domain name and an IP address, stored in a “glue record”, to reduce the number of lookups. Nameserver acceleration is configured to remove this glue record.</p>



<p>When the recursive resolver doesn’t get the glue record it needs, it performs a separate lookup to find the missing IP address. When the resolver looks up the IP address of the authoritative nameserver at NS1, we respond with an IP address based on the resolver’s location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If that resolver is in China, NS1 responds with an IP address of a China-based nameserver. If the resolver is outside of China, the response goes back with an IP address for a server on NS1’s global anycast network.</p>



 <a></a>Performance impact 



<p>Now, you may be asking, “doesn’t that extra lookup actually degrade performance?” It is true that inserting an additional step into the query resolution process takes extra time. However, we’ve found that the impact on performance is so negligible that it’s hardly worth mentioning. And in comparison to the drag on performance produced by the system of filters and controls, it’s clearly worth doing.</p>



<p>The numbers clearly bear this out. Here’s some data we pulled on DNS response times in mainland China from IBM NS1 Connect® and its primary competitors. As you can see, our approach yields significant dividends—on average, our service is over three times faster than any other network.</p>



 <a></a>The DNS management angle 



<p>If you’re a global business with a significant user base in mainland China, Nameserver Acceleration makes NS1 the clear choice for DNS services. But it’s not the only reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NS1’s Managed DNS for China does all of this through a single control plane. All of the technical magic and fancy traffic steering happens within our platform. From a management perspective, queries from China sit right alongside the rest of your network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not all DNS providers can say that. Due to Chinese regulations around serving content, many of them require entirely separate accounts and credentials to specifically manage queries that originate in China. Since NS1 is a pure play DNS provider, we can offer a single control plane without the need for an ICP license.</p>

   If you’re seeing NXDOMAINs and other network errors, do you have the DNS data to do something about it? NS1’s DNS Insights provides the data you need to correct misconfigurations that hurt performance.

<p>It is relatively simple to see that something is wrong with your network using DNS data. A spike in NXDOMAIN responses or other errors usually serves as a clear indication that something is amiss. </p>



<p>The next step—diagnosing the source of the problem and then actually doing something about those errors—is often a heavier lift. It is a data problem. Any authoritative DNS provider worth its salt will show you how many NXDOMAIN responses you are getting. Yet, few provide the contextual information network that teams need to uncover the source of those errors, which can come from multiple directions and involve multiple DNS data points. </p>



<p>Up to this point, authoritative DNS providers have approached this challenge in one of two ways:</p>



 Overwhelm network teams with data 



<p>Several authoritative DNS providers offer raw data feeds as an add-on feature. These certainly provide all the information a network team would need to troubleshoot misconfigurations and diagnose the root cause of DNS errors.</p>



<p>The problem: finding the needle in the haystack. Raw data feeds sound nice, but they usually end up creating more work for network teams, who have to process and analyze the data to discover the underlying cause of network issues. Even if the team is pushing the DNS feed into a data lake, SIEM, or processing platform, it can take a while to build out the dashboards and workflows to convert it into usable information. Even then, it is not always clear that you will have the right information when you need it.</p>



<p>The result: network teams spend more time trying to find the information they need and less time actually diagnosing and solving challenges.</p>



 <a></a>Provide only basic data 



<p>Other authoritative DNS providers take the opposite approach, providing just a simple dashboard with basic information. Usually, this takes the form of a table of NXDOMAIN responses organized by geographical location, IP range and a few other points.</p>



<p>The advantage of this approach is that the data is pre-processed and easy to digest, saving a lot of work on the back end to build, configure and manage analysis infrastructure.</p>



<p>The primary disadvantage is that the data usually is not comprehensive enough to account for all the reasons network errors happen in the real world. There is not enough flexibility to capture all the corner cases or look at an issue through multiple lenses. What you see is what you get—and that is often not enough.</p>



<p>The result: network teams get just enough information to wish they had more. They can identify basic issues, but their ability to truly troubleshoot and get to root causes is limited.</p>



 <a></a>DNS Insights: Network troubleshooting that is “just right” 



<p>After analyzing the DNS data options on the market, IBM® NS1 Connect® decided to take a different path—one that offered both a broad scope of data and the analysis needed to make that data useful for network teams.</p>



<p>To do this, we decided to use <a href="https://orb.community/">Orb</a>, an open source DNS data analysis tool designed and built by IBM NS1®. Originally created as a way to diagnose and protect against DDoS attacks, Orb efficiently captures targeted data at the edge using a “small data” approach which reduces operational overhead while generating useful analysis on the fly.</p>



<p>By deploying Orb on NS1’s own DNS infrastructure, we can now offer our customers the data they need to accurately and quickly identify the root cause of misconfigurations and other network errors without the headache of building out an analysis machine on their own.</p>



<p>Known as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dns-insights">DNS Insights</a>, this feature is available to all customers using IBM NS1 Connect <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/managed-dns">Managed DNS</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dedicated-dns">Dedicated DNS</a>.</p>



 <a></a>What you get with DNS Insights 



<p>Simply put, DNS Insights offers the best of both worlds in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/dns-observability">DNS observability</a>: the broad scope of data to diagnose a wide variety of network challenges, coupled with built-in analysis to make troubleshooting faster and easier.</p>



 
 DNS Insights is a targeted data feed drawn from a wide variety of DNS and network metrics. This diversity of data sources provides the flexibility network teams need to examine misconfigurations from several angles. This is not a flood of raw data logs that overwhelms your storage capacity and requires a lot of effort to consume. But it also goes further than a simple table of NXDOMAIN responses. In short, it is what you will actually use. 



 DNS Insights is a set of pre-built dashboards that do most of the data analysis work for you. We have approached the issue from multiple angles, offering charts and graphs <a>that </a><a>[RM1]</a>&nbsp;display the most common (and several uncommon) ways that misconfigurations may present themselves. The dashboards are designed to show just enough data to get you on the right track, without too much detail that would make them confusing or impenetrable. 



 DNS Insights connects troubleshooting data to other tools using <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/remote_write/">Prometheus Remote Write</a> and <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/">OpenTelemetry</a>, an open source standard for observability tools. With these two options for data transfer, you can plug in the DNS Insights feed and dashboards into whichever tool you happen to use—Splunk, DataDog, Grafana and more. 
 



 <a></a>Get the DNS data (and the answers) you need 



<p>NS1 customers are the driving force behind DNS Insights. We have been listening to their requirements and working with several key design partners for months to refine the product to meet the needs of innovative market leaders and ordinary businesses alike. After playing around with DNS Insights, here is what a few of them had to say:</p>



 
 “This is information we’ve been waiting to see for a long time.” 



 “We can see why we’re getting hit with so many bad queries—this helps us out a lot.” 



 “It’s certainly a lot more data than we can see today…it’s extremely useful.” 
 



<p>We know the power of DNS Insights—NS1 has been using this technology for many years. Now we are pleased to make that powerful data and analysis available to our customers as well— an innovative new feature set that once again places NS1 as the most innovative, forward-looking authoritative DNS provider.</p>

<p>In today’s business environment, regardless of the product or service, leaders must develop a well-honed business strategy. Without clarity and intention, even the most innovative companies are unlikely to succeed. A successful business strategy must clearly define an organization’s objectives, decision-making processes and long-term business goals. It must also consider the organization’s target market and major competitors to help ensure that decisions are made with a holistic view of the existing landscape, facilitating long-term success. Through decades of research, business thinkers identified several types of business strategy that can help guide an organization’s plans.</p>



 The value of business strategies 



<p>Developing a business strategy involves critical thinking and extensive market research. As <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/business-strategies-types">Professor Felix Oberlholzer-Gee of Harvard Business School emphasized</a>, an effective business strategy requires a deep understanding of your company and a profound sense of optimism about its potential for exceptional performance. To achieve this nuanced understanding of an organization’s future operations, business leaders must carefully consider their primary objectives, core strengths and their target audience. It’s essential to identify the people they serve and determine the most effective ways to engage with them.</p>



<p>When an organization engages in comprehensive strategic planning, a well-defined business strategy can:</p>



 
 Guide the decision-making process to prioritize initiatives and allocate resources effectively. 



 Help ensure that all employees have well-defined goals and clear mandates for the organization. 



 Enhance competitive advantage by creating a sustainable, informed edge over competitors. 



 Create an agile company with the capacity to adapt quickly to market changes. 



 Facilitate long-term planning as the organization grows. 



 Provide a tangible foundation for performance benchmarks and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/talent-management">employee evaluations.</a> 
 



 3 broad types of business strategy 



<p>Business strategies vary depending on the competitive environment and the operations of specific organizations. However, business experts and institutions identified several specific types of strategies. These business strategies can be categorized into 3 distinct types:</p>



 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporate-level strategy 



<p>This strategy refers to decisions made by an organization’s top-level management. It often involves big-picture thinking and pertains to matters like mergers, acquisitions, portfolio management and diversification.</p>



 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Functional-level strategy 



<p>Functional-level strategies are run on a smaller scale and focus on specific departments or areas of a business, such as human resources (HR) or finance. They are deployed to improve aspects of an organization’s operations and support corporate-level or business-level strategies.</p>



 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Business-level strategy 



<p>This type of strategy is what most people understand as a business strategy. It relates to how an organization intends to gain a competitive advantage in its chosen market, whether through differentiation, competitive pricing or expansion into new markets.</p>



<p>Typically, comprehensive business-level strategies are combined with other strategy types. For instance, an operational strategy facilitates the alignment of production and delivery processes with the overall business plan. An innovation strategy, which aligns with the overall business strategy, guides how an organization incorporates <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/product-development">new ideas or products</a> into its overall plan.</p>



<p>Ideally, a well-defined business strategy must impact every department and aspect of an organization, providing clear priorities and objectives across teams like marketing, research and development and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/human-capital-management">HR</a>. With a clearly defined strategy identified early on, organizations can efficiently develop secondary business processes like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/planning-budgeting-and-forecasting">forecasting </a>or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-process-management">process management.</a></p>



 Evolution of core business strategy frameworks 



<p>In the 1980s, Professor Michael Porter from Harvard Business School developed a series of generic strategies, which subsequent researchers built upon. These strategies continue to underpin the most widely employed business approaches. Large corporations and small businesses still use these classic business strategies. Porter’s original theory identified 3 fundamental types of business strategies, with one later splitting into two variants. These 3 core strategies include:</p>



 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost leadership strategy 



<p>The cost leadership strategy focuses on gaining market share by providing goods or services at the lowest possible cost. Typically, these organizations operate on a large scale, often by using a network of franchises to enhance efficiency and speed. In organizations pursuing a cost leadership strategy, their competitive edge lies in providing the cheapest goods to a broad audience. Compared to other strategies, they allocate relatively fewer resources to research and development or advertising, as their success relies largely on economies of scale.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://pressbooks.lib.vt.edu/strategicmanagement/chapter/6-2-understanding-business-level-strategy-through-generic-strategies/">focus on efficiency and scale can help these organizations</a> withstand challenges from competitors and often results in high profits. However, the same focus on efficiency may impede their ability to adapt quickly. If the perception arises that the organization’s lower prices correspond to lower-quality goods, it <a href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/strategicmanagement/chapter/5-4-differentiation/">may negatively impact the business</a>.</p>



 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Differentiation strategy 



<p>Organizations following a differentiation strategy aim to encourage consumers to pay a premium for a unique product or highly desirable product. This uniqueness might mean that the new product is more expensive but also more reliable or useful compared to competitors, or it might involve innovative features.</p>



<p>This business model needs careful consideration of marketing strategies and market dynamics. Businesses following a differentiation strategy often highlight their research and development efforts to convince customers of their product’s superiority. For example, <a href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/strategicmanagement/chapter/5-4-differentiation/">Nike emphasizes its innovations</a> in sportswear to differentiate itself from competitors.</p>



<p>When effectively implemented, this strategy may lead to higher profit margins as loyal customers repeatedly choose the brand. It may also reduce the threat of competitors if the unique product is widely viewed as such, fostering significant brand loyalty. However, organizations remain vulnerable if a competitor offers a cheaper alternative for price-sensitive buyers.</p>



 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus strategy 



<p>The focus strategy, also known as the niche strategy, involves aligning an entire organization’s efforts around a highly specific group of customers, product line or geographic market. This strategy often aims to target undiscovered market segments or serve an under-served demographic.</p>



<p>While this strategy may sometimes resemble differentiation or cost-leadership strategies, it focuses on a smaller consumer group. Businesses deploying a focus strategy aim to capture a specific market rather than exponentially expand their customer base through low pricing or novel product development. There are 2 types of focus strategies for niche markets:</p>



 
 Cost-focus strategy: This type of strategic management focuses on offering products to a specific niche market at a lower price than competitors. 



 Differentiation-focus strategy: This type of business strategy may offer products to its niche market at a higher price but involves developing products and services that are seen as superior to the competition. 
 



<p>Businesses deploying either focus strategy can benefit from increased expertise gained from specializing in a narrow niche. This specialization allows them to offer products and services that are tailored specifically to their relatively small market segment, potentially fostering more personalized customer interactions and building customer loyalty. Since the target audience for the product tends to be limited, <a href="https://www.simon-kucher.com/en/insights/mastering-focus-strategy-steps-stand-out-your-niche-market">businesses that use this model</a> can expect higher efficiency and lower marketing and operational costs.<a href="https://www.simon-kucher.com/en/insights/mastering-focus-strategy-steps-stand-out-your-niche-market"> </a></p>



 Implementing all 3 levels of business strategy 



<p><a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/strategy/business-strategy/Pages/the-five-forces.aspx">Porter’s core business strategies</a>, which started a revolution in the business world, continue to influence contemporary business practices. Porter argued that organizations should choose one of these fundamental strategies to avoid resource wastage and confusion in their business goals. <a href="https://pressbooks.lib.vt.edu/strategicmanagement/chapter/6-7-stuck-in-the-middle/">According to the professor</a>, choosing a strategy is as much about deciding what an organization won’t do as it is about what it will do.<a href="https://pressbooks.lib.vt.edu/strategicmanagement/chapter/6-7-stuck-in-the-middle/"></a></p>



<p>In the years following the development of Porter’s generic strategies, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/18479790221080214">some thinkers suggested the possibility of exploring hybrid business strategies</a> that combine aspects of multiple strategies. &nbsp;Still, the fundamental insight from Porter’s ideas is that organizations need clearly defined boundaries and goals in structuring their practices resonated for over 3 decades and remains a guiding principle for today’s business leaders.</p>



<p>Porter’s core strategies can be implemented as corporate-level, functional-level or business-level strategy frameworks. The current realities of customer preferences and market dynamics require organizations to incorporate all 3 types of business strategy.</p>

<p>“I want it now!”—This isn’t just a phrase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wAlQf4WdiE">spoiled children sing</a>; it’s what we demand every time we click a link, stream video content or access an online application.</p>



<p>As internet traffic grows in volume and complexity, our expectations for faster response times from the services and content we use rises. We often click away if instant results aren’t provided. For businesses delivering applications and services, the fierce urgency of “now” is a logistical headache. Internet traffic must navigate different clouds, content delivery networks (CDNs) and other core services on the back end. Achieving consistently high performance requires an efficient routing system, optimizing traffic between the services your application depends on.</p>



<p>IBM® NS1 Connect® uses the power of domain name systems (DNS) to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dns-traffic-steering">automatically steer traffic</a> to the best-performing service available, enabling you to meet user expectations. IBM® NS1® employs simple rules and monitoring data to dynamically switch endpoints, all based on your preset rules and priorities. In NS1 Connect, NS1 traffic steering configurations apply to individual DNS zone records. These configurations determine how NS1 Connect handles queries for each record, determining which answers to provide. Various filter chains use unique logic to process queries, enabling you to create combinations that are tailored to your operational or business needs.</p>



<p>Optimizing application performance can vary by business and NS1 Connect offers different traffic steering options:</p>



 
 <a></a>Round Robin (Shuffle): Distributes application traffic evenly across multiple endpoints, preventing overload and overdependence on any single service provider. Filters in the chain include “Up” to check endpoint availability and “Shuffle” to distribute traffic randomly among designated service providers. 



 Round Robin (Shuffle) with session persistence: Balances traffic load while maintaining a consistent user experience. NS1 Connect uses the same logic to distribute traffic among different service providers, while defaulting to the same provider for queries that originate from the same location. This prevents mid-stream changeovers for the sake of load balancing. It uses “Sticky Shuffle” to ensure that load balancing doesn’t disrupt ongoing sessions. 



 Distribute application traffic based on site capacity: Favors specific services, sending more traffic to cheaper or better-performing options while maintaining availability for load balancing. “Weighted Shuffle” and “Weighted Sticky Shuffle” distribute traffic based on predefined weights. 



 Send users to the closest location (geotargeting): Directs traffic to endpoints based on the originating location with options like geotarget country, geotarget region and geotarget latlong to specify granularity: A) Geotarget country narrows down the answers to service providers that match the originating country of the query. If no service provider is available in that country, this part of the chain will effectively be skipped; B) Geotarget region narrows down answers to queries with metadata indicating the geographical region; and C) Geotarget latlong chooses the closest service provider based on a calculation of the distance between where the query originated and the GeoIP database. 



 Distribute application traffic based on current site load (shed load): Enforces limits on CDNs or service providers in real time. The “shed load” filter steers traffic to compliant providers based on load-related metrics, helping manage contractual or cost limits automatically. More information about the settings for the shed load filter is in our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ns1-connect">NS1 documentation portal</a>. 
 



<p>In summary, IBM NS1 Connect offers a range of traffic steering options to meet diverse business needs to help ensure optimal application performance in the “now” era.</p>

<p>In the most recent version of its “Cloud Hype Cycle,” Gartner placed multi-cloud network operations in the “peak of inflated expectations, perilously close to the ‘trough of disappointment.'” While this may reflect the state of both hybrid and multicloud networking at an aggregate level, there is an abundance of nuance lurking underneath Gartner’s assessment. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The challenge is that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">multicloud</a> are both the present and the future of networking. It is an area that seems to be producing inflated expectations, deep disappointment, enlightened revelations and amazing productivity all at the same time. Let us dig a little deeper into what this means.&nbsp;</p>



 The present: Applications in multiple siloes&nbsp; 



<p>Most applications, services and content streams are already delivered from multiple clouds and hybrid environments. We know this because IBM® NS1® is the authoritative DNS provider for many of those assets. Our internal datasets show that 80% of our customers house workloads in more than one cloud provider. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, having multiple clouds available is not the same as spreading delivery of applications, services and content across multiple clouds. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The application traffic flowing through IBM NS1 Connect’s infrastructure shows that clouds are almost always used in a siloed way. Multiple clouds often deliver single-use applications in parallel, but the use case of synchronized application delivery from multiple clouds at the same time is rare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an example, we found one large enterprise customer that uses nine separate public clouds—from the “big three” of AWS, Azure and GCP all the way down to smaller providers like Tencent and DigitalOcean. We found zero overlap between cloud providers in the DNS records associated with those clouds. Every record was pointed at a single cloud only.&nbsp;</p>



 The future: Distributed, multi-infrastructure applications&nbsp; 



<p>Application workloads are already leveraging the advantages of single cloud or hybrid environments—the next step will be to leverage the advantages of multiple environments (including cloud, edge and on-prem infrastructure) at the same time. Ideally, this will happen through an abstracted management layer that uses policies to implement connectivity decisions across environments. The benefits of a distributed approach to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/hybrid-cloud-mesh/application-centric-connectivity">application connectivity</a> are clear:&nbsp;</p>



 Microservices 



<p>The unique value of cloud-specific microservices can be applied to specific parts of an application workload without needing to house the entire application in one place—a “best of breed” approach that enhances capabilities without resulting in vendor lock-in.&nbsp;</p>



 Performance 



<p>The latency of cloud services can vary from moment to moment and depends on a host of factors, including geography, routing pathways and service availability. A multi-cloud approach allows businesses to select the best-performing environment for their applications at any given time.&nbsp;</p>



 Cost 



<p>Application delivery costs vary significantly between cloud providers. In particular, baseline usage commitments can play a strong role in determining the overall expense of bringing an application to the end-user’s screen. A multi-cloud approach delivers the least expensive option for any particular moment, lowering the overall cost of delivery.&nbsp;</p>



 Resilience 



<p>When downtime or service deprecations come (and they will come), network admins need the flexibility to steer application traffic to alternative workloads. A true multi-cloud delivery framework ensures that applications keep running even when single clouds are unavailable.&nbsp;</p>



 The value of traffic steering in application delivery&nbsp; 



<p>NS1 has long recognized the value of delivering applications, services and content from multiple back-end infrastructure vendors. We have been helping customers handle multiple infrastructure layers for years. These customers have used our innovative traffic steering capabilities to improve the business metrics they care about. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Leveraging highly granular Real User Monitoring (RUM) data, we have helped these customers <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/application-performance-optimization">improve performance</a> by steering traffic to the delivery CDNs and clouds which provide the lowest latency at the best cost. Using data from NS1’s availability monitors, we have steered traffic around <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/network-resilience-uptime">outages and service deprecations</a> to keep applications (and revenue) up and running.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ibm-ns1-connect-how-ibm-is-delivering-network-connectivity-with-premium-dns-offerings/">NS1 is part of IBM</a>, we are starting to extend the proven value of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dns-traffic-steering">DNS traffic steering</a> deeper into the networking stack. NS1’s traffic steering finds the best connection between clouds and end users. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/hybrid-cloud-mesh">IBM Hybrid Cloud Mesh</a> optimizes internal connectivity between cloud-based application workloads. Together, the two solutions deliver applications that are optimized for performance, cost and availability at every connection point.&nbsp;</p>



 DNS that does more: Optimizing application delivery end-to-end&nbsp; 



<p>The market for multi-cloud network operations software is rapidly evolving. A horde of startups is already converging on what promises to be a large, industry-defining set of customer challenges. Yet, if you look at the scope of the challenge these startups have chosen to address, it is surprisingly narrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Almost all of the emerging multi-cloud networking solutions are focused on optimizing connections between clouds for internal-facing use cases. Extending that optimized connection to the end user is almost an afterthought, much less any network outside of these vendor ecosystems. IBM is taking a more holistic view. By attaching NS1’s authoritative DNS network to its hybrid cloud connectivity solution, IBM is delivering connectivity that is optimized end-to-end, regardless of the customer use-case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The value of faster connections, lower network delivery costs, better network resilience and higher availability is not merely confined to what is inside the firewall. It extends out to the end user experience through applications that are better performing, always on and cheaper to provide. That, in turn, means applications that have higher customer satisfaction, better customer retention and higher per-customer revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe there is a ton of customer value to be unlocked by optimizing connectivity at every point in the hybrid cloud application delivery chain—from internal networks all the way out to end users. Stay tuned as we start to bring this vision to life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanksgiving in the U.S. signals the start of the holiday shopping season, stretching all the way to Christmas. During this time, businesses offer various deals and incentives, triggering a surge in orders, deliveries, and returns of goods. Unfortunately, this season is also a prime opportunity for attackers seeking to capitalize on unsuspecting individuals, employing identity-based cyberattacks such as phishing to compromise users’ credentials and take control of their accounts.</p>
<p>In fact, the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA231115#:~:text=The%20FBI%20warns%20of%20criminals,in%20losses%20over%20%2473%20million.">FBI reported almost 12,000 victims reporting non-payment/non-delivery scams during the 2022 holiday shopping season, resulting in losses over $73 million</a>. This number doesn’t account for organizations that have experienced breaches due to employees falling victim to phishing while using corporate devices for online shopping. Additionally, it doesn’t acknowledge the number of victims who never report these incidents. While education on phishing scams and how to stay safe is a necessary step in helping protect users against account takeover (ATO) and other identity-based attacks, it is not a foolproof way to secure your users and their data.</p>
<p>Most organizations have implemented some form of multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is usually based on SMS/email one-time passcode (OTP) or mobile soft tokens to improve security for their users and customers. At the same time, attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, using tools such as phishing-as-a-service and generative AI. These technologies enable the creation of phishing emails and campaigns that look alarmingly authentic, often evading the most well-trained and vigilant security-aware individuals. In addition, MFA bypass attacks like SIM swap and MFA fatigue/prompt bombing render traditional MFA options vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations need to implement phishing-resistant and MFA bypass-resistant multi-factor authentication to protect their users and customers.</p>
<p>Types of Holiday Scams</p>
<p>Most holiday phishing attacks exploit users’ distractions amid holiday festivities and shopping. This leads to financial losses and identity theft, causing long-term repercussions such as damage to credit scores, mortgages, and more.</p>
 
 Fake promotions – These are emails or advertisements that offer attractive discounts, leading victims to phishing sites that replicate genuine retail websites. Users unknowingly make purchases using their credit cards, only to never receive the items they paid for. 
 Delivery notifications – As online holiday shopping increases, cybercriminals exploit it by sending fake delivery notifications. These messages pressure victims to click on links to resolve supposed issues, such as delivery address or payment of additional fees, often leading to compromised credentials. 
 Fake charities – Preying on the goodwill of people during the holidays, attackers create deceptive websites impersonating charities to solicit donations. 
 Fake order receipts – Cybercriminals mimic well-known, reputable retailers by sending fake order receipts through email. These emails contain links supposedly allowing the recipient to cancel or modify their order, tricking them into visiting phishing sites where their credentials are compromised. 
 
<p>While most attacks are targeted toward consumers, organizations should also be alert. Employees often use corporate devices such as laptops and mobile phones for holiday shopping, potentially risking the compromise of business accounts and applications. In addition, many users reuse passwords across personal and corporate accounts, making them susceptible to credential stuffing attacks.</p>
<p>Phishing-Resistant Passwordless MFA</p>
<p>Certificate-based authentication (CBA) with Bluetooth proximity is the highest assurance phishing-resistant MFA option available in the market. It is the most recommended approach to securing access to organizational resources and data for users including employees, contractors, and B2B customers.</p>
<p>For most consumer use cases, passkeys are starting to gain adoption as the phishing-resistant MFA that utilizes a user’s smartphone to utilize cryptographic key pairs when authenticating users to applications or services. Passkeys are generally multi-device enabled with the private key stored across a user’s device ecosystem and in their platform’s cloud account (i.e. iCloud, etc.).</p>
<p>Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication (RBA)</p>
<p>While phishing-resistant passwordless MFA provides enhanced security and protection against ATO attacks, enforcing a risk-based approach can help add additional layers of security while balancing security with user experience, only introducing friction in the process when necessary. Risk inputs like travel velocity, behavioral biometrics, and other external risk feeds such as threat feeds, etc. can help evaluate the risk score of a user during an authentication event, allowing for access to be blocked or requiring the user to use a different 2FA based on risk score thresholds.</p>
<p>Identity Verification (IDV)</p>
<p>Another common entry point for attackers is during password/MFA reset, where they can gain access to a user’s account by triggering a reset and adding additional authenticators to the account. Using identity verification solutions can help combat these attacks. Requiring users to verify their identity with physical credentials such as a driver’s license, passport, etc. can add another layer of defense in securing users against ATO attacks. IDV as a step-up authentication can help protect high-value transactions or out-of-policy/out-of-compliance users.</p>
<p>Combining phishing-resistant MFA with RBA and IDV offers a layered approach with defense in depth against identity-based attacks.

<p>As organizations collect larger data sets with potential insights into business activity, detecting anomalous data, or outliers in these data sets, is essential in discovering inefficiencies, rare events, the root cause of issues, or opportunities for operational improvements. But what is an anomaly and why is detecting it important?</p>



<p>Types of anomalies vary by enterprise and business function. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/anomaly-detection">Anomaly detection</a> simply means defining “normal” patterns and metrics—based on business functions and goals—and identifying data points that fall outside of an operation’s normal behavior. For example, higher than average traffic on a website or application for a particular period can signal a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> threat, in which case you’d want a system that could automatically trigger fraud detection alerts. It could also just be a sign that a particular marketing initiative is working. Anomalies are not inherently bad, but being aware of them, and having data to put them in context, is integral to understanding and protecting your business.</p>



<p>The challenge for IT departments working in data science is making sense of expanding and ever-changing data points. In this blog we’ll go over how machine learning techniques, powered by artificial intelligence, are leveraged to detect anomalous behavior through three different anomaly detection methods: supervised anomaly detection, unsupervised anomaly detection and semi-supervised anomaly detection.</p>



 Supervised learning 



<p>Supervised learning techniques use real-world input and output data to detect anomalies. These types of anomaly detection systems require a data analyst to label data points as either normal or abnormal to be used as training data. A machine learning model trained with labeled data will be able to detect outliers based on the examples it is given. This type of machine learning is useful in known outlier detection but is not capable of discovering unknown anomalies or predicting future issues.</p>



<p>Common machine learning algorithms for supervised learning include:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/knn">K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm</a>: This algorithm is a density-based classifier or regression modeling tool used for anomaly detection. Regression modeling is a statistical tool used to find the relationship between labeled data and variable data. It functions through the assumption that similar data points will be found near each other. If a data point appears further away from a dense section of points, it is considered an anomaly. 



 Local outlier factor (LOF): Local outlier factor is similar to KNN in that it is a density-based algorithm. The main difference being that while KNN makes assumptions based on data points that are closest together, LOF uses the points that are furthest apart to draw its conclusions.&nbsp; 
 



 Unsupervised learning 



<p>Unsupervised learning techniques do not require labeled data and can handle more complex data sets. Unsupervised learning is powered by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">deep learning</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a> or auto encoders that mimic the way biological neurons signal to each other. These powerful tools can find patterns from input data and make assumptions about what data is perceived as normal.</p>



<p>These techniques can go a long way in discovering unknown anomalies and reducing the work of manually sifting through large data sets. However, data scientists should monitor results gathered through unsupervised learning. Because these techniques are making assumptions about the data being input, it is possible for them to incorrectly label anomalies.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">Machine learning</a> algorithms for unstructured data include:</p>



<p>K-means: This algorithm is a data visualization technique that processes data points through a mathematical equation with the intention of clustering similar data points. “Means,” or average data, refers to the points in the center of the cluster that all other data is related to. Through data analysis, these clusters can be used to find patterns and make inferences about data that is found to be out of the ordinary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Isolation forest: This type of anomaly detection algorithm uses unsupervised data. Unlike supervised anomaly detection techniques, which work from labeled normal data points, this technique attempts to isolate anomalies as the first step. Similar to a “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/random-forest#:~:text=Random%20forest%20is%20a%20commonly,both%20classification%20and%20regression%20problems.">random forest</a>,” it creates “decision trees,” which map out the data points and randomly select an area to analyze. This process is repeated, and each point receives an anomaly score between 0 and 1, based on its location to the other points; values below .5 are generally considered to be normal, while values that exceed that threshold are more likely to be anomalous. Isolation forest models can be found on the free machine learning library for Python, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>.</p>



<p>One-class support vector machine (SVM): This anomaly detection technique uses training data to make boundaries around what is considered normal. Clustered points within the set boundaries are considered normal and those outside are labeled as anomalies.</p>



 Semi-supervised learning 



<p>Semi-supervised anomaly detection methods combine the benefits of the previous two methods. Engineers can apply unsupervised learning methods to automate feature learning and work with unstructured data. However, by combining it with human supervision, they have an opportunity to monitor and control what kind of patterns the model learns. This usually helps to make the model’s predictions more accurate.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/linear-regression#:~:text=Resources-,What%20is%20linear%20regression%3F,is%20called%20the%20independent%20variable.">Linear regression</a>: This predictive machine learning tool uses both dependent and independent variables. The independent variable is used as a base to determine the value of the dependent variable through a series of statistical equations. These equations use labeled and unlabeled data to predict future outcomes when only some of the information is known.</p>



 Anomaly detection use cases 



<p>Anomaly detection is an important tool for maintaining business functions across various industries. The use of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms will depend on the type of data being collected and the operational challenge being solved. Examples of anomaly detection use cases include:&nbsp;</p>



 Supervised learning use cases: 



 Retail 



<p>Using labeled data from a previous year’s sales totals can help predict future sales goals. It can also help set benchmarks for specific sales employees based on their past performance and overall company needs. Because all sales data is known, patterns can be analyzed for insights into products, marketing and seasonality.</p>



 Weather forecasting 



<p>By using historical data, supervised learning algorithms can assist in the prediction of weather patterns. Analyzing recent data related to barometric pressure, temperature and wind speeds allows meteorologists to create more accurate forecasts that take into account changing conditions.</p>



 Unsupervised learning use cases: 



 Intrusion detection system 



<p>These types of systems come in the form of software or hardware, which monitor network traffic for signs of security violations or malicious activity. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to detect potential attacks on a network in real-time, protecting user information and system functions.</p>



<p>These algorithms can create a visualization of normal performance based on time series data, which analyzes data points at set intervals for a prolonged amount of time. Spikes in network traffic or unexpected patterns can be flagged and examined as potential security breaches.</p>



 Manufacturing  



<p>Making sure machinery is functioning properly is crucial to manufacturing products, optimizing quality assurance and maintaining supply chains. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be used for predictive maintenance by taking unlabeled data from sensors attached to equipment and making predictions about potential failures or malfunctions. This allows companies to make repairs before a critical breakdown happens, reducing machine downtime.</p>



 Semi-supervised learning use cases: 



 Medical 



<p>Using machine learning algorithms, medical professionals can label images that contain known diseases or disorders. However, because images will vary from person to person, it is impossible to label all potential causes for concern. Once trained, these algorithms can process patient information and make inferences in unlabeled images and flag potential reasons for concern.</p>



 Fraud detection 



<p>Predictive algorithms can use semi-supervised learning that require both labeled and unlabeled data to detect fraud. Because a user’s credit card activity is labeled, it can be used to detect unusual spending patterns.</p>



<p>However, fraud detection solutions do not rely solely on transactions previously labeled as fraud; they can also make assumptions based on user behavior, including current location, log-in device and other factors that require unlabeled data.</p>



 Observability in anomaly detection 



<p>Anomaly detection is powered by solutions and tools that give greater observability into performance data. These tools make it possible to quickly identify anomalies, helping prevent and remediate issues. IBM® Instana™ Observability leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to give all team members a detailed and contextualized picture of performance data, helping to accurately predict and proactively troubleshoot errors.</p>



<p>IBM watsonx.ai™ offers a powerful generative AI tool that can analyze large data sets to extract meaningful insights. Through fast and comprehensive analysis, IBM watson.ai can identify patterns and trends which can be used to detect current anomalies and make predictions about future outliers. Watson.ai can be used across industries for a variety business needs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved configurability for organizations that uses PIV / CAC 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last year since we announced the General Availability of Certificate-based Authentication (CBA), we’ve seen an increase of over 850% in Entra ID CBA usage for US Government customers. CBA helps our customers in their Zero Trust journey, migrating from on-premises IdPs such as AD FS, while continuing to provide familiar end user experience using PIV / CAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We continue our investments in cloud-based CBA with recently added capabilities that allow you to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group. You can now select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multifactor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Adopting secure defaults, aligned with “Secure by design, secure by default” approach outlined by CISA 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/">Secure Future Initiative</a>. As part of this initiative, we will start <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=132044">Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies</a>. These initiatives align with the “Secure by design, Secure by default” approach called out by The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), to ensure consumers can trust the safety and integrity of the technology that they use every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that tackling cybersecurity challenges is a collective effort. We're dedicated to collaborating closely with government agencies, security experts, and the broader community to strengthen our collective defenses against cyber threats. Our aim is to provide government customers with the tools and knowledge they need to stay ahead of evolving risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent releases and ongoing commitment to enhancing cybersecurity will support our broad set of customers, including the U.S. government customers who are working to meet the Executive Order. Together, we can build a more secure digital future.</p>

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees includes managing which SaaS applications they need access to and which they need to be removed from. Many small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) do this with something lovingly (or not so lovingly) called The SpreadsheetTM.</p>
<p>A new employee joins the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee left the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee changed their name? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, when the annual access review comes along, everyone asks: How accurate is The Spreadsheet? And as your company grows, the more employees you have, the more applications you use, the more digitally connected you are — the more complicated The Spreadsheet gets.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet method had its day, but you can see how it might prevent SMBs from leveling up and even unintentionally add operational, technical, and security debt to take care of later. It is possible to automate granting and revoking access and permissions by using APIs for many applications. But there are some substantial barriers:</p>
<p>It’s nobody’s job (yet). Small companies are often strapped, and maybe you don’t have a dedicated headcount that can own the process of <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">updating employee application access</a>.</p>
<p>The app doesn’t have an API. With some applications, the only way to update permissions is in the app itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">expensive SSO tax</a> gets in the way. Using automation software like Okta, for example, forces you to implement technological protocols you just don’t need yet. It’s expensive and can be disruptive to users.&nbsp;</p>
 A better way to automate IT permissions 
<p>Because it’s so easy to implement, more modern application vendors have adopted “Sign in with Google,” and they don’t charge for it. This means that if you use Google Workspace, the need for SAML-based SSO (like Okta) is nearly obsolete. And get this — 70% of startups and SMBs already operate on Google Workspace to begin with!</p>
<p>YeshID helps Google Super Admins create a streamlined, repeatable, efficient, and compliant way to manage identities and applications. Using templates, you can automate creating a Google user and putting them in the proper organization and groups. This also triggers the creation of a task list of apps they need access to and automatically sends requests for provisioning to the proper admins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, we’re testing an even easier way to do this: If the application offers the ability to read the list of users on lower subscription tiers, we’ll actually keep the list up to date for you. And soon, we’ll have the ability to add the user for you too (if that capability exists in lower subscription tiers).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, we have integrations with Slack, Notion, and Hubspot. Once enabled, syncing users from those applications to YeshID can be done with a click of a button.&nbsp;</p>
 Give it a go 
<p>YeshID is in beta and looking for folks who sit in that sweet spot where you want to ditch The Spreadsheet but don’t want to go all in on Okta. If this is you, <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">learn more</a>! We’re already <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-new-era-of-secure-it-identity-management-yeshid-soc-ii-and-you/">SOC II compliant</a>, we’re in the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/yeshid_onboard/456377342688">Google Workspace Marketplace</a>, and you have a big ol’ DELETE button if you decide it’s not for you. </p>

It concludes on Dec 21. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF68   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF68 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Today, we’re thrilled to unveil the details of our Ignite announcement and introduce new features and APIs for Permissions Management, enhancing your overall permissions management experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Permissions Management app in the ServiceNow app store (Generally Available) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can now request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)) via the ServiceNow portal. This integration will strengthen organizations’ Zero Trust posture by adding permission requests to existing approval workflows in ServiceNow, making it possible to enforce the principle of least privilege in multicloud environments. To learn more about this, please visit <a href="http://aka.ms/ServiceNowPoD">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s been a busy few months at Ubisecure with a number of presentations at various events throughout Europe – some of which are available on-demand on our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/video-resources/" title="<span>Video Resources page</span>">Video Resources page</a>. It is great to be at the events, hearing from other industry experts, meeting new people, and not least getting direct feedback from live audiences as you present. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our core topics we’ve been presenting is getting great interest and engagement, and that is the notion of Identity Context.</p>
 What is Identity Context? 
<p>In business transactions, Identity Context helps to understand the parties involved in a transaction, including their roles, representative rights, responsibilities, and the nature of their engagement in a specific transaction.</p>
<p>Our work at Ubisecure is driven by our shared vision on the future of digital identity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine a highly assured organisation identity with a strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve written in depth about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/true-b2b-iam/" title="highly assured organisation identity">highly assured organisation identity</a>, and how the value of strongly authenticated individual identity is well known. However, it is the act of combining those two identity classes that gives actual context to the potential interaction and defines the rights of the individual. It is this resultant combined identity that defines the Identity Context and enables the presentation of an aggregated/generated set of rights that are appropriate in that context.</p>
 The Value of Context 
<p>We all use the value of Identity Context implicitly, often without realising it, but in those circumstances, it is almost always ‘manually’ or at best with administrative control.</p>
<p>In direct interactions we often add context automatically – consider introducing yourself to a new teacher at your child’s school: ‘Hi I’m X, mother/father of Y’. Adding the parental relationship immediately adds context to the interaction and context to your presented identity. Alternatively, it’s almost certain that the first slide of any presentation you have given has established your Identity Context with the audience by including your name and your job title.</p>
<p>The context allows bounds to be known in the scope of the interaction. Additionally, that context will define rights that the individual can assert because they are acting in that context.</p>
 The Complexity of Context 
<p>Identity Context has value, and we use it already. So, how complex can it be? In short, very complex.</p>
<p>Context is, well, contextual. For a given individual they will operate in many differing contexts at differing times; they may even operate in multiple contexts at the same time. When operating in multiple contexts these can be independent or combined.</p>
<p>Add to this that the rate of change of contexts can be high; either as demanded by external changes, or as demanded by the process itself. A great example of this is privilege application management, where best security practice calls for least privilege by default and shortest possible time of increased privilege. The broader context might not change for several hours, but within that there will be fast-moving point in time contexts (with associated rights) that need to take effect in real time.</p>
<p>The idea of fast-moving context actually meshes very well with the current ‘buzz’ around Zero Trust. Zero Trust is often described as ‘authenticate always, authenticate often’ but in implementation ‘authenticate’ becomes ‘authorise’, noting that you must be known (authenticated) to be authorised.</p>
<p>Authorising often allows for rights to be modified as time and context change.</p>
 The Risks of Context 
<p>Context defines rights, and often responsibilities. In the previous two examples the context was self-declared. Self-declaration is ‘efficient’, but also sits as the root cause for most fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Referring back to our vision, discussed at the start of this blog, for a moment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine a highly assured organisation identity with a strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>We talk about a highly assured organisation identity and a strongly authenticated individual identity – we actually get most value when that individual identity is highly assured as well. But there is a third item that needs to have an assurance level – the ‘combination’.</p>
<p>The combination is the linkage between the two identity types. In the examples above, we have Parent and Employee as the specific linkage.</p>
<p>The linkage can be self-declared, verbally – “I am the parent of” – which is a low assurance declaration and therefore, a low assurance combination. Alternatively, that linkage can be verified, for example through a birth certificate and passports.</p>
<p>The assurance level of the linkage directly affects the value of the Identity Context.</p>
<p>For a given eco-system, the assurance levels of identities and linkage will be defined by a Governance Framework. We see a great example of this in the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/vlei/">vLEI</a> eco-system (based on verifiable credentials), defined by the GLEIF and supported by Ubisecure. The assurance levels of the organisation, individual and the linkage between the two are prescribed along with process definitions that will, when executed, preserve that assurance level.</p>
 In summary… 
<p>Identity Context enables significant value – we have seen and talked about a Northern European Government case study (see below) that realised a 99% saving from establishing a highly assured Identity Context and then allowing that to be delegated.</p>
<p>Knowing ‘who you are’ is not sufficient, we need to know the rights you have for the given ‘interaction’.</p>

 Why you should Regularly Review your Cyber Security 
 
<p>Cyber security is never done – you need to constantly work to improve your organization’s cyber security readiness.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive-wahlefeld-cyber-threat-landscape">Cyber adversaries never sleep</a> and the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80854/cyber-risks-from-china-how-contract-negotiations-can-mitigate-it-risks">geopolitical tensions across the world</a> are raising the cyber security threat levels.</p>
 
 Technology is evolving 
 
<p>The technology landscape is evolving creating new opportunities as well as new threats.&nbsp; Lange Language Models (LLMs) have evolved beyond what was thought practical only a few years ago and conversational Artificial Intelligence engines are now a commodity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations are adopting these to provide improved efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and a better connection with their customers, partners, and suppliers.&nbsp; However, while LLMs provide <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-lichtenthaler-human-and-artificial-intelligence">great opportunities</a>, they also bring <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/artificial-intelligence-cre23">new cyber threats</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI involves a new kind of development pipeline and current system development methodologies and tools are not yet adapted to this.&nbsp; Can you be sure of the provenance of your training data? Can you trust the shared LLM?&nbsp; Can you be sure that the deployed inference engine has not been poisoned?</p>
<p>LLMs represent an entirely new form of cloud workload.&nbsp; Current Cloud Native Application Platforms (CNAPP) and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81219/cloud-security-posture-management">Cloud Security Posture Management&nbsp; (CSPM)</a> do not cover these.</p>
<p>However, LLMs provide powerful capabilities to enhance the identification of cyber risks, the detection of active threats and the response to and recovery from cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations cannot afford to neglect the new opportunities but must prepare for these new threats. &nbsp;They must also exploit these new capabilities to improve their cyber security.</p>
 
 Standards and Regulations are Developing 
 
<p>The standards and best practice frameworks for cyber security are changing to respond to the increasing level of cyber threats and to incorporate the latest industry insights into how to best respond to these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 27001 The widely used information <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/27001">security standard ISO/IEC 27001</a> was updated in 2022. &nbsp;This new standard includes completely new controls covering - Threat intelligence, Information security for use of Cloud services, ICT readiness for business continuity, Physical security monitoring, Configuration management, Information deletion, Data masking, Data leakage prevention, Monitoring activities, Web filtering and Secure coding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your organization complies with ISO 27001 you will be required to update your controls to meet the new standard when next certified.&nbsp; Are your IT service providers and cloud services certified to the new standard?</p>
<p>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) v2.0 &nbsp;- On <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2023/nist-releases-cybersecurity-framework-2-0-draft#:~:text=The%20CSF%202.0%20draft%20reflects,CSF%E2%80%94especially%20for%20creating%20profiles.">August 8, 2023</a>, NIST released a draft of the NIST CSF 2.0, making the most significant revision to the framework since its inception in 2014. The draft includes the CSF itself and a discussion draft of implementation examples. NIST intends to release the final version in early 2024 without issuing another version for public comments.</p>
<p>NIST’s CSF 2.0 version 2.0 introduces significant changes to the cybersecurity landscape to address evolving threats and make the framework more accessible to all types of organizations. The draft reflects community feedback and industry shifts, emphasizes the role of cybersecurity as a key enterprise risk, and expands its scope beyond critical infrastructure. The CSF now includes six core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, recover and the new “govern” function, which focuses on decision making in support of a cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>If your organization bases its approach to cyber security on this framework you need to plan for transition to the updated version.&nbsp; Are you ready for this transition?</p>
<p>EU NIS 2 - In the wake of increased cyber-attacks on national critical infrastructure, authorities around the world are imposing stricter requirements on organizations that their populations rely on for a wide range of essential services, which includes a wide and growing number of private companies that should be preparing now to meet their new obligations.</p>
<p>Notably the EU issued the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj">Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive in 2016</a>&nbsp;and the US saw the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a>&nbsp;on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity in 2021. But European authorities are now seeking to go even further with an update to the NIS Directive, known as NIS2, which is expected to go into force by the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, NIS2 has a much wider scope, going beyond the traditional critical national infrastructure providers to include a range of organizations that are essential for the normal functioning of society, which include both EU and non-EU organizations that will have to ensure their compliance in future.</p>
<p>Is your organization <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-digital-frontier-cre23">ready to comply with its obligations</a> under these new regulations.</p>
 
 Reviewing your cyber security 
 
<p>Business objectives, organizational best practices, and technologies are constantly evolving.&nbsp; It is essential to continuously review your organization’s performance in the light of these changes. To support these reviews, KuppingerCole provides Maturity Level Matrices that are specifically targeted to distinct areas of cyber security.</p>
<p>These are based on the five-point maturity scale formulated using the Carnegie Mellon Maturity Index (CMMI).&nbsp; Note that this is currently <a href="https://cmmiinstitute.com/products/cmmi/content-release">being enhanced</a> to &nbsp;include best practices for measuring capability and improving performance in the areas of people management, data management, and virtual work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessing maturity based on this model is complex and to organizations to accomplish this task for cyber security <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80839/maturity-level-matrix-for-cyber-security">we publish two matrixes</a> that describe the key areas that must be considered when assessing cyber security maturity.&nbsp; There are two matrices one covering cyber security organizational and management maturity and the other technological maturity. These are summarized below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Cyber security organizational and management maturity</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: Cyber Security Technological maturity levels</p>
<p>KuppingerCole provides deep research into all the areas of cyber security.&nbsp; There also are many useful sessions from our cyberevolution event including how the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5421/1">hackers can exploit AI</a>, the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5430/1">regulatory challenges to the financial industry from DORA</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5469/1">practical advice on cloud security.</a></p>

<p>Let’s face it, organizations face many barriers to offering privacy products.</p>



<p>For companies that offer consumers pieces of the privacy and security puzzle, innovating and expanding offerings to adjacent – and in-demand – capabilities is often too expensive, takes too long, and falls outside of the core strength of the company offering the solution.</p>



<p>There’s a wide range of solutions that consumers “should” be using, but rarely are they motivated enough to do the hard work necessary to research, select, purchase, implement, and use all those solutions. Consequently, they use what they have been forced to use because of a security incident or they use the tools that come with their mainstream technology purchases or broader offerings.</p>



<p>Organizations playing in the privacy and online safety arena could benefit enormously from expanding their product offerings to cover adjacent areas – creating an easily acquired and easily implemented “one-stop-shop” where consumers get all they need from a brand they already trust.<br><br>Take these examples:</p>



 
 Insurance companies that offer identity theft insurance could package it with the technological solutions customers need to avoid falling victim in the first place. 



 Technology companies that offer cybersecurity capabilities, such as antivirus and malware protection, could add adjacent privacy and security offerings to complete the picture for consumers. 



 Vendors of specific privacy and online security services, such as credit monitoring, could boost customer loyalty and accelerate customer acquisition by also offering services their customers know they need but haven’t yet found an easy way to adopt. 



 Trusted general providers of goods and services, such as big box retailers and popular associations, could conveniently also offer online security products and services under the one roof, significantly increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.<br> 
 



 
 <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/11/removing-the-barriers-to-monetizing-privacy/">Read White Paper</a> 
 



 The challenge is real 



<p><br>Most organizations are not equipped to re-direct development resources to new products that fall outside of their established sweet spot. While they certainly could hire, ramp-up, and build these types of solutions from scratch, the time to a viable and profitable product offering may be too much.</p>



<p>But what if there was a way to add attractive and necessary privacy and online safety capabilities to existing products – or even as new products – quickly, easily, and completely and without the burden of developing them in house?</p>



 The solution is Sudo Platform 



<p>Anonyome Labs’ Sudo Platform is an API-first, developer-focused ecosystem that delivers the tools companies need to quickly and completely deliver to their customers the capabilities they need to protect and control their personal information while navigating the digital world. It is a powerful, modular, and quick-to-implement collection of the most important digital privacy and cyber safety tools for either mobile or desktop, and covering:</p>



 
 safe and private browsing including ad and tracker blocking and site reputation services 



 password management, automation, and security 



 virtual private network services 



 safe online commerce through virtual cards 



 a platform for decentralized identity including identity wallets, verifiable credentials services, and all the infrastructure necessary to make it real today 



 compartmentalization across all services so customers can easily partition their online interactions into purpose-specific identities (for example, one each for shopping, socializing, medical, travel, and so on). 
 







<p>Organizations use the set of scalable hosted services at the heart of Sudo Platform to quickly integrate these tools into any of their products or offerings and give their customers seamless access to them.</p>



<p></p>



 Sudo Platform is feature-packed 



<p>Developer-focused documentation</p>



<p>Thorough direction for how to build each of the Sudo Platform capabilities into applications are included in the <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/">documentation site</a>.</p>



<p>API-first ecosystem</p>



<p>Sudo Platform APIs power next-generation customer apps with privacy, cyber safety, and decentralized identity capabilities, to empower organizations to quickly put privacy in their customers’ hands.</p>



<p>SDK source code</p>



<p>Mobile, web and desktop SDKs can be easily incorporated into an existing application or used as building blocks for new applications. Each SDK is built to run natively on all supported platforms, so they have the highest chance of compatibility with a vendor’s applications, independent of the frameworks and architecture they employ.</p>



<p>Available <a href="https://github.com/sudoplatform">SDKs via GitHub</a> include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudos SDK&nbsp; 



 Telephony SDK&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Virtual Cards SDK&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Secure ID Verification SDK&nbsp; 



 Email SDK&nbsp; 



 Site Reputation SDK&nbsp; 



 VPN SDK&nbsp; 



 Password Manager SDK.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Sample apps</p>



<p>Using a sample app is the fastest way to see how the Sudo Platform services work and the value they deliver. Vendors can easily explore the technology and imagine the potential for their products, either as an enhancement or brand new offering.</p>



<p>Sample apps are intended to be lightweight reference apps that demonstrate to application developers basic SDK capabilities. <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asudoplatform+sample">Sample iOS, Android, and web apps available include</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Telephony Sample App&nbsp; 



 Email Sample App&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Secure ID Verification Sample App&nbsp; 



 Password Manager Sample App&nbsp; 



 Ad and Tracker Blocker Sample App&nbsp; 



 Site Reputation Sample App. 
 



<p>Brandable apps and UI kits</p>



<p>For the fastest route to market, Sudo Platform offers brandable (white label) apps and UI kits. These enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications which can an organization can quickly brand and deliver to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms.</p>



<p>A UI kit gives access to libraries of advanced software modules with complex data and graphical flows that go beyond basic Sudo Platform service access, including:</p>



 
 complex business logic for data management and functional utilities that span one or more of the Sudo Platform services 



 UI kit, which includes widgets, screens and minor user flows that give recommended user experiences for a feature and can be integrated into your application. 
 



<p>Sudo Platform management console</p>



<p>The management console is where the organization manages administrative users and end users and gains critical insight into the analytics underlying a deployment and into ways to enhance the Sudo Platform experience. It gives insight into:</p>



 
 deployed Sudo Platform services 



 authentication 



 billing 



 entitlements. 
 



 Sudo Platform meets customers’ current and future needs

<p>For generations, teams have <a href="https://doodle.com/en/resources/blog/a-brief-history-of-meetings/?ref=blog.holochain.org">collaborated in physical rooms</a> using materials like whiteboards, sticky notes, and printed documents laid out on tables. While collaboration can be one of those “suitcase words” that is full of different meanings depending on the person you ask, it’s an enduring part of most of our work lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Dedicated spaces enabled the kinds of fluid interaction and embodied cognition which, in turn, drives complex projects forward.</p><p>With today's increasingly distributed digital work environments and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/01/why-labor-economists-say-the-remote-work-revolution-is-here-to-stay.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">work from home</a> setups, can elements of dynamic in-person teamwork successfully be recreated online?</p><p>As video meetings and productivity suites become default remote work tools, teams strive to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/revolutionizing-the-workspace/">recreate collaborative dynamics digitally</a>. However, experts argue purely digital collaboration has inherent limits.</p><p>This article explores: lessons from physical group flow, key aspects to replicate collaboration digitally, remaining gaps, and the potential of immersive and distributed platforms still on the horizon, like Holochain.&nbsp;</p> The Magic of Physical Spaces <p>For Hailey Cooperrider, game designer and co-founder of collaborative consultancy <a href="https://amble.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Amble</a>, physical spaces enable a “magic” that digital platforms struggle to recreate.&nbsp;</p><p>She argues spatial dynamics like rooms allow more holistic group participation than 2D screens, stating, “I think being in a space with the whiteboard and having room to collaborate together isn’t just for the creative piece. It’s about dealing with complexity.”</p><p>Cooperrider also discusses how “literally, we think, with movement, with our hands, and with other parts of our bodies. And that cognition happens throughout the body.”&nbsp;</p><p>While this radiating, embodied cognition isn’t limited virtually, it certainly thrives in environments where teams can gather together physically.</p><p>When complex creativity and collaboration is required (such as in large groups), in-person spaces currently provide a fluidity that digital tools have difficulty replicating. Large meetings require quick back-and-forth communication among a large number of people — which is more time-consuming on the computer.&nbsp;</p> Bridging Physical &amp; Digital Workflows <p>When considering how to translate collaborative dynamics online, Cooperrider discusses the importance of preserving certain familiar artifacts digitally. For example, she notes that her team relies heavily on Trello's digital task boards to mimic physical sticky notes for project management.</p><p>“We love it, because it just smooths out what would normally be sticky notes, and allows us to bring our own meaning to the lists and the columns," she explains. Rather than prescribe complex new workflows, Trello provides flexibility for groups to organize work their own way.</p><p>Cooperrider also discusses how engineers often focus on operational challenges like reducing friction in workflows. However, she argues digital tools actually work best when preserving existing collaborative platforms and workflows that teams are already familiar with.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Google Suite took traditional formats for documents, slides, and spreadsheets, and made them editable in real-time by multiple users online. Rather than adding complicated features to these tools, it kept them simple — and added the utility of collaboration.</p><p>Cooperrider concludes that "the most revolutionary, powerful, and most popular collaboration tool, it’s the Google Suite.”</p><p>While new technologies open new possibilities, they must also integrate the traditional techniques teams have relied on for years, in order to maximize adoption and usage. The future likely involves blending physical “magic” with virtual capabilities.</p> People-First Tools in a Hybrid Future <p>While digital collaboration tools have delivered immense progress, the next horizons explore decentralized and distributed models giving users more control, as with Holochain. Rather than enforce rigid conformity, the ideal future blends customizable peer-to-peer frameworks with thoughtfully designed physical spaces.</p><p>Tools must smooth, not obstruct, the rituals sustaining teams. And digital interactive spaces should spark the embodied cognition inherent to human collaboration. As remote and hybrid work expand, integrating the digital connectivity teams need with the in-person magic they crave is essential.</p><p>The frontier of collaboration technology puts people before platforms, deepening what is uniquely precious about gathering in rooms with resonant virtual capabilities. In the end, innovation emerges from groups in flow — whether particles across cables or shoulder-to-shoulder around whiteboards</p>

<p>In the wake of the hack at MOVEit and far too many other organizations this year, the secure, user-controlled, privacy-preserving benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) make it a critical component of a modern identity and access management (IAM) architecture.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1248857/moveit-carnage-continues-with-over-2600-organizations-and-77m-people-impacted-so-far.html">one breach</a> alone has impacted 2,620 organizations—including Genworth, antivirus providers Avast and Norton, and the US Department of Energy—and 77.2 million people worldwide. The sheer volume of credentials and personal information compromised through downstream attacks is yet to be determined. But the incident and so many others like it drive home one of the biggest challenges of the digital age.</p>
<p>While centralized IAM consolidated the storage and management of identity data and enabled login credentials to be associated with user roles and permissions easily, it also created a single point of failure that cybercriminals continue to exploit to gain access to all the resources those credentials are authorized to access. Call us crazy, but at 1Kosmos, we believe a big part of preventing threat actors from stealing and weaponizing credentials and personally identifiable information (PII) is to avoid centrally storing them in the first place.</p>
 IAM Private &amp; Permissioned: Why DLT Is a BFD 
<p>In Parts <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">2</a> and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/ditching-the-feds-why-decentralized-digital-identity-is-key-to-effective-iam/">3</a> in this series, we look at how the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">1Kosmos architecture</a> provides a reliable and secure way to verify the identity of users and<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/"> biometrically authenticate</a> them via decentralized digital identity (DID) mechanisms in our BlockID solution—including a reusable <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">digital identity wallet</a>. The next pillar of our architectural advantage is distributed ledger technology for providing a private and permissioned blockchain that eliminates the centralized PII honeypot for good.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology has several security features that provide a proven way to manage and maintain digital property rights. Think user-controlled data, peer-to-peer, cryptographically secure sharing without an administrative intermediary, and an immutable digital “chain of custody” containing a detailed digital audit log of all user authentications. That makes it an ideal technology for managing and protecting users’ digital identity wallets, which can store a wide range of information—personal details, legal and educational credentials, financial accounts, digital health records, and more. The private and permissioned distributed ledger within BlockID delivers several key advantages, including the following.</p>
<p>Privacy by Design</p>
<p>Without a centralized administration authority, our private and permissioned blockchain technology gives individuals sole access and control of all personally identifiable information. This privacy-by-design approach enables end users to view and approve or reject the sharing of any and all information requested by online services or systems they seek to access. All PII is encrypted end-to-end, so it’s never exposed. Users approve or reject sharing requests directly with the applications and systems they connect to—without a third-party intermediary accessing their data. No external public key server, host messaging server, or other entity can access the keys or plaintext messages.</p>
<p>An Immutable Audit Trail</p>
<p>Like a public blockchain, our private and permissioned ledger retains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all events, enabling visibility to all logins, access attempts, information updates, and shared information related to a digital identity. This private ledger acts as a closed network where information from separate organizations or lines of business can be stored separately—each with its own private ledger. This extraordinary level of audit and visibility helps prevent unauthorized access and fraudulent transactions, providing a high level of assurance for the identity behind the device.</p>
<p>Industry Certification for Unrivaled Performance</p>
<p>We built the first (and only) architecture designed to support and exceed the industry’s strictest standards for security and convenience. Because BlockID follows the W3C specifications and is certified to <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a>, and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>, it uses public-private key cryptography to record and access all information. The private keys are stored in the secure enclave or TPM chip of the endpoint or the user’s device, which can be secured to the very highest digital standard of IAL2/AAL2 supported by NIST—ensuring credentials never leave the user’s device and are never stored on a server, eliminating the risk of credentials theft, replay attacks, or even user tracking. The next highest level of IAL3/AAL3 is generally reserved for human verification but can be achieved via agent-assisted authentication through 1Kosmos partners.</p>
<p>Security That Gives the PII Honeypot the Heave-Ho</p>
<p>In addition to the public-private key security used for encryption, signing, and making relationships with other parties afforded by the certifications above, 1Kosmos LiveID biometrics are certified to <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta DEA EPCS</a> specifications, providing assurance of liveness and achieving a false match rate of less than 0.1% at 95% confidence interval. Best of all, our private and permissioned ledger ensures there’s no central honeypot of user PII for hackers to target—further defeating the risk of ransomware and data breaches.</p>
<p>Support for a Wide Array of IAM Use Cases</p>
<p>With irrefutable proof of identity and an immutable, tamper-proof audit log of all updates and access attempts, our private and permissioned blockchain gives organizations the speed and agility they need to focus on building customer loyalty and capture market share from less tech-savvy rivals. In the conclusion of this series, we’ll look at how the 1Kosmos architecture enables reusable, verified credentials across a variety of IAM use cases—from “inferred” identity based on email address or device, to cross-referencing biometrics with government-issued forms of ID, to the very highest levels of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) mandates, and more.</p>

  <p>At Ignite 2022, we announced the general availability of Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA) as part of Microsoft’s commitment to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a>. Based on our experience working with government customers, PIV/CAC cards are the most common authentication method used within the federal government. While valuable for all customers, the ability to use X.509 certificate for authentication directly against Entra ID is particularly critical for federal government organizations using PIV/CAC cards and looking to easily comply with the Executive Order 14028 requirements as well as customers who want to migrate from a federated server like Active Directory Federated Server to Entra ID for CBA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve added many new features and enhancements, which made CBA available on all platforms, including mobile, with support for certificates on devices as well as external security keys like YubiKeys. Customers now have more control and flexibility to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group and select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multi-factor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vimala Ranganathan, Product Manager on Microsoft Entra, will now talk about how these new features will help in your journey toward phishing-resistant MFA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>--  &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello everyone,   &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m Vimala from the Microsoft Entra PM team, and I’m excited to walk you through all the new features and enhancements to CBA in detail. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA username bindings CBA added support for three remaining username bindings and is now at parity with on-premises Active Directory. The three bindings that are being added are: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 IssuerAndSerialNumber  &nbsp; 
 IssuerAndSubject  &nbsp; 
 Subject Only  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The username binding policy allows admins to customize how Entra ID will match the certificate being presented by the user with their user account in Entra ID. By default, we map Principal Name in the subject Alternative Name (SAN) attribute of the certificate to UserPrincipalName in the user object. An admin can override the default and create a custom mapping. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Authentication policy rules help determine the strength of authentication as either single-factor or multi-factor.&nbsp;Unlike other authentication methods available in Entra ID, which are either always, CBA is capable of being either. We like to refer to this as CBA being a multi-factor capable authentication method, and the authentication policy rules allow the admin to configure protection levels to determine when Entra ID should consider a certificate to be single-factor or multi-factor. Multiple custom authentication binding rules can be created to assign default protection level for certificates based on the certificate attributes (Issuer or Policy OID or by combining the Issuer and OID).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Affinity Binding refers to certificate attributes used for validating a certificate for user authentication. As we introduced earlier, there are several ways a certificate can be bound or matched to a user object. Some methods rely on properties of a user’s certificate that are easily reusable. This reusability characteristic is the key indicator to whether a particular user binding method is High (strong) or Low (weak) affinity. For example, implementing a user binding based on SAN Principal Name would be low affinity, whereas a user binding policy based on Issuer+SerialNumber would be high affinity. Entra ID allows admins to set affinity binding at tenant level, as well as create custom rules to use high affinity or low affinity mapping for covering many potential scenarios our customers have in use today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA as second factor will now support CBA as one of the factors to get multifactor authentication (MFA) to access Entra resources.

<p>CBA with single-factor strength&nbsp;</p>


<p>Passwordless Phone Sign in (PSI)&nbsp;</p>

<p>CBA (single-factor or multi-factor strength)&nbsp;</p>


<p>Something you know + Something you have&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA as Most Recently Used (MRU) method is set once a user authenticates successfully using CBA, and the user's MRU authentication method is set to CBA. Next time, when the user enters their UPN and clicks&nbsp;Next, the user is taken to the CBA method directly and need not select&nbsp;‘Use the certificate or smart card.’ To reset the MRU method, the user needs to cancel the certificate picker, click&nbsp;‘Other ways to sign in,’ and select another method available to the user and authenticate successfully.

<p>Digital wallets have emerged as a preferred payment method in the Middle East and Africa, and customers are willing to leave their wallets at home rather than their phones. Offering digital payment solutions and pursuing a digital transformation is key for banks to stay competitive.</p>
<p>On November 7, 2023, we hosted a <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/593634?utm_source=Entrust&amp;utm_medium=brighttalk&amp;utm_campaign=593634">webinar</a> with Izabela Morriss, Vice President of Global Channel Sales &amp; Tech Partnerships at CR2, and Andy Cease, Director of Product Marketing Financial Issuance at Entrust. During this engaging thought leadership discussion, we gained valuable insights into the payment preferences of cardholders in the Middle East and Africa, as well as the challenges financial institutions face in offering a digital-first customer experience.</p>
<p>Here is what we heard from them:</p>
 
 Adoption of digital payments in the Middle East and Africa 
 
 
<p>Contactless payments are rapidly gaining popularity in the Middle East and Africa. People love the convenience and speed of making payments with contactless cards and digital wallets.</p>
<p>This drive for convenience is advancing the convergence of speed and simplicity, alongside elevated security measures. Contactless payments, appreciated for their convenience and speed, are quickly gaining popularity in the Middle East and Africa. Globally, demand is also increasing, but it’s particularly flourishing in this region.</p>
<p>In a 2022 McKinsey report, 60% of global respondents said they prefer to leverage mobile wallets for their digital payments. With an 80%-90% smartphone penetration, it’s no wonder customers in the Middle East are seeking out seamless digital payment experiences (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-payments-in-the-middle-east">McKinsey, The future of payments in the Middle East, 2022</a>). Offering digital payment options is a way for banks and credit unions to answer this demand, differentiate themselves, and be perceived as modern and innovative leaders. If they don’t, they’ll be left behind and viewed as archaic and out of touch.</p>
<p>With quick and secure transactions, customers can easily pay anytime, anywhere, without the need for cash or physical cards. Digital cards are especially relevant for in-store use, but near field communication (NFC) payment from the banking app is a way of answering the need for instant and contactless digital payments.</p>
<p>Izabela from CR2 explained that they see a strong demand for customer-centric digital payment solutions. In both the Middle East and Africa, customers are showing an increasing interest in different payment solutions. They want innovative options and are looking at what is being proposed outside of the region. Customers are seeking secure, convenient, seamless digital payment experiences that align with their diverse requirements, be it for e-commerce, mobile apps, or in-store transactions. This shift highlights the urgency for banks to evolve and cater to these changing needs.</p>
<p>We see the rise of financial inclusion in Africa, characterized by its young population, is at the forefront of the continent’s mobile money transformation. This rise is underscored by a high penetration of mobile devices. Eighty four percent of internet users in Kenya used their mobile phones for payments, mirroring a similar trend where 60% of internet users in Nigeria and across Africa did the same. In 2021, East Africa reported 296 million registered mobile money accounts (<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27017/mobile-payment-in-africa/">2021 Statista Global Consumer Survey</a>).</p>
<p>These statistics highlight the profound impact mobile payments have on driving financial inclusion, particularly in Africa where there’s a need to reach the unbanked. This trend also presents a significant marketing opportunity for financial institutions. The push toward digital payments in the Middle East and Africa is largely driven by the intent to support financial inclusion. Facilitating banking services through digital channels allows even the unbanked and underserved populations to actively participate in the financial landscape, paving the way for empowered communities and fostering economic growth. In a world where 1.4 billion individuals remain unbanked (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services">World Bank Global Findex 2021 database</a>), the need for a significant shift is necessary.</p>
<p>In Africa, Izabela observes a market dynamic driven by the goal of reaching the unbanked population. There’s a noticeable trend of transitioning directly from mobile phone operator/money transfer services to mobile wallets, bypassing traditional physical payment cards.</p>
<p>The digital-first transformation in the Middle East stems from a demand for convenience, security, and a desire for financial institutions to provide a seamless customer journey. Mobile banking enables them to do that.</p>
 
 
 Why financial institutions want to offer contactless payments and digital card issuance 
 
 
<p>The innovation of tokenization has made digital card issuance possible. Banks want to innovate, keep their customers, and enhance convenience for their customers, ensuring satisfaction at every turn. Security is top of mind for cardholders as well as banks.</p>
<p>Izabela explains that banks in regions such as Ethiopia or Nigeria are particularly sensitive to questions of sustainability. Using tokenization for digital card issuance allows them to reduce their plastic usage, aligning with their sustainability goals.</p>
<p>The economy in Africa is still very cash-driven: 90% of transactions are made with cash (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-payments-in-africa">McKinsey, The future of payments in Africa, 2022</a>). There is a huge opportunity for banks to shift from cash-based transactions and pave the way for digital transactions. Again, this will also allow them to promote financial inclusion and transparency. Many countries have not fully adopted the physical payment card, and they are expected to skip the issuance of physical cards and directly adopt digital cards. Banks must be ready for this change. Izabela expects that digital wallets will dominate the payment landscape within the next two years. Several African central banks, such as those in Rwanda and Nigeria, are driving a vision of a cashless economy.</p>
<p>Differences in demand can be observed across diverse age groups. However, banks recognize that to stay competitive, they must offer very targeted, personalized customer journeys that cater to the varying demands of all demographics. Offering more capabilities within the mobile banking app ensures that it is at the core of the bank-customer relationship.</p>
<p>Banks can expect increased usage of their card portfolio, earlier activations, and broader outreach to diverse demographics, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction. Additionally, cost-saving incentives serve as an important motivator compelling financial institutions to provide digital payment solutions.</p>
<p>Moreover, traditional banks are increasingly feeling the competitive pressure from emerging players like neobanks, which continue to obtain banking licenses, compelling traditional institutions to remain relevant.</p>
 
 
 Challenges for banks to implement this 
 
 
<p>Answering the very diverse demands of cardholders has been made possible by innovations in the payment space during the last few years.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, security is top of mind, both for financial institutions and cardholders. Tokenized cards offer the highest level of security when it comes to payments. Andy from Entrust explained that tokenization enables the consumer to take control again, as the tokens are device-bound or market-bound, offering cardholders a very convenient experience. Tokenization technology, championed by major schemes like Visa and Mastercard, is a necessary prerequisite for the issuance of digital cards. To give a quick explanation: Tokenization substitutes sensitive card data with unique tokens tied to specific devices and use cases. This ensures secure transactions while enabling banks to minimize the risk of fraud. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/tokenization-enabling-the-intersection-of-data-security-and-exceptional-user-experiences/">This article</a> explains the functioning and value of tokenization more in detail.</p>
<p>And of course, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/entrust-digital-card-solution">digital card issuance</a> allows financial institutions to offer a digital-first user and payment experience.</p>
<p>While banks in the Middle East and Africa now want to take active steps toward a digital transformation, they also realize that it is not as simple as it may seem. They want to be innovative, but do not know where to start. Most banks struggle to combine a seamless, digital-first, innovative payment experience with the highest level of security, while keeping integration and maintenance of such a solution lightweight.</p>
<p>Izabela notes that most banks are starting to have a good understanding of tokenization; current operational discussions are around identifying the correct next steps and implementing technology for the benefit of the cardholder. Addressing legacy technology and infrastructure presents a significant challenge for banks. How can they leverage their existing resources to enable a digital wallet effectively? What role does the card management system play? Which tokenization partner should they choose? How can the digital wallet be embedded within the existing banking application?</p>
 
 
 Technology alliance partnership between CR2 and Entrust 
 
 
<p>We know that the digital revolution is here, and that banks need to transform their service model to meet the expectations for convenient banking that offers anywhere, anytime access. This is especially true in the Middle East and Africa. To resolve those challenges together, CR2 and Entrust have forged a partnership. The technology alliance between CR2 and Entrust gives CR2 customers confidence in the security of their digital payments while also providing user-friendly, seamless digital-first experiences.</p>
<p>By partnering with Entrust, CR2 leverages Entrust’s tokenization for NFC payment solutions, providing a fully comprehensive digital payments offering.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar: Is this the right time to invest in Identity and Access Management? This week Jesse Kurtto from Ubisecure has joined us to answer this question and discuss the current economic situation. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Today’s guest is Jesse Kurtto. Jesse’s career has gradually arched from the Wild West world of finance, to his current position as a Data Protection Officer and Data Scientist at Ubisecure. Learning Program before learning to read Finnish and visiting 25 countries before 25. He is no stranger to exploring unchartered waters and discovering connections that others might miss. Surrounded by a delicate balance of the latest technology and dozens of carefully tended houseplants, his secret hobby is writing to his beloved snail mail friends across the world. Welcome Jesse.</p>
<p>Jesse: Thank you for the invite, Oscar. Nice to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great having you, Jesse, definitely. We’re going to have a super interesting conversation about the market in Digital Identity and Identity and Access Management.</p>
<p>First of all, we always want to hear more about our guests. So please tell us a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Jesse: All right. So, like many or even most of us in the digital identity field, I actually never really actively sought to be a specialist, IAM specialist, on purpose. And my personal background is actually nothing technology even, but in finance and investing more specifically. So, a chance encounter and I liked the people who interviewed me and decided to stay for a while, and that while has been over seven years now. And I’m still learning something new every day, checking out how we really the world of digital identity like and frankly haven’t ever regretted decision. No two days have really been the same and the field continues to evolve and develop quite a bit every year.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent and definitely hearing at Ubisecure, we definitely appreciate having this – well call it, like a blend of knowledge – the financial market, not lesser than what you bring with the security and digital identity knowledge, very practical knowledge you also had. So, it’s always super interesting having those conversation with you.</p>
<p>And for the first time here on the podcast, we are going to have that, a bit more financial touch on that – What is coming, especially in this well this year, and I think also the years to come. The previous year and the year to come I think, we are already end of 2023 in which – well the financial situation is not good we’re going to talk about. But of course, no matter how the economy is, the companies organisation has to protect their services, have to upgrade the services, maintain them, so they have to invest some money in that.</p>
<p>So, from the perspective of companies who today need to upgrade their digital capabilities, what would you say is the piece of the current macroeconomic situation that they should know well? So that was at least what they should know well, from what is happening now?</p>
<p>Jesse: Well, first of all, we all know the macroeconomic situation hasn’t really been dancing on the roses over the past few years. But first, we had a massive shock with the COVID pandemic starting from spring 2020. Then we got massive economic stimulus to recover from that slump. And right after we were starting to climb up, then the war in Ukraine saw that all kinds of new problems everywhere around the world seemed to emerge just within three or four months.</p>
<p>The energy uncertainty in Europe and the economy went down the drain, and macroeconomic in quite a difficult situation here in Europe. But we would actually want to have some kind of stimulus in order to recover. But at the same time, we are suffering from quite persistently high inflation, which makes any kind of stimulus package basically equal to pouring more gasoline to the flames.</p>
<p>So, the European bank is really between a rock and a hard place here. And I can only look over the Atlantic to the States and be very jealous how they are able to both fight inflation and with high interest rates, five and a half percent this talking and meanwhile still have a blisteringly red-hot labour market all but there.</p>
<p>So, my first point would be that not all markets are equal. And the second important point is that now is actually a really great time to invest in any digital capabilities, including digital identities. Because now, we are in the middle of a small recession in Europe and investing in recession has historically been the very best time to invest in growth.</p>
<p>And if we think for a while, it actually makes perfect sense. After all, the alternative is to invest in the middle of a growth season when everybody else wants to invest in growth as well. Pushing prices even higher and reducing the availability of experts to help with these transformation projects. But now it’s still for a while kind of a buyer’s market.</p>
<p>So best time to invest in future growth is now.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, time to invest is now.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay. So, let’s go into what – because there are many things that the company can invest now and many things that many companies might need. But if you were one of the – chief executive, like CISO, or someone who is top decision makers in companies and there has to be some budget for digital identity. Thinking of – first of all broadly. Broadly but in digital identity, what would be the most important products that today would be the top priority for buying now?</p>
<p>Jesse: Today I would say that the absolute top priority would be – to establish really low friction user journeys from the very beginning account registration to the actual purchase, including solid online self-service. And now this low friction user journey is no way exclusive with security or compliance, but it is actually reaping the benefits of digitalisation. Digitalisation is ongoing, it’s accelerating, it’s unstoppable.</p>
<p>So, the question is for every organisation – should they try to fight this change to the last or embrace it and be among the first to actually reap its benefits. It’s actually interesting because my background in finance, the many finance sector operators were among the first to embrace digital identities, but they kind of stopped it halfway there; “Okay, we can build self-service portals for our users, but for many, many procedures we still require hand signed paper documents being sent via physical mail.” And this is really only reaping a very small part of the benefits of digitalisation. So, there is plenty to go.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Interesting what you say in finance services. That’s correct. For reasons of security had to be always in the latest of technology for security. But some of the process has been, as you say, very old fashioned like the old school, many paper fax I think still use or cheques. So, these kind of.</p>
<p>Jesse: Oh yes, those ones to.</p>
<p>Oscar: Still alive.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And it truly hurts the user experience a lot. It even causes direct missed opportunities. Let’s say new bond is coming to a market and you wish to buy a piece of it and participate. But if it takes three or four days just to do all the paperwork, then the opportunity has simply passed.</p>
<p>Oscar: And indeed, the price changed completely. Okay, so you say that the top is to – the user journey has to be digitalised. So, what is the category of products that address that?</p>
<p>Jesse: Would say a real CIAM system would be the one to go here, and not try to build the user journey from, let’s say 4 to 6-point solutions and then somehow glue them together. I think the best solution would be an IAM solution that’s designed for a whole user journey from the scratch and not something homemade or batched together.</p>
<p>Because when business grows, as it will eventually grow, no recession will last forever. And to user numbers pick up and suddenly there’s a nightmare of issues of having 4 to 6 different vendors and trying to keep their products up and running with ever increasing user numbers. And that again, is doing digitalisation the wrong way, if I may say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. CIAM being – so how, well the evolution of the more broadly speaking, Identity and Access Management. Maybe you can give us an overview of that evolution of the Identity and Access Management, what – how we started and what we have today.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, that’s a very interesting topic. Through the IAM are from big enterprise internal needs at once to employee numbers just grow to a certain level, they can’t be managed with excel sheets or pen and paper before that. But these kind of internal IAM solutions scale and fit really badly for end customer facing journeys. Internal users can always be taught how to use some kind of system, even if it’s not immediately logical or it feels unwieldy.</p>
<p>But for the customers, it’s not realistic to expect that they would spend tens of minutes or even hours to learn how to use some kind of system to log in. And no, they would simply instead put down their laptops, pick up the phone and call your customer service. So, it will actually just cost you more money to have this kind of system.</p>
<p>And now, in the past ten years, there have been massive uptake of different CIAM systems. And lately, let’s say after the pandemic, it’s interesting to see that now the full circle is coming back towards internal users with remote working. Remote working, different kind of partnerships, there are more kind of internal and kind of external users than ever, and trying to keep these as fully separate groups is very challenging.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. So, what about the investment of a company in Identity and Access Management? So what does that imply if the company does not have even, let’s say, a first personal CIAM or open source, something that they started, if they if the company really doesn’t, which actually to me surprise me that, you discover companies don’t have it, don’t have it, almost anything like identity access management and they are looking for some solutions or they are or they know that they need it. Maybe the decision has not come.</p>
<p>So why would you say is important for the buyers to know about the product, the Identity and Access Management product?</p>
<p>Jesse: That’s an interesting detail what you said that there’s still about 20-25% of companies in Europe that do not have any kind of Identity and Access Management system in place. So, one could argue that every IAM’s companies’ worst competitor is doing nothing. But to the question at hand, I’d say scalability is one very important thing, and compliance. If one doesn’t have any kind of identity management system in place, then it’s extremely hard to tell where and by who are the user identities actually stored.</p>
<p>And of course, that is a massive no in the eyes of the GDPR and this kind of adventures just don’t usually end up well. So first job would be to map out how many identities there are in the first place, how it has evolved over the recent quarters and where they are located, how many systems actually are connected, including partners, including systems like let’s say payroll providers, insurance providers, and usually the number is quite surprising. It can often be more than ten individual systems.</p>
<p>And now managing all these identities from a single centralised place is frankly a godsend compared to trying to manage this and plus sprawling network identity some here, some there. And of course, it also brings centralised identity management, also brings massive security benefits. For example, if you wish to revoke the access for, let’s say some external consultants that have already finished their projects, you only have one place to do it or you can even automate it.</p>
<p>But if the identities are in ten systems, 15 systems, then it’s really easy to forget just one. And who knows, maybe five, ten years later, one of those passwords will get breached and now the attacker gets to your system for free.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, what is normally called silos, identity silos. Having so many data repositories and it’s -through the years it’s easy to forget at least couple of those are forgotten but they are still there somewhere in there in some machine, in some server. So, the data is there.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And of course, I’ve heard many times the counterargument that it’s not wise to put all eggs in one basket, but when it comes to information security, we as the defenders must secure every single system that we use. But the attacker only needs to find one weak system to exploit.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, exactly. They can just find the forgotten one, the one that nobody remembers that.</p>
<p>So, what the company – the buyers should ask for a technology vendor? So, for a CIAM vendor? So, what are the most important things that’s should be – has to be asked to the vendors?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would ask them to demonstrate the self-service capabilities first. What exactly the users can and cannot accept less without external help? Meaning customer service assistance. Because that sets quite stringent limits on the benefits of digitalisation. And of course, all the usual user journeys should be handled by the system automatically. So, I would guess that any IAM project touches deeply.</p>
<p>So, I would first describe the challenges we are facing. And then I’d ask vendor to explain, just in plain English, that – how does the solution work and how does it actually solve the challenge that we just presented? And after all, one should never invest in anything that one doesn’t understand.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to address early in any IAM project is to what is actually included in the price and what isn’t. In order to actually accurately measure the TCO and how it would evolve as internal and external user base grows. And for example, there are many vendors out that charge ten to even hundred times for internal users compared to external users, and that’s not usually put on a large print on the front page.</p>
<p>And finally, I would discuss any coming changes in legislation because I would be very interested to know whether any changes will be covered under the current proposal or will it occur additional project and additional costs in the future. Change is, after all, inevitable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think that’s very important. We know in – in the European Union it’s coming the digital wallet that’s going to come in. Well, how many years do you predict at this moment?</p>
<p>Jesse: I’m optimistic and say late ‘24 launch for some countries. ‘25 mass adoption and hopefully organisational identities soon after.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and that’s something that I think very few people would argue that that will be – that will not have some considerable success because there’s a lot of time invested in people preparing all these new standards in this part of the evolution. What we have been seeing before with Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), the wallet itself is something that is already becoming very popular in the commercial side. So that will come in.</p>
<p>Similarly, in other geographies, there will be similar initiatives, there will be new regulations. So that, through all this, the vendor has to offer that, has to tell whether we offer or not. So that’s definitely a good, good aspect you mentioned.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And the commission has made clear goals here to avoid repeating the mistakes of the eIDAS 1.0, that was supposed to bring cross-border digital identities to Europe. Well, we all know that it was a commercial failure, but they have really learned from that, and I have great hopes for the EUDI. Both for personal identities and for organisational identities, and especially for the latter one.</p>
<p>I believe that the market is currently suffering from a kind of chicken and egg problem here, that everybody’s waiting for cross-border organisational identities and not building services because they aren’t here yet. So, we might see the floodgates open in the late 2020s.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. I also believe that as a lot will change in more or less like the, as you say in the next 12-24 months is going to change a lot, in a good way I believe. So definitely exciting to be at this moment. We’ve been talking a lot about Identity and Access Management, other aspects, other type of technology that are also in the minds of the executives who are going to upgrade their technologies. We hear a lot about passwords in the last year. Well, ‘cryptocurrencies’ is getting a bit more quiet. Today we hear a lot about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Would you recognise some technology that is actually underrated, that not many people are talking about? But these business buyers should be aware, because the impact will be even bigger than those buzzwords. So, what would you say?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would say that the coming EUDI and its principle of Self-Sovereign Identities is something that might cause quite big ripples in the identity landscape. The very basic idea that it’s the end user themselves who collect attributes and control to whom and when they release those attributes. That that is very different from the usual data repository centric view that – okay, we have this database, and we control everything here. Everything is set in stone.</p>
<p>But when the end users actually decide which attributes to release and which not. Then one can’t take for granted that, “Okay, we always have every single field in our database field. Every user record looks similar in a structural level.” That is no longer true and that might cause some changes.</p>
<p>As for technology, I have great hopes for machine learning and especially how it can help accomplish not zero trust, no. But zero friction user journeys. And I don’t mean a strong AI that is still decades into future, if ever. But simple things like; is the user using a different device to log in or the same device as before? And so on.</p>
<p>For example, I have a recently having a quick holiday in the US, and I was frankly quite shocked when I logged into some financial services – using a completely different device that I had never used, on completely opposite time of the day. I was even physically located on a different continent. And no MFA prompts, nothing. Just inputting my password, I was in.</p>
<p>And that’s a lot of missed risk management there, for both parties. For me as an end user and for the financial service provider. And I believe this is something that will change sooner or later. And of course, I would like, as an end user, for this to work for the opposite way as well. That if I’m logging in using the same device, about the same time of the day, from same city that I’ve done it for hundreds and hundreds of times – then perhaps I could be spared the MFA fatigue and just get in with my password managers embraced password.</p>
<p>Oscar: The technology doesn’t bother you when you are in the habitual way of interacting with, let’s say, the banks.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, exactly. It should take always the context of the transaction into account. And frankly, what I would like to see many companies to do is; do a more thorough risk analysis at what they are actually trying to defend against. I can give a real-world example.</p>
<p>About a month ago, I drove to a gas station, put my car to charge, decided that I’ll have a coffee there. Opened the app and saw, hey, there’s an offer for a coffee and a doughnut €1 off. Great.</p>
<p>Okay, it seems that first, I needed to update the app to actually buy. Okay, well, I’ll do it.</p>
<p>Then they wanted to add the credit card directly to the app, alright. Got an MFA from that.</p>
<p>Then when I actually wanted to make the purchase, I got yet another prompt and confirmation, this time from my bank. That – ‘Hey, in order to buy this €3.50 product, would you please update our app again, and use it as an MFA to confirm this purchase’. For the third time.</p>
<p>And by that time, I already got notification that, ‘hey, your car has charged’, and my coffee was called by then and left it there.</p>
<p>So that was the opposite of Zero Friction. That was more of a zero trust like game. But the security solution that’s very fitting for, let’s say, authorising nuclear missile launch, is very different than the security that’s needed to confirm a €3 coffee purchased at the gas station.</p>
<p>And as discussed earlier, I believe this problem stems – that solution was built from very small parts and every individual vendor only looked after their own interest, only want to save their back in case of any kind of misuse. But nobody took a step backwards to actually see; What we are trying to defend against here? What is the attack vector here? That okay, somebody misuses this app and clones this coupon and gets two coffees and doughnuts for a €3 each. Okay, so how much is an attacker willing to put time and money into such attack? I guess nobody stop to think about it. And as a result, the whole user journey was just failure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, complete failure indeed. Very good way to bring back the very first thing you said, User Journey. Yeah, that’s a specific example how things can happen. Sounds like a marvellous opportunity, not to get a deal nice and then becomes complete failure.</p>
<p>Jesse, one final question I would like to ask you is – for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would dream that every executive would dedicate one day, one whole day to actually be an end user for a day and go through their company’s entire flow. All the way from account registration to actually purchasing to product or service that they’re selling. And if there’s time trying out things like forgotten password resets. And then the next day repeating the same procedure for the top competitor and even more importantly, their newest competitor, because that is where the threat of digitalisation is coming.</p>
<p>Oscar: Going to be very revealing.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes, and it’s important to go through the entire journey. If one, simply takes it piecemeal. And of course, every piece may look perfectly fine. Okay, this works like this. It has confirmations like this. Great. Next piece. Next piece, Next piece. All right. Everything looks fine. But then actually going through the process, one gets hit by four or five different confirmations, forced updates, all kinds of non-user-friendly things, and that won’t fly.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely a very good experiment, actionable idea. Absolutely. Well, thank you very much, Jesse for telling us all this about the – how the companies and why companies should invest in the digital identity and why today.</p>
<p>Let us know why people would like to get in touch with you or follow you or learn more about what we are doing. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Jesse: All right. Thank you. First, I would ask everybody to check out <a href="http://www.ubisecure.com/" title="ubisecure.com">ubisecure.com</a>, and see how we are approaching these problems on the market. And if needed, I would be very happy to have a chat, over a virtual or real coffee, and I can be contacted at <a href="mailto:jesse.kurtto@ubisecure.com">jesse.kurtto@ubisecure.com</a> at anytime.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>With our first speakers release, we are letting loose four tech experts from the finance industry. Despite some of the industry-specific challenges, IAM and cybersecurity professionals from finance can offer valuable insights and lessons learned that can be translated to other sectors seeking to enhance their identity and access management practices.</p>
<p>The relevance of identity management in finance</p>
<p>Identity management is integral to financial services for various reasons. Robust systems enhance security by verifying and authenticating user identities, employing methods like multi-factor authentication and biometrics to prevent unauthorized access and reduce fraud. Compliance with regulatory requirements, such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), is ensured through effective identity management.</p>
<p>Building customer trust is another crucial aspect, because secure identities foster confidence in engaging with digital financial services. Personalized offerings based on accurate customer data, operational efficiency, and streamlined transactions are facilitated by sound identity management practices. In the context of digital transformation, identity management is foundational for seamless and secure digital experiences, including online banking and mobile payments.</p>
<p>Risk management benefits from effective identity verification, helping to identify and mitigate potential risks. Furthermore, in the globalized financial landscape, proper identity management supports cross-border transactions by ensuring compliance with international regulations and standards, fostering trust in transactions across different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In summary, identity management in financial services is not just about verifying who someone is; it's a fundamental aspect of ensuring security, compliance, and efficiency in an increasingly digital and interconnected financial world.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs’&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;offers the key building blocks that empower a financial institution to add valuable verifiable credential (often caller reusable credentials) capabilities to existing KYC and identity verification processes. Sudo Platform includes four ready-to-use, and fully brandable products with more in development:</p>



 
 Mobile DI Wallet: A standalone mobile application for iOS and Android, a user can use the mobile DI wallet for DI interactions and storage: creating and storing cryptographic keys, and creating connections for receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. It interacts with verifiable credential issuers and verifiers and can be used as-is, or branded to match an FI’s existing experiences. 



 Mobile DI Wallet SDK: For customers that want to add the DI wallet functionality to their own mobile application, this native mobile SDK provides the capability for storage, creating cryptographic keys, and establishing connections and for receiving, holding and presenting VCs. 



 Verifiable Credentials Service/SDK: This service provides the ability to establish connections with DI wallets and to issue VCs. It also provides the ability to request and verify presentation proofs from DI wallets. 



 Relay Service/SDK: This service introduces an always-on capability for a mobile DI Wallet. Implemented as a cloud service, the Relay Service provides mediator capability for incoming/outgoing verifiable credential and other messages, so that sending and receiving is not limited to when the client implementations of the mobile DI wallet and SDK are online. 
 



<p><br>As an API-first developer platform, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;includes everything necessary to quickly bring new products to market or augment existing products with value-add privacy and identity protection capabilities. It includes:</p>



 
 Developer-focused documentation 



 APIs 



 SDK source code via GitHub 



 Sample applications for test-to-deploy of various capabilities 



 Brandable white-label apps for quick go-to-market deployments. 
 



<p>You can see in these images how a credit union has used the Sudo Platform sample app and SDK to build a VCs solution within its banking app:</p>



In 4 steps, go from installation of your mobile application to having an encrypted connection with your potential new member. With this channel established you can commence your KYC process.



<p></p>



With an authenticated end-to-end connection established members can complete their KYC proofing with a verified credential issued at completion that can be used for future proofing exercises needs either in branch or online.



<p><br><br>In this example, a customer wants a car loan and the car dealership verifies their account quickly and securely, avoiding additional applications and legacy forms:</p>







<p>In addition to DI solutions, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;has modular, turnkey solutions for:</p>



 
 Safe and private browsing 



 Password management 



 Virtual private network 



 Compartmentalization 



 Virtual cards 



 Open and encrypted telephony and email communications.

<p>Sacramento – The State of California Department of Motor Vehicles Open Source Mobile Wallet for Decentralized Digital Credentials <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">has been awarded</a> by Gartner for the Eye on Innovation Awards in Government in the category of provisional, state, or regional for 2023. Gartner is an American technological research and consulting firm that conducts research on technology.</p><p>Wayne Chang, Co-Founder and CEO of SpruceID, said: “We are thrilled that California’s mDL pilot was recognized by the reputable Gartner, Inc. for the 2023 Innovation Award. Working closely with the state DMV, we brought Californians a reliable digital credential that is privacy-first and open source to maintain the utmost reliability and interoperability. California is leading the way in delivering high-quality digital services to its constituents; we commend the state for taking this approach, and we appreciate their partnership.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Assemblymember Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles), said: “I am thrilled to see the California DMV’s mDL pilot receive Gartner’s award for public sector innovation. Since fighting for digital driver’s licenses back in 2021 with AB 1503, I have been proud to see the program come to life so that any Californian can store their driver’s license on their phone. Congratulations to the DMV and their technology partner SpruceID.”</p><p>SpruceID has been working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to bring mobile driver's licenses to residents of California. Earlier this fall, the State of California expanded the initial pilot program to allow California residents <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">to download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone through the California DMV Wallet mobile app (compatible with iOS and Android devices).</p><p>The mobile driver’s license is powered by SpruceID’s SpruceKit components and Credible product. SpruceKit is an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity that enables secure wallet construction, and Credible provides entire credential life cycle management–from issuance and presentations to updates and revocation. Both are modular solutions that are made to integrate into existing high-assurance environments with security and privacy at the core.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">privacy-first mobile driver's license</a> can be used at participating TSA airport security checkpoints and select retail locations. In the future, the mobile driver’s license can help residents prove their identity online, operate motor vehicles, access health care, secure financial assistance, and verify their age–both in-person and online–while selectively disclosing only the necessary information. <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">Learn more</a>.</p><p><br>NOTE: GovTech to Host Live Webinar this Wednesday, 12/13 on “Getting Started with Digital Identity” Featuring Ajay Gupta, the Chief Digital Transformation Officer for the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">State of California DMV</a>,&nbsp; and Wayne Chang, <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceID</a> CEO.

				  Governing generates an enormous amount of paperwork, so much so, the US employs an <a href="https://www.zippia.com/auditor-jobs/demographics/">estimated 228,000 auditors</a> to keep track of it. Here, we look at how governments can save millions on issuing documents, licenses and permits, while providing a much better experience for citizens.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>A key function of government is issuing permission, either so that citizens are allowed to do certain things — to build, drive, hunt, run a business, travel, or vote — or perform certain jobs according to certain standards, such as food handling. Governments issue a lot of these documents; for example, the US government issued <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/about-us/reports-and-statistics.html">24 million passports</a> in 2023, each of which&nbsp; took an average processing time of seven-to-ten weeks, and cost the person applying $130 dollars.</p>
<p>By issuing these same documents as verifiable digital credentials, governments can not only reduce the cost of creating the passport, and eliminate shipping costs and the waiting time for shipping, it can also simplify the process of renewing and replacing these documents.</p>
<p>The scale of cost reduction rapidly escalates as we move into state-level documents. In the US, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191653/number-of-licensed-drivers-in-the-us-since-1988/#:~:text=Number%20of%20licensed%20drivers%20-%20United%20States%201990-2021&amp;text=Around%20233%20million%20people%20held,female%20licensees%20than%20male%20drivers">223 million people</a> held valid driver’s licenses in 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253615/number-of-hunting-licenses-and-permits-in-the-us/#:~:text=Hunting%20is%20generally%20regulated%20on,amounted%20to%20almost%2039%20million">38.7 million hunting licenses</a> were issued in 2023, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/687993/fishing-license-holders-by-us-state/">over 126 million fishing licenses</a> were issued in California alone in 2023. Each of these documents takes seven-to-ten days to process and ship. Even if the only thing verifiable credentials eliminated was the <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/prices.htm">66-cent cost of mailing the document</a>, they could have saved the government $147 million on driver’s licenses, $25 million on hunting licenses, and California $83 million on fishing licenses. And people would have received their verifiable credential versions instantly.</p>
<p>But verifiable digital credentials offer more benefits than saving on shipping while arriving faster. They can also save time and therefore money when it comes time to audit the holders of these credentials. For example, you need <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/restaurant-licenses-and-permits/">up to 16 permits and licenses to open a restaurant</a>, each of which can be misplaced or lost. Because verifiable credentials are stored securely on a mobile device, they are easy to keep track of and share when they need to be checked. Mobile verification software makes inspection easy, and the tamper-proof way data is stored means that everyone can be sure key documents haven’t been altered or faked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn’t just government inspectors who benefit from this feature. Anyone can easily verify the authenticity and data of someone else’s official documents. This eliminates what is now time-consuming and challenging research and sometimes a fee. For example, it costs <a href="https://washington.licenselookup.org/medical/">$50 and takes five-to-seven business days</a> to verify a Washington state medical license, while verifying a law license requires <a href="https://www.lawyerlegion.com/promote-your-law-practice/directories-by-state-bar#:~:text=Lawyer%20Licensing%20-%20American%20Bar%20Association,practice%20in%20a%20particular%20state">combing the state bar directory yourself.</a></p>
<p>If you would like to see an example of how governments are already adopting this technology with the Digital Travel Credential (DTC)&nbsp;you can read about how the government of Aruba has implemented it to <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">speed up border crossings</a> or watch a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcu76JEaqwI">here.</a></p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase   Sign-In with Ethereum <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  Last month, Discourse bumped the version of FFI, which we had to match in our plugin (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth/pull/25?ref=blog.spruceid.com">discourse-siwe-auth#25</a>)   TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims to describe the structure and semantics of the defined schema comprehensibly. It lies at the intersection between&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a>&nbsp;and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as&nbsp;<a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  A <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2?ref=blog.spruceid.com">new version of TreeLDR</a> is in the making. Last month, we worked on the following components of TreeLDR to make improvements:  We've refined and formalized the definition of <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/blob/v0.2/layouts/README.md?ref=blog.spruceid.com">TreeLDR's layouts</a>, simplifying their definition and how developers can interact with them.  We are working on the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2/layouts/book?ref=blog.spruceid.com">layout book</a>, containing an overview and formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts.  We've extracted the RDF handling part of TreeLDR's layout compiler into a separate project, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/inferdf-rs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">InfeRDF</a>. This "RDF engine" is dedicated to the inference and interpretation of RDF datasets so TreeLDR can fully focus on its main feature: the layouts.    <p>This update introduces a lot of breaking changes for the better. We are still working on reintroducing previous TreeLDR features: the DSL and generators. The Rust code generator will be the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/162?ref=blog.spruceid.com">first reintroduced</a>.</p> DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms, including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  Support deserialization of single termsOfUse in Verifiable Credentials which is allowed by the specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/538?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#538</a>)   <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>This contest offered incentives to explore the inner workings of Curve Finance. Participants analyzed trading volume patterns and behaviors on this decentralized exchange tailored for stablecoin trading and yield farming. Focused on technology adoption, this challenge examined liquidity pools, AMMs, CRV, veCRV, and utilized open data for their analysis.</p> Abstract <p>This research report encapsulates the findings from the <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/15">Curve Finance Data Challenge</a>, a competition that engaged 34 participants in a comprehensive analysis of the decentralized finance protocol. The challenge produced an average report length of 25 pages amongst competitors. Inside these pages covered a spectrum of topics from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), to the impact of veCRV on the protocol's governance and machine learning models. Participants investigated unusual activities, evaluated trading strategies, and analyzed the interplay between trading volume and liquidity. Additionally, the challenge spotlighted BIS use cases, pros, and cons, and the development of Predictive analytics via machine learning models, showcasing the integration of advanced data science in&nbsp;finance.</p><p>These diverse deep dives collectively contributed mature insights into the workings of <a href="https://curve.fi/">Curve Finance</a>, marking a significant step forward in the understanding and application of other market-leading decentralized finance protocols.

Key findings, indicators, and leading metrics are presented below in corresponding order to the <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/15">data challenge</a> hosted November — December&nbsp;2023.</p> Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis&nbsp;(EDA)  MEV <p>Over 25,000 MEV-related transactions have been executed through Curve. This is better said as game players game the game. Curve MEV basic statistics present an alternative indicator of on-chain movement and behavioral finance. This only accounts for transactions made on blockchain, and is a principal in decentralized finance to consider before further&nbsp;signs.</p><a href="https://dune.com/encrypted_soul/mev-activity-on-curve">Link to dashboard</a><p>A key question presented in exploratory data analysis was to find significant changes in trading volume and identify potential causation.</p><p>The analysis in a basket of reports revealed the same three dates with the most significant changes in trading volume on Curve&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>These dates and their corresponding trading volumes are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>• February 14, 2021: A trading volume of approximately 1.2935 ×&nbsp;1019</p><p>• August 14, 2020: A trading volume of approximately 1.116318 ×&nbsp;1019</p><p>• September 11, 2021: A trading volume of approximately 1.02 ×&nbsp;1019</p><p>These dates are significant as they represent the highest spikes in trading activity, indicating either increased user engagement or specific market events that drove&nbsp;many</p><p>transactions. Further investigation into these dates may provide insights into external factors or internal protocol changes influencing trading behavior on the Curve Finance platform.</p> Post/pre veCRV <p>veCRV (vote-escrowed CRV token) in 2020 brought voting power and enhanced community participation to its ecosystem. Quantitatively, it reduced token circulation by locking CRV into veCRV. Effectively reducing circulating supply drives the long-term alignment of CRV holders and the success + longevity of the protocol.</p><p>The plots below show the daily transaction count and volume around the veCRV launch date, highlighted by the red dashed&nbsp;line.</p> Protocol Averages <p>How did veCRV impact daily transactions and gas prices? The most straight-forward answer, plus statistical proof are shown in this&nbsp;snippet:</p> Trading Moving&nbsp;Averages <p>The 30-day moving average shows a smoothing of the daily fluctuations and indicates a sustained increase in veCRV token holders = There’s a steady increase in the amount of CRV being locked up, showing a growing interest in boosted yields incentive to the veCRV holders and also potentially participating in the governance of the protocol through&nbsp;veCRV.</p> Peak Trading&nbsp;Hours <p>The provided data on hourly trading volume demonstrates a distinct pattern of daily fluctuations. Trading activity exhibits a clear upward trend from the early morning hours, reaching its peak between 14:00 and 17:00 GMT. This period, encompassing the European and American afternoon hours, coincides with the overlap of major trading markets and heightened market activity. The peak trading hours, defined as the periods with the highest trading volume,&nbsp;are:</p><p>● 14:00 GMT to 15:00&nbsp;GMT</p><p>● 16:00 GMT to 17:00&nbsp;GMT</p><p>During these peak hours, trading volume consistently exceeds USD 160 billion, indicating a surge in market activity and investor participation.</p> Project Marinara — DeFi at&nbsp;work <p>A bonus question here entertained a thesis made this year for The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Project Mariana using Curve Finance Technology.</p><p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), often referred to as the “central bank of central banks,” is an international organization that fosters cooperation among central banks and other financial institutions. Established in 1930, the BIS plays a crucial role in promoting financial stability and facilitating international monetary cooperation. So why do they want to use Curve AMM and liquidity dynamic structure?</p><a href="https://www.texasblockchain.org/blog/curve-finance-the-future-for-exchanging-wealth">Image source</a><p>The integration of Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, as exemplified by Project Mariana’s innovative use of Curve Finance algorithms, marks a paradigm shift in the landscape of cross-border financial transactions. The application of AMM mitigates long-standing financial risks by ensuring immediate execution and settlement of trades, effectively minimizing credit and settlement risks.

 How IDnow’s latest collaborative research project, MAMMOth, is making the connected world a safer and fairer place for everyone. 



 



<p>While the ability of AI to optimize efficiencies and improve processes is well documented, there are also genuine concerns regarding its susceptibility to human bias and how unfair data processing can lead to the perpetuation of discriminatory practices and social inequality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow leverages AI in its proprietary algorithms to automate three critical tasks:</p>



<p>1. Capturing and parsing identity documents.</p>



<p>2. Ensuring document compliance and authenticity.</p>



<p>3. Verifying the document holder’s identity, including a facial verification step.</p>



<p>Research conducted by IDnow has revealed demographic biases in facial verification algorithms, primarily linked to underrepresentation of certain ethnic groups several population groups. &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Although a manual analysis performed after an automated check can rectify erroneous verdicts, addressing bias in AI-powered services is a priority for IDnow as we want to ensure our clients and their customers have access to reliable and fair tools.</p>Lara Younes, Engineering Team Lead at&nbsp;IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>In a bid to break down the barriers of bias, IDnow has been collaborating with 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, as part of the MAMMOth project, for about a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency, the goal of the three-year long project is to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so that they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three use cases have been identified:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Assessment of loan applications.&nbsp;  



  Academic evaluation and visibility of academic work. In the academic world, the reputation of a researcher is often tied to the visibility of their scientific papers, and how much they are cited. Studies have shown that on certain search engines, women and authors coming from less prestigious countries/universities tend to be less represented.&nbsp;  



  Face verification applied to identity verification.&nbsp;  



<p>IDnow will predominantly be&nbsp;focusing on the face verification use case, with the aim of implementing methods to mitigate the biases found in algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



 Hearing the voice of the under-represented.&nbsp; 



<p>In an effort to provide a tool that meets the needs of those affected by bias, the project has the support of social science researchers at UNIBO, and three associations working to promote the voice of under-represented groups: <a href="https://www.iasismed.eu/">IASIS</a>, <a href="https://donaactiva.org/">DAF</a>, and <a href="https://www.diversitygroup.lt/en/">DDG</a>. Their involvement in MAMMOth enables IDnow to understand the needs and expectations of under-represented groups. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a series of questionnaires and workshops, the above partners have collected input from underrepresented groups, especially women and ethnic minorities. Gathered information has revealed apprehensions about being discriminated against by identity verification algorithms, emphasizing the necessity of ensuring algorithm reliability before use. These groups also advocated for human oversight of algorithm decisions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Other concerns included possible data leakage, highlighting the need to address privacy-and-security-related issues when systems are developed. It’s also worth noting that some participants highlighted that human input could also be biased and that responsible AI use could reduce this risk.&nbsp;</p>



 AI for a responsible future.&nbsp; 



<p>At IDnow, we believe the importance of innovation lies in finding solutions to problems that do not yet exist but are sure to impact the future. That is why we have invested heavily in research and AI technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are proud to be a part of such an important collaborative research project. These studies underscore the need for trustworthy, unbiased facial verification algorithms. This is the challenge that IDnow and MAMMOth partners aim to overcome during the remaining two years of the project,” said Lara.&nbsp;</p>

 The next generation wants control over their data for a more transparent lending experience 



<p>Having grown up with the internet, smart phones, and social media, young Millennials and Gen-Z borrowers are particularly savvy about using their digital footprints for their own benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They embrace technology to streamline everyday tasks and they want to make informed decisions about transactions. As they increase their presence in the workforce, they are becoming the generations poised to drive the future of lending. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences, young people’s voices came through: They want a more transparent, simpler, digitally-enabled lending process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And open banking can make this a reality. Using secure APIs, advanced data analytics, and machine learning, open banking technology allows consumers to safely share their financial data, giving a more up-to-date and holistic view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit.</p>







<p>Most borrowers are already on board. According to our survey, 77% of those ages 45 to 60 and 68% of those over 60 are willing to grant access to their banking data to secure a credit or loan. Among respondents 18 to 29, the number shoots up to 84%.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of younger customers have already linked their accounts while applying for a loan. And, as digital natives, nine out of ten would prefer a loan option with a digital application or approval process.</p>







<p>The consumer base is changing, opening a window for the industry to evolve in step. Today’s borrowers are calling for a new, digital-first era of lending, giving applicants more control over the information used to determine their creditworthiness.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>By allowing consumers to share access to their financial data, open banking can provides a current view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit for more transparent lending decisions – and a more financially inclusive economy.</p>



 Younger borrowers are embracing digital lending

<p>If asked what job role is most associated with Identity and Access Management (IAM), what would you say?</p>
<p>Most of you might think a highly technical specialist, or an “IT person”. However, many CEOs, CFOs, Customer Service team leaders, HR analysts and other professionals across companies are involved in IAM decision making. But why is this? This blog will explore why it is important for companies to invest more time and effort in ensuring that Identity and Access Management is well understood across various job functions.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s understand what Identity and Access Management is.</p>
 What is IAM? 
<blockquote><p>“Identity and Access management is the people, processes and systems used to manage digital identities and their entitlements throughout their life-cycle.” ~ <a href="https://open-measure.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DIC/pages/1409143/Identity+and+Access+Management">Open Measure Dictionary</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Organisations use IAM software to manage and secure the identities of both internal and external users for their services and applications. There are &nbsp;two main styles of IAM systems, that are currently in use:</p>
 Traditional IAM or Internal IAM 
<p>Traditional IAM takes care of the internal identities, mainly employees but also can include other groups of individuals such as subcontractors and representatives from partners and suppliers. Think of an employee, from their user account creation, granting the right access to perform their job, until the account deletion when the person leaves the company.</p>
 Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) 
<p>CIAM forked from IAM when the number of Internet applications in every company’s data environment exploded in numbers. Such growth was clearly reflected in the number of screen icons in our devices. Companies of all kinds expect that their applications will be accessed by thousands or millions of consumers, citizens, remote workers, and other types of users. These “customers” could be B2C or B2B. Particularly with the innovations in the LEI world, B2B IAM is becoming a hot topic that will bring massive benefits to the B2B world.</p>
 Why IAM matters to everyone 
<p>Not long ago, when you started a new job or became a university student, someone from IT would provide you with access to necessary systems, and a username and password that needs to be changed after the first login. All identity and access management processes were semi-manual and done by the IT team. Today, we have modern identity standards, but often IAM is an area that only a small group of people in the organisation are involved in. With companies embarking on digital transformation, a larger percentage of the companies’ staff is now becoming involved in building new web and mobile services. But unless everyone has an adequate understanding of IAM, these projects are doomed to fail. Therefore, knowing IAM is not only for the IT folks as it was at the beginning of the millennium.</p>
 Who normally sees Identity and Access management on their desk? 
<p>Identity and Access Management is not an everyday task for many professionals beyond the IT team (or IAM team if it exists). However, when the time comes for strategic decisions, there are several people who will have a voice and decision power in how IAM is acquired, planned, deployed, maintained and expanded.</p>
<p>Especially for the biggest decisions involving risk and money, several sub-organisations and functions have the responsibility to build consensus with the IAM team in order to get their own business objectives met. The most critical of these stakeholders are:</p>
 
 There is no software that magically makes a company GDPR-compliant. Same with PCI DSS, CCPA and other regulations. Compliance officers use IAM among other tools and processes to fulfil their audits. Undoubtedly the compliance team will have clear requirements about what IAM must offer. 
 With a large portion of employees working from their home offices, the risks of attacks to the companies’ systems have drastically increased. The Chief Information and Security Officer is well aware that IAM has taken a leading role in the organisation’s security. 
 Customer Service. Since the concept of self-service account management appeared, CIAM has made a tremendous impact on customer service, and there are multiple ways that CIAM can help. Even in a utopian passwordless world, users will need account recovery and might end up panickily calling customer service. And customer service will ask CIAM to help. Find out more about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/resources/ciam-customer-experience-marketing/" title="leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here">leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here</a>. 
 Business Development / Umbrella Organisations. New student portals, patient portals, citizen portals, new mobile apps, improved authentication methods for existing applications…; for every new or existing web service, every day a new service is being created or improved, and IAM needs to be in place. That’s why business units must understand IAM very well in order to reach their set goals. 
 Human Resources. Today any HR information system (e.g., SAP SuccessFactors, Workday) is in one way or another connected with the IAM systems, both Traditional IAM and CIAM. There again, several persons in the HR team will have a lot to say about what IAM should do and shouldn’t do. 
 The CFO. We know it well, that IAM is a necessary but also hefty investment for organisations. The Chief Financial Officer will carefully evaluate the financial impact and will ask both the IAM vendor and the aforementioned stakeholders for a clear Return On Investment (ROI). 
 
<p>Most of these people unfortunately only truly care about IAM when an issue arises for them.</p>
 Let’s educate everyone on IAM 
<p>Seeing how relevant IAM is across the functions, shouldn’t we start a crusade to educate more people about it?</p>
<blockquote><p>“30% of the time for an IAM team should be dedicated to education and knowledge transfer to people who are outside of the IAM team, and the rest of the organisation.” ~ <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/iam-uk-public-sector-richard-slater-amido/" title="Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.">Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With my personal experience, spending time on educating around IAM is realistic and crucial. There are commonplace and unconventional ways to make this happen: presentations, pre-recorded demos, mini workshops, discussions on hot topics. The executive who leads IAM in the organisation has to become a persuasive agent and make sure that these activities happen, and that more people will be converted into IAM ambassadors. Everyone in the company will benefit from it. After all, times have changed, and there is no digital transformation without CIAM.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and Credential Locking, or proof of humanity locking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and credential locking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches, or 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers credential locking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and Credential Locking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>Credential Locking, or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, Credential Locking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a Credential&nbsp;that can be locked with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By locking KEY on their Credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's Credential Locking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By locking their credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have locked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, locking credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens&nbsp;as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Credential Locking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By locking their credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD Credential Locking  
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's credential locking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information to ensure the security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD Credential Locking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By locking their credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>In my research for this blog post, I wondered where the proverb about glass houses and throwing stones originated. I'm unsure whether there will ever be a definitive answer, but <a href="https://www.almanac.com/fact/where-did-the-saying-people-who-live">this one</a> appealed to my education as an English major:</p>
<p>The proverb appeared in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, written in 1385. Later, George Herbert modified it this way: “Whose house is of glass, must not throw stones at another.” And in 1736, Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Don’t throw stones at your neighbors, if your own windows are glass.”</p>
<p>Then I decided I’d give DALL-E a go at it. I like that it turned out so dramatically:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This image captures quite well the point I’d like to make about breach revelations—piling on the schadenfreude provides little solace when you become the target. And let’s face it, we are all targets now.</p>
 For whom the bell tolls 
<p>When the closing bell rang at the NASDAQ on November 29, 2023, Okta shares (NASDAQ:OKTA) had been devalued by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/29/okta-hackers-stole-data-on-all-customer-support-users-company-says.html">nearly 7%</a> and received <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/okta-hit-with-6-downgrades-following-q3-earnings-4-big-analyst-cuts-3246837">six downgrades</a> from previous estimates, despite the company’s better-than-expected <a href="https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results">earnings report</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20231130546/oktas-stock-falls-amid-wave-of-downgrades-now-is-not-the-time-for-profit-push">TD Cowen analyst report</a>, OKTA's financial performance is reflecting “the impact of recent high-profile breaches involving the company’s solutions.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>In reaction, part practical, part penance, Okta stated it would <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/okta-s-90-day-delay-on-product-releases-is-a-critical-step-analyst">halt product releases</a> for 90 days (presumably, the time it takes to get one’s security glasshouse in order). Such news may seem like a holiday gift to Okta’s competitors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, continuing to draw on my English major, John Donne had this <a href="https://allpoetry.com/No-man-is-an-island">great poem</a> a while back about a bell tolling and then Hemingway went on to develop the concept into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls">novel</a>. This sentiment rings true today, as we step collectively into an era of hyper-exposure to cyber-attacks: everybody’s going to take their turn. From Donne’s poem:</p>
<p>Any man's death diminishes me,<br>Because I am involved in mankind.<br>And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>It tolls for thee.</p>
<p>Speaking of humanity, it turns out the initial account that was compromised was a non-human—or service—account. These types of accounts can be unruly, and they don’t use multi-factor authentication. In a <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@dangoodin/111348246005935166">discussion</a> on infosec.exhange (with Adam Shostack and friends, no less!) commentors offer various summaries on what had just occurred and who was to shame. This one, I think, summarizes it up best:</p>
<p>Yes, let’s all agree, the one-word technical summary is accurate. But—to paraphrase a security professional I discussed the matter with—as large as the providers are these days, you can never be certain you’ll have your bases covered everyone takes a turn, even open-source providers.</p>
<p>And—talk about the mother of all identity providers—the DNA research company 23andMe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/23andme-confirms-hackers-stole-ancestry-data-on-6-9-million-users/">reported a breach</a> in October, as well—and likewise continues to realize new depths of the severity of the attack. And again, lest we forget, this cautionary tale is at least as old as 2011, when KuppingerCole Analysts reported similar findings from the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/rsa-securid-it-will-never-be-the-same-again">RSA SecurID breach</a>.</p>
 Cyberculture and the culture of silence 
<p>So, what is the proper response to getting our security <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-retired-players-agree-to-concussion-lawsuit-settlement-0ap1000000235501">bell rung</a> (as the NFL calls it)? Well, first and foremost, it’s important to talk about it openly. That’s not an easy topic for discussion with investors, customers, and competitors looking on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BeyondTrust, which <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">reported</a> the breach on October 2nd 2023, was likely the first customer to speak up about it, because the attackers had finally showed up at the company’s door (front door in this case). Still, Okta took more than two weeks to admit to the breach. Oddly, even now, BeyondTrust’s detailed timeline of the breach provides a lot more specifics than you can find on Okta’s security blog.</p>
<p>There’s a reason the mantra of physical security states, “if you see something, say something”—the social alert draws in a community to restore safety. For example, BeyondTrust reveals that the attacker requested a HAR file archive (HTML backup) for the ostensible purpose of troubleshooting the website. Obtaining the file, the hacker then reused a session cookie from that HAR file to attempt a replay attack on a web service, which BeyondTrust easily blocked. Undeterred, the attacker then switched to using API calls instead. According to BeyondTrust:</p>
<p>API actions cannot be protected by policies in the same way as actual admin console access. Using the API, they [the attackers] <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">created a backdoor user account</a> using a naming convention like existing service accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great intel on how the threat actor conducts business and everyone should be put on notice. Still, valuable time was spent in a moment or two of silence. Why?</p>
<p>The culture of silence needs to go. We need to swap notes. Safety is a collaborative effort, because we can’t know in advance where the next threat will originate or where it will propagate.</p>
 Going to production requires oversight 
<p>The interesting thing about this breach is that it started with a service account and then moved to human accounts. One way this happens is by not hardening the system sufficiently when moving from development to production environments. The Okta Developer portal makes it easy for developers to get moving on projects but will need a thorough security review when deploying applications.</p>
<p>Also, the LDAP interface is typically enabled by default even when not in use, heightening the risk level. Access control policies for sensitive apps and admin accounts are often not adequately designed to limit risk exposure to breaches.</p>
<p>Okta is now critical infrastructure and needs a run book that ensures security is maintained. One of the shocking findings in the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/CSRB_Lapsus%24_508c.pdf">report on Lapsus$</a> breaches “organizations did not always consider third parties and BPOs in their risk management programs.” Communication with third parties is necessary preparation for moving to production, as well.</p>
 How to learn from—rather that gloat over—others’ mishaps 
<p>Proposals for avoiding and dealing with breaches were plentiful at our recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">Cyberevolution</a> conference. For example, we <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5434/1">heard from</a> Michiel Stoop of Philips, who spoke on “How to Minimize the Blast Radius of an Attack?” In this case, the approach was to minimize access from privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Jorge Monteiro of Ethiack pointed out that it’s actually a good idea to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5439/2">attack yourself first</a>, in his presentation titled “Autonomous Ethical Hacking for Accurate and Continuous Security Testing.”</p>
<p>Emergency preparedness is often overlooked in cybersecurity, with the majority of the attention going to prevention and detection. But, if we already agree that we are all simply waiting our turn to be attacked, it seems only obvious that we prepare plans for that inevitable moment.</p>
<p>One proposal we covered at Cyberevolution is the practice of developing and training on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5468/3">tabletop exercises</a>, which was covered in a panel titled, “Arresting Disaster: Driving Incident Response in Cyber-Regulated Europe in an Age of AI Threats,” which included participants from ArmorText and the law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring.&nbsp;It’s important to recognize that even your messaging platforms like Teams, Slack, or Zoom become compromised in a breach and so your team will need an out of band “break glass” communication that also meets legal requirements of various governments.</p>
<p>Independent of the measures taken to reduce risk and mitigate cyber disasters, the common thread through all these measures is to communicate openly and quickly with the cyber security community. We’ll all fare much better against attackers as we open channels for honest, detailed, and actionable information.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>With employee identity risk and fraud on the rise — to the point that the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI has issued a public warning</a> — it’s crucial to ensure that employees are who they say they are. Is the person you interviewed the same person you actually hired? Is the person logging in a legitimate employee? Is the person requesting a credential reset in fact the owner of those credentials? Robust identity proofing helps you answer those questions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Understanding Identity Proofing and Why It’s Needed  
<p>What is identity proofing? Identity proofing is the process of verifying and validating the identity of individuals accessing digital systems. It ensures that the identity exists and that the person claiming the identity is the real owner. Employee identity proofing is a fundamental aspect of safeguarding sensitive information, intellectual property and overall organizational integrity. It addresses one of the major security weaknesses in most IAM systems — the fact that authentication only validates that the credentials being used to access systems are valid. It cannot ensure that the person using those credentials is the legitimate holder, and further that the legitimate holder is actually who they claim to be.</p> 
 Workplace Identity Fraud Escalating  
<p>The rise of remote work and the increase in attacks on identity processes underscore the critical need for reliable methods of verifying and validating employee identities. Using credentials obtained by brute force attacks, phishing, AitM attacks, social engineering and other methods,&nbsp; cybercriminals can readily gain unauthorized access to systems and networks. Sometimes the attacks aren’t particularly sophisticated, but exploit gaps in verification processes to perpetrate identity fraud.</p> 
<p>Consider the case of the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">attack on MGM resorts</a>. Armed with publicly available details, attackers impersonated an employee and convinced the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. From there they could wreak havoc, stealing sensitive data and deploying ransomware that shut down operations for over a week.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>MGM Resorts attack flow</p> 
<p>By implementing stringent identity proofing protocols, organizations can ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.</p> 
 Key Components of Identity Proofing for the Workforce  
<p>Worker identity proofing should include multiple verification methods to increase the security of the proofing process. The methods used will depend on the situation and context. Ideally all components are connected both to each other and to your other identity security tools and systems.</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Document verification determines whether a document — such as a passport, driver’s license or other official document — is authentic or not. This can be done either in person or digitally. Your document verification process should include technology that is able to detect forgeries or alterations.</p> 
 Location Detection  
<p>Location detection is an important aspect of online identity proofing. Is the employee in the geolocation you expect them to be? If not, this may require further investigation. It’s important, however, that your location detection adheres to global regulations.</p> 
 Facial Recognition With Liveness Detection  
<p>Facial recognition uses facial biometrics to determine if a person matches the identity they are claiming. Usually the person will take a selfie as part of the identity proofing process. Liveness detection is a critical feature when using facial verification in order to detect spoofing tactics such as a photo, video playback or even a mask.</p> 
 Live Video Verification  
<p>Live video verification adds an additional layer of security to the identity proofing process. It takes place face-to-face over a video conference, between the employee and their supervisor or an authorized agent and includes questions and actions designed to confirm liveness and detect signs of spoofing or coercion.</p> 
 Chat Verification  
<p>In some cases, such as a lower risk scenario, chat verification may be sufficient. It also may be used as part of a more comprehensive identity proofing flow. Effective chat verification combines AI and human interaction.</p> 
 Attestation  
<p>Attestation by a responsible party of the identity proofing results is a critical part of the process. This creates an official trail for audit and compliance purposes. Your identity proofing software should retain the attested results, not the employee’s sensitive data.</p> 
<p>The integration of these diverse methods creates a comprehensive identity proofing ecosystem, enhancing cybersecurity measures and safeguarding organizations from unauthorized access and data breaches.</p> 
 NIST Identity Proofing Guidelines&nbsp;  
<p>Identity proofing holds a critical role in IAM. Under the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital Identity Guidelines, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63a.pdf">NIST SP 800-63-A</a> covers enrollment and identity proofing. It outlines a general identity proofing flow and describes three different security levels based on the strength of the type of evidence gathered as well as the verification processes used.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> Level 1 (IAL1): This level does not require the user to be linked to a known, established real-life identity. It uses self-asserted attributes — in other words, no identity proofing.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2): IAL2 introduces the requirement for strong proof connecting the user to a valid, real-world identity. It supports a wide range of identity proofing methods, allowing for either remote or in-person validation. This includes government-issued documentation as well as biometrics;&nbsp; proofing cannot rely on knowledge-based techniques.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3): IAL3 is the strictest identity proofing level, requiring user presence and biometric verification.</p> 
 Best Practices for Effective Workforce Identity Proofing  
<p>Many companies verify a worker’s identity at the time of hire and stop there. Make sure your identity proofing strategy addresses all key workplace scenarios and times of increased risk of fraud. Below are some of the most critical moments to address.</p> 
 Employee Onboarding  
<p>Before giving any new hire access to corporate systems and data, HR teams need to ensure that the person they are onboarding has a credible identity and is the legitimate owner of the identity they are claiming. They also need to verify that the new employee is in fact the person that was interviewed for the role. This means elements of identity proofing need to come into play before a candidate steps a real or virtual foot into the office. It’s also crucial to securely tie the new employee’s verified identity to IAM systems using non-phishable methods.</p> 
 Credential Resets  
<p>In many organizations, identity proofing stops at HR’s door. The newly minted employee is provisioned with a digital identity and from that point on verification involves validation of that digital identity — there is no process for ensuring it ties back to the real world holder of that identity. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks that target the credential reset process. For example, an attacker with the right information can claim to be an employee with a new phone that needs to enroll in MFA on their new device.</p> 
 Changing Roles  
<p>A change in roles often provides an employee with access to systems previously out of reach. Before granting those elevated privileges, organizations should make sure that the role change is legitimate and the user is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p> 
 Elevated Detected Risk  
<p>When identity monitoring systems detect potential risks, re-proofing may be indicated depending on the risk level and threat type. For example, if a user attempts to log in from a device that is not in proximity to their computer or engages in other suspicious activity, they could be automatically prompted to provide proof that they are the valid credential holder.</p>

<p>For many in the identity industry, hearing “self-sovereign identity” (SSI) automatically makes you think “blockchain.” And, if you’re like me, as soon as you hear blockchain, you think it’s too darn early to play the blockchain drinking game and move on. In the early days of SSI, most of the discussion was, in fact, about identity on a blockchain. That association did a disservice to the concept of SSI. SSI is no more dependent on using blockchain technologies than a passport is dependent on a particular type of paper.&nbsp;</p>



 What is SSI? 



<p>SSI is an architecture that guides technological decisions. It is not a piece of software to install or a service you can purchase. In an SSI model, the individual is the single most important entity in a transaction. That individual controls what happens with their information. For people to trust the individual’s information, there needs to be some measure of both technical and societal trust in the veracity of that information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the puzzle the technology has to solve. How do you create a digital identity with information that has been verified (or possibly asserted) by a third party (like the government), that allows an individual to control what information is shared, does NOT allow the third party to know about the transaction, and yet can be verified as accurate by whoever is receiving the data from the individual?</p>



 What is a Blockchain? 



<p>Several features associated with blockchain technology suggest it is a good fit to solve that problem. At its most basic, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a distributed database with data spread across any number of nodes in a network. Enough math is involved to guarantee that the information in those nodes can only be altered with a clear record of who modified it and when.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the right technology, such as a digital identity wallet, an individual can share this cryptographically secure information with any other interested party. Suppose that information was initially issued by a known, trusted entity, and the data cannot be changed (only added to in a visible way). In that case, no one needs to check back with that issuer to see if the information is accurate. The issuer will, in fact, have no idea that this information was shared at all. The individual is in control, and privacy is preserved. Win!</p>



<p>You might find this article interesting if you’d like to read more about how SSI and blockchain can transform society.</p>



 Other Options for SSI 



<p>We have some obvious wins here by using blockchain technology to support SSI. Why isn’t it the One True Way? Because blockchain has some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/04/14/the-5-biggest-problems-with-blockchain-technology-everyone-must-know-about/?sh=5c35504c55d2">significant limitations</a>. For one thing, it is computationally expensive (which means slow and power-hungry). It is also far more complicated than is actually required for most use cases (if you haven’t seen Figure 6 in this&nbsp;<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8202.pdf">NIST publication</a>, it sums this argument up nicely).</p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a fundamental part of the SSI model. There is an entire&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">registry</a>&nbsp;of possible methods to use and support DIDs. Some are blockchain-based, but others rely on the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;specifications. There are options; it is better to understand your current infrastructure, what problem you’re trying to solve, and decide what technology you need to support. Don’t try to make your problem fit the tool, especially when other tools are available.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>SSI’s core principle is about enabling individuals to own and control their digital identities. This architecture can be implemented through various technologies, not limited to blockchain. Blockchain offers a way to decentralize and secure these identities, but it’s not the only method to achieve the principles of SSI.</p>



<p>And if you play the blockchain drinking game, too, I hope you read this late in your day and have a designated driver to get you home.</p>

 How open banking paints a more nuanced picture of borrowers  



<p>Even in the best economic circumstances, loans are often a necessity, especially for critical purchases like homes and cars.  &nbsp;</p>



<p> For some insight into the lending landscape, Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The upshot: 89% have been adversely affected by economic pressures, and nearly half are struggling to get the loans and credit they need. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional credit scores do not always reflect an applicant’s ability to make payments. Individuals with thin or no credit history can struggle to qualify for credit. Young adults on their own for the first time, gig workers who deal mostly in cash, new Americans and retirees with a single credit card and no loans can struggle to qualify for leases, credit cards and mobile phone contracts. </p>



<p>To most consumers, change is overdue — 87% believe the decisioning process should make it easier for responsible borrowers to prove their ability to repay. </p>







<p>Open banking could help provide that missing piece. By choosing to share their bank account data, applicants can paint a more complete picture of who they are. Real-time insights into their accounts — such as a thin credit borrower’s biweekly deposits, cash flow or consistent payments for bills like utilities — offer an up to date, more comprehensive view of their financial health. &nbsp;</p>







<p>This shift in consumer mindset opens new horizons for lenders, allowing them to champion more inclusive processes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking has the potential to accommodate millions of thin-credit applicants who have previously had difficulties accessing the benefits of the financial system. Consumers have spoken. They want the next evolution of lending to prioritize transparency, accessibility and empowerment for consumers worldwide to build a more inclusive digital economy where everyone thrives. &nbsp;</p>



 Digital lending is on the rise 



<p>The data revealed in Mastercard’s Lend Report shows global consumer support for a more transparent, digital-first approach to lending. Read more about the future of lending in Mastercard’s Lend Report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finicity.com/future-of-lending-report/">here</a>.</p>

<p>While Identity and Access Management (IAM) long ago gave IT teams tighter controls against unauthorized access to digital services, it hasn’t exactly been bulletproof.</p>
<p>Yes, IAM consolidated the management and storage of user data and enabled login credentials to be associated with user roles and permissions easily. But it also created a single point of failure that hackers have proven painfully adept at exploiting to gain access to all the resources a user is authorized to access.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/journey-through-identity-models-centralized-federated-decentralized">Federated</a> identity management was supposed to fix that by involving a third party in the management of IAM. Instead, it retained all the dangers of centralized identity while extending the potential blast radius of compromised credentials to vast, interconnected networks. Meanwhile, the global cybercrime economy now tops $7.8 trillion a year. The good news: Decentralized digital identity (DID) management has emerged as a superior approach to managing user identity — if you have the right architecture to support it.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Password or a Pretty Face 
<p>In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we shared the contours of the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a>, which employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with up to 99.6% accuracy. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">Part Two</a>, we showcased how we go above and beyond mere logins by binding identity to a biometric stored within a digital wallet. Yet, as solid as these architectural pillars are, we know that decentralized identity models offer a way to keep these and other personal identifiers and information far more secure than traditional user stores — centralized, federated, or otherwise.</p>
<p>To that end, let’s look at why we designed our architecture to support <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">a reusable identity wallet</a> that enables users to securely gain access to corporate systems using identity details that remain under their own control instead of being stored centrally on servers where they can be altered, misapplied, become inaccurate over time—or be swiped, ransomed, or leveraged to commit fraud.</p>
 Decentralized Identity: What’s In Your Wallet? 
<p>In our view, decentralized digital identity isn’t just important to modern IAM. It’s essential because: 1) it replaces platform-specific user stores that are hard to integrate because of proprietary technologies embedded deeply within those very same platforms, and 2) it replaces incomplete user personal identifiable information (PII) scattered across multiple business applications to one version of the truth managed directly by the user.</p>
<p>By leveraging advances in smartphones, cryptography, and blockchain technologies, our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID solution</a> leverages the 1Kosmos architecture to establish high-assurance trust online in a way that balances security, privacy, and convenience. This enables organizations to confidently accelerate user onboarding and activation of digital services, protect digital accounts from unauthorized access (AKA account takeover), prevent transaction fraud, improve the user experience, and more. Specific features include:</p>
<p>A Reusable Identity Wallet</p>
<p>End users gain secure access not just to corporate accounts and systems but also to digital analogs of verified government-issued ID cards, driver licenses, passports, social security cards, and more—anytime, anywhere, from any device. Users also control what personal information they share with digital services in a manner consistent with emerging <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> frameworks.</p>
<p>Portability and Interoperability</p>
<p>1Kosmos offers the only solution certified to the highest FIDO, NIST, UKDAITF standards for interoperability and security and provides an SDK along with off-the-shelf APIs to simplify data sharing and integration.</p>
<p>Verifiable Claims &amp; Credentials</p>
<p>A way to digitally present in real time claims for a virtually limitless number and variety of machine-verified credentials and safely store them so they’re ready to reuse on-demand with user consent.</p>
<p>These features produce enormous benefits for organizations and end users, including the following.</p>
 Rapid Remote User Onboarding 
<p>The 1Kosmos digital identity wallet organizes and stores information gathered, triangulated, and validated during the identity-proofing stage of self-service user onboarding. This includes attributes from multiple, proof-able sources—and enables a wide variety of applications that require identity verification without requiring physical, in-person presence. Think worker and contractor onboarding, applications for government services and documents, and compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) mandates.</p>
 Security Backed by Public Key Cryptography 
<p>Our digital identity wallet consists of a decentralized identifier along with the cryptographic public-private key pair. Personal information about the user and their credentials are stored within the wallet and require the user’s private key and biometrics to read data from it. Because the private key never leaves the Secure Enclave within the device and the biometric can be authenticated with the highest digital standards available, this approach vastly exceeds the security achievable through passwords, traditional forms of multifactor authentication, and unverified device-level biometrics. In turn, this reduces cyber threats related to credentials stolen through phishing attacks, data breaches, and more.</p>
 User Convenience With Just the Right Friction 
<p>When data from the digital wallet needs to be presented—during login or in the event of step-up authentication—the wallet holder must present their biometric and consent to share that data. When approved, the private key is presented as a credential to unlock the wallet and share the data. The private key never leaves the device and hence the risk of compromise is dramatically minimized. Best of all: There are no passwords to remember or clumsy OTPs to enter.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials for a Zero-Trust World 
<p>Verifiable credentials are a standardized means of issuing and presenting claims about one’s identity—driver’s license, passport, college qualifications, gym membership, etc. Other types of information, such as educational certificates and vaccination records, for example, can also be added to the wallet to make the user’s identity-proofing process indisputable in any number of use cases. The identity wallet can make assertions about identity or credentials that are cryptographically verifiable by the receiving party—without the actual data being revealed. The major cryptographic element used by decentralized identities is known as a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/security-glossary/zero-knowledge-proof/">zero knowledge proof (ZKP)</a>. Zero Knowledge proof measures an information request while protecting user privacy.</p>
 Blockchain: This Is Just The Beginning 
<p>In Part Four, we’ll click further into how the 1Kosmos architecture leverages distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to eliminate the centralized PII honeypot while increasing business ability and speed.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF66 rewards. DF67 runs Dec 7 — Dec 14,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 66 (DF66) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 100K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Nov 30, 2023 and ended 12:01am Dec 7. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>“<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa">Predictoor Data Farming</a>” is a new Ocean incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via 37.5K OCEAN + 100K ROSE (≈$27K USD) in weekly extra sales to Predictoor data feeds [1]. This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF67 is live today, Dec 7. It concludes on Dec 14. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF67  Section 5: Challenge DF&nbsp;Ends   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF67 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

<p>In a world inhabited by a multiplicity of truths, how may we develop mechanisms to orient positively therein?&nbsp;</p><p>This article explores knowledge graphs as a tool for sensemaking and epistemic pluralism. Data is not neutral. It is contextual — collected under particular conditions, by particular people. And when we gather data together and attempt to make sense of it, we add meaning to it to produce an insight. Insights can then be repackaged as new data points within a layered graph. Rather than seeing these insights and data points as neutral fact, we explore the way that knowledge is a diverse field, with overlapping interpretations. By building tools that let us see these divergences and track their origins, we believe that we can better enable community and society level sensemaking.</p> Making Sense of Contextual Data <p>Raw data points alone are meaningless without interpretation. They exist as inert quantifications exerting only the direct geometries of their measurements and have no further relation to reality. The quantity of lead particulates in public water systems alone is insufficient to derive meaningful action. First, we must also understand that lead particulates are dangerous to humans when consumed and that humans are dependent on public water systems to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>Insights — defined for this post as artefacts of knowledge — are always in relationship to an ontology; they exist within a framework for sensemaking reality. Thus data points and their descendant insights can be divergent across ontological frameworks. The challenge then — for us as a collective species interdependent with the natural world — is to develop a system within which we can make decisions that benefit us as a whole and enable us to cohere towards some common goal, despite our differing opinions, interpretations, agendas, and means of engaging reality. What is more, we must be able to transcend a mono-ontology to truly understand the complexities in the hearts and minds of the entities that inhabit Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>It is the composition of measurements into published, opinionated claims that thread the fabric of a ‘knowledge topology’ upon a distributed library of available data.</p> Gesturing Towards Pluralistic Knowledge&nbsp; <p>Recognizing the pivotal role of cogent insights in informed decision-making, it becomes imperative to establish a system that can both acknowledge and effectively evaluate a diverse array of perspectives, especially when they range from congruent to starkly divergent. This necessity stems from an understanding that our collective perception of the world is inherently pluralistic, encompassing a spectrum of contexts and ontological frameworks where multiple rich contexts and ontologies need to be able to coexist and organise towards a future that is inclusive, yet coherent, interdependent, self-aware, and common enough such that we can avoid undesirable internecine interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>It is here that a set of tooling in support of a healthy, composable and pluralistic Data Commons is described, or more accurately, a set of tooling to enable data commoning! This tooling extends the distributed data storage, query, and analysis modules described in part one of this blog series.&nbsp;</p> Adapting our collective lens for knowledge <p>The authors do not intend to describe a specific implementation. Rather, this post serves as an investigation into praxes of pluralism and knowledge integration. The exact form of these praxes codified into a product are not the focus of this enquiry, and rather we wish to draw attention to the dynamics this tool may embody.&nbsp;</p><p>While modern science boasts remarkable capabilities in accurately measuring various aspects of our world, this informational chapter of the Anthropocene has repeatedly shown that absolute truth is elusive. This observation does not undermine the pursuit of objectivity in our understanding of reality. Instead, it highlights that the perspectives that shape our collective cultural narrative are diverse and often lead to substantial variations in our conceptual models of reality. This diversity underscores the importance of acknowledging and designing an effective lens for the plurality of views when engaging in our collective quest for knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Consider the following diagrams, where two polar (and very generic) ontologies are described. The authors do not intend to provide an argument for either ontology, but rather give them by way of example. The first is a theistic epistemology, the second is an atheistic epistemology. The nodes in both diagrams are shared data points. The highlighted edges represent the structural relationships between the nodes for each epistemology. The semi-opaque edges represent an opposing ontology and have been rendered for the purpose of demonstrating the pluralism that is the thesis of this post.&nbsp;	</p>Figure 1: A subgraph of the global knowledge graph where the highlighted edges defined by the community determine the structure of their theistic ontology.Figure 2: A subgraph of the global knowledge graph where the highlighted edges defined by the community determine the structure of their atheistic ontology.<p>In the above two diagrams, four configurable ‘insights’ are represented by very simplified nouns. Further, the use of simplified concepts such as God, Humans, Big Bang and All Life are intended to represent more complex composable insights and have been selected for their capacity to demonstrate how the epistemological topology of a community can vary despite using the same nodes. Specifically, it is the relationships between the nodes — their relative structure — that determines their framing and ultimately their meaning within a system of knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the above illustrations is to demonstrate that even with some shared understanding of a set of data points (where both ontologies acknowledge the existence of “humans”), it is the relationship of these data points to other data points that define their ontological framing.</p> Epistemic Pluralism and Peer-Based Graph Structures <p>Software can act as a bridge connecting us to — and mediating our interactions with — the physical world. It can also oversimplify and potentially degrade our experience of reality. This dichotomy underlines the importance of our mission: to design technological solutions that enrich, rather than diminish, our engagement with the world. Our aim is to ensure that these technological interventions augment our understanding of reality, maintaining its depth and complexity in a way that unlocks the rich and existing knowledge mappings that percolate in our brains, epigenetics, culture, and shared interpersonal space.&nbsp;</p><p>With the above framing in mind, we can begin to gesture towards a pluralistic knowledge graph of insights; a multiplicity of complex claims with directed links (references) to the datasets upon which the claims are based.&nbsp;</p><p>Enabling pluralism within a tool for knowledge is non-trivial. The challenge is to determine and promote synthesis and coherence across an agent-centric knowledge mapping tool.&nbsp;</p><p>The reader is encouraged to imagine a graph-builder of sorts, where participants provide insights via some medium as nodes in a graph. These publications will bear some epistemic relationship to other publications. They may be direct responses, endorsements, or rebuttals but they may also have less explicit relationships such as semantic similarity or geopolitical proximity. It is this metadata, the edges of the graph or in other words its relational structure, that represent the social relations through which we have collectively archived and evolved our various cultures for millennia.&nbsp;</p> Designing for Protocols &gt; Platforms&nbsp; <p>This blog post does not delve into the specific design or user experience (UX) of the proposed tool. Instead, our focus is to conceptualize its potential functionalities, particularly when implemented as a protocol for safely sharing data and insights across software ecosystems. We envision it as a flexible module or wrapper, designed for integration by other developers, rather than as a standalone platform. This approach considers an inter-platform collaborative model. A key aspect of this model is the 'safe answers' concept as examined in part one of this blog series, which negates the need for centralized server access to raw data. Instead, it enables communities to retain custodianship over their data, allowing external organizations to send localized algorithms to peer networks. These algorithms can then query data, with granular control over the opacity of the data being used for computation. This means that the return of the algorithm can optionally expose the raw data it is using, or provide some ‘insight’ pertaining to the data. For example, a security camera may expose to a querying party the amount of people who walked past the camera, and not the identity/profile of the individuals walking past. This method fosters a decentralized and secure approach to data analysis and sharing.&nbsp;</p> Finding Integration in Pluralism <p>While there is something just and encouraging about an ecosystem aimed at mapping the pluralistic epistemics that percolate throughout the world, there are also risks therein. What is important is that we avoid a set of disintegrated ‘knowledge’ feedback loops, echo chambers, where those embroiled in misguided or harmful informational clusters are never exposed to counter-arguments or differing schools of thought. It is important that we identify mechanisms through which to measure how coherently any given network’s graph of knowledge integrates with the other graphs in the ecosystem. To achieve this, we endeavour to draw from Integrated Information Theory (IIT).&nbsp;</p><p>IIT, initially formulated to describe consciousness, posits that a system possesses consciousness to the degree it possesses 'Phi' (Φ) — a measure of its intrinsic cause-effect power. It is a system's ability to integrate and differentiate information. Adapting this to our knowledge graph setting, we can interpret 'Phi' as a measure of the extent to which knowledge from one epistemological network is both differentiated from and integrated with another. The higher the Φ, the more integrated (and thus potentially coherent) the knowledge graph is with the broader knowledge ecosystem.</p><p>In practice, Φ along with more traditional graph analysis techniques may be used to reveal areas where connectivity can be enhanced, subsequently tuning search and discovery algorithms. This is crucial in a world increasingly fragmented by differing worldviews, as it enables us to identify points of convergence and divergence across knowledge systems. By analogizing Φ in IIT to the integration of knowledge across different epistemic frameworks, we establish a quantitative measure and orienting function to shift the knowledge network toward greater coherence.</p><p>Just as IIT posits that conscious experience arises from the integration of differentiated information within the brain, we posit that a coherent and functional knowledge ecosystem could emerge from the integration of differentiated insights across various epistemological networks. We suggest that a healthy knowledge graph, like a biological mind, is not just a repository of information, but a dynamic, integrated network capable of evolving and adapting to its environment.&nbsp;</p> Embracing the Dynamics of Knowledge Integration <p>The journey through the realms of data, insights, and knowledge graphs has elucidated the intricate and dynamic nature of knowledge itself. We believe that the concept of a pluralistic data commons, as explored in this article, is not just a theoretical framework but a necessary evolution in our approach to understanding and navigating the complex tapestry of global information. The notion of knowledge as a static, singular entity is a relic of the past. Today, we are called upon to recognize the fluidity and multiplicity of knowledge, shaped by diverse perspectives and evolving contexts.</p><p>This blog post describes praxes for knowledge mapping in a manner that aims to embrace epistemic pluralism, and resists the idea that we as a species can arrive at a positive orientation through a homogenised narrative. Rather, we believe that it is in the intersection of a diversity of narratives that we may come to a model of integrated knowledge. These praxes are important when considering the applications that may sit above the distributed storage layer we described in our first blog post. It is insufficient to merely ‘capture’ data. Data requires contextualisation and application, and it is in these later steps that the capacities and implications of the data becomes apparent. Here we must ensure that our endeavours to synthesise and unpack data are done in an inclusive and life-centric manner, and thus it is important that the communities using the distributed storage tool have the means to find the degree of integration in the knowledge artefacts derived from a given set of data.&nbsp;</p><p>The notion of measuring the integration of knowledge, borrowing from Integrated Information Theory, offers a promising path forward. It allows us to quantify and visualize the interplay of different knowledge systems, identifying points of convergence and divergence. This, in turn, can guide efforts to enhance connectivity and coherence within the global knowledge ecosystem. Such an approach recognizes that the health of our collective understanding is not just in the accumulation of data or insights, but in the integration and harmonious interplay of diverse epistemologies.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of this endeavor will depend on our collective willingness to engage with and evolve differing viewpoints, to challenge our own assumptions, and to remain open to the evolving nature of truth. The creation of these knowledge ecosystems is not just a technical endeavour but a cultural and intellectual one, requiring ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and a shared commitment to exploring the multifaceted nature of reality. As we forge ahead, let us embrace this complexity, not as a hindrance, but as a rich tapestry of human experience and wisdom, from which we can all learn and grow.</p>

 The travel and mobility industries have been anything but stationary over the last year. As we move toward 2024, let us look back at 2023 to reflect on changes and predictions that will drive these industries into the future.&nbsp; 



 



<p>Mobility and travel are industries on the move, literally. Individuals from all walks of life have an almost daily need to get from point A to point B. Our needs, our finances,&nbsp;our environments and even our <a href="https://brilliantio.com/how-does-culture-affect-travel-and-tourism/">culture dictate how we move</a> in our lives, and as times change so we must follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People are traveling more frequently than ever, the only difference is how they are traveling. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/features/mckinsey-center-for-future-mobility/our-insights/european-mobility-finance-a-25-billion-euro-growth-opportunity">McKinsey is seeing developments</a> in full-service leasing, new-car subscriptions and financing for used cars as potential core mobility-finance markets by 2030. Furthermore, micromobility will continue to grow and contribute 5% of total revenue in 2030 compared to 1% in 2023. An additional niche area which will see some growth beyond 2030 is electric vehicle charging infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As consumers are delighted about the variety of mobility trends on the horizon, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-mobility-evolves">respondents from a McKinsey survey</a> found that almost one-third plan to up their use of micromobility over the next decade and 46% have already switched to more sustainable modes of travel with an interest in shared autonomous vehicles. But whatever the mode of transport, safety is key, and the increased need for identity verification has become clear along with the desire of growing digital services.&nbsp;</p>



 Wheels of regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The travel and mobility industries have seen some exciting developments and steps forward this year, thanks largely to the increased adoption and implementation of identity verification solutions across the entire user journey. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, 2023 could also be characterized by a series of significant stops-and-starts. The most pivotal event in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility industry</a> occurred in September when, following an overwhelming vote to ban e-scooters in Paris, the French capital was cleared of the vehicles overnight. The main reason for the ban was safety concerns, following a streak of accidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This set the wheel in motion for the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">strengthening of micromobility regulation</a> in different cities around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Right now, the market can be <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/electric-kickscooters-have-come-of-age-regulators-have-taken-notice">split into four types of cities</a> ranging from unregulated, where e-scooters can be implemented without any limitation or regulation, to complete bans, where e-scooters are not allowed, such as in Paris” stated Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility and Travel Sales Director at IDnow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two regulatory archetypes, in-between no regulation and complete ban, carry certain stipulations such as an age verification process, speed limits, restricted numbers of operators and areas in which to park.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ramifications of the Paris ban are likely to be felt for the next few years as each country and city decides its stance on micromobility. Opponents to the ban argue that it was a step back for sustainable transport, and that there are benefits to embracing a clear micromobility strategy that includes faster, more convenient, eco-friendly forms of transport that can help reduce urban congestion, and offer transport options to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other changes likely to affect mobility in 2024 include ongoing digital transformation efforts, across every step of the user journey highlighting this need for progress.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Processes remain old school in car rental agencies who are now facing strong competition from fully digital car rental companies, so digitalization will play a major part in the development of the car rental space.</p>Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility and Travel Sales Director at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Consolidation will also play a role in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/mobility-report/">future of mobility</a>. “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) will become key</a>, as it will provide a new way to plan a full trip [whether bus, train, e-scooter, e-moped, bike, car or taxi] from one platform and one user experience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Traveling digital.&nbsp; 



<p>When reflecting on 2023, it didn’t come as much of a surprise to Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Travel &amp; Mobility at IDnow that, much like mobility, digitalization within the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel industry</a> played such an important role.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Covid acted as a wakeup call that there was an urgent need for digital services in the travel and mobility sectors, and that the travel industry, in general, had been very lax in dealing with these topics for decades.</p>Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Travel &amp; Mobility at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Michael explains that the major challenge facing the sector is that there is “a shortage of skilled workers and increasing customer expectations on the one hand, and low margins, rising inflation and conservative strategies on the other. Digitalization should be driven forward more rapidly, but most travel and hospitality companies still behave hesitantly and adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the digital skepticism of some travel and hospitality companies, Michael has no doubt that digitalization in every area of the tourism value chain, and user journey, will continue to be the driving force for hotels, airlines and other travel businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">Seamless travel, digital check-in processes and digital identities</a> are hot topics that will simplify travel experience in the short and long-term. It is an ongoing process and courageous companies that prioritize digital projects and implement them ASAP will be able to gain a market advantage and be more successful in the future. Plus, IDnow will be there to support them.”&nbsp;</p>

 A side of hospitality.&nbsp; 



<p>Along with mobility and travel comes their partner, hospitality. Where would travel be without hospitality to lend a hand? Due to the increase in travel, hotels and rental companies are back to business but with a few more challenges on their plate. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Many hospitality businesses have seen a surge in fraudulent attacks in recent years. Coming in a variety of different forms, the most significant include loyalty card programs which fraudsters have developed a liking for and is <a href="https://www.cybersource.com/en-us/blog/2020/loyalty-fraud-how-real-is-the-threat.html">projected to reach a market value at over $11 billion by 2025</a>, as well as the ever-present credit card fraud which the airline industry is also heavily impacted&nbsp;by&nbsp;with <a href="https://chargebacks911.com/travel-forecast-2023/">IATA totaling the loss for airlines at $1 billion a year</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraud is everywhere, no matter the industry. Unfortunately, hospitality is feeling the effects due to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-protect-owners-guests-holiday-rental-scams/">lack of protection and high turnover rate compared to other industries</a>. And it isn’t just a loss in revenue but also reputation. Luckily, thanks to identity verification, chargeback and credit card fraud can be minimized, improving security of both the hotel and the guest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/optimizing-the-online-travel-booking-experience/">from reservation</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/leveraging-digital-check-ins-hotel-operations/">check-in</a> to payment. &nbsp;</p>



 



 

 



 To the reusable future.&nbsp; 



<p>As the travel and mobility industries take stock of 2023 and look to the coming year, digitalization will play an ever-increasing role, especially through the use of reusable digital identities. While they can be applied in almost every industry, reusable digital identities are already taking off&nbsp;within the travel sector where airlines and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have already showcased their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/iata-first-integrated-journey-digital-identity/">Proof of Concept – End to End Digital Identity initiative</a> near the end of 2023 in collaboration with IDnow. With such developments arising in travel, digital identities (travel credentials, boarding passes, visas, etc.) will be stored in digital wallets, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a>, ready-to-use within seconds making the future of travel much more pleasant and stress-free. The possibilities of tomorrow are only a [digital] wallet away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contributions by: Sam Gbafa (Product Prototyping), Wayne Chang (Strategy), Parke Hunter (Content &amp; Editorial)</p><p>Picture this scenario: You're a politician running for state office. It's been a long campaign, and the polls are very close — a virtual tie. It's the night before election day when most of the ballots come in.</p><p>You get a call in the middle of the night, and it's the head of your campaign. There seems to be a fake story about you spreading like wildfire that has come out of nowhere. What's worse is that there’s also a video of you confirming and apologizing for the fake allegations spreading alongside, coming from a verified account with a name spelled in a way that looks visually identical to yours! Your campaign manager has already started damage control. You know that this will be disproven, as the allegations are obviously false. But the election is tomorrow– is there enough time? If only people could see that that apology video is fake and didn't come from your campaign. Your campaign manager asks: how should we move forward?</p><p>Enter a world with content authenticity…</p><p>In a world driven by content authenticity, there is a verifiable way to prove any content's author. In the campaign example, you would have set up a system where you registered digital credentials, including your mobile driver’s license, .gov email, and a state credential that includes your current title to create a verifiable online digital identity.&nbsp;</p><p>Every message, video, and post by the campaign has a small reference with it that can be retrieved and verified by platforms, allowing them to give you a special verification symbol with all of your content. Anyone can check this verification and pull down the original content you posted. Social media platforms would instantly make it clear that the apology video didn't come from your campaign. This fake story is still out there, but its power is diminished.</p> An Introduction to Content Authenticity <p>Throughout time, the ways in which we’ve encountered news and information in the media have shifted dramatically. With the proliferation of AI, social media platforms, and influencers, it’s become a challenge to weed out the truth from misinformation. Not being able to verify the legitimacy of content is problematic, especially when it comes to political news or government information, as portrayed in the example above.</p><p>Multiple organizations are currently working on tech approaches to solve this problem by adding a layer of trust and verification to the content we consume. This layer of trust and verification added to content is called content authenticity. At our core, SpruceID’s mission is to let users control their identity and personal data across the web in a way that facilitates trusted interactions. As a result, contributing to the future of content authenticity, powered by trusted digital identity, is important to us.</p> The Rise of Digital Content, Platforms and Publishers <p>From relying on a few major news providers to the rise of citizen “journalism” on social media platforms—the internet has made it easier than ever for anyone to have a global reach. With this new power, it becomes more challenging for information consumers to differentiate what is real from what is fake.</p><p>To combat this, platforms have traditionally used verification of notable figures. Tools like the Twitter Blue Checkmark or the Verified Badge on Instagram give users a clear way to know who to trust. However, there have proven to be issues with this approach, including platform risk (as seen with Twitter’s recent changes to verification), bias and discrimination (such as a political campaign being unable to make verifiable statements due to their political opinion), and legitimization of harmful entities if someone can game the verification system to post with authority. These platforms also have the power to allow verified posts to look different and appear more frequently. By modifying their platform, they can increase or decrease trust in “verified” content with their audience.</p><p>Currently, these platforms have to design and build their own verification systems, and they are not interoperable with one another. There isn’t a clear way to say that the identity of “The New York Times” on Facebook is the same as that on Twitter (besides the recognition of that entity’s name). These platforms have, in part, understood their responsibility to inform people of what can and cannot be trusted. They have done so with different approaches, including <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/about/introduction?ref=blog.spruceid.com">community notes</a> on Twitter and fact-checking on Facebook.</p> Approaching Solutions&nbsp; <p>Today, we’ve begun to see political figures address the danger of deepfakes and the need for a solution to AI-generated content. On October 30th, 2023, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_JLkU5xF2Y&amp;t=3s&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">President Joe Biden spoke out</a> about signing an executive order on artificial intelligence, which is the first of its kind for the U.S. Government. He stated:</p><p>“With AI, fraudsters can take a 3-second recording of your voice can generate an impersonation good enough to fool you; it’s mindblowing…I said, ‘when the hell did I say that?’”</p><p>With an open <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">executive order</a> calling for technology to solve this problem of verifying who is saying what, this currently remains a pressing issue. We believe that one way to approach this issue is by introducing a way to verify who posted what content by tying said content to the poster’s verifiable identity using digital credentials.</p> SpruceID Proof of Concept <p>In order to demonstrate a potential solution for content authenticity, we created a proof-of-concept using our SpruceKit open-source libraries. We recently presented this proof-of-concept in Washington D.C. at <a href="https://dcfintechweek.org/agenda-2023-2/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">D.C. Fintech Week</a> to show what a solution could hypothetically look like. Here, we’ll break down the technology in our proof-of-concept and describe how these tools can be used to verify content and build trust across all platforms.</p> Key SpruceKit Components for Content Authenticity <p>This proof of concept uses the following technologies we’ve developed as part of SpruceKit, our open-source libraries. We will reference these tools in our walkthrough below:</p><p>SpruceID Libraries used in this demo:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rebase</a> is a tool that allows you to run a credential issuer. Rebase lets you run a witness that can programmatically examine multiple proofs from someone requesting a credential, verify those proofs, and then issue a credential.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Kepler</a> is a data storage system where you permission who has access to this data with your Ethereum keys. You sign in with your Ethereum keys, and that signature permits the app you are using to access and store data.</p><p>Other technologies used:</p><p><a href="https://attest.sh/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Attestation Service</a> is an infrastructure for making attestations on or off of a blockchain about anything. We use it as a place to make attestations.</p><p><a href="https://base.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Base</a> is the blockchain we are using for this demo. It allows for low-cost attestations (100s of attestations per dollar). Someone must pay this fee for a transaction to be posted as a public blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://web3.storage/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">web3.storage</a> are tools we use to store and retrieve data verifiably. IPFS summarizes the file into a Content ID, which can then be used to retrieve that file. It does this in a way so that it’s verifiable that the file you upload is the file you retrieve. We use web3.storage as an easy way to interact with the IPFS network.</p> Content Authenticity in Action <p>In this walkthrough, we’ll break down how to both create and verify Content Authenticity claims in order to make a statement or claim and then “stamp” that claim (with a high assurance credential such as a mobile driver’s license or a .gov email) so that your audience can be confident that it was you who made it.</p> 1) Account Setup and Adding Credentials <p>When you land on the Content Authenticity page, you can either create a Content Authenticity claim or verify one. First, let’s create a claim.</p> <p>To create a Content Authenticity claim, you will first need to sign in. We use Sign-in with Ethereum to connect to Kepler in order to store and retrieve data associated with our account. This data includes the credentials we have and any files we have uploaded.</p> <p>If this is your first time interacting with your account, you’ll need to create a data vault with Kepler (our data storage system). This second signature request creates a place where your data is stored.</p> <p>If you have no credentials, you can easily create them. Our Rebase issuer powers the process of creating credentials. To create a credential, select “issue first credential,” and you’ll be taken to the following page.</p> <p>From here, we'll choose the Email credential.</p> <p>In the process of adding a credential, you prove two things: </p><p>1) you are in control of the keys you want to associate with the email </p><p>2) You control the email you want to associate with the keys. </p><p>If both of these are verified by the witness, then it will issue you a credential. Going through the steps here proves these things to the witness. In step 1, you say what email you’ll be using. Step 2 prompts you to sign a message with the email and Ethereum public key in it. This message and signature are cryptographically verifiable, and the witness checks that. Lastly, you are sent an email with a unique challenge to the email provided. If you have control of this email account, you can respond to the challenge correctly. Providing this proves access to the email. Once proven, the witness will issue you a credential that says your email is the same as your Ethereum public key. This credential is an important pillar in our content authenticity solution, as it anchors the cryptographic signer to other identities.</p> <p>Once they are added, any credentials you have, such as your Twitter handle, email address, etc. will be displayed under the Credential section below.</p><p>In this example, the issuer is the Spruce Rebase Demo Witness, but there can be many other credential issuers, including your organization, your government, or a club you are a part of. These credential issuers may have other requirements besides the simple proofs to issue an email credential. Our demo trusts credentials issued by the Spruce Rebase Demo Witness, but ultimately, a user may have different trust models, such as trusting an issuing key that belongs to the New York Times or the California DMV.</p> 2) Upload Your Content <p>Upload a file to IPFS and get its content identifier to accompany your claim. This identifier is both a cryptographic hash of the content and a way to retrieve the content from the IPFS network. Anything uploaded is public and irreversible.</p> <p>Select the file, and then you can make claims about that content.</p>  3) Make a Claim About Your Content <p>Once you have your credentials and have uploaded the content you want to make a claim about, you can use this tool to make those claims!</p> <p>First, select the credentials you want to use in order to make a claim. I’ll select my GitHub and email accounts.</p> <p>Then, you select the file you want to make a claim about.</p> <p>This flow supports <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Content Credentials</a>, an effort by the <a href="https://c2pa.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</a> to develop technical standards for certifying media content's source and history (or provenance). Some <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/leica-launches-worlds-first-camera-with-content-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">hardware</a> and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/content-credentials.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">software</a> support content credentials, which prove the source and modifications to an image. You can export those and add them as part of this optional step. Depending on the use case, having that cryptographic verification of where an image came from is just as necessary as who is posting it.</p> <p>The uploader can add additional claims you want to make regarding the image. This example demonstrates making a claim about the SpruceID logo.</p> <p>Review and submit the transaction to the blockchain. This page lets you preview the data and submit it to the blockchain. You can go back and fix any errors. Once it’s submitted, it can never be undone. It will be public and permanent.</p><p></p> 4) Verifying a Claim <p>You'll be sent to the verification page once a content authenticity claim has been posted. This page is the public page that others see when examining this content. </p> <p>This page verifies the data and includes cryptographic checks about the credentials, the issuer of those credentials, and the identity of the poster of the claim to ensure they all add up. It also retrieves and displays the content so you can see the content about which a claim was made.</p> Watch a Demo <p>This demo walks you through the same steps above to recap how one would create and verify content authenticity claims.</p> What’s next for Content Authenticity? <p>From the increasing need for solving content trust and verification to our hypothetical example of how this problem could be addressed today, it’s difficult to say exactly how the world will tackle this complex problem. SpruceID has the knowledge and expertise to help tie provable high-assurance identity attributes (such as a mobile driver’s license) into content that is put out to the public in order to elevate the level of trust in the person or entity making the statement. Empowering users to control their identity and personal data across the web is woven into our DNA. We’re excited to share this proof-of-concept to help shape a future with trusted identity and interactions online.</p> <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/digital-identity-now-and-future/digital-identity-today?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More about Digital Identity</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p></p><p></p>

 Change announcements 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in November 2023, we <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">announced</a> the auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies to automatically protect tenants based on risk signals, licensing, and usage. This is to remind you that Microsoft will begin automatically protecting customers with Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies. These are policies that Microsoft creates and enables in customer tenants. The following policies will be rolled out to all eligible tenants:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Policy&nbsp;</p>


<p>Who it’s for&nbsp;</p>


<p>What it does&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for admin portals&nbsp;</p>


<p>All customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers privileged admin roles and requires multifactor authentication when an admin signs into a Microsoft admin portal.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users&nbsp;</p>


<p>Existing per-user multifactor authentication customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy applies to users with per-user multifactor authentication and requires multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It helps organizations transition to Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for high-risk sign-ins&nbsp;</p>


<p>Microsoft Entra ID Premium Plan 2 customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers all users and requires multifactor authentication and reauthentication during high-risk sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll begin a gradual rollout of these policies to all eligible tenants and notify in advance. Once the policies are visible in your tenant, you’ll have 90 days to review and customize or disable them before we turn them on. For those 90 days, the policies will be in report-only mode, which means Conditional Access will log the policy results without enforcing them. For more information refer to the blog, “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.”  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update on Azure AD Graph Retirement&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June of 2023, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> that described the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will be done with incremental steps. We’re committed to supporting our customers through this retirement and migration to Microsoft Graph, and we’re committed to increased transparency and communication as we work through this change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Retirement: Stage One &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first stage of Azure AD Graph retirement will begin later in 2024. We’ll share a specific date in a subsequent update, with a minimum of three months of advance notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we enter this first stage, applications that are created after a specific date will encounter an error for requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net/">https://graph.windows.net</a>). We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph at this point, and we’ll provide an optional configuration to allow applications created after this point to resume use of Azure AD Graph APIs for an extended period. If you develop or distribute software that requires applications to be created as part of the installation or setup, and these applications will need to access Azure AD Graph APIs, you must begin planning to avoid interruption. This optional configuration can be set on an application after it is created, and the configuration change will be done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll provide more detailed guidance on the timeline for this plan and on configuring the optional configuration in our next update.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I find Applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs? &nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re working to deliver a new experience to help our customers identify applications in their tenant that are using Azure AD Graph APIs. This will be enabled through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-use-recommendations">Microsoft Entra Recommendations</a> experience. We’re expecting to enable this experience in the first months of 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to audit logs behavior for custom security attributes&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning in October 2023, changes were made to custom security attribute audit logs for general availability that might impact your daily operations. If you’ve been using custom security attribute audit logs during the preview, here are the actions you must take before February 2024 to ensure your audit log operations aren't disrupted:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Use new audit logs location.&nbsp; 
 Assign Attribute Log roles to view audit logs. &nbsp; 
 Create new diagnostic settings to export audit logs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/custom-security-attributes-manage#changes-to-audit-logs-behavior">Changes to audit logs behavior</a>.  &nbsp;<br> </p>
<p>Changing sign-in audience for new applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will change the default value of 'signInAudience' property in app registration from 'AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount' to 'AzureADMyOrg'. Our analysis shows that most new applications do not ever support users outside the application tenant. This will improve latency and security of apps. For more information on application sign-in audience, refer to the documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0#signinaudience-values">application resource type - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling app instance lock by default&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will have “App instance lock” enabled by default. The capability called App instance lock for workload identities was launched in September 2023. This feature allows app developers to protect their multi-tenant apps from attackers tampering with critical properties. Applications created using Entra ID portal already have the setting enabled by default, and going forward, it will be enabled for other app creation surface areas such as MS Graph, PowerShell, and SDKs. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-configure-app-instance-property-locks">How to configure app instance property lock in your applications | Microsoft Learn</a>.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Account is replacing legacy profile page&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-new-feature-and-change-announcements/ba-p/3796396">announced</a> the legacy profile page will be replaced with a new, modernized experience. This is a reminder that My Account (<a href="https://www.myaccount.microsoft.com/">https://www.myaccount.microsoft.com</a>) will replace the existing Profile page (<a href="https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/profile">https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/profile</a>) by January 2024. My Account enables customers to manage account details, language and privacy settings, security information, and more. My Account has been around for several years and has all the functionality of the legacy profile page. This deprecation is moving customers to a better and more modern experience. No actions are required by the customers, as customers will be automatically directed to the new My Account experience. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, we talked about <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">the risks that come with granting OAuth tokens without restraint</a> across your organization and mentioned two ways to manage this process:</p>
 
 You can periodically check your Google admin console to see what permissions are authorized and manually revoke access where needed.&nbsp; 
 Or you can also easily track this information with YeshID.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of access to your Google Workspace, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions granted to third-party applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And today, we’re making it even easier to gather those insights and take immediate action with new data visualization capabilities in YeshID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s explore how data visualization can play a pivotal role in mitigating risks like data exposure and unintentional oversharing of permissions. We’ll introduce you to our new visualization tool along the way.&nbsp;</p>
 Our risk representation of OAuth scopes&nbsp; 
<p>Humans are really good at pattern recognition, and seeing things drawn or color-coded can help us quickly grasp a concept. In this case, we can use data visualization to provide a granular representation of OAuth scopes (the permissions granted to applications), breaking them down into easily digestible components and allowing you to pinpoint areas of high risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This clarity enables informed decision-making when it comes to understanding exposure from connected applications and adjusting permissions to align with organizational security policies. YeshID’s data visualization breaks OAuth scopes into a digestible color-coded graph so you can easily pinpoint areas of risk. We use <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/sensitive-scope-verification">Google’s sensitive/restricted scope classification system</a> to categorize granted scopes on a green, yellow, red basis. Find an anomaly? We also make it easy to revoke or block access.</p>
 Not just a pretty picture 
<p>Once you have an idea of what looks suspicious, YeshID makes it easy to act with options to revoke, block, or manage applications.</p>
 
 Revoking a third-party application’s access essentially invalidates the access that your users have granted to an application. However, this is temporary and your user could grant permissions again. We allow you to mark it as ‘Forbidden,’ and we will highlight it if access has been regranted. 
 Blocking an OAuth token goes a step further by preventing the associated application from requesting access to the user’s Google Workspace data altogether — a cumbersome process <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en">when done through the Admin Console</a>. 
 
<p>Here it is in action.</p>
<p></p>
 Try YeshID now 
<p>Data visualization within YeshID transforms the complexity of app access management into a visual narrative that’s easier to grasp at a glance. By harnessing the power of visualizations, you can navigate the challenges of OAuth tokens, enhance security measures, and foster a culture of awareness and responsibility among users. <a href="https://yeshid.com/visualization/">Learn more</a>.</p>

 How much should a predictoor stake, to maximize revenue and bound&nbsp;risk?  Abstract <p>This article is for predictoors — people running prediction bots in <a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> ecosystem.</p><p>If you stake more, you can earn more, but only to a point. Earnings are bounded by sales of the feeds. So if you stake too much, you will lose&nbsp;$.</p><p>This article provide equations that bound how much to stake, along with general&nbsp;tips.</p> 1. Introduction <p>Ocean Predictoor offers data feeds predicting the price movements of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap during the next 5 and 60 minute intervals. Data scientists can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">run a predictoor bot</a> that submits forecasts for these tokens to Predictoor contracts, and earn&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Rewards are financed by sales of the feeds. These are (i) organic purchases by traders and others, (ii) purchases from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor Data Farming</a> OCEAN side, and (iii) rewards from Predictoor DF ROSE side, which are pro-rata to the other&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Rewards are affected&nbsp;by:</p>  Amount of sales. Sales↑ means rewards↑.  Prediction accuracy. Accuracy↑ means rewards↑.  Amount of stake. Stake↑ means potential for more reward, bounded by prediction feed sales; more on this&nbsp;later.  <p>Given all these factors, much should a predictoor stake, to maximize revenue and bound risk? The article provides some answers to that question.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an equation for payout as a function of such factors. Section 3 has formulae for upper-bound stake amounts; the models have assumptions but are helpful in practice. Section 4 provides general tips. Section 5 concludes.</p> 2. Payout&nbsp;Equation <p>For a given predictoor’s prediction: if the prediction is wrong, stake is slashed, i.e. they lose the stake. If the prediction is correct, they receive a&nbsp;payout.</p><p>Under a correct prediction, payout&nbsp;is:</p><p>The initial terms specify that the rewards are distributed only among those who predicted correctly. In order to maximize rewards, participants must not only be accurate in their predictions but also stake an amount reflecting their confidence in these predictions.</p><p>If all participants stake the same amount, rewards are equally divided among those who predicted correctly. However, if a participant makes a correct prediction but stakes less than others, their reward is smaller. Conversely, placing a high stake on an incorrect prediction results in the loss of the entire&nbsp;stake.</p> 3. How Much To&nbsp;Stake? <p>Given these factors, it’s crucial to carefully decide how much to stake. To better understand this, let’s examine some scenarios from simple to&nbsp;complex.</p> 3.1 How Much to Stake: Single Predictoor Scenario <p>The objective is to determine the appropriate amount to&nbsp;stak.</p><p>Let’s start by assuming there is only one predictoor in the system&nbsp;. Therefore we can ignore factors related to other predictoors’ stakes. We only have to consider reward amount and accuracy.</p><p>Let’s assume that their classifier’s accuracy is 50%, i.e. random, making correct predictions half of the&nbsp;time.</p><p>Then, expected payout E[Payout] is:</p><p>And, expected return E[R]&nbsp;is:</p> 3.1 How Much to Stake: Multiple Predictoors Scenario <p>Assume now that other predictoors enter the game. The main modification to the equations is that the % of total rewards for a particular predictor with arbitrary accuracy Acc, is weighted by the amount of&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Then, expected payout&nbsp;is:</p><p>This assumes that amount staked by all the predictoors does not change with time, and the rewards remain constant across time as well. (Making such an assumption makes modeling more tractable, yet still&nbsp;useful.)</p><p>To further simplify the model, we can assume that each of the n predictoors stakes the same amount sₚ.&nbsp;Then:</p><p>The return is&nbsp;then:</p><p>From the equation above, we see that returns are positive as long as the numerator is greater than&nbsp;sₚ:</p><p>Given a particular value of accuracy Acc, under the conditions presented (all predictoors stake the same amount, stakes and rewards are constant) we obtain the following relationship.</p><p>Stake Bounding&nbsp;Formula:</p><p>This suggests that for a specific level of accuracy, the amount staked should not exceed the figures on the right side of the equation to ensure a positive return, according to the assumptions made.</p> 4. Stake Amount Guidelines <p>Here are some general guidelines on how much to&nbsp;stake.</p>  The lower-bound sales for a given week are the Data Farming Rewards in OCEAN and in ROSE, on the order of 37500 OCEAN and 100000 ROSE. You can use this for r_f in the formulae.  Higher accuracy levels lessen the likelihood of negative&nbsp;returns.  When determining the stake amount, consider the stakes of other users. The system allocates rewards based not only on accuracy but also on the stake amount. Hence, in each epoch, users who predict correctly and have a larger stake will receive a larger share of the&nbsp;rewards.  Start with very small stakes, where you definitely aren’t bounded by sales. Get a feel for how everything works end-to-end, and how the variables above relate in practice. Only when you feel more confident should you&nbsp;increase  <p>Finally — hopefully to state the obvious — it’s unwise to stake all your OCEAN into a single prediction even if your model’s accuracy is extremely high. Because if you’re wrong then you lose it all! All the models above assume that amount staked is significantly lower than this. However there is a way to bound this amount too, such that you never risk it all yet maximize profit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>. It’s the original “right-size” approach to making bets in poker and trading, and applies equally&nbsp;here.</p> 4. On Formula&nbsp;Accuracy <p>The two scenarios presented above are relatively simple due to making specific assumptions. Nonetheless, we hope they prove useful in practice.</p><p>For predictoors who want to further maximize their return by improving formula accuracy further, here are some possibilities (at the cost of higher formula complexity).</p>  Fixed predictoors’ stake → stake changing over time → real-time estimates of&nbsp;stake  Fixed prediction model accuracy → real-time estimates of&nbsp;accuracy  Rewards lower bound from Data Farming → add organic sales estimate → real-time estimates of organic&nbsp;sales  Ignore gas fees → add gas fees estimate → real-time estimate of gas&nbsp;fees  (and more)   5. Conclusion <p>This article is for predictoors — people running prediction bots in <a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> ecosystem.</p><p>If you stake more, you can earn more, but only to a point. Earnings are bounded by sales of the feeds. So if you stake too much, you will lose&nbsp;$.</p><p>This article provided equations that bound how much to stake, along with general&nbsp;tips.</p> Final Note <p>⚠️ You will lose money as a predictoor if your $ out exceeds your $ in. If you have low accuracy you’ll have your stake slashed a lot. Do account for gas fees, compute costs, and more. Everything you do is your responsibility, at your discretion.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>For anyone <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/how-can-you-protect-your-gpt/500642">paying attention</a> to the OpenAI DevDay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk">announcements</a> a few weeks ago, Gizmodo’s recent article “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/security-vulnerabilities-openai-chatgpt-custom-gpt-1851057912">Be Careful What You Tell OpenAI’s GPTs</a>” shouldn’t come as news. (To refresh everyone’s memory, “GPTs” were announced as OpenAI’s platform for building custom agents that can be shared as apps with other users.) It was clear from the demos and presentations that the GPT Store will expose to the public your prompts, the “Knowledge” files you upload, the APIs used for “Actions,” and any metadata your GPT employs. YouTube videos like <a href="https://youtu.be/gEf0BPkqQSM">this one</a> even demonstrate in detail how shockingly easy it is to acquire this information with a few simple hacks.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious security concerns, it also invalidates any commercial value promised by the GPT Store because there can essentially be no proprietary intellectual property—the GPT Store will simply become one giant copy machine.</p>
<p>But then, maybe we don’t need the GPT Store to be so much an innovation center as a relationship store (as in “storage” in this case). This is something I proposed at our recent cyberevolution conference in my presentation, “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5437/3">Thanks to AI, the Future of Security is Collaborative</a>.” It’s a concept that bears repeating in this context.</p>
 The App Store was Never Actually About You, Anyway 
<p>Apple is lauded profusely for its human-centric design. But I posit that it merely seems user-friendly—it’s actually a developer-centric design with enough glitz to retain the attention of us normals. As Exhibit A, I offer the home screen of the iPhone. Let’s say you want to send your friend Sam a message; the first problem you’re confronted with is which messaging app to use. In your mind, you have to work through a matrix, which looks something like this:</p>



App
When to use
Why use it now?


Apple Messages
Blue contacts (aka “not green”)
Easy access and group chats


WhatsApp
International
I’m traveling


Facebook Messenger
Friends &amp; family
Reacting to a post


Signal
Privacy
News about his firing—needs to be on the DL


WeChat
China &amp; stickers
I want to send a cute sticker!


Snapchat
Generational
Probably won’t use


Line
AsiaPac &amp; stickers
Want to use a sticker that’s not on WeChat


Slack
Work &amp; workgroups
Group conversation about GPT security


Google Chat&nbsp;
Work &amp; play
We use Google Workspace sometimes


Discord
Gamers
We’re playing a game


Instagram
React to images
I’m a promoter


Skype
General purpose
If nothing else seems appropriate at the time



<p>Table 1: A rubric for deciding which messaging app to use right now (e-mail apps excluded)</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, I prompted Stability.ai’s DreamStudio to generate a phone with only messaging apps on the home screen (no need to reverse-engineer the prompt, I provide it for you). The “message” of the image is of course to satirize the consternation this screen evokes in the human who faces so many nuanced options simply to message a friend. I think DreamStudio got this one exactly right because the text under the weird icons isn’t even intelligible 😀.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, who actually benefits from the App Store approach? It’s clearly not the user. Unsurprisingly, App stores are for the sellers and the apps represent a relationship between you and the developer. If you want to chat with a friend, you’ll first need to figure out which of your developer friends you want to broker that message.</p>
 Not Apps, not GPTs—GPme 
<p>I got an e-mail from OpenAI on December 1st, reiterating the company’s desire to empower “builders” with more tools and announcing the launch of the GPT store “early next year.” (Note: e-mail seems a rather old-fashioned way to communicate information about GPTs; but it’s ubiquitous, so I guess that’s the kind of calculation they made in the marketing department.) In case you didn’t get the message, here it is:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Short and to the point—not even any mention of Sam Altman. Perfect. But the e-mail reinforces the point that OpenAI is courting “builders” (erstwhile developers) rather than the natural inhabitants of AI space: personas.</p>
<p>Whether the economic incentives of OpenAI will prove sustainable for builders remains to be seen; but the platform can already support persona-to-persona relationships on the internet. Let me explain.</p>
<p>In my cyberevolution presentation, I introduced a new species, one that lives natively on the internet: Homo ex machina. I asked ChatGPT for a definition and got a surprisingly well-thought-out response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Homo ex machina" is a Latin phrase that could be translated into English as "Man from the machine." This phrase seems to be a play on the term "deus ex machina," which means "god from the machine" and refers to a plot device where a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected intervention. "Homo ex machina" could imply a human being emerging from or created by a machine, possibly referring to the concept of artificial intelligence or cybernetic organisms in a philosophical or literary context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my view, GPTs shouldn’t be viewed as a kitchen appliance like Talkie Toaster or a sentient being like I, Robot, which are separate from natural persons; rather, they should make natural persons more like an internet-native version of Iron Man. DALL-E seemed to get it right away—on the first prompt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DALL-E prompt: A human with a superhero suit on that bestows god-like powers</p>
<p>A GPme (working title) is a personal power up that combines your humanity with superpowers. Your apparent intelligence will be near genius level; your knowledge will be encyclopedic; your linguistic skills will extend to fluency in dozens of languages; your creativity will be unbounded. You may even become a decent driver.</p>
 How GPme Storage would Foster Trustful Relationships 
<p>What we really want those icons on our home screens to represent is the totality of our relationships—our relationships to other people, other GPme’s, groups, businesses, governments, and even our enemies. Behind each of those social emoticons lies an avatar representing our personal interests in that relationship. The GPme would retain all the history, all the promises, all the aspirations as well as an accounting of the contributions made and the current status of the relationship. In this way, relationships will become more symmetrical, fair, and trustful.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A GPme for All Seasons</p>
 GPme’s also change the game for decentralized identity 
<p>For the decentralized identity crowd out there (including all the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> folks), take notice: by using GPTs (or similar agents such as Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio">CoPilots</a>) as a relationship aggregator rather than an app store, we have the beginnings of a new type of decentralized identity. It’s not a wallet, it’s not a self-sovereign identity (SSI), and it’s not a decentralized identifier (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>). Instead, we have a (for lack of digital term) fully fleshed out GPT relationship store, which provides a way for individuals to maintain the totality of their relationships with the assistance of powerful AIs. And beyond providing mere channels for connectivity (as messaging apps do), these GPT relationships could function as a trust base.</p>
<p>This in turn would form a network of decentralized trust anchors consisting of persona-to-persona relationships. In this context, the identity data and metadata wouldn’t need to be directly tied to the natural persons who own or operate these personas, enhancing privacy tremendously.</p>
<p>Returning to SSI, ledgers have an important role to play in GPT relationship stores. Whereas apps are at risk from information exposure, revealing information about your GPT relationships turns out to be very helpful from a trust perspective. In fact, information about your GPT relationships should be public, and verifiable, like on a ledger. This approach enables reputation and cost signaling, which are proven to foster interparty trust (see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-future-of-security-is-collaborative-cre23">my cyberevolution slides</a> for references as well as my recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti">Advisory Note</a> on distributed identity).</p>
<p>In summary, using swarms of GPme’s, natural persons can empower GPT actors to both protect them in a hostile, foreboding internet while engaging in meaningful and productive relationships.</p>

 We interview experts from the world of financial services, crypto and gambling to discover some of the year’s major regulatory and technological surprises, and the trends awaiting the identity verification sector in 2024. 



 



<p>We click, we scroll, we awkwardly stare at the camera, and we do that ‘press, but don’t actually press, just lightly rest it upon the side button thing’ every single day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we approach 2024, it’s no exaggeration to say we spend most of our lives online; personally, and professionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, we’re probably not too many years away from our digital selves becoming more trusted and, in a way, able to do more than our soft, fleshy human forms. Able to register, transact and be recognized quicker and more effectively online than in person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every industry has gone digital. Fact. It’s not even a controversial and outlandishly sci-fi statement to make anymore. We buy, we sell, we save, we transact, we subscribe and gamble – all online, often without physically interacting with another person, whether in person or online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if we’re spending more time online, then it’s important to be able to prove our identity – that we are who we say we are, and that the people we’re interacting with are who they claim to be. This is where industry regulations, rules and established processes like identity verification data and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> come into play. Laws ensure online users behave in a legally binding and appropriate way.</p>



 Accountability vs anonymity. 



<p>But, what about an internet user’s right to remain anonymous and even more importantly, their right to privacy? &nbsp;</p>



<p>The desire for anonymity may not necessarily be rooted in the wish to engage in illegal activities away from prying eyes, but more as a genuine concern for how their personal identifiable information and other important data could be hacked and tracked or even used for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How to balance accountability with anonymity has been a conundrum since the internet was first invented and is a recurring bone of contention whenever new regulation or frameworks are created. The ongoing, fractious exchanges on the details of the proposed Electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS 2.0) have been testament to that. More on that later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite tech titans’ claims to the contrary, there is no simple one-size fits all answer to the question of how to offer both anonymity and privacy. If there was, organizations would never be fined for internal failings like AML and KYC deficiencies; users would never fall victim to fraud; and the internet would be a wonderland, free from financial crime, scams and hate speech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A potential answer lies in the balancing act between the needs of the corporation and the needs of the consumer, in the open and ongoing dialogue between regulatory decisionmakers and industry insiders for the common purpose of a secure and attractive marketplace, and in the clever deployment of technology that can optimize processes while ensuring a superior digital customer experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this blog, we speak to our Spotlight Interview alumni, as well as IDnow’s own experts to discover the sector developments that have surprised them in 2023, and what trends they predict will have the most impact in 2024.</p>

 Is that the real you, or is that just your identity? 



<p>The global digital identity solution market is projected to grow from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/digital-identity-solutions-market-247527694.html">$34.5 billion in 2023</a> to a staggering $83.2 billion by 2028. The main reasons for the growth are the increasing usage of online services (across an ever-expanding range of sectors and use cases); the introduction of more cost-effective AI/ML-powered services; and the rise in SME adoption of identity management solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of 2024. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are simply staggering.</p>



 Is traditional banking dead? 



<p>Unsurprisingly, considering how important identity checks are in heavily regulated industries like financial services, the banking sector performed the lion’s share of identity verification checks in 2023 (37 billion), which is more than half of the global identification market. The days of visiting branches to verify your identity to open a bank account, or make a transaction payment are nearing the end, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb3f99a2-bd4c-4ba1-8cb9-432ecfbf73ab">closures of approximately one in eight bank branches</a> in the UK in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>In 2023, we’ve seen a lot of interest in FinTechs, including neobanks. The digital-only trend has certainly not gone unnoticed by traditional banks, which are now looking into what technologies and what partners can do to help them improve aspects such as user experience.&nbsp;</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and FinTech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>The use of technology to optimize operational efficiencies, enhance customer experience and ultimately reduce fraud has become pivotal, regardless of the sector, but especially in financial services. Financial services are often at the forefront of technological innovation and leading the charge toward safer and more secure environments for transacting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Little wonder then that the global growth in volume of identity verification checks has been <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">driven largely by banks adopting stronger biometric identity</a> verification methods in a bid to combat fraud, in particular account takeover and card-not-present fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It will come as no surprise that financial services continue to be the industry most exposed to fraudsters,” said Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow. “Fraudsters and the technology at their disposal are becoming increasingly more sophisticated.”</p>



 The never-ending cat and mouse game of fraud prevention. 



<p>The amount of money lost to fraud is staggering. In the UK alone, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">approximately £3 billion is lost every single year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, Lovro said that there were three things that surprised him:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“First was the rapid rise of social engineering, from phone calls to SMS, emails, phishing, everything has increased. The second surprise for me is that physical document fraud has almost completely disappeared – it’s not zero, but it’s a very steep curve down. Unfortunately, the quality of fraudulent documents has improved dramatically, with hologram production at such a high level now that they’re more difficult to detect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third development that surprised Lovro in 2023 was how innovative many fraudsters have become regarding the use of synthetic fraud, synthetic identities and deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I thought it would take another few years before we got to this stage. Up until very recently, synthetic fraud was very rudimentary, but it is getting much better and more sophisticated.</p>Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>As identity verification methods like liveness checks are known to prevent spoofing and other types of fraud, organizations that have not been using biometric verification methods in 2023 should be doing so in 2024 to protect their business, their customers, and their reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the use of the latest forms of identity verification technology can certainly help organizations learn more about their customers, and thereby prevent fraud in the process, there are certain types of social engineering fraud, like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> that take advantage of human emotional frailty, so are harder to safeguard against.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ex-police officer and self-professed fraud nerd, Paul Stratton agrees that the increase in social engineering is a worrying trend that will unfortunately continue into 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Romance and ‘repeat victimization’ fraud (e.g.: a romance fraud victim is steered into investment fraud) will continue to prosper. Breaking the cycle of manipulation and coercion is almost impossible when that person believes it is all legitimate… This is when banks and financial institutions must step in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/"> Jinisha Bhatt, AML and crypto fraud investigator</a>, who also dedicates a lot of her time researching and helping to prevent human trafficking, it’s also important to factor in the link between social engineering fraud, and human trafficking violations.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Today, highly organized scam compounds run rampant in countries like Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar and force ‘workers’ to groom, manipulate and defraud victims of romance and investment scams worldwide.</p>Jinisha Bhatt, AML and crypto fraud investigator.</blockquote>



<p>“The larger the pool of financial fraud victims, the higher the demand for scam factory workers. This is a machine that continues to feed itself at an insurmountable cost to human beings on each end of the cycle. While we focus our efforts on preventing pig butchering scams, we must also continue to enhance international cooperation among law enforcement and strengthen measures to impose human rights-related sanctions against entities and individuals who profit from this crime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever the reason banks or any organization chooses to overhaul their customer onboarding process and internal controls, an identity verification platform that can address the aforementioned three driving forces: optimize operational efficiencies, enhance customer experience, reduce fraud – will further accelerate the mass adoption of digital identity verification services.</p>



<p>As consumers become more wary about sharing their PII data due to privacy concerns or the risk of data breaches and the rise of identity theft, synthetic identity fraud or account takeover there is a need for organizations to switch their focus from frictionless user journeys to optimized user journeys with ‘good friction’ that not only deters fraudsters but also increases consumer confidence and trust in the organizations onboarding process. It is a balance between convenience and security for consumer confidence that needs to be carefully managed.</p>



 Play time’s over: The year that crypto was forced to grow up. 



<p>As a sector that by its very existence questions the limitations of established systems and structures, it is understandable that many crypto firms experiment with new ways of doing business, with some even making the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">risky decision to forgo traditional KYC checks</a> altogether. While 2023 proved an important and somewhat stabilizing year for the evolution of the industry, with both the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulatory framework</a>,( MiCA) and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed regulatory regime,</a> taking significant steps toward completion, it was also a somewhat unsettled year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think what surprised me most about 2023 was the sheer level of turbulence. In fact, there is still ongoing litigation with many major crypto names. Reassuringly however, this hasn’t halted innovation, which is what crypto is all about. We saw the likes of Worldcoin launch, which is a new take on identity and proof of personhood, so it’s these kinds of developments that show that crypto is making significant strides in the right direction,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d153b0-0c28-4946-acbe-2e93329bca52">convict the founder of FTX of money laundering</a> and fraud sent shockwaves through the industry and should act as a warning shot that the upstart industry of crypto needs to play by the established rules of financial services, especially regarding Anti-Money Laundering directives, and KYC processes. Is play time over for crypto? If not, then the days of transacting in complete anonymity, without restrictions, and of celebrities promoting unregulated platforms, certainly are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the digital identity verification industry, and to an extent, the wider technological community is sure to admire the innovative steps taken by crypto to think outside the box in 2023, regulatory bodies are losing patience. And with 2024 likely to be the year that the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer of Funds Regulation</a>,&nbsp; MiCA, and the UK’s equivalent will be implemented, that patience is sure to be tested more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some argue that existing and upcoming crypto requirements are too harsh, prohibitively so, especially the UK’s financial promotions regime for crypto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of crypto firms currently perceive <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-promotions-uk-crypto/">financial promotions</a> as a massive burden and barrier of entry to the UK market. I hope the restrictions are softened somewhat in 2024, otherwise what we may find is a reduction in number of crypto firms in the UK market, which may, in turn push crypto users to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/">either grey market platforms or to offshore operators</a>, which would surely put a dent in the UK’s plans to become an international crypto hub,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, though, Jason remains optimistic about the state of crypto in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re on the cusp of new individuals and new flows entering the crypto space, which will be a very beneficial development and hopefully lead to a more positive crypto environment in 2024. Also, in March of next year, we will see the bitcoin halving, which is an exciting time for the crypto market, because the rate of supply of newly mined bitcoin is halved.”</p>



 



 

 



 



 Regulatory reflection: Betting on an online future. 



<p>Creating regulatory frameworks that not only protect the consumer, but also provide an attractive environment for operators is essentially the role of regulation, and regulatory bodies from around the world have certainly been busy this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the above crypto frameworks to the reassessment of existing gambling regulations in as disparate markets as the UK and Curaçao, 2023 has reminded every industry, especially gambling, of the importance, and opportunity of regularly updated regulation. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“One of the major surprises in the gambling industry for 2023 was that Brazil is now firmly on track to regulate both sports betting and online casinos, it’s the right thing to do because regulating the full portfolio of products will be critical to the success of the Brazilian market, including the ability of the authorities to clamp down on the grey market of operators that choose not to apply for a license,” said Martin Lycka, SVP American Regulatory Affairs and Responsible Gambling at Entain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Elsewhere in LatAm, Peru and Chile have been exploring regulation in 2023, and I do think that North American markets and regulators will also be keeping a close eye on proceedings too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our own gambling expert, Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk agreed with Martin regarding the sunny outlook for the LatAm online gambling market and expressed his pleasant surprise at the pace of gambling regulation in Brazil.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, Roger did admit that not all surprises were of the positive variety.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>One of the major surprises for me was learning of the increasing numbers of German players that were migrating to the grey market, due in part to the high tax rates subjected to regulated platforms, and other player restrictions.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Director of Global Gambling at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Such restrictions include 5 second spin durations, €1 stake limit, and €1000 max deposit per month across all licensed operators. In a bid to cut costs, operators who are compliant and licensed in Germany may decide to either pull out of the market, reduce their sponsorship budget (which will negatively impact grassroots sports), or focus on other markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a lose-lose, and not a great situation for the German economy, but I remain positive that German regulators will take the time to assess the situation and perhaps reevaluate its tax strategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roger also believes that while the UK market is doing the right thing by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">running a series of consultations</a> on revisions to its online gambling regulation, like proposed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">financial risk checks</a>, he did worry about the impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, much like the player exodus in Germany, I fear that 2024 may see UK players start to gravitate to the grey market unless upcoming regulatory changes are attractive to both the market and players.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can regulation ever have a negative impact upon a market’s growth? For Martin, it’s a delicate balancing act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It might be stating the obvious, but if regulations are introduced and it’s required to be implemented, then it’s for good reason in the long run and is money worth spent. But there is a fine line to tread between overly onerous regulation that may not be adding any value, and regulation that is efficient.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the gambling industry can teach us anything, it’s that the pace at which the digital world moves means the need for agile, and regularly updated frameworks and guidelines is paramount to ensure industry players operate in a fair and transparent environment.</p>

 Balancing act: The role of regulation. 



<p>Whatever the industry, there is perhaps no regulation or requirement as important in the digital identification space as KYC. This is why KYC, in some form or another, is mandatory in most industries, including financial services, crypto, gambling, among others. Despite its origins dating way back to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpis-F6rGCAxX8X0EAHTPAAoQQFnoECBAQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dowjones.com%2Fprofessional%2Frisk%2Fglossary%2Fknow-your-customer%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DKYC%2520regulations%2520originated%2520from%2520years%2Cand%25202008%2520global%2520financial%2520crisis.&amp;usg=AOvVaw2o_D_jE3NQ3Ig7i62H2uso&amp;opi=89978449">1970, with the passing of the Bank Secrecy Act</a>, KYC regulations and requirements are regularly updated, with most notable and significant revisions occurring following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 2008 global financial crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Changes to the KYC process can also occur whenever changes to associated regulations like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jinisha has been pleasantly surprised by some of this year’s developments regarding AML and is eagerly awaiting the domino effect of clearer and more consistent legislation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“After hundreds of iterations to AML regimes and endless conversations on beneficial ownership registries, it seems that the global financial crime sector is ready to mobilize support for effective ‘transparency’. As per <a href="https://transparencycanada.ca/news/billc42updatesnovember2-2023">Transparency International</a>, 132 countries have made commitments to beneficial ownership registries. Many G7 and G20 countries have adopted the ‘Open Ownership’s Beneficial Ownership Data Standard’ to ensure their national registries are interoperable with the rest of the world’s. These standards will eventually help us uncover connections between opaque shell corporations, sanctions evaders, and PEPs across the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the concept of AML and KYC has remained the same over the years, the importance and how they are used has changed dramatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Banks are beginning to understand that KYC checks can be seamlessly integrated into the client onboarding process, eliminating the need for customers to feel burdened by them,” said Vivek Mishra, Operations Manager at WNS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital identification solutions are also increasingly being used to enable customers to authenticate their identity online without submitting any physical proof. The focus on the customer experience is a good thing, since it indicates that banks are beginning to prioritize their clients at last. Additionally, it implies that KYC checks are getting more successful and efficient, which is excellent news for banks and their clients,” said Vivek.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increasingly multi-purpose use of KYC, the current and second iteration of eIDAS, and national AML laws are just three regulations and requirements that have greatly improved safeguards in digital transactions for regulated market sectors in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rayissa Armata, Director of Global&nbsp;Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow, said that although many positive steps were taken this year, she stressed the importance of careful route-planning and ongoing collaboration with relevant stakeholders to ensure that the European Union gets important regulation like eIDAS 2.0 right.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>There is still more that needs to be done and the challenge is to support an aligned framework that remains reliable, innovative and secure. IDnow fully supports the call for building a more harmonized framework that addresses interoperability, innovation, and most importantly – security.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director of Global&nbsp;Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Rayissa added that future frameworks should therefore factor in the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Identification that can be reused across borders and sectors (public and private)<br>  Establishing standards for developments in technology with appropriate levels of security<br>  Continued collaboration between the public and private sectors&nbsp;  



<p>For Viky Manaila, President of Cloud Signature Consortium, the next few years will prove crucial for the global digital identity landscape.</p>



<p>“eIDAS 2.0 regulation and its evolution during the trilogue surprised everybody in the identity ecosystem, with positive and less positive amendments. As it comes close to the final destination, the next period will be critical for defining the implementing acts, the standards in support of the new services and certification scheme with cross-border interoperability in mind.”</p>

 2023: The year when digital identity became must-have. 



<p>This year’s growth in popularity of identity verification solutions can partly be attributed to the adoption of additional new use cases, for example in facilitating remote recruitment. In fact, 2023 could be categorized as the year that organizations began to unlock, or at least peek through the peephole into the future of how digital identity verification could potentially be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some EU states have made significant developments in their own digital identity systems, such as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/ukraines-digital-identity-app-growing-and-becoming-an-inspiration-for-other-countries">Ukraine’s digital identity app, Diia,</a> which is used for storing biometric passports, tax IDs and driver licenses, to access private and public services, others are taking a much more considered approach to modernizing their identity landscape. For example, the UK has <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">introduced the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> – a set of rules and standards for identity verification service providers to follow in order to offer certain use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although each country will naturally have its own idea of how it wants its citizens to use their digital identities, the future success of digital identity and the digital wallet will invariably be linked to its interoperability, across sectors (public and private), and across regions. For that to happen, however, a standard and generally agreed-upon course forward needs to be set, which of course requires intensive discussions from all interested parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) published a technical report analysing selective disclosure and zero knowledge proofs for the EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sebastian Elfors, Senior Architect at IDnow, who co-authored the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/119476/01.01.01_60/tr_119476v010101p.pdf">ETSI paper</a>, said: “The report has received tremendous interest from the industry, with constructive feedback from the self-sovereign identity community and experts in W3C, GSMA, and several other standardization organizations. The EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) and ETSI and CEN remain on standby to provide the relevant standards and certification schemes for the EUDI Wallet and Qualified Trust Service Providers under eIDAS 2.0.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remaining cautiously optimistic on the future of digital identity, Viky said: “The new commercial models for services around identity proofing, and verifiable credentials on top of the Wallets have the potential to unleash the missing part of digital transformation. If these services are customer-centric designed, they will take off. Otherwise, they will become just another type of digital platform asking for all sorts of personal information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although 2023 has seen the ongoing development of pivotal regulations like eIDAS 2.0, alongside the introduction of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/world-coin-crypto-iris/">new ways of identifying customers, such as iris scans</a>, the pace of development in the digital identity space hasn’t suited everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m surprised by how many times I still have to enter passwords given that Apple, Google and Microsoft are all implementing the passkeys standard. Only yesterday it took me three guesses to remember my telco password and I had to do a password reset on one of my American bank accounts. Please make it stop!</p>David Birch, global advisor and thought leader in financial services.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>However, David did admit that the upcoming ISO mobile driving licence, which both Google and Apple have added to their wallets is sure to accelerate adoption and put Wallets fairly and squarely in the public discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumers will rapidly become comfortable with this mode of presenting standardized credentials in both face to face and remote environments,” added David.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although it’s difficult to predict the future of digital identity verification with any kind of certainty, it is highly likely that it will continue to be used for ever-increasing and multi-purpose use cases, and that any changes that do occur will be precipitated by a combination of technological advancement, regulatory input, fraud trends, and, of course, consumer preference.</p>



 Risks vs rewards: AI and the modern workplace.&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a reason why <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67271252">Collins Dictionary named AI</a> the word of the year in 2023. Artificial intelligence was on the lips of every organization (and unfortunately every fraudster) this year, and with good reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The potential of generative AI, in particular, has many organizations salivating over their budget sheets due to AI’s ability to automate, augment and accelerate working processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a safe bet, therefore, that industries will continue to experiment with AI-powered processes in 2024. In fact, many industries are already reaping the benefits of AI to increase automation, reduce costs and offer more accurate and streamlined identity verification methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vivek certainly recognizes the value in doing so: “I anticipate that as banks and other financial institutions strive to increase their efficiency and security in 2024, AI-powered KYC and banking solutions will become even more widely adopted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s important to not delegate all tasks to AI. Yes, AI and technology in general, can be used as a competitive advantage, but success in 2024 and beyond will almost certainly come from the clever combination of humans and technology, and recognizing the relative merits of both. In identity verification, this may mean AI is reserved for simpler data-scouring tasks, freeing up resources and enabling staff to concentrate on more difficult jobs, like performing manual identity verification checks on high assurance use cases, or delivering more personalized, superior customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, AI has also been weaponized by fraudsters. While in the past, cybercriminals needed a certain base level of technical skills to produce fake documents or websites, AI-augmented fraudsters can utilize generative AI to create authentic-looking documents, videos, images and audio. A trend that will continue in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I expect to see an increase in the use of AI for fraudulent purposes, which makes the innovative use of AI to combat it, and fingerprint scanning and biometric analysis all the more important, alongside human input,” added Lovro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is your organization prepared for the future?</p>



 Inclusivity and accessibility: Making the connected world a safer, fairer place. 



<p>As our digital identities become more established and entrenched in regulations and legal frameworks, it’s important to remember the importance of collaboration on the common goal of making a safer, more secure online world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, IDnow made significant strides toward making the connected world a safer place, becoming the only European identity verification provider to be awarded two certifications for the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/pvid-certification-idcheck-io-and-videoident/">French remote identity verification standard known as PVID</a> (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) at ‘substantial’ level. We also became certified by the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/diatf-certified-framework-identity-verirification-provider/">UK’s Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework.</a> </p>



<p>IDnow prides itself as being at the very forefront of innovation in identity verification, and believes that believes that with a layered, holistic approach to identity, businesses can elevate trust and empower experience across the customer journey – no matter the region, industry, or required regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Research and Developments teams have been hard at work throughout 2023; contributing on projects as far ranging as a toolkit to identify and mitigate biases in AI algorithms to the verification of optical variable device (holograms). Our Product team has also been working tirelessly to update, improve and optimize our digital identity verification services, making them the most complete IDV solutions on the market. Such updates include IDnow’s&nbsp;360 Signals, which detects attempts of repeat fraud, by collecting risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources to detect single and serial fraud attempts in real time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have some exciting upcoming developments, including paper photocopy detection, automatic bank account ownership verification and plans to implement WCAG Level AA to ensure our services can be used by people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inclusiveness and accessibility will continue to be an important topic in 2024 and beyond, and <a href="https://www.bundesfachstelle-barrierefreiheit.de/DE/Fachwissen/Produkte-und-Dienstleistungen/Barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz/barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz_node.html">organizations will soon be legally required</a> to provide a certain level of accessabilty in their solutions or face legal reprecusssions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many factors that lead to inequality in identity verification. Age, disability, neurodiversity, lack of docs for proof or identity or lack of photo are all problems that identity verification providers must improve to provide access to digital services for all. Bridging these gaps requires inclusive design, technological adaptations, and policies addressing diverse accessibility needs, to ensure equitable digital service access for all. IDnow’s video verification enables organizations to improve inclusivity, accessibility, safety, and convenience for all their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have valued and trusted relationships with various international police and counter fraud organizations, including INTERPOL, and the French Scientific Police (the forensics arm of the police) with whom we exchange knowledge and share best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is these relationships and these industry insights that allow us to move quickly and keep abreast of industry trends and developments to offer a comprehensive&nbsp;multi-jurisdictionally compliant identity verification solution. For example, in preparation for the opening of the Brazilian online gambling market, we integrated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/automated-cpf-database-checks-brazilian-gambling/">CPF database checks</a>. Our market-leading identity verification services enable our clients from a variety of sectors to benefit from our proprietary fraud prevention technology and regulatory expertise to provide peace of mind that wherever they operate, and in whatever industry, they can do so compliantly.</p>



 



 

 



 



 The sky is the limit? 



<p>Another major milestone for IDnow in 2023 included the launch of ShopIdent in gas stations throughout Germany. The on-site identification solution enables customers to activate pre-paid SIM cards, open bank accounts, or verify driver’s licenses directly from their local gas station.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, perhaps the most exciting project that we were involved with in 2023 was assisting the International Air Transport Association (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/iata-first-integrated-journey-digital-identity/">IATA) in creating the first ever integrated digital identity travel experience</a>, streamlining the process from flight shopping to arrival. In the Proof-of-Concept trial, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a> was used to store and present digital travel credentials, such as boarding passes and digital visas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We look forward to 2024 with optimism and excitement for what the future holds. While the future of digital identity verification may be uncertain, one thing’s for sure, the sky is no longer the limit.</p>

<p>I am very excited to announce that 1Kosmos is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/integrating-amazon-cognito-with-1kosmos-blockid-for-enhanced-security-and-user-experience/">official AWS Cognito Passwordless MFA partner.</a></p>
<p>Amazon Cognito places the utmost importance on online account security. To bolster the protection of account holders, starting in 2024, Amazon Cognito made it a goal to expand its multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements, ultimately partnering with 1Kosmos to help the Amazon Cognito team reach its customer security initiatives.</p>
 A Better MFA 
<p>It’s no secret that MFA significantly augments the security of web and mobile applications by necessitating additional identification methods beyond just a password. By implementing various forms of MFA organizations can effectively mitigate the risks associated with user account takeovers, phishing attacks, and password breaches.</p>
<p>To take things a step further, users can elevate their account security through biometric authentication features like TouchID (fingerprint), FaceID and LiveID (a 1Kosmos architectural advantage). Additionally, it offers one-time passwords (OTP) through SMS and email, time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) via a linked mobile authenticator, and push notifications. This flexibility empowers Amazon customers to select the MFA methods that best align with the requirements of their application ecosystem.</p>
 User Experience is Important 
<p>The team at Amazon Cognito places delivering a seamless user experience high on its list of requirements, and that is why partnering with 1Kosmos was a perfect fit. The 1Kosmos MFA capabilities provide a diverse array of authentication choices to accommodate a broad spectrum of users and devices, all with a similar user experience. The 1Kosmos BlockID and Amazon Cognito partnership strikes the right balance between security and usability when developing customer-facing applications.</p>
 Easy Access to Passwordless 
<p>1Kosmos is a trusted AWS Partner and AWS Marketplace Seller offering BlockID and passwordless MFA solutions to elevate online account security. The platform boasts FIDO2 and NIST 800-63-3 certifications, further affirming its reliability. Amazon Cognito customers can easily deploy and directly acquire BlockID through the AWS Marketplace, enabling the implementation of a phishing-resistant passwordless MFA solution.</p>
 Identity Verification 
<p>An optional capability of the 1Kosmos platform, 1Kosmos BlockID provides organizations an automated and cryptographically secure way to verify a virtually unlimited array of identity details including government issued ID, education qualifications, healthcare data, financial account details, and other third-party machine-readable personal information while respecting an individual’s privacy. This provides progressively higher levels of identity assurance for authentication and digitally transforms a broad range of business processes such as worker or contractor onboarding, new customer account origination, and provisioning of digital services.</p>
 Combination of Verification and Authentication 
<p>This capability of the BlockID cloud service has been meticulously crafted to combat identity impersonation, thwart account takeovers, and prevent fraudulent activities, all while offering a user-friendly and frictionless login experience.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID leverages identity-based verification to transparently authenticate users, effectively shielding against account compromises and fraudulent activities. The result of implementing BlockID identity verification with the integration of Amazon Cognito enables organizations to have a higher level of assurance for the users they have under management.</p>
 Privacy by Design 
<p>The 1Kosmos decentralized private blockchain technology empowers individuals with exclusive access and full control over their personally identifiable information, ensuring a privacy-centric design. This approach allows end users to review and authorize or decline the sharing of their data with online services they want to utilize. All personally identifiable information (PII) undergoes end-to-end encryption, guaranteeing that it remains shielded from exposure. Users can directly grant or deny sharing requests to the applications they connect with, without any involvement of third-party intermediaries, such as external public key servers or messaging hosts, ensuring that their data, keys, and plain text messages remain inaccessible to these entities.</p>
 More About 1Kosmos 
<p>Our platform encrypts and securely stores biometrics and ID data within a private, permissioned blockchain, safeguarding user data against potential breaches. BlockID is not only certified to NIST Identity Assurance Level 2 but also compliant with Level 3, showcasing a steadfast commitment to upholding and advancing identity assurance and regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>Effective collaboration is essential for organizations to innovate, make decisions, and drive progress. Over the past few decades, digital technologies have dramatically expanded how we are able to collaborate remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>The introduction of tools like email, instant messaging, wikis, and video conferencing enabled new ways for distributed teams to communicate and work together.</p><p>More recently, all-in-one SaaS collaboration suites from vendors like Slack, Microsoft, and Google have been widely adopted by companies looking to centralize their key business applications.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as remote and hybrid work environments become more prevalent, teams are finding that centralized legacy models for digital collaboration have limitations. This is driving the exploration of distributed and decentralized frameworks that offer greater <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/walkaway-or-why-forking-matters/">control, transparency, and flexibility</a>.</p> The Rise of Centralized Collaboration Suites <p>In the early 2000s, the rise of software as a service (SaaS) paved the way for full-fledged collaboration suites delivered through the cloud. Vendors like Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce began providing bundled productivity and communication applications all under one platform.</p><p>According to Ian Tien, CEO of Mattermost, “When I started, I was at Microsoft, right? And collaboration was easy. It was all through the intranet on a centralized server.”&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last decade, this market has continued rapidly expanding. Tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Workspace have become essential platforms that consolidate messaging, video meetings, file sharing, knowledge management, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>While early digital tools enabled discrete modes of teamwork, these centralized suites aim to be comprehensive one-stop shops.&nbsp;</p><p>In the interview, Tien notes that customers are looking to “integrate [tools] with all your different infrastructure, your compliance, and your tools.” For many organizations, adopting an integrated SaaS platform became the obvious path forward as remote and hybrid work began accelerating.</p><p>However, concerns and limitations around relying solely on centralized providers have started to emerge.</p> The Emergence of Distributed Collaboration <p>While centralized systems have become popular, some organizations are exploring alternative distributed frameworks for collaboration. According to Ian Tien, CEO of Mattermost, "The biggest one is, and I'm sure you see it all over the place is this: How do I take these new sorts of LLM AI models and use them to accelerate my work?"&nbsp;</p><p>Tien also states that "the core of it is that when you take the information, let's say, and just like your workplace communications, right, it's not that valuable."&nbsp;</p><p>However, he notes that aggregated data from collaboration tools can provide insights companies may want to keep private. Holochain and other distributed projects aim to give users more <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/what-is-digital-identity/">autonomy and control</a> over their information.</p><p>LLMs combined with generative AI harness enormous amounts of data. While the systems can’t understand data like a human can, they can still create generalizations based on the extremely large datasets.&nbsp;</p><p>If Slack were to implement an LLM model with generative AI, it’s unclear whether your data would be used in conjunction with other company’s data.&nbsp;</p><p>With distributed models, validation happens at the app level between users rather than via centralized consensus. This enables customized security policies tailored to specific collaboration use cases.</p><p>As remote and hybrid work expand, teams want the flexibility to collaborate effectively while maintaining autonomy over their systems and data. Distributed models provide an alternative approach with transparent peer-to-peer connections.</p> What the Future Holds <p>While centralized suites solved many early collaboration challenges, new needs are emerging around flexibility, transparency, and control. Ian Tien summarizes this well:</p><blockquote>"The future of digital collaboration will require increased transparency around data provenance and usage. How can we enable explainability around why systems make certain determinations? What audit trails exist to show the origins and lineage of data used for collaboration?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>“Users want more clarity not just on what algorithms decide but the underlying data and logic driving those decisions. As collaboration platforms leverage more AI and machine learning, robustly documenting data provenance will only grow in importance. Companies want to ensure they can control and account for how data gets managed in collaborative processes."</blockquote><p>Distributed collaboration frameworks like Holochain offer an alternative paradigm with direct peer-to-peer connections instead of intermediary servers. This agent-centric approach gives users autonomy while still enabling effective teamwork across organizations.</p><p>There are still challenges to making distributed collaboration <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/becoming-viable-seeds-to-saplings/">seamless and scalable</a> for the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>But with the right blend of usability, security, and customizable control, these emergent technologies could empower teams with a new generation of tools for digital teamwork. The ideal future likely incorporates both centralized and decentralized elements across hybrid technology stacks.</p>

				  Indicio Proven™&nbsp; now provides a privacy-preserving way to record, share, and verify educational achievements.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, Dec 5, 2023, <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading world’s leading provider of digital trust solutions, today announced the addition of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-badges/">Open Badges</a> 3.0 digital credential format to Indicio Proven™, Indicio’s flagship product for creating and communicating verifiable data.</p>
<p>Open Badges is a powerful digital format for recording educational achievements, skills, and other accomplishments. Increasingly popular as a standard, Open Badges are shared on social media and stored and managed on third-party platforms.</p>
<p>The addition of Open Badges into Indicio Proven, the leading software for enterprise adoption of verifiable credentials, makes it possible for the badge to be directly held and controlled by the person who earned the achievement in a wallet on their mobile device instead of being forced to access their records through a third-party provider or platform.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven makes holding, sharing, and verifying an Open Badges credential truly portable. Now, anyone using the same open-source issuing software can create an Open Badges credential, anyone with the app can receive and share an Open Badges credential, and anyone with the verification software can verify the source and the integrity of the data in the Open Badges credential.</p>
<p>By removing the need for a centralized Open Badges Platform, users have control over their privacy, they can consent to share Open Badge data in secure, privacy-preserving ways, and they — and not the platform — fully own their Open Badges credentials. Indicio will be the first to use the new Open Badge verifiable credentials, issuing them&nbsp; to those who complete training and workshops in the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-academy/">Indicio Academy</a> training and workshops.</p>
<p>“Combining the Open Badges format with a verifiable credential releases its full power,” said Heather Dahl, CEO and co-founder of Indicio. “Similar to the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">Digital Travel Credential we developed on ICAO standards</a>, we’re creating simple ways for our customers to build seamless processes with verifiable data. The Open Badges format is a great way to share and verify detailed academic records and information about skill sets. But now we’ve freed Open Badges to be even greater — to take advantage of interoperable, open-source technology, to be used in faster, more private, and more secure ways, and, of course, to be a record of achievement that can be owned and verified forever.”</p>
<p>Technical details</p>
<p>Indicio’s unique approach combines open-source verifiable credentials based on the W3C Verifiable Credential Data and 1EdTech Open Badges 3.0 (OBv3) standards with open source technologies from Hyperledger Foundation. This enables people to hold the records of their educational achievements in a digital wallet under their own control in perpetuity. These JSON-LD based credentials can be used to easily share verifiable information on social media, when applying to a job online, or with any verifier using open source verifiable credential technology to read the badge.</p>
<p>Open Badges can be issued using Indicio Proven for a wide range of participatory, educational, and learning scenarios and can be verified by ACA-Py and AFJ based agents. Badge types include:</p>

<p>As another year draws to a close, it’s time to start thinking about what trends and challenges may face us in 2024. Next year promises to be a pivotal moment in the evolution of identity management and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). As we grapple with the challenges posed by sophisticated phishing attacks, deepfakes, and the ever-expanding influence of AI, the need for innovative solutions has never been more critical. This blog post explores the emerging trends that will shape the identity landscape, from identity inclusion and access movements to the intersection of AI and security.</p>
<p>Inclusion and Access: Bridging the Digital Divide</p>
<p>The fusion of our physical and digital lives requires a fundamental shift in how we approach identity. As we move toward a future where digital identity underpins social and economic mobility, the importance of inclusivity cannot be overstated. In 2024, there will be a heightened focus on ensuring secure and convenient identity verification, both online and in-person.</p>
<p>Regulatory Surge in the Cyber Risk Landscape</p>
<p>With the Biden administration’s landmark Executive Order setting new standards for AI safety and security, 2024 is poised to see a regulatory surge. Chief information security officers (CISOs) will need to prepare for continued AI regulation, new post-quantum guidance, and anticipated legislation around Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines. As guidance from governments increases, businesses must adapt their cybersecurity strategies to navigate a patchwork of regulations and ensure the security of customer data.</p>
<p>AI-Powered Phishing and the Banking Dilemma</p>
<p>The age-old threat of phishing takes on a new dimension in 2024 as AI-enabled phishing becomes more sophisticated and widespread. The financial industry faces a dual challenge with AI. While AI presents opportunities to enhance customer experience and reduce costs, it also intensifies the arms race with hackers. The scalability and effectiveness of AI-driven attacks means that financial institutions must continuously innovate their security and risk management strategies to ensure continued security to their most important assets: PII data and monetary instruments.</p>
<p>Post-Quantum Cryptography: A Looming Challenge</p>
<p>While post-quantum cryptography may not be a top priority for many CISOs today, its existential threat cannot be ignored. In 2024, businesses, especially in the banking sector, must upgrade their cryptography to post-quantum standards. The long data retention mandates in banking make it imperative to prepare for “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” quantum attacks (in which encrypted data that is stolen now could then be accessed once a suitably powerful quantum computer is available), even if quantum computers are not yet a reality. Failure to do so could have repercussions for decades to come.</p>
<p>Open Banking and the Cybersecurity Wild West</p>
<p>Open banking regulation is set to accelerate in the U.S., posing challenges and opportunities for financial institutions. While consumers seek convenience, banks must navigate the potential threat to direct customer relationships. The cybersecurity landscape will undergo growing pains as open APIs introduce new access points and players. Collaboration with regulators and fintechs, combined with advancements in identity verification, is crucial to ensuring the privacy and transparency of financial ecosystems.</p>
<p>Simplifying Tech Complexity for Enhanced Security</p>
<p>Banks face a growing challenge in managing the complexity of their tech stacks, particularly in the realm of identity verification. Fragmentation increases the risk of attacks, making it essential for institutions to consolidate vendors and streamline their ecosystems. Vendor consolidation not only adds an extra layer of protection against bad actors but also facilitates a more seamless experience for consumers.</p>
<p>Biometrics: Striking the Balance Between Security and Convenience</p>
<p>Advancements in biometrics offer a transformative solution to balancing security and convenience in the digital realm. Banks will increasingly use biometric technology, smartphones, and document recognition to enhance security measures. By adopting innovative solutions, institutions can create a system that deters fraud without frustrating users, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>As we embark on the journey through 2024, the intersection of identity, AI, and cybersecurity will define the technological landscape. From changes in how we view identity to the regulatory surge in AI and the ongoing challenges of phishing and post-quantum cryptography, businesses and individuals alike must stay vigilant and adapt to these transformative trends. It’s a year of innovation, adaptation, and collaboration as we navigate the complexities of the digital age.</p>

 Introducing Multi-Party Approval for On-chain Agreements 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in November of 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Welcome to the November edition of the Product Newsletter, where we highlight the product team’s latest upgrades each month.</p>
<p>This month we are discussing the implementation of the multi-party approval feature, an enhancement of the already existing Conditional Transfer Feature.</p>
 We Upgraded The Conditional Transfer Feature 
<p>In our ongoing efforts to streamline and secure the movement of tokenized securities, we recognized a crucial need for our clients:&nbsp;a system that requires approvals from multiple parties before a transfer can proceed.</p>
<p>Our previous&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/security-tokens-conditional-transfer/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8COCRyIXJFk84a0AvtQsPi2B4w9GRwb6NUlUQ5AlZWZTu4ZrU5yaThZsOrBbLwo_YWYfAZ">conditional transfer feature</a>&nbsp;only allows issuers or agents to have one&nbsp;single-party approval. By adding the&nbsp;multi-party approval&nbsp;feature we create a flexible transfer approval process, catering to the diverse needs of our clients.</p>
 The Multi-Party Approval Transfer 
<p>Multi-party approval transfer elevates the transfer validation process by requiring multiple approvals.&nbsp;Issuers gain the flexibility to&nbsp;create custom approval workflows, tailoring the process to fit their specific transactional needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, as&nbsp;multi-party approvals are set up at the smart contract level, approvers have the freedom to choose their preferred wallet solution in order to approve or disapprove transactions, be it multisig wallets, self-hosted wallets, or hard drive wallets.</p>
<p>It’s designed to provide a&nbsp;unified, on-chain agreement signing process, which further streamlines operations, ensuring transparent and immutable recording of approvals on the blockchain. This feature aims to not only&nbsp;streamline the complex token transfer process&nbsp;but also&nbsp;enhance counterparty interactions&nbsp;in asset management.</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 How it Works: 
 
 Setting Up:&nbsp;Issuers, their agent, or equivalent set the rules for each multi-party approval transfer, including who needs to approve it and in any specified order.<br>
Types of approvers:<p></p>
 
 
 
 Recipient of the transfer 
 Custodians of the seller and the buyer 
 Any other approver the issuer or compliance agent wants to appoint 
 
 
 
 
 Initiating Transfer:&nbsp;When an investor requests a transfer, it’s held in a ‘pending’ state, awaiting approvals. 
 Multi-party Review:&nbsp;Issuers and appointed parties review and&nbsp;approve or disapprove&nbsp;the request. 
 Completion:&nbsp;Once all approvals are in place, the transfer is automatically executed, ensuring both security and efficiency. 
 
<p>Please contact us if you are interested in learning more or trying out this feature.</p>

   Background&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many customers face challenges in managing their Conditional Access (CA) policies. Over time, they accumulate more and more policies that are created ad-hoc to solve specific business scenarios, resulting in a loss of overview and increased troubleshooting efforts. Microsoft has provided <a href="https://aka.ms/ca-zt">guidance</a> on how to structure your Conditional Access policies in a way that follows the Zero Trust principles, using a persona-based approach.&nbsp;The guidance includes a set of Conditional Access policies that can serve as a starting point. These CA policies can be automated from a CI/CD pipeline using various tools. One such tool is Microsoft365DSC, an open-source tool developed by members of the Microsoft Graph Product Group, who are still actively involved in its maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft365DSC can automate the configuration of various Microsoft 365 workloads, including Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access policies. The diagram below illustrates the role of Microsoft365DSC as a tool for automating Microsoft 365, complementing the automation of Azure that’s typically achieved using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and/or Bicep templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has already been documented how you can use Microsoft365DSC to automate and maintain your Conditional Access policies. Two such sources are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/get-started/integrating-with-azure-devops/">Integrating with Azure DevOps</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/ConditionalAccessGovernanceAndPrinciplesforZeroTrust%20October%202023.pdf">Github Conditional Access for Zero Trust Resources</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These solutions work, but they need to either use a self-hosted agent with a managed identity in Azure DevOps or use a shared secret, and neither of the two solutions are optimal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim at being able to do the automation from Azure DevOps using a Microsoft-managed agent for the CI/CD pipeline and no shared secrets. The introduction of Workload Identity Federation with Azure DevOps can help us do exactly that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting Started&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution we’re aiming at is depicted in the figure below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea is to have our CI/CD pipeline files hosted in the Azure DevOps repository and make values in an Azure Key Vault available in the pipeline based on configuring Workload Identity Federation between the Azure DevOps project and Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps to do this are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Configure a service connection the Azure DevOps project settings as shown below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recommended choice can be selected; however, it would automatically create a service principal in Entra ID with permission to the whole Azure subscription that you specify in the settings. To adhere to the principle of least privileged, we suggest using the manual configuration, which means that you manually create the service principal and only assign it permission to the Key Vault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create an Entra ID App Registration using Federated credentials as shown below:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Add application permissions to the service principal for it to be able to create and update Conditional Access policies. Permissions may include: Policy.Read.All, Policy. ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess, Application,Read.All.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Create a Key Vault in a distinct resource group in an Azure subscription. This subscription should be specifically designed to manage sensitive identity-related workloads. Ideally, it should be located under the “Platform” management group within the “Identity” subscription, provided are adhering to the Enterprise Scale landing zone architecture as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/">documented here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Create two certificates in the Key Vault, one certificate that will be used to sign Microsoft365 configurations and one that will be used to authenticate Microsoft365DSC tools to Entra ID. See below.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. In the Key Vault access control, assign M365DSCWorkloadIdentity the “Key Vault Secret User” role for it to be able to read secrets that you create.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you should have the basic prerequisites in place for you to create or change your CI/CD pipeline to take advantage of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline definition 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest using a multi-stage pipeline defined in an YML file in your repo, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/caautomationpipeline.yml">specified in this example YML file</a>. When utilizing Microsoft365DSC, the Conditional Access policies that we aim to configure or enforce within our Entra ID tenant should be clearly defined in our repository. Also, as a prerequisite, you need to configure the groups that you refer to in the Conditional Access policies definition either manually in the portal or using automation described in the referenced GitHub resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This information should be contained within a file, which could potentially be named ‘ConfigureCAPolicy.ps1’. The content for this file can be generated through various methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Create your Conditional Access policies in the Entra ID portal and use export-m365DSCConfiguration as documented here: <a href="https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/get-started/snapshot-of-existing-tenant/">Taking a Snapshot of Existing Tenant - Microsoft365DSC - Your Cloud Configuration</a>.&nbsp; 
 Create it manually using any editor.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/ConfigureCApolicy.ps1">Here’s a sample of a Conditional Access policy</a>. You will notice that the file must define that we want to authenticate using the certificate. You can get a full list of the Conditional Access policies in Microsoft365DSC format based on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/tree/main/ConditionalAccessSamplePolicies/Microsoft365DSCCAPolicies">persona-based approach configured for Zero Trust here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Build Stage 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pipeline for building the solution is divided into two scripts. First, we import the certificates from the Key Vault into the Windows based CI/CD pipeline agent and compile a Microsoft365DSC configuration file into a MOF file that is to be pushed to our Entra ID tenant in the deploy stage. The reason for having this is two scripts is just for ease of debugging. You may choose to combine them into <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/prep.ps1">one script as shown here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/build.ps1">second script here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Deploy stage&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now have our artifacts stored in Azure DevOps and would like to deploy them to our Entra ID tenant. This is done in the deploy stage where the deploy.ps1 is called. The content if <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/deploy.ps1">deploy.ps1 is located here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Final comments&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information provided, you should now have a clear understanding of how to automate your Conditional Access policies within Entra ID and manage changes using Azure DevOps, all without the need to store shared secrets within Azure DevOps. We strongly recommend that you experiment with this process and utilize the resources mentioned in the article for more detailed information about the configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we primarily focus on implementing this process through Azure DevOps, it's important to note that GitHub Actions also supports Workload Identity Federation. This provides an alternative solution if you prefer GitHub over Azure DevOps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today’s interconnected digital landscape, where applications seamlessly integrate to enhance productivity, is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, information is more accessible than ever, requiring switching between apps and services, ostensibly increasing productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the importance of robust identity management cannot be overstated, and if you’re not careful you can lose track of who, what, and where you’ve authorized permissions — and with companies under 2,000 employees <a href="https://youtu.be/s149kAiuCns?t=44">averaging more than 73 SaaS app integrations in 2020</a>, it’s clearly a growing problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s crucial to recognize the potential risks associated with <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth (Open Authorization)</a> grants and how they impact your organization’s data security. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the intricacies of OAuth and shed light on the vulnerabilities that may lurk beneath the surface.</p>
 Broad OAuth access can mean identity sprawl 
<p>Many applications today build on top of each other, using the data from one to power the other. A common example is Google. Google is not one thing; it’s Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc. And for each of these services, Google has a fine-grained API that engineers can use (usually read-only or read-write) to integrate with their products. OAuth is the standard authorization technology across services and is part of what makes an “interconnected” internet experience possible. For example, YeshID Onboard leverages OAuth APIs from Google, Slack, Zoom, and other platforms <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">to streamline identity management</a> for your organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the devil is in the details when it comes to OAuth scopes, which are the permissions granted to applications. An alarming aspect is the breadth of these scopes. Some vendors offer OAuth APIs in an all-or-nothing approach, which hampers the ability to employ least-privilege access principles. This contrasts with providers like Google Workspace, known for their granular scopes, allowing for more specific permissions like manipulating mailbox settings, accessing sensitive files, and even user impersonation. However, granularity does not inherently mean restraint; vendors may still request more permissions than necessary, increasing potential risks.</p>
<p>Complicating matters, the risk of data exposure and account takeover is substantial if an OAuth-integrated application is compromised. This situation is akin to any custodian acting on our behalf; the extent of the compromise is proportional to the level of trust and access we’ve granted. So understanding the granularity and necessity of OAuth scopes is crucial in safeguarding your organization’s sensitive information. It’s imperative to assess not just what permissions are possible, but also what permissions are truly necessary for the task at hand</p>
 OAuth can introduce unintentional vulnerabilities 
<p>One of the major risks lies in users granting OAuth access without fully comprehending the implications, which can lead to unintended vulnerabilities. Consider the scenario of a vulnerability in a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism</a> that allowed unauthorized access using Google credentials. Users, in their quest for convenience, might inadvertently expose sensitive company data by granting access without due diligence.</p>
<p>The accidental use of work credentials in personal applications further exacerbates the problem. This unintentional mingling of professional and personal spheres can result in a breach of company data, underscoring the need for user education on OAuth access and permissions. Here’s an example of what you might wind up with.</p>
 Navigating OAuth security concerns 
<p>Enhancing the security of your accounts can be achieved by clearly understanding the difference between “session length” and “grant validity period.” In OAuth, permissions granted to applications often allow extended, but not indefinite, access to company data, raising potential security concerns. This issue becomes particularly critical when applications with extensive permissions retain this access for prolonged periods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mitigate risks like unauthorized access, data exposure, and account takeover, it’s essential for leaders to proactively manage and monitor these OAuth grants. Regular reviews and audits of the grant validity periods are key practices in ensuring these permissions are necessary and relevant, and in maintaining the overall security and integrity of your organization’s data. <br>
<br>
Here’s a look at the OAuth request lifecycle to illustrate the issue:</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way to do this is by <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgmail-high-risk-oauth-scopes%2Cdrive-high-risk-oauth-scopes">using your Google Workspace console</a> and navigating the following path: Security &gt; Access and Data &gt; API Controls &gt; Manage third party app access &gt; View list. There, you can view apps with access, revoke access if needed, and just get a general view of what’s going on in your app environment. Check out the video below, where I walk you through it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, you can also easily track this information with YeshID. Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of app licenses, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions across different applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.</p>
<p>As leaders in the SMB space, it’s imperative to understand the intricacies of OAuth and its potential risks. By educating users, understanding OAuth scopes, and implementing security measures, SMBs can fortify their identity management practices, ensuring a robust defense against the evolving landscape of digital threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID is your partner in this effort, showcasing the identity sprawl within your organization and aiding in the vigilant management of OAuth access.

				 <p>In the inaugural episode of the <a href="https://untrustables.io/">(un)Trustables Podcast</a>, we delve into the fascinating landscape of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity (NDI) project. This groundbreaking initiative introduces Bhutan’s “edge wallet,” a highly secure mobile wallet designed to safeguard what Bhutan refers to as ‘foundational digital identity,’ the first verified credential issued to citizens.<br><a href="https://untrustables.simplecast.com/episodes/ep001-bhutan-has-launched-a-national-digital-identity-program">Listen to the full episode</a></p>
 The Birth of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity 
<p>Our conversation with Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments, reveals the genesis of Bhutan’s NDI project. This audacious endeavour embodies the vision of Bhutan’s monarchy, aligning perfectly with the principles outlined in the SSI book by Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed. The aim is clear: to create a citizen-centric digital identity system that empowers individuals and streamlines their interactions with the government and private sector.</p>
 Building Blocks of a Bhutanese Digital Identity 
<p>Bhutan’s digital identity framework is a marvel of innovation. It includes unique identifiers, permanent and current addresses, and other critical data points that form the bedrock of citizens’ digital identities. Beyond foundational identity, the NDI opens the door to many use cases, spanning government services and commercial applications.</p>
 Empowering Bhutanese Citizens with Digital Convenience 
<p>The NDI project isn’t just about innovation; it’s about transforming the lives of Bhutanese citizens. It eliminates time-consuming journeys to government offices, saving citizens valuable time and resources. Even in remote areas, the NDI project enhances accessibility, simplifying processes with mobile solutions.</p>
 Drummond Reed’s Perspective on Bhutan’s SSI Journey 
<p>Renowned digital identity expert Drummond Reed shares his initial astonishment at the audacity of Bhutan’s plan to implement a self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution at the national level. He reflects on Bhutan’s forward-thinking approach and alignment with the SSI book’s principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did research and then we read the SSI book which Drummond and Alex wrote, and we just felt so strongly that it’s exactly the vision of His Majesty, our King. We said, why don’t we just build the book? That was kind of our starting place. Since then, we embodied the principles. We really thought about what the idea of the book is and how it should benefit people. We wanted it to be very citizen-centric. – Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments</p>
</blockquote>
 Crafting Legislation and Governance for Digital Trust 
<p>Translating the SSI book’s vision into tangible legislation was a crucial step. Jacques explains how this process, guided by Drummond Reed and informed by extensive consultation with experts, culminated in the unanimous passing of an Act in Bhutan’s parliament. This legislation ensures a citizen-centric approach to digital identity.</p>
 Building an Ecosystem for Digital Trust 
<p>Drummond underscores the importance of creating a comprehensive digital trust ecosystem involving various stakeholders. Bhutan’s NDI project serves as a blueprint for other nations seeking to embark on similar digital identity journeys, emphasizing the collaborative nature of such transformative endeavours.</p>
 Addressing Device Accessibility 
<p>Inclusivity is a priority for Bhutan’s NDI project. Jacques outlines Bhutan’s strategies to ensure device accessibility for all citizens, including a fund to provide devices to families without them. For those in remote areas without mobile coverage, a unique biometric verifiable credential bridges the digital divide, enabling access when they visit friends and family with smart devices.</p>
 Digital Horizons Unveiled 
<p>Bhutan’s NDI project is a testament to the transformative power of digital identity. It offers citizens convenience, efficiency, and accessibility while laying the foundation for a more connected and digitally empowered society.</p>
<p>As we conclude Episode 1 of the (un)Trustables Podcast, we invite you to stay tuned for future episodes where we continue to explore digital trust and transformation worldwide.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Earlier this year, Wenjing and I delved into the fascinating intersection of Digital Trust and Generative AI in an SSI Orbit podcast episode (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/digital-trust-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/">here</a>), which serves as an excellent primer on the subject for those unfamiliar with it. Since that episode, the landscape of generative AI solutions has undergone significant transformations, prompting us to record a follow-up discussion.</p>
<p>In this Part 2 episode, we were joined by Sankarshan, who co-chairs the ‘AI and Metaverse Task Force’ at the Trust over IP Foundation, alongside Wenjing. His insights added a valuable dimension to our conversation, particularly as we tackled prevalent misconceptions in the field of AI.</p>
<p>One key misconception we discussed is the belief that AI systems are purely statistical and random. We emphasized that, in reality, the world itself is inherently statistical, and AI systems are designed to mirror human decision-making processes, which are also based on statistical reasoning.</p>
<p>Another topic we explored is the common overestimation of AI’s logical reasoning capabilities and the underestimation of the constraints within AI systems. This discussion led us into the realm of AI governance. We debated the suitability of non-profit models for managing emerging technologies like AI, considering their capital-intensive nature and ongoing maturation. Examples like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/our-guide-to-openai-sam-altman-and-what-the-heck-happened-34da070b">OpenAI </a>and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-operating-costs/">Signal</a> were brought up to illustrate these points.</p>
<p>We aimed to focus part of the discussion on identifying practical solutions and low-hanging fruits for building digital trust tools. These tools are crucial for consumers to discern truth in an era increasingly dominated by generative AI-driven content. Additionally, we delved into strategies to mitigate and prevent the risks of AI abuse, especially as AI systems become more integrated with our daily lives.</p>
<p>A topic that resonated with me was the importance of provenance and authentication in AI systems, especially in content creation. We underscored the need for more robust tools to authenticate AI-generated content. However, we also acknowledged the limitations of current tools in ensuring provenance and their inability to address all security risks comprehensively.</p>
<p>Our discussion also touched upon the influence of human nature on AI development and governance. We pondered whether the current ideal-driven structures would evolve towards more traditional capitalist models, accompanied by regulation. This led to a broader conversation about the purpose of technology, which usually gets categorized as ‘a benefit to mankind’ by its creators. Yet, the complexity of implementing this ideal becomes apparent when considering who should govern these technologies and how they should be regulated.</p>
<p>This podcast episode not only sheds light on the complexities of digital trust in the age of AI but also opens up avenues for further exploration and discussion. As we move towards 2024, these conversations are more relevant than ever, guiding us towards a future where technology is both a tool for advancement and a subject of thoughtful governance.</p>

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF66 is live today, Nov 30. It concludes on Dec 7. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF66  Section 5: Challenge DF Wind-down   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has three substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and earn.<br>– Challenge DF. Accurately predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are four ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), Challenge DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream.

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF66 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.

 Stakers can claim DF62 rewards. DF63 runs Nov 9 — Nov 16,&nbsp;2023 <p>[Note: this particular post was published a few weeks late. So please ignore its date of publication.]</p> 1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 62 (DF62) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 100K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Nov 9, 2023 and ended 12:01am Nov 16. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>“<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa">Predictoor Data Farming</a>” is a new Ocean incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via 37K OCEAN + 100K ROSE (≈$22K USD) in weekly extra sales to Predictoor data feeds [1]. This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF63 is live today, Nov 9. It concludes on Nov 16. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF63  Section 5: Challenge DF Wind-down   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has three substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and earn.<br>– Challenge DF. Accurately predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are four ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), Challenge DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash bad Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF63 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.

<p>As part of ongoing support, we are releasing two service patches against SSO 9.2 and SSO 9.3. Found within both of these patches are several corrections against SAML authentication-related issues. The SAML authentication issue has existed for a number of years, but was uncovered with improvements to SSO cacheing performed in SSO 9.2. Specifically, the Microsoft service SignIn with SAML, has permitted non-uniqued entityIDs to exist. Our improvement to caching uncovered this potential minor configuration issue, which is fully corrected in the patches.</p>
<p>Additionally, for SSO 9.2.1, we have included the recent update of OpenLDAP 2.5.16, which includes OpenSSL v3 libraries. For any customers using LDAPS, we encourage you to install one of these latest service patchs.</p>
<p>Please find the SSO 9.2.3 and SSO 9.3.1 patches at: <a title="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/" href="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/">https://downloads.ubisecure.com/</a></p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your Identity Platform in a timely manner. Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility, security, and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.</p>

<p>Keeping up with the latest security challenges can feel like you are running a race that has endless hurdles. From rapid advancements in technology – rendering old hardware obsolete – to increasingly stringent requirements and regulations, the time and costs can quickly become enormous.</p>
<p>Many of these challenges are related to the migration of compute, storage, and backup services to cloud services. Picture this, you have moved your databases to the cloud. But are you in control of your encryption keys? Do you know who has a copy or could access a copy?</p>
<p>Today’s solutions offer your organization a choice of how to most effectively secure your encryption keys. You can select a solution that allows your organization to secure your keys in an on-premise HSM or one that allows your organization to protect your keys via a secure connection to a cloud-based HSM with an HSM-as-a-Service (HSMaaS) offering such as Entrust’s nShield-as-a-Service solution.</p>
<p>Entrust recently partnered with TechValidate to conduct a survey to understand how companies view and are implementing HSMaaS solutions.</p>
<p>From On-Premise to the Cloud</p>
<p>For years, the best practice was to use an HSM deployed on-premise. Concerns about security of software based key storage, separation of keys, and sovereignty requirements made it the only viable option. Over time, as-a-service HSM offerings appeared in the market offering lower costs, and a level of security comparable to on-premise HSMs, with more flexibility and quicker implementation.</p>
<p>The Survey Says</p>
<p>Today’s organizations are looking to save time and money. The survey showed that 57% of organizations said a key reason for considering subscribing to an HSMaaS offering is to reduce IT management costs. Further, 69% of respondents said that their organizations would realize reduced spend on physical infrastructure. The next closest benefit noted was improved efficiency with 46% of the respondents selecting that benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The focus on saving time and reducing expenses has also been a significant driver of cloud adoption. With the rise of cloud service providers, as-a-service-HSM offerings evolved even further. Leading cloud service providers offer their own unique approach to securing your encryption keys. While these offerings provide convenience and cost-effective solutions, they do not always meet internal security requirements set by some organizations adding further to the complexity involved when deciding how to store your encryption keys.</p>
<p>In addition to saving time and money, HSMaaS solutions like Entrust nShield-as-a-Service provide the same level of support for a wide range of applications. This is something that was also reflected in the survey results. Respondents indicated that once onboarded, they would leverage an HSMaaS solution for a variety of functions.</p>
<p>The top functions ranked were public key infrastructure (PKI), which was mentioned by 60% of respondents followed by key management which was selected by 57% of respondents. Data encryption/decryption and digital signatures were also mentioned by nearly half of the respondents (49%). These results reinforce the similarities in functionality between on-premise HSM and HSMaaS offerings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Important Cloud Key Management Considerations</p>
<p>Saving time and money are necessary criteria when considering implementing an HSMaaS solution. However, they are not the only considerations you should have when deciding what as-a-service HSM offering to use when storing your encryption keys. It is important to also consider:</p>
 
 Security – Make sure you understand how the HSMaaS offering works. Are you sharing the cloud-based HSM with other users or is it for your exclusive use? This is often referred to as single-tenancy vs multi-tenancy. You must ensure that you chose the right solution to match your risk profile and requirements. 
 Sovereignty of keys. Can the HSMaaS provider guarantee what country or region your keys will physically stored in? Will you be compliant with the regulations affecting your organization? 
 Integrations and the compatibility of the key management software with other vendors. Does it integrate with the other products and services used by your organization? 
 Ease of comprehensive key management for the entire organization. Does the solution give you the ability to rotate, generate, discard, and easily access information required during an audit? 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>When evaluating these considerations and HSMaaS solutions, partnering with a company that understands your holistic security and encryption needs will simplify this process. While cost is always a driving factor, ensuring you are in control of your keys is the most important. Ensuring where your keys are stored for key sovereignty requirements, the available integrations and the key management capabilities need to be carefully reviewed. The right keys need to be stored in the right places, using a solution that will protect your business and significantly enhance your organization’s security.</p>

<p>With credential stuffing attacks on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/">23andMe</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/no-okta-senior-management-not-an-errant-employee-caused-you-to-get-hacked/">Okta</a> just the latest breaches to make headlines in recent weeks, the push for biometrics-based authentication is gaining momentum for Identity and Access Management (IAM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem: Biometrics aren’t all created equal. Yes, device-based biometrics such as Touch ID, Face ID, and Windows Hello can help reduce the threat of password-based account takeover (ATO). But they can still leave IT guessing about the identity behind the device. While hardware tokens and Apple, Microsoft and Google’s decision to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/google-makes-passkeys-the-default-sign-in-method-for-all-users/">passkeys the default</a> for logins are also helpful, they really only confirm possession of a device or biometric and assume (but don’t validate) identity. Thankfully, it doesn’t have to be this way—if you have the right IAM architecture.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Device: Enabling F-Word Free Authentication&nbsp; 
<p>Whether it’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/public-schools-in-denver-colorado-hit-with-breach-fingerprint-scans-grabbed">fingerprints</a> or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/heres-the-newest-camera-hack-fraudsters-are-using-to-beat-facial-recognition">facial recognition</a>, that which is stored can be stolen or spoofed by cybercriminals to infiltrate corporate systems. Hell, even without a hack, traditional forms of biometric authentication only confirm the person accessing an account is the same person who initially enrolled to do so—but not whether that person is really who they claim to be. This matters when enrollment fraud leads to more than <a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/javelins-identity-fraud-study-highlights-the-changing-nature-of-fraud/">$3.2 billion</a> in losses annually. For me, “fraud” is an f-word that typically leads to others we could all do without. That’s where 1Kosmos comes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity-Backed Biometrics &amp; Modern IAM Architectures 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we saw the urgency of finding a way to easily and accurately verify and authenticate identity in a way that can’t be vouched for by mere password, one-time passcode, or a static (and spoofable) biometric. That’s why we set out to modernize IAM by combining strong identity verification and authentication within a unified architecture. One that offers unrivaled identity assurance behind each device used to access online services, along with a seamless account enrollment and authentication experience. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we provided an overview of this architecture and the pillars it’s built upon. In this post, let’s double-click on a core pillar: <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">biometric-based user authentication.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a> employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with 99.6% accuracy, stores them under user control, and binds them to an identity wallet and biometric with liveness detection. This gives IT the security and control they need while providing users with a seamless login experience. The benefits are threefold:&nbsp;</p>
<p>High Assurance</p>
<p>Biometrics verified through liveness testing deliver the highest digital identity assurance possible and enable fast, frictionless multi-factor authentication. When matched to a verified identity, they eliminate fraudulent identities hiding behind valid credentials.</p>
<p>User Convenience</p>
<p>Physical attributes used for biometric authentication are not vulnerable to damage and unexpected alterations. They provide quick, user-friendly authentication with or without passwords.</p>
<p>Flexible Use Cases</p>
<p>Whether the use case demands a fingerprint, voice match, a live biometric or other identifier, the 1Kosmos architecture provides affordable authenticators that adjust to varied and evolving business needs.</p>
 Building Bulletproof Biometric Authentication 
<p>We didn’t just follow the most effective approach to identity-backed biometric authentication. We defined it. 1Kosmos offers the only IAM architecture built with four crucial elements of identity-backed biometric authentication:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certification to FIDO2, NIST 800-63-3 and UKDIATF Standards</p>
<p>Our BlockID platform is certified to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO</a>, <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST</a> and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/kitcp-06-01-certificate-1kosmos/">UKDIATF</a> standards, having undergone rigorous testing to verify quality coding and ensure the use of common devices to authenticate users. When combined with a verified identity, you’re talking about unmatched security and convenience. BlockID supports USB keys, keycard authentication, fingerprint readers, and hardware tokens and provides a robust framework to implement or augment passwordless authentication without being forced into using a single provider. With identity-backed biometrics, you also benefit from stronger security using physical traits. Think fingerprint scan with a USB security key or FIDO-compliant facial recognition, for instance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>iBeta Certified Biometrics</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, biometrics can improve security by replacing or augmenting the use of passwords, but they can also be subject to theft or spoofing. iBeta is an independent, NIST-accredited biometrics testing lab that has developed certification programs to verify biometric applications to recognized standards to prevent these things from happening. When enrolling with our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID</a> solution, the user can perform an advanced form of biometrics called a liveness test that prevents false facial verification using a photo, video, mask, or other substitute for an authorized user’s face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometric Encryption</p>
<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/12/what-is-biometric-encryption/">Biometric encryption</a> leverages a biometric template and public-private key pair to encrypt and decrypt personally identifiable information for authenticating a user and sharing data with an online service. This approach relies on the uniqueness of biometrics to ensure that hackers can’t reverse-engineer a password or key. Without the biometric and matching private key, all data in the digital wallet isn’t accessible, usable, or even legible. There’s no central storage of user biometrics, ensuring these biometrics remain private. Biometric authentication is easy to use and requires little, if any, user training.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flexible Levels of Identity Assurance</p>
<p>With BlockID, you determine the type of biometric appropriate for a given application and the level of identity assurance appropriate to the business risk. For <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/customer-onboarding-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/know-your-business-compliance-guide/">Know Your Business</a> (KYB) standards, Identity Assurance Level 2 can be achieved using <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">LiveID</a> and identity verification using government-issued credentials, such as a driver’s license or passport. A liveness test confirms a user’s facial match to the enrolled biometric and verified documents in real-time.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Lesser forms of identity assurance can be achieved using information from banking, telco, or corporate databases or through “inferred” identity based on access to an email address or logged-in device, as appropriate for the intended use. For additional use cases, 1Kosmos can also verify a user’s social security number (SSN) against the SSA, a driver’s license against the American Association of Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), a passport against ICAO or the US Department of State, or verify a user is indeed a physician by validating their NPIN (National Physician Information Number).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As documentation and accounts are enrolled, the location and phone number are verified against the issuing authority. The user’s LiveID scan is then validated against the picture extracted from the documentation. Once complete, their biometrics are captured, and the data is encrypted with the user’s private key and stored within a private and permissioned blockchain.</p>
<p>An Unbeatable Advantage&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Part Three, we’ll drill down on another core pillar of the 1Kosmos architecture: decentralized digital identity and how it provides users with secure anytime, anywhere access to ID cards, driver licenses, social security details, and more through a reusable identity wallet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  Die Abkündigung von SAP Identity Management (SAP IDM) stellt Unternehmen vor eine kritische Herausforderung. Die bisherige Lösung erreicht das Ende ihres Lebenszyklus, und Organisationen müssen sich nun die Frage stellen: Wie kann trotzdem weiterhin Compliance aufrechterhalten werden?  Die Gewährleistung der Identitätsverwaltung unter Berücksichtigung der gesetzlichen Bestimmungen entwickelt sich zu einem zentralen Anliegen für Fachleute im Bereich Informationstechnologie. 

In diesem Kontext suchen Unternehmen nach effektiven Wegen, um die bisherigen Ansätze und Verfahren aus dem SAP IDM-Umfeld auf andere Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)-Systeme zu migrieren. SailPoint und IBM präsentieren innovative Ansätze, wie moderne Technologien eingesetzt werden können, um IGA-Systeme zu erweitern und deren Vorteile optimal zu nutzen. Dieser Schritt eröffnet neue Wege für Unternehmen, um ihre Identitätsmanagement-Strategien anzupassen und den Herausforderungen des Endes von SAP IDM proaktiv zu begegnen.

<p>This is the 100th episode of Let’s Talk about Digital Identity – in this special episode two of our most popular guests, Heather Flanagan and David Birch, rejoined the podcast to explore what is exciting them in passwordless, identity wallets and digital money.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“Passwords have got to go. As we’re moving to passkeys, I think there’s always room for improvement on – even on them. If nothing else, focusing a little bit more on the user experience so that people will have a better understanding of what this means.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Heather Flanagan, Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and choreographer for Identity Flash Mob, comes from a position that the Internet is led by people, powered by words, and inspired by technology. She has been involved in leadership roles with some of the most technical, volunteer-driven organisations on the Internet, including IDPro as Principal Editor, the IETF, the IAB, and the IRTF as RFC Series Editor, ICANN as Technical Writer, and REFEDS as Coordinator, just to name a few. If there is work going on to develop new Internet standards, or discussions around the future of digital identity, she is interested in engaging in that work.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This is episode number 100 of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And for this special occasion, we have invited back Heather Flanagan, and David Birch.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>We have invited back to the show two of our most popular guests. So, these two guests, let me introduce them is Heather Flanagan. She is Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and Acting Executive Director for IDPro. Hello, Heather.</p>
<p>Heather Flanagan: Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Nice having you back.</p>
<p>And our second guest is David Birch. David Birch is an author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. He is Principal at 15 Mb, his advisory company. Hello, David.</p>
<p>David Birch: Hi. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a real pleasure having you both for this special episode, a bit different style, so being out of our usual script. But yeah, hearing a little bit more about yourselves.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to hear something in particular, because we want to hear something – a moment in your lives. So, what I want to hear – think of one specific moment in your career in which you told yourself, “Yes, this is why I love working in the identity industry.” Which moment would it be? Who wants to start?</p>
<p>David: Well, and it’s a bit self-centred, but probably when my publisher agreed to publish my first book. I thought I had some interesting ideas about identity – I mean you always think that your ideas are – but when you get that kind of validation that your ideas actually are interesting to other people. That really did change my career. Yeah, otherwise, I probably would have just carried on being a pretty average consultant and carried on in payments and banking. So yeah, it’s – but I put it all down to my publisher.</p>
<p>Oscar: Which one was this book? Tell us which book was this.</p>
<p>David: Identity is the New Money. It was Diane Coyle, the Economist, who encouraged me to publish it. So yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Heather?</p>
<p>Heather: I don’t have anything. I’ve been actually thinking about this question for a while, and it’s really hard to point to any one thing, because there were no lightning from the sky moments. It’s just, it’s always been such a foundational aspect of everything that I’ve ever done since I started in tech in the mid ‘90s. Where the first question was always – when you’re taking over something from a bulletin board system to an email server, “Who can access this? What permissions do they need to have? How do you set up accounts for them?” That was where everything always started. So, no one moment, it’s all of the moments.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, that’s great that there are several exciting moments. I’m sure for all of us, it’s been like that. Several moments in which we feel that this is exciting to be in this industry. But thank you for sharing that with us.</p>
<p>Being already towards the end of this year 2023 – so there are some keywords which were buzzing in the last years. But some of these buzzwords today are more reality, we have access to those. What do you think, what you feel about these technologies or techniques. And let’s get started with passwordless. So, if I ask Heather, what excites you today about passwordless?</p>
<p>Heather: I’m really excited about the fact that the technology itself is solid, the standards themselves are really, really well-done. But as excited as I am, I am concerned. Like at all the new modern technologies, I look at them and go, “Wow, that’s really cool.” and little anxiety making because for passwordless, what I observe is when you actually get out of the tech field and talk to my mother, she doesn’t trust it because it’s too easy.</p>
<p>And so, I do wonder about as bad as passwords are, the friction that they add, it’s something that people can wrap their heads around. Whereas they don’t understand the magic that’s happening behind the scenes that makes passkeys better. And if they don’t trust it, they won’t use it. And if they don’t use it, we lose out on all the benefits. So, one of the things I’ve been trying to think about for you know, the future is OK passkeys are amazing, but how can we make them less magic scary?</p>
<p>David: I’m a bit frustrated with it really, because I’m extremely lazy. And so, you know, like eBay, for example, uses passkeys, the whole thing works perfectly. So as soon as I go to a site, as in fact I just did 10 minutes ago to look at something and it’s log back in. I’m like, “What I have an account? I didn’t even know I had the account.” And then I had to remember the password. And of course, I didn’t get it. So, I had to click on, I forgot my password, and then I got the password reset. And then I put in the new password. And it said, “You can’t have a new password that’s the same as the old password.” And we just go around in this loop. And it drives me crazy. I’m like, “Why can’t you just all implement this?” Despite the fears of your mom, which I mean I can’t discount those because they’re real. The sooner we make people stop using passwords, the better.</p>
<p>I was reading a fantastic story in the Insider this morning. Did you see this story about the Zelle fraud on Insider? It’s typical kind of thing, you know, guys getting some work done by a contractor. The hackers get into the contractor’s email account, they send him a thing to send money to a different account, which is the hackers’ account. And they make off with all of the money. And so, they go and talk to the contractor and said to him, “You know, did you know that your email has been compromised, you should change your email password.”</p>
<p>And the guy, it says in the article, “We may as well have been speaking Romanian.” The guy had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. Because he’s a normal person. He doesn’t care about all of this stuff. You don’t say to people, “Oh, here’s a car, would you like a seat belt with it? Or would you like a piece of string that you could attach in, you know, particularly opt in place.” You know, as a society, it comes to a point where you say, “I’m sorry, not wearing seatbelts, there’s just too many people dying. So, cars have to have seatbelts. And you have to put the damn things on. End of story.”</p>
<p>And I sort of feel we’re getting to that point. Fraud and scam, it’s just so completely out of control. And this thing about whether you know, you need to put people in charge of their own data and so on. I just don’t believe that for a moment. I just don’t. Most people don’t have the persistent competence that – including me, by the way, I’m not casting the first stone, I’m one of those people that lacks the persistent competence to make this happen. There are reservations but passkeys are a billion times better than passwords, and we should make people use them. I’m sorry, you got to stop pandering to populism.</p>
<p>Heather: No two ways about it – Passwords have got to go. As we’re moving to passkeys, I think there’s always room for improvement on – even on them. If nothing else, focusing a little bit more on the user experience so that people will have a better understanding of what this means. And when they click this button, why would they click this as opposed to clicking something else that might be a phishing site that they wouldn’t recognise. So, it’s an ongoing education.</p>
<p>David: Then you sort of think of contactless as the, you know, in the early days of contactless people, “Oh, it’s too scary.” And in some parts of the world, it appears to be witchcraft, that you can pay for things by not touching it with your card and this, people are going to come and steal all the cards. And there are going to be people of Eastern European origin on the subway system, putting their hands inside your clothes to read your cards and all this. Remember all of this stuff that was going on?</p>
<p>And now, you walk into a store, anywhere in the world. I’m not talking America, I’m talking about developed countries, of course. You walk into a store anywhere in the world, and there’s that little contactless symbol and you pay, and you go, and no one thinks anything about it anymore. It’s a bit different in America. In America, you have to look for the till and where’s the sign? And then you have to press some buttons. And then sometimes you have to sign something as well. It’s baffling. I don’t understand any of it.</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, the day you understand what happens in the United States will be a marvellous day. Because nobody understands what happens.</p>
<p>David: No, it’s mysterious. But the point is, generally speaking, you know, we came up with this symbol, and everybody knows, you tap your card there, and it works. And guess what? All of your money isn’t stolen by Eastern European fraudsters. So, they’re not all Eastern European, obviously, other fraudsters are available. Because the corollary is going to be basically, people like us will start using passkeys, and so all the fraud will transfer onto people like your mom. That seems a little unfair to me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, seeing that you are excited indeed with passwordless. But of course, there are some concerns and some things to improve. Absolutely. Interesting what Heather said that, yeah, some people have been using password for so long, but that anything else feels like how do you say the…</p>
<p>David: An improvement? Real security? System-wide integrity? I don’t know, what’s the word you’re searching for there? I don’t know.</p>
<p>Oscar: How you say the…</p>
<p>Heather: Magic.</p>
<p>Oscar: Magic. Yeah, magic.</p>
<p>David: So, I’m excited as Heather is, I’m probably just a bit more militant on how quickly we should be pushing it out.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, we’ll see what comes in the next year as how it really rolls out. But the next one is about identity wallets. So, what excites you today about identity wallets?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, I have a list on that one. I’m particularly excited over how – as much as I worry about people not understanding the magic, they do understand the concept of flipping through a wallet to get to the right card, the right credential, the right thing they need and then using it and giving them that level of control is a vast improvement, I think over some of the other technology has been going on today.</p>
<p>I’m watching what’s happening in Europe quite closely because I think that – how the governments are handling digital wallets and digital identity is a very interesting model. I will be curious to see how other countries do it. How they do it well, how they do it poorly. And if there’s some way we can actually – I’d love to standardise ‘what’s a wallet’, you know. That’s one of my little pet peeves, there is no standard for a wallet. There’s standard for credentials, but there’s not a standard for ‘what is a wallet’.</p>
<p>David: I mean, it’s interesting to see what the Open Wallet initiative and various other people are doing in this space. I agree with Heather. I think as much as the technology is important, and certainly, in technological terms, the wallet is the sort of crucial pivot between the kind of online and offline world. It’s very central to the next phase of evolution of commerce. A lot of it has to do with – in fact, we won’t even call our wallets now identity wallets, we just call them wallets. But if you actually open up my wallet, I mean, I won’t do it over there. If you open up my wallet, it has no money in it. Everything is in my wallet, it has to do with identity, driver’s licenses and loyalty cards. And my wallet is already an identity wallet, we just don’t call it that.</p>
<p>So, extending that wallet across sort of virtual and real world seems to me, pretty straightforward. But of course, that does rather interestingly open up what I think will be quite a vicious battle about who’s actually going to control those wallets. Because certainly, Heather mentioned kind of the European approach. They’re very, very unhappy with the idea of big tech controlling those wallets. We’re very unhappy with the big tech or big government controlling the wallets. People like me will prefer that it was regulated institutions – banks primarily, that control those wallets. Other people think banks should be absolutely the last people to have any sort of control over those wallets. So really, I’m not smart enough to figure out like the end dimensional gameplay as to how this is going to work out. But it’s pretty serious. It’s pretty serious.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, people understand the concept of a wallet. But what we’re talking about in today’s world is that, you know, “how many wallets are you going to have to carry?” Because there may be one that’s issued by big tech, perhaps via your browser or via your mobile device. But then, you know, as governments are saying, “No, we’re going to issue something that’s completely separate and have its own app, and what is that going to look like. And then how are people supposed to be able to find the credential they need across 2, 3, 5 different wallets?</p>
<p>David: No, I agree with you completely on that, Heather. But I think there’s another level of complexity there as well, which is – because is the wallet going to be like if you imagine there’s some kind of standard wallet, is that wallet the app? Or is that wallet, essentially the underlying SDK the apps plug into?</p>
<p>So, my British Airways app and my Barclays Bank app, they’re all actually the same wallet underneath. They’re all plugging into the same wallet. But is it going to be like that? Is there going to be like a travel industry wallet? Or is British Airways going to have its own wallet? That’s really hard to know. I would think, and this comes from kind of what I think is a reasonably rational calculus. The credentials that are going to be in those wallets are the embodiment of individual reputations.</p>
<p>My British Airways credential is the embodiment of my relationship with British Airways, that I want to take and show to other people. It’s not obvious to me that British Airways would benefit from owning the wallet, because they’d have to maintain it and upgrade it and whatever. They’re having enough trouble just with their own website to do that. On the other hand, I can see why they’d be nervous about just handing the whole thing over to Apple and Google, because then they’ll end up paying a tax, which I’m pretty sure they don’t want to do. So, I don’t know how that’s going to work out. But I listen to a lot of smart people about this. It’s a very fascinating topic to me.</p>
<p>Heather: I talked to Don Thibeau and Juliana Cafik and a couple others about “what was the Open Wallet Foundation trying to do?” And they’re trying to work towards interoperability in code and maybe a standard will come out of that someday when they see what works and what doesn’t work. But at the moment, they are not standardising wallets. They’re just…</p>
<p>David: No, that’s true. There’s…</p>
<p>Heather: They’re just putting together a platform to try and make it work together.</p>
<p>David: But as you pointed out earlier on, some of the components are standardised. We have VCs, we have MDL. We’ve got MDL 7 and 9 coming in a few months, a year or something. So I mean, there is some pretty useful standardisation going on anyway.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, more in the credential format space.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That might give us enough interoperability to get started.</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ll see. Indeed, it sounds like it’s…</p>
<p>David: I’m a naturally simple and optimistic person. Heather’s looking at all the nuances here. And that’s why she’s so, that’s why my superficial, cheery approach to this – it’s not washing with her I can see it from her face.</p>
<p>Oscar: You seem to be both excited about identity wallets, I think.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I think wallets are really interesting topic for the coming year.</p>
<p>Heather: Huge potential.</p>
<p>Oscar: You, David, mentioned that as far as I understood, you don’t carry cash anymore, that was my understanding how you have your wallet, your real wallet without cash.</p>
<p>David: No, actually, I mean I don’t carry my real wallet, it’s in the drawer over there. So, I had an interesting conversation with somebody last week about premium cards. That’s how interesting my life is, Heather. I just, I benchmark, I had an interesting discussion with someone else last week about premium cards. This is a tragic trajectory of my life.</p>
<p>But I have this fancy new American Express Platinum Card, which is made out of some sort of metal. I don’t know if it’s actually platinum, but it’s sort of metal. And it’s really fancy and heavy and solid and whatever. And I couldn’t even tell you where it is. It’s in the house somewhere. I haven’t the slightest idea.</p>
<p>Oscar: Don’t activate it.</p>
<p>David: No, no, because as soon as I got it, it’s on my phone. I only ever use it on my phone. I don’t know where the actual card is, I have no interest in that. I’m going into London in a minute, I have a ring. So, the ring I use for getting on the subway and bus because I don’t always want to take my phone out. But if I’m paying in a restaurant so I got to use my phone. I think the days of physical wallets, I mean, lots of people keep saying, well, there’s going to be a backlash at some point, and people are going to want to use cash, sort of the way they want to use vinyl records, I suppose. But I think that will just be like a few hipsters. I don’t think it’ll be the rest of us.</p>
<p>Heather: I don’t trust having network access consistently enough to go without some kind of physical something. Do I use my wallet on my watch and my phone more often than not? Well, when I’m in Europe, yes. When I’m in the US, maybe. I don’t count on it. I don’t think I can count on it yet. So, there’s always the physical components that I think I have to have.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I mean, I would say that’s an interesting argument in favour of using offline verifiable credentials. And it’s also a crucial argument in favour as to why Central Bank Digital Currency should operate offline. So, I mean, I agree with you about that. As to the state of things at the moment, well, if the transit gates fail and can’t go online, they have to fail open, it’s a public safety issue. You can’t fail transit gate shut. So, they have to, they should have – I can always get home, you know, but it’s never happened. But when push comes to shove, I’ll get home, so I’m fine.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and that related to my last question, but just to hear what you liked the most. So, what excites you about this digital money that we were already starting to discuss?</p>
<p>David: I’d say there’s probably three things. I mean, Heather’s going to disagree with me on every single one of them, which is why it makes for an interesting conversation. But I’d say there’s probably three things.</p>
<p>So, the first thing is digital money, well, certainly digital currency is the subject of irrational delusional comment by conspiracy theorists, which makes for entertainment. So, I get emails, “oh, you know, Central Bank Digital Currency is the mark of the devil. And we know this because Bill Gates implanted microchips in us through the vaccine, and the microchips are going to steal the digital currency from unvaccinated people and send it through the 5g towers to Satan.” Or somebody, I can’t remember exactly, I don’t remember. But you get emails like this, which add to the gaiety of the nation.</p>
<p>So, the first thing is, there are parts of America where non-existent digital currency is already being banned. So, this is all getting a bit, sort of witch trail-y, so that’s quite entertaining.</p>
<p>The second thing is, and I wasn’t joking about that offline point, which is any scale digital currency in any developed country, even where you have networks and infrastructure has to work offline. It’s the crucial design requirement of it. If you’re going to have a cash substitute, it has to work offline. And that, for me, poses very interesting technological problems, all of which I think, have already been solved. But nonetheless, it’s really intellectually interesting, so I sort of like that.</p>
<p>And the third thing is, I think a lot of people look at digital currency as ‘the thing’. Like, you know, we need digital currency. And that’s it. I mean, what we need is a platform for innovation and development. Digital currency in itself is sort of not that interesting. As we’ve just established, I can already buy milk in the supermarket without using physical cash. So that’s not, but this idea of permissionless innovation that you could bring into our space from the cryp– because digital it doesn’t involve any credit risk, you see. So, you could imagine a situation where as long as you’ve got an approved chip in your iPhone, or something, they’re certified as being capable of storing digital dollars or something like that, then you can use the API to do whatever you like, there’s no credit risk involved. So, allowing people to experiment with interesting new things – micro payments, and Escrow and blah, blah, blah. On top of it is really where it’s at. And that’s why, you know, I get it a bit when people say, “Well, what are the sort of key uses?” Well, I don’t know, I’m too old. Give it to some kids in a garage and let them come up with something.</p>
<p>Heather: OK. So, for one thing, I really want to see your emails about this because they sound hilarious. I admit, I’m absolutely a digital currency sceptic. For one thing, as David has said, right, you don’t generally need to carry cash now anyway, so what is it getting you? And everything I understand about it is like, “Well, yes, but then you’ll be able to transfer money quickly without the bank getting in the way.” And I’m like, “Hmm, you say the bank getting in the way and verifying the transaction is a bad thing.” “Oh, but it’s expensive.” And I’m like, “Well, that’s a different problem, not just because the banks are charging a lot.” So that’s like a completely different problem to solve that it’s not a technology problem at all.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’m definitely not convinced. Having the permission to innovate and work with this kind of currency, to me in a way, that’s like saying, “Yup, let’s turn this into a barter system, except you’re bartering these digital currency components.” “OK. Go for it, go to town.” That’s just people agreeing with each other. And it’s a completely different system in the same way that a barter system is completely different with my cash system.</p>
<p>David: That’s a really interesting point. And I don’t mean that in any sort of patronising sense, I really mean that because you’re right, of course. And what that means is, if this stuff worked, then downstream you could imagine an environment where if you and I engage in some sort of transaction, right, I’m going to pay you to write something or you’re going to pay me to come and speak or something like that. My, you know, supercomputer at the end of a wire, it can be a through my mobile phone, my giant killer robot artificially intelligent wallet will negotiate with your super intelligent giant killer robot Terminator wallet to exchange baskets of tokens to an agreed –</p>
<p>The idea that you would need money as an intermediary when you have that kind of barter that works. I think that’s really, that’s as a very interesting point. So, if our super computers could agree on these baskets of assets to exchange, which sounds weird when its people talking about it, but it’s a few nanoseconds for super computers. Why would you turn those assets into dollars or something in the first place? Why wouldn’t you just swap the assets around?</p>
<p>So, I actually rather agree with that point. But I think that’s much further downstream. I think, in the short term, you see the demand for dollar stable coins in particular, as an indication to me that a lot of people around the world and in America, for that matter, wants to hold digital dollars. They would find digital dollars useful to do things with that you can’t do with regular dollars, and I sort of agree.</p>
<p>So, I can see sort of both things. But to me, the short term and the long term are quite different there. Because I probably do drink my Kool Aid, and I’d probably do think that that’s kind of a stupid expression actually it’s, don’t drink that Kool Aid because everybody that drank the Kool Aid died, didn’t they? Or am I getting the stories mixed up?</p>
<p>Heather: I wasn’t going to say it.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, no, I think they did. OK, that’s a bad example. But the point is, I think in the long run, you might well be right. I think in the short term, digital currencies, I think would add to the net welfare. I mean, I can imagine, you and I agreeing to something, and the money just goes from my digital wallet to your digital wallet. It never goes anywhere near the banking system. It just goes over Bluetooth or whatever but yes. It is exciting. That’s true.</p>
<p>Oscar: Heather, what’s not so exciting to digital money?</p>
<p>Heather: We’ll see.</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ll see. We’ll see. Anything else that it’s for you is exciting?</p>
<p>David: What’s not working digital money, you know, these answers are intertwined, because the thing that’s broken in digital money at the moment, is identity, not the payment bit. Like the reason why you’ve got Zelle frauds and authorised push payment frauds and these massive crypto scams going on all the time. It’s because nobody knows who anybody is. It’s not because the payments don’t work properly. It’s because identity doesn’t work properly.</p>
<p>If the identity, you know, I’m going to sound like a broken record on this one for the teenagers there. I’m going to sound like a vinyl implement that used to go around whether it has a scratch in it. So, this sort of needle would prompt up, down and come back to this, I have to talk them through this metaphor. But I’m going to sound like a broken record on this. Because if you fix the identity problem, payments are easy.</p>
<p>If you know the reputation of all of the counterparties in a transaction, then pricing the risk in that transaction is easy. And that’s kind of what we should be aiming for. The next phase of evolution is really about identity. It happens that I think, and I can’t prove this with any kind of actual analysis, this is just my sort of crackpot theory about this. But actually, if central banks do drive forward with digital currency, digital currency doesn’t work unless you have digital identity. You can’t give people wallets unless you know who those people are. You can’t maintain limits on personal holdings unless you know who’s got the wallets. There must be an identity system for the currency system to work. So it could be that Central Bank Digital Currency actually turns out to be a vector for people like Heather to actually get something done about wallets and digital identity. So, there’s an interesting interrelationship there.</p>
<p>Heather: They are certainly tied together. There’s no two questions about that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Anything else that you think that is exciting today in the identity world that we have not covered?</p>
<p>David: Well, there’s two things I’m excited about today. I can tell you what I was doing before I came on this call. So, one is – I’m very excited about only because I’m not a normal person. I’m very excited about ultra-wideband technology. So, all iPhones for a while, you know some of the top end Samsung’s you know Apple Air Tags, things like this, they all have this thing in them called you UWB, Ultra-Wideband which a lot of people kind of overlook a little bit because we focus everything on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. But when Bluetooth and Wi Fi came out there were actually three wireless standards. There was Bluetooth, UWB and Wi-Fi. And UWB never really got used because the Wi-Fi chips got cheaper much quicker, and everybody just started building Wi-Fi into things. And meanwhile Bluetooth ranges went up.</p>
<p>But ultra-wideband, which is short range, medium speed that uses this pulsed radio. Because of the way it works, it can only tell where things are, this is how Air Tags work. But it can also tell whether you’re moving towards something or away from it. So, this idea of having a phone that knows you’re walking up to the point-of-sale terminal or knows you’re walking up to a door. And the way that Apple are part of this digital car keys alliance, which I’m very interested in with Google, and I think BMW and people like that.</p>
<p>So, this idea that you have one technology like this, which locates you, you’re walking towards the POS terminal, and then it flips to Bluetooth to execute an actually secure transaction with real cryptography, and real keys. I’m really interested in that at the moment for a variety of different ways. So that’s the first thing.</p>
<p>And the second thing is, and I think we have touched on this before, we think of identity as being about people. But actually, everything needs identity. And when everything has an identity, working out how to get both privacy and security in that environment is really rather complicated. It’s very intellectually challenging. And that’s what I’m spending the rest of my time on with another startup at the moment. So yeah, there’s no end of things to be excited about in this space, honestly. And frankly, figuring out how people can log into their bank account without password is the least interesting of the things that’s going on at the moment.</p>
<p>Heather: Probably the most interesting thing that I’m trying to stay on top of right now is watching the standards development space, because that is like one of my favourite things to do. Because I might also be a little bit of a strange person. So, standards development space, seeing how ISO, the IETF, the W3C, as well as some of the smaller standard’s organisations like the OpenID Foundation, the Decentralised Identity Foundation, Trust Over IP, how they’re all circling closer and closer to each other and sometimes hitting each other, bouncing off.</p>
<p>You know, it’s becoming a really dense space to try and follow and understand what’s happening with W3C verifiable credentials? How do those relate to the ISO MDOC standards, and what’s happening with the IETF’s OAuth and CBOR and you know, all of these different standard’s groups are all starting to get closer and closer at nibbling down this problem. And they’re never going to succeed because they’re reaching the point where it’s not a technical problem anymore. It’s a societal problem. And the regulators are starting to move ahead of them and saying, “No, this is what, you know, we need to happen. And it’s not about technology, as much as it is sometimes about the society and the cultural requirements.” So, seeing these organisations tighten up, it’s pretty cool.</p>
<p>David: I was just going to ask you, because I’ve sort of lost the thread on this a little bit, because unless you follow it with minute detail every day, you don’t. I wonder if the whole kind of MDOC thing doesn’t have its own momentum. So, in other words, in a lot of circumstances, you can see why people are going to go to MDOC and MDL part 5, even for something that’s not a driving license, just because. It reminds me a little bit, and here’s another one of the teenagers, it reminds me of X.500. Because having spent part of my young life, she doesn’t even know what X.500 is, how he’s been part of my – X.400 was the ISO messaging standard that existed before the internet and that no longer exists. And X.500 was the directory standard for that. And that no longer exists. An X.509 was the standard for exchanging public keys in that directory. And X.509 version 3 is how everything works on the internet.</p>
<p>So, the whole of X.400 has disappeared, the whole of X.500 disappeared. And I just wonder if MDL isn’t going to be in the same place, like people are going to end up using MDL just because it exists. It may not be the optimum for a lot of the appli– but it doesn’t matter. The format exists. Wallets can understand it. Apple and Google Wallets can understand it. The MDOC stuff will carry on standardising, and I think maybe a lot of stuff will just get sucked into that.</p>
<p>Heather: What’s getting complicated about it – is the MDL standards. They are in their own way the X.509 to the modern world. They’re specifying a credential. This is a discrete concrete, and this is what this is supposed to be used for. It is your driver’s license. It is your identifier. Verifiable credentials using W3 capital V, capital C verifiable credentials. That’s not what they are really, those are much more generic thing that’s actually more an authentication thing. So, the fact that they’re hitting each other in the ways that they are is very interesting and a little disturbing. And the fact that the browser vendors are debating within themselves, which one they’re going to support when ultimately, they serve different purposes, I worry that we’re going to be driven towards…</p>
<p>David: No, no, I… your analysis is spot on. I agree with you completely Heather. I’m just saying that in practice, what seems to be happening is like people like me would say, “Well, actually…” you know, use the canonical example going into the bar, you know, people like me would say, “Well, you should be presenting an ISO W3C verifiable credential that says that you’re over 18 or over 21. So, I’m going…” But that doesn’t exist. The standard for the credential exists, but the contents, whereas on MDL, OK, that’s not really what it was meant for. But actually, demanding to see your MDL driver’s license, I can do because the standard exists. And I, you know, so I agree with your analysis. I’m just saying I wonder if actually, well, Trust Over IP and all these other things are kind of circling around, bumping into each other. MDOC is just steadily progressing, you know.</p>
<p>Heather: Told you Oscar, I told you, you’re going to have all sorts of fun things to talk about.</p>
<p>David: He’s going to get very bored on our – just our island, Heather. Like after the plane crashes, we’re going to be fine. He’s going to be, I don’t know what he’s going to do all day, making those little token at men or something.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, fantastic. Hearing all this from you. You’re definitely super passionate about – many of these things that you’re talking about, frustrated about some of them, but yes, super excited about most of them. So, thank you very much for joining us in very special episode for us. So, thank you very much. And please tell us how people can learn more about you, Heather?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, easiest thing is – go to LinkedIn and find me there. I check it every day. It’s one of my major social media accounts.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I mean, I spend more time on LinkedIn now since Twitter kind of went all weird. So, I mean, I’m on LinkedIn too. But it also you can just look up www.dgwbirch.com.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, thank you very much. So, let’s see how exciting comes the next coming months, years and yeah, how all the things we were discussing today will roll out. So, again, thanks a lot and all the best.</p>
<p>Heather: Great. Bye</p>

   Evaluate your access management (AM) strategy with guidance from Gartner 

<p>Access management (AM) has become instrumental in fueling business growth while protecting against modern attacks. Today's economic environment makes AM even more critical, with enterprises seeking a converged access management solution that can address myriad use cases for multiple populations. But what capabilities should you prioritize for your organization?</p>

<p>The 2023 Gartner® Critical Capabilities for Access Management report is a technical companion to the Gartner Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management. While the Magic Quadrant provides an overview of a vendor including its market share, Critical Capabilities is purely a technical analysis of a vendor's products and services.</p>

<p>This year Gartner scored 11 vendors against four common use cases, including workforce access management, business-to-consumer access management (B2C), business-to-business access management (B2B), and application development.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce that ForgeRock received the highest scores in two of these use cases, namely B2C and B2B customer access management.</p>

 11 critical capabilities to consider for your 2024 roadmap 

<p>In addition to the four use cases, Gartner outlines a set of critical capabilities essential for any organization's access management strategy:</p>

  Core Access Management 
	 User Authentication 
	 Authorization and Adaptive Access 
	 Portable Identity Integration 
	 Business to Business 
	 Business to Consumer 
	 Customization and Extensibility 
	 API Access Control 
	 Threat Reporting and ITDR 
	 Resilience 
	 Ease of Deployment 
  ForgeRock understands your business to the core 

<p>Our commitment to simplifying complex user journeys can be a differentiator for your business. We support various delegated administration approaches for B2B capabilities, all orchestrated seamlessly through <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">ForgeRock Intelligent Access</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, our comprehensive catalog of global and regional cloud identity provider connectors, integrations with government IDs, customizable consent flows, self-service social identity registration, and a <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/marketplace/">marketplace</a> featuring a wide array of identity verification providers and wallets make us a solid choice.</p>

 We give you ultimate control 

<p>Customizability and extensibility are paramount for large enterprises and their unique use cases. Our solutions offer the flexibility and power required for different <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">deployment models</a>, while our Intelligent Access orchestration (“Trees”) and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/sdk">SDKs</a> simplify integrations for developers. We also provide robust support for integrations with both our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">identity gateway</a> and third-party API gateways.</p>

 The future of digital finance is evolving, and it’s happening just in time 



<p>Over the last few years, the move to digital finance has accelerated. Consumers are adopting emerging financial apps and services, empowering them to take control of their financial health. The same technological leaps that are enhancing payments, financial management and banking are also changing lending for the better, and they couldn’t have come at a more opportune time. </p>



<p>That’s because consumers are feeling the impact of economic uncertainty and worry about the effect that it may have on them. In a 2023 survey, Mastercard spoke to 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the U.K., Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences. &nbsp;</p>



<p> Over 89% of respondents say that they’ve been negatively affected by economic uncertainty. &nbsp;</p>







<p>At the same time, whether they’re making big purchases like homes or handling everyday needs like transportation or food, consumers worry that they won’t be able to borrow what they need. &nbsp;</p>







<p>Open banking data can help consumers get to the bottom of these challenges.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, open banking allows consumers to permission access to their bank account, allowing lenders to augment their credit decisioning models with real time information that gives a better view of the consumer’s ability to repay a loan.&nbsp;That’s important because 95% of those who have been denied a loan in the past two years want more insights into the lending process. People are willing to share secure access to their bank account data, if it means better interest rates, instant approval for a loan, improved chances of being approved for a credit card or to secure an increase in the limit on a credit card.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lenders benefit, too. By augmenting traditional credit models with open banking, they can improve operational efficiencies, lower costs and create innovative new lending models that can give consumers the credit they deserve, when they need it.  &nbsp;</p>



 The world is going digital 



<p>The data revealed in Mastercard’s Lend Report shows global consumer support for a more transparent, digital-first approach to lending. Read more about the future of lending in Mastercard’s Lend Report <a href="https://www.finicity.com/future-of-lending-report/">here</a>.</p>

				  Decentralized identity technology is increasingly being adopted to quickly and securely share data in the private and public sectors. With widespread interest in the technology’s ability to create verifiable data and streamline processes, the question of how you create a solution has never been more important.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>More people are interested in verifiable credentials and decentralized ecosystems than ever— which is awesome to see! But as new people enter this space the amount of information and the options available can be complicated and overwhelming. For those seeking to learn about the technology, the fundamental concepts, and how it works, Indicio recommends this quick, but comprehensive, <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">Beginner’s Guide</a>. But once you have decided that a decentralized solution is what you want for your organization, there are several things to consider when it comes to actually making a purchase.</p>
<p>Vendor / Platform lock-in</p>
<p>Being locked into one vendor or platform can have downstream consequences: surprise costs, slow responses to adding new competitive features, and the risk that should something happen to the vendor, your platform suddenly becomes unsupported. In today’s business world, vendor lock-in is often seen as unavoidable for some things; for example, many companies are reliant on Microsoft for their entire office suite and the licenses they can provide. But it simply doesn’t need to be like this for your decentralized identity solution — and shouldn’t be. The space is new and growing so fast that it doesn’t make sense to tie your hands to a proprietary solution from a particular provider.</p>
<p>Instead, do as we do: Indicio builds on open-source technologies whenever possible. For example the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven™</a> line of products are built on the open-source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy">Hypereledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries</a> codebases. Open source gives you freedom: freedom to build what you need to succeed, freedom to add what you need when you need it to meet opportunities, and most importantly — freedom to walk away.</p>
<p>Open source codebases incubate innovation and resilience: the more people using the code, the more it is tested, the better it becomes, and the quicker it evolves. However, do note that open source comes in two flavors: free and supported. Many companies opt for a supported solution (e.g., the Red Hat model), which saves their developer teams from having to climb the learning curve of unfamiliar codebases and frees them to focus on business solutions. Indicio provides supported open-source product solutions, both pre-designed and customized, so that you get to implementation as quickly as possible and have all the technical support you need to grow.</p>
<p>Do they sell all the pieces you need?</p>
<p>There are four major pieces of technology that form a working decentralized ecosystem for the secure exchange of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<p>Issuer agent— for creating and issuing a credential</p>
<p>Mobile wallet — for holding and presenting a credential</p>
<p>Mediator — coordinates messages between wallets on mobile devices and verifiers / issuers</p>
<p>Verifier agent — for verifying the credential</p>
<p>Not all vendors sell these as a package. Some only have one or some of the parts to create the functionality you want. It is important to understand exactly what it is that you’re getting. Just being able to download a mobile wallet will not give you the ability to create your own credentials.</p>
<p>Indicio offers each of these components separately if you want, (learn more about our mobile wallet <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a>, or play with <a href="https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/">one of our mediators</a>), but if you are seeking to implement a complete ecosystem, it is better to buy a complete ecosystem. That way, you get everything “in the box,” so to speak, and you know that everything will work together smoothly. This was the impetus for Indicio to create Proven as a complete, off-the-shelf ecosystem.</p>
<p>Interoperability</p>
<p>The world will never operate completely on one system. The more credential formats your decentralized solution supports, the more people will be able to use and benefit from it. Building this kind of support into solutions takes time and money, so not all vendors provide it or plan to do so, and instead pick a format in hope that it will become the format that catches on and everyone uses.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how this can go wrong, building special integrations for Internet Explorer would have looked like the smart move in 2009 when it had <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/worldwide/2009">65% of internet browser market share</a>, but today, even after a rebrand to Edge, it is now <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">hovering at just over 5%</a>, and only 5% of customers being able to use your integration would be severely limiting to your business.</p>
<p>Indicio is committed to building as much interoperability into our solutions as possible, commonly using a variety of verifiable credential formats including Anoncreds, SD JWTs, JSON-LD, JSON-LD BBS+, Open Badges 3.0, W3C, and Mobile Drivers Licence. Our team has years of experience implementing successful solutions, and we can advise you on the credential types that best meet your use case’s requirements, or help build a custom solution using an additional credential type your organization needs.</p>
<p>Network</p>
<p>You’ll need to host your verifiable credential solution on a blockchain-based distributed ledger network — or have someone else take responsibility for writing credential data to the ledger. Either way, you’ll want to make sure that the network supporting your solution meets your needs.</p>
<p>A distributed ledger network, typically, consists of several networks: one for developing and testing a solution, one for demonstrating a solution, and a main or production network to support your finished product. There may also be a temp network for stress testing, which gives you the freedom to push your solution to breaking point and easily reset, something better done before going to market.</p>
<p>In all cases, there are several important questions: how much does it cost to use each of these networks (singly or bundled), including how much does it cost to write credentials to the main or production network and, if necessary, revoke them? How much will it cost to scale your solution, and whether “all-you-can-write” packages can simplify payments and deliver significant cost savings in the medium and long term.</p>
<p>Second, what kind of technical support or support packages are provided? If you are new to verifiable credential technology, is there full customer onboarding and operational support for each network? What kind of engineering support is there for solutions that are mission-critical?</p>
<p>You’ll also want to assess the network’s performance by asking for uptime metrics and ask how the network is monitored to ensure that any problems can be quickly addressed. (For example Indicio’s network has a 99.97% uptime)</p>
<p>In terms of resilience, you’ll need to know how many nodes support the network and how extensive their geographic distribution, as some customers, particularly governments, have regulations on where nodes can be hosted.</p>
<p>Governance</p>
<p>What rules will be in place for your decentralized ecosystem? Who will implement these rules and how will they be integrated into the system? While your solution might function from a technical standpoint, its usability in the field depends on governance. When considering a solution or provider, examine how rules such as trust lists for approved credential issuers are implemented. How are credentials verified in near-offline or offline conditions? Governance in decentralized identity often seems complex. It doesn’t need to be.</p>
<p>Indicio developed machine-readable governance to deliver this simplicity. This enables governance rules to be published in a machine-readable format (currently in development as a specification at the Decentralized Identity Foundation), propagated to all participants in a decentralized identity ecosystem, and cached in their software. This enables the governance authority responsible for the use case to quickly implement system-wide rules and rule changes, manage trust lists and provide offline verification. Indicio developed a <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">Governance Editor</a> to simplify creating the governance files. You can try it out <a href="https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/Indicio-tech/governance-editor/tree/main">here.</a></p>
<p>We hope this article gives you a decent starting place when evaluating your options for a decentralized solution. You can never ask too many questions, especially when building something to last. If you have an idea for a decentralized identity ecosystem the Indicio team is ready to answer any questions or help you get started, you can <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out here.</a></p>

<p>Use of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/certificate-solutions/learn/certification-authority-authorization">Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)</a> was mandated for TLS certificates in September 2017. The primary purpose of CAA is to allow the domain owner to authorize specific CA(s) to issue TLS certificates for their domains. It also prevents other CAs from issuing TLS certificates for those domains. CAA limits the risk and scope of certificate issuance to only approved CAs.</p>
<p>When the Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) Requirements were introduced in July 2021, CAA was included with the “issuevmc” record. It was important to have a new record, so TLS CA authorizations would not impact VMC issuance.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/smime-br/">S/MIME Baseline Requirements</a>, there is now a place to provide standard requirements for S/MIME certificate issuance. One goal was to extend CAA to email addresses for the issuance of S/MIME certificates. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9495.html">Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Processing for Email Addresses- RFC 9495</a> has just been published to support this requirement and provide the “issuemail” record to permit CAs to issue S/MIME certificates.</p>
<p>The standard CAA record form for email addresses would look like this:</p>
 
 mail.client.example &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAA 0 issuemail “authority.example” 
 
<p>The “authority.example” identifying domain value would be provided by the CA in their CPS. The Entrust CAA identifying domain is “entrust.net”.</p>
<p>Domain owners are encouraged to use CAA to streamline the CAs that can issue TLS, VMC, or S/MIME certificates for domains. From a risk mitigation point of view, this stops CAs from issuing requests that have not been approved. An unapproved CA request could come from an attacker or could also come from a colleague who is not familiar with your CA selection process.</p>
<p>Note; There has been no CA/Browser Forum ballot to date, so the S/MIME Baseline Requirements have not been updated to require CAA to be checked before issuing S/MIME email certificates. We expect a CAA checking requirement to be added to the S/MIME BRs within the next year.</p>

<p>In the second release cycle of 2023, we have updated our SSO to include Client Credentials Grant. &nbsp;In addition, we have performed several corrections and improvements as well as regular security updates and life-cycle management on the Identity Platform. For full details, please review the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9084600321/Identity+Server+2023.2+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
 Features 
 Client Credentials Grant with OIDC (OpenID Connect) 
<p>In brief, the Client Credential Grant permits an application (or client) the ability to request an access token. This token is used instead of having the application configured with an administrator password, thus being more secure.</p>
<p>Ubisecure’s <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9138405377/Client+Credentials+Grant+reference+-+SSO">Client Credentials Grant</a> implementation supports two key use cases for the flow.</p>
 
 Authorised Access use case, also known as Common flow – the Client’s access token is used to impersonate the client and request resources from other servers or applications. 
 A lessor used, but available within the specification, configuration method is the Single application use case. In this flow a server is using its own credentials to access local resources on the same server, requiring user’s access rights. 
 
 Improved Stability 
<p>Also found in this development cycle are several smaller stability improvements. Memory and cache cleaning improvements will help environments with very long uptimes or very high utilisation for SSO. For CustomerID we have resolved a number of registration work-flow errors that could result in additional manual clean-up requirements of the LDAP directory.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>With the CI running updates continuously for many of the utilised third-party libraries, we have been able to focus on additional security items. We have updated OpenLDAP MDB to 2.5.16, which includes OpenSSL v3 – an essential update as OpenSSL v1 is no longer being maintained. This OpenLDAP update has been backported to IDS 2023.1 release (SSO 9.3, in SSO 9.2.3).</p>
 Improved Information 
<p>Addressing a concern raised by a number of customers, we’ve also reorganised the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9103376399/Change+Log+-+Identity+Platform">Change Log for Identity Server</a>.&nbsp;With this new format, you can quickly see which version of SSO should be grouped with which version of CustomerID and if there have been essential patches to each core application.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>Over the coming winter, we will be focusing on essential improvements around Swedish BankID, namely the support of the required animated QR codes. We’ll also be performing essential life-cycle management updates – we expect you to be able to see these clearly on a new area of the Developer Portal that will help to illustrate the overall system requirements and maintenance for your on-premise environment; note that using our Identity Cloud will ensure that all of the life-cycle management and upgrade requirements are fully managed by Ubisecure’s Operations Team.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>In my presentation at the KuppingerCole's <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution 2023 conference</a> in Frankfurt, entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/beware-of-easy-paths-cre23">"Beware of Easy Paths: The Journey Towards NIS2 Compliance",</a> I focused on the complexities of the revised Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2) issued by the European Union. While I am neither a lawyer nor an auditor (so they might be important peers to talk to on your NIS2-journey), my focus is on the practical implications of this crucial piece of cybersecurity legislation. As a critical component of the EU's cybersecurity strategy, NIS2 extends its influence across various essential sectors, encompassing energy, transport, banking, and health. This directive marks a significant shift in the cybersecurity landscape, setting forth new challenges and requirements for organizations, particularly for medium-sized and large companies, as they strive to align with these evolving regulations.</p>
 Understanding NIS2 
<p>NIS2 is a pivotal piece of legislation issued by the European Union, aimed at fortifying cybersecurity measures across its member states. This directive serves as a cornerstone in the EU's strategy to enhance resilience and response capabilities in the face of growing cyber threats. NIS2 applies broadly within the EU, encompassing a variety of sectors deemed critical for the economy and society. These sectors include energy, transport, banking, health, digital infrastructure, and public administration, among others.</p>
<p>Crucially, NIS2 came into force on January 16, 2023. However, its practical application involves a multi-stage process. First, member states are required to transpose the directive into national law. This aspect underscores the need for harmonization of cybersecurity standards across different jurisdictions while allowing for some degree of customization to address national specifics. Second, the organizations within the scope of NIS2, particularly those categorized under <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80065/kritis-understanding-and-protecting-critical-infrastructure">KRITIS</a> (Critical Infrastructures), are mandated to comply within a 21-month period. This staged approach aims to provide a structured and feasible pathway for entities to adapt and align with the directive's requirements.</p>
 The Scope and Impact of NIS2 
<p>NIS2 significantly expands the framework of cybersecurity obligations compared with its predecessor. It encompasses a wider range of organizations by categorizing them as either "essential" or "important" entities. This distinction is critical, as it brings a greater number of companies under the purview of NIS2, particularly those that were not previously subject to such stringent cybersecurity regulations.</p>
<p>For essential facilities, the level of criticality and obligations is higher. Important institutions, although new to this level of regulatory scrutiny, now also fall under the ambit of NIS2. This expansion significantly broadens the range of affected companies and organizations, moving beyond the traditional sectors of critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Moreover, NIS2 introduces specific thresholds for determining which companies are considered medium-sized or large, making many more companies subject to these regulations. &nbsp;Medium-sized companies are defined as having 50-250 employees and a turnover of €10-50m and/or a balance sheet of less than €43m.&nbsp; Large companies are those with more than 250 employees and a turnover of €50m and/or a balance sheet of €43m. The implications of these thresholds are substantial, especially for medium-sized companies, which may find themselves grappling with a massive tightening of cybersecurity requirements.</p>
 Requirements and Enforcement under NIS2 
<p>NIS2 introduces a blend of specific and generic requirements to ensure comprehensive cybersecurity across various sectors. Article 21 of NIS2, for instance, lists several specific mandates, particularly focusing on risk management, incident response, authentication, and other measures. However, NIS2 also emphasizes adherence to current best practices, certifications, and a generally high and appropriate level of security. This dual approach allows for flexibility while maintaining a baseline of cybersecurity standards.</p>
<p>The enforcement of NIS2 is marked by firm oversight and significant sanctioning power. Supervisory bodies are designated at the national level to monitor and enforce compliance. This includes strengthened supervisory measures ensuring entities' adherence to cybersecurity protocols and the introduction of severe penalties for non-compliance. Cross-border collaboration is a key feature, enhancing cooperation between member states for consistent enforcement. And requirements for transparency and disclosure are stipulated, mandating clear communication regarding cybersecurity incidents and measures. NIS2 encourages initiatives exceeding minimum requirements, fostering a culture of cybersecurity excellence, and promotes public-private partnerships to enhance overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
 Focusing on Compliance: A Tailored Approach 
<p>From KuppingerCole’s perspective, a key aspect of complying with NIS2 is recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, no matter what vendors, consultancies or whoever tells you. Each organization must define and implement NIS2 compliance in a manner that reflects its unique context and challenges. This tailored approach is crucial, considering the diverse range of sectors and company sizes affected by the directive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image: NIS2 - From Initial Assessment to Continual Implementation</p>
<p>Organizations should prioritize a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, as advocated by NIS2. This involves not only identifying and assessing cyber risks unique to their operations but also developing bespoke strategies to mitigate these risks. Compliance, therefore, becomes a dynamic and continuous process, necessitating ongoing adjustments and improvements in line with the evolving cyber threat landscape and organizational changes.</p>
<p>Key areas of focus include risk management, incident reporting, supply chain protection, and cyber hygiene. Each of these areas requires a detailed and customized strategy, taking into account the specific needs and capabilities of the organization. For instance, incident reporting protocols must be efficient yet sensitive to the particular operational context of the business.</p>
 Practical Implementation Strategies 
<p>For practical implementation, especially for SMEs, the focus should be on developing manageable and cost-effective cybersecurity strategies. SMEs often face resource constraints and skill gaps, making it imperative to find solutions that balance cost with effectiveness. Simplifying compliance processes and tailoring strategies to the operational realities of SMEs can significantly aid in meeting NIS2 requirements. Collaboration and community initiatives can also play a pivotal role, allowing SMEs to pool resources and share knowledge to enhance their cybersecurity posture collectively.</p>
<p>In summary, the implementation of NIS2 demands a thoughtful, customized approach, particularly for smaller organizations facing unique challenges in their compliance journey.</p>
 Navigating NIS2 Compliance 
<p>NIS2 marks a significant shift from the conventional checkbox compliance to a more integrated approach, embedding cybersecurity, compliance, and resilience into the very fabric of organizational processes. It prompts a departure from the simplistic, procedural adherence to regulations, focusing instead on a comprehensive assessment of risks. The directive advocates for a customized journey to compliance, one that is not generic but tailored to the specific needs and risk profiles of individual organizations, underscoring the need for a strategic and nuanced application of its mandates.</p>
<p>In addressing NIS2 compliance, it is clear that a uniform solution is not feasible. Each organization must approach compliance in a manner tailored to its unique context. Seeking assistance from a range of professionals, including peers, consultants, analysts, lawyers, and the enforcing bodies is advisable for navigating this complex regulation. Collaboration with these experts can provide the necessary insights for effective compliance strategies.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole Analysts, we focus on offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-nis2-directive-who-what-and-how">realistic strategies for NIS2 compliance</a>. We understand the challenges involved and aim to provide pragmatic solutions, recognizing that each organization's journey towards compliance is distinct.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the path to NIS2 compliance is intricate and requires a bespoke approach, there are <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/advisory">resources</a> available to guide organizations through this process, ensuring a secure and compliant digital environment.</p>

 Sudo digital identities sit at the heart of Sudo Platform 



<p>To empower users to better protect their personal identity online, we’ve created the Sudo digital identity, also simply called a <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>. A Sudo lets your customers interact with other people and organizations while protecting their personal data.</p>



<p>Sudos are at the heart of Sudo Platform, and most Sudo Platform features are built around the Sudo. Your customers can create multiple Sudos by leveraging our Sudo Platform products, protecting them from inadvertently disclosing their personal details.</p>



<p>People already know not to mix their work and personal identities. Sudos take this approach one step further, allowing users to create a different identity for every activity they do. This is called <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a> and it’s a great way to improve safety and security online.</p>



 Sudo Platform offers privacy as a service 



<p>Sudo Platform is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform with a unique focus on privacy.</p>



<p>Your organization can leverage Sudo Platform to rapidly develop and deploy easy-to-use, privacy-first products that interoperate seamlessly and intuitively. Sudo platform capabilities include:</p>



 
 Safe and private browsing including ad and tracker blocking and site reputation services 



 Virtual private network 



 Password management, security, and automation 



 Online commerce protection through virtual cards and compartmentalization 



 Open and encrypted communications including voice/video, messaging, and email 



 Decentralized identity services including identity wallets, verifiable credential services, and passwordless authentication. 
 



<p>We take a privacy-first stance to architecture, design, development and deployment of our products and services to deliver immediate value to organizations that seek to sell privacy and online security to their customers, either as new products or as enhancements to existing offerings.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform is a continually evolving offering as we develop new products and enhance existing services. Common services such as accounts, entitlements and profile management, underpin our offerings.</p>



<p>To find out more, check out <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/how-you-can-use-sudo-platform-digital-identities-and-decentralized-identity-capabilities-to-rapidly-deliver-customer-privacy-solutions/">how you can use Sudo Platform to rapidly deliver customer privacy solutions</a>.</p>



 <br>Sudo Platform combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of SDKs 



Figure 1: Sudo Platform



<p>Sudo Platform is built for developers by developers.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Sudo Platform is a set of scalable hosted services that provide the capabilities to an enterprise developer. You can integrate these hosted services with your systems to provide entitlement, federated single sign-on, and other integrations that allow your existing customers to seamlessly access the Sudo Platform services you want.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform hosted services are also integrated into various third party systems such as cloud providers, telephony carriers, banks, payment processors, blockchains, and more. These hosted services are deployed individually for each of Anonyome’s consumer-facing customers/partners, completely separating them from other customer/partners’ data and services and providing the ability to customize that environment for the individual organization.</p>



<p>Above the hosted services sit SDKs, documentation and sample apps distributed through GitHub which allow Sudo Platform customers to quickly develop applications using Sudo Platform services. This software is open source so you can quickly become productive. All Sudo Platform SDKs are offered in Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript/TypeScript, which means you can freely enhance any of your web, mobile or desktop products that make up your full software suite.</p>



<p>If you’d prefer a faster route to market or lack the internal expertise or capacity to create and deploy applications to end users, we also publish UI kits that enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications that can be quickly branded and delivered to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms. This rapid white label offering is very attractive to organizations that want or need to move quickly.</p>



<p>A UI kit gives you access to libraries of advanced software modules with complex data and graphical flows that go beyond basic Sudo Platform service access. The first library contained in a UI kit is the core library, which provides complex business logic for data management and functional utilities that span one or more of the Sudo Platform services. The second library contained in a UI kit is the UI library, which has widgets, screens and minor user flows that give recommended user experiences for a feature and can be integrated into your application. UI kits are supported across Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript/TypeScript.</p>



<p>An unbranded application (or white label application) allows you to take advantage of fully developed and supported applications for web, mobile and desktop platforms. Our unbranded apps deliver an optimal user experience of Sudo Platform services, and you can add your logo, color palette and other branding requirements. Once complete, you simply add your new apps to your product portfolio for fast deployment and integrate them with your user management and accounting systems.</p>



 Sudo Platform keeps up with the privacy landscape 



<p>We can only achieve privacy if Sudo Platform products and services adapt to the ever-evolving data surveillance landscape. We have built Sudo Platform offerings against enhancement roadmaps and with a philosophy of continuous development so it stays abreast of user needs. Each release incorporates the latest support for all mobile, web and desktop platforms and features regular security updates for packaged software dependencies.</p>



<p>The Sudo Platform GitHub site is shown below. We include our SDKs and sample apps (including source code) to make it easy to leverage the capabilities into your applications.</p>



Figure 2: Sudo Platform GitHub site



<p>The instructions for how to build Sudo Platform capabilities into your applications are included in our documentation site:</p>



Figure 3: Sudo Platform documentation



<p>You can find more information about Sudo Platform in our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/">documentation</a>, open source <a href="https://github.com/sudoplatform">SDKs</a> for mobile, web and desktop, and official <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asudoplatform+sample">sample applications</a>.</p>



 Getting started takes just 4 simple steps 



 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create an account 



<p>Start by creating an account so you can access, configure and integrate Sudo Platform services into your products.</p>



<p>Creating an account is simple. Each Sudo Platform account has two key characteristics:</p>



 
 complete account isolation 



 feature service customization. 
 



<p>Unlike accounts with traditional multi-tenant SaaS companies, Sudo Platform accounts are individual and isolated from others within the system so that core services and data are unique to each deployment. In real terms, this helps to eliminate any risk of information cross-contamination within our internal systems.</p>



<p>Each Sudo Platform account is unique for each customer based on individual need. When you create a Sudo Platform account, your selection of features and any subsequent configuration makes your deployment different from other customers’ deployments on Sudo Platform. This means:</p>



 
 You only pay for what you need. 



 The deployment is implemented against your compliance, data and location requirements. 



 You have clear visibility into what you are developing against. 



 Manage your account with the Sudo Platform management console<br><br>The management console lets you manage your administrative and end users, gain critical insight into the analytics underlying your deployment, and explore ways to enhance your Sudo Platform experience. 
 



<p>Your Sudo Platform management console is a real-time reflection of your deployment. It lets you view and alter the features that back the integrated products and affects how your services interact with Sudo Platform. This means you can easily adapt your customers’ experiences with Sudo Platform features and your existing authentication, subscriptions, billing and entitlements systems.</p>



 2.    Manage your account with the Sudo Platform management console

This means you can easily adapt your customers’ experiences with Sudo Platform features and your existing authentication, subscriptions, billing and entitlements systems.</p>



 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start with a sample app or go straight to SDKs 



<p>Once you have your Sudo Platform account, why not check out what it can do? You can do this via a sample app or jump right into integration with our SDKs.</p>



<p>Using a sample app is the fastest way to see how the Sudo Platform services work and the value they can provide. You can easily explore the technology and imagine the potential for your products, either as an enhancement or brand new offering.</p>



<p>If you dive right into integration with our SDKs, you’ll find they are designed for seamless integration with all your existing and new applications. Each SDK is built to run natively on all supported platforms, so they have the highest chance of compatibility with your applications, independent of the frameworks and architecture you employ.</p>



<p>To integrate with the platform you’re developing on, simply use the appropriate package manager (see table below) and add a dependency to the Sudo Platform SDKs you need for your project. If you need help using one of the listed package managers, refer to its documentation.</p>



PlatformPackage manageriOS (Swift)Cocoapods: https://cocoapods.org/Android (Kotlin)Maven Central: https://search.maven.org/Javascript/Typescriptnpmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/



<p>See our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/getting-started">documentation</a> for more information.</p>



 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain your Sudo Platform application 



<p>Maintaining a Sudo Platform application is an important exercise once you have integrated our SDKs. Everything you need to know each release to plan or automate how you pull in fixes, updates and new features is available in GitHub and the Sudo Platform documentation.</p>



 Changelogs 



<p>Changelogs for all Sudo Platform SDK releases are available in the associated GitHub repository. Within these changelogs there is information about each release, including:</p>



 
 a description of changes that are newly available 



 an indication of SDK versions that are compatibility breaking 



 a description of fixes that are available 



 assets associated with a release. 
 



<p>To access this changelog information for each release, simply go to the appropriate GitHub repository and click the ‘Releases’ link in the right pane:</p>







<p>The next page gives you access to the changelogs associated with each release of the SDK:</p>







 Versioning 



 Rules 



<p>Our versioning adheres to semantic versioning-like rules so integrating up-to-date releases into your CI/CD development pipelines is easy. Introducing Sudo Platform products from official release repositories into your dependency pipeline and adhering to versioning rules ensures constant compatibility with the services in your Sudo Platform deployment.</p>



<p>The rules in Sudo Platform versioning are:</p>



 
 MAJOR version when incompatible API changes are released 



 MINOR version when backwards compatible functionality is released 



 PATCH version when backwards compatible bug fixes are released. 
 



<p>If we deviate from these rules, we will let you know in the documentation as soon as possible so you can adapt.</p>



 Compatibility 



<p>Another important consideration is the compatibility of the version of the SDKs your application uses and the version of the SDKs supported by the services within your Sudo Platform deployment. Ignoring the compatibility of your application’s SDK versions can cause your application to stop functioning correctly or completely.</p>



<p>We have an API that lets you verify the general compatibility of your application against your deployed instance. This API gives you information about the compatibility status of your application and any features that are incompatible. As a result, you can design your application to appropriately respond to this API based on your needs and the overall scenario:</p>



 
 understand the compatibility of an application during development 



 inform a user about the need to update their application installation to a compatible version 



 gracefully disable select functionality of the application based on the nature of the compatibility issue. 
 



<p>You can find specific guidance on each platform’s implementation of this API and some sample code in our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/getting-started#verifying-the-app-compatibility-with-backend-services">documentation</a>.</p>



 Those 4 simple steps achieve 3 big rewards 



 
 You access a unique, comprehensive, performant, scalable, and secure way of introducing privacy-first services and paradigms into your products.<br><br> 



 You get the services and development building blocks you need to build solutions that meet your users’ demands quickly, seamlessly and with future vision.<br><br> 



 You deploy cutting-edge capabilities across communication, collaboration and commerce, and integrate them into your products and processes so you can:
 
 enhance your users’ privacy 



 fill gaps in your product portfolio 



 help mitigate the ever-increasing threat of data surveillance.

<p>To act in the world we must first make sense of it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the world is complex, containing an amount of information exceeding the processing capacity of any individual or group. Adequate sensemaking in the context of complexity and info-abundance therefore requires the ability to process and analyse data. </p><p>We refer to this capability as data-driven sensemaking.</p><p>Yet, today the means for data-driven sensemaking are unevenly distributed. In our essay, <a href="https://www.culturehack.io/issues/issue-02-territories-of-transition/data-commoning-as-a-territory-of-transition/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Politics of Data: Data Commoning as a Territory of Transition</a>, we described how data is shaping the landscape of power, perpetuating and amplifying asymmetries. Unsurprisingly, the principal beneficiaries are large corporations and state actors with the financial and technical resources required to undertake data collection, processing and analysis at scale. As with ‘natural resources’ and ‘labour’, the dominant economic and cultural logics of today regard data as another resource to be extracted, siloed and abused in service of narrow objectives and/or for the benefit of a few.</p><p>While data alone cannot orient us, it can help to reveal new possibilities and trajectories. Yet, data only realises its potential as a coordinative aid if it is able to flow freely through our digital territories. Practices of data sharing are important — surely — but data must also be capable of transmutation; of undergoing a kind of alchemical process of reconfiguration and recombination in the midst of varying contexts. This conception regards data — or information — as a living process rather than a static object or resource. Data is made more contextually relevant when the logics and infrastructure we employ to generate, channel and transform data support these kinds of evolutionary dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this series of posts and the technical interventions described, we are seeking to understand and embody this conception of data as a living process, and to articulate interventions intended to help unlock data toward greater service to life. In other words, like many in the Holochain ecosystem, we are endeavouring to engage in data commoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we will introduce the technical stack for a data commons, discussing data collection, discovery, and analysis; considering distributed computing and large language models; and proposing an algorithm library for analytic tools. We then go on to discuss the social effects of narrative and to think about how data and sensemaking could be reframed to support a generative future. Finally, in part two of this article series we will dive deeper into knowledge graphs, so don’t forget to read that article as well.</p> The Data Commons Stack <p>The capacity for commoning derives in part from maintained symmetry in power dynamics preventing data from becoming a source of extraction, enclosure, and ultimately tragedy. Consider that, the moment we click 'send' or 'save', our tweets, notes, and messages are expedited to a remote data warehouse controlled by the respective platform provider. Here our data becomes a means by which platforms increase revenue and market dominance rather than as a means for collective sensemaking. The digital spaces where we gather, lauded as the 21st century ‘town squares’ are, in truth, more like vast feudal estates. The conversations occurring within are, in many respects, the property of our digital usurpers rather than the domain of public knowledge.</p><p>Yet we remain hopeful that these power asymmetries can be mitigated — even corrected — given the right cultural and technological conditions. We’ll begin by addressing the technological dimension and speak to the cultural dimension toward the end of this post.&nbsp;</p> Layer Zero <p>Agent-centric, peer-to-peer (P2P) frameworks like <a href="https://holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> support data commoning by providing certain assurances with respect to access, control, and provenance of the data we collectively generate. On the one hand, local-first storage affords us privacy and control with respect to our personal data whilst distributing and validating shared data among peers allows more flexible, selective means of data access. Here, data can be stewarded and evolved in a cooperative manner with reduced risk of extraction and exploitation. With these foundations, it becomes possible to support what we call 'generative information ecosystems': spaces in which information evolves toward greater complexity, relevance, and integration.&nbsp;</p><p>While Holochain's agent-centric architecture and data integrity mechanisms provide essential ingredients toward data sovereignty, it does not automatically grant the capability to discover and derive insights from data. Hence, an initial focus for our team at Arkology Studio is developing a suite of modules for data discovery and analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>For us, important sensemaking occurs in the context of our lived realities; human beings embedded in community and specific bioregions, rather than just the halls of academia and research laboratories.&nbsp;Hence, the hope is that the affordances of open, data-driven sensemaking tools can be matched with the orienting/decision-making capacities of grassroots organisations and communities attending to local challenges. By empowering local actors to share, discover, and draw insights from data, we may see connective tissues expand, and local solutions spread and adapt to new contexts.&nbsp;</p><p>The following diagram offers an initial high-level overview of a ‘data commons stack’, indicating the five functional categories or ‘layers’: collection, storage, discovery, analysis, and knowledge. </p>Figure 1: high-level systems overview of the ‘data commons’ stack<p>While the diagram above depicts a linear progression for illustrative simplicity, in actuality there exists a variety of feedback loops between the many subsystems. Note, for example, that published insights at the knowledge layer may themselves become data points in the data storage layer, to be included in later analyses (this unlocks, for example, interesting possibilities for narrative analysis, which we investigate in part two of this article series). Furthermore, there exists a feedback loop between our understanding of the world and our behaviour in the world. In other words, knowledge can engender change in material reality, which in turn may affect our understanding of said material reality. It is these sorts of feedback loops which reveal the complex, dynamical nature of a data commons and, if supported, enable it to adapt to evolving contexts.</p> Collection <p>Since data-driven sensemaking is impractical without a diversity of data, methods for channelling and/or exposing data from a multitude of sources is paramount. On the one hand, this involves developing standardised, consensual methods for data collection from applications, including IoT devices, traditional web apps, and other Holochain apps: what we term ‘data channels’. Data entering the ecosystem from the ‘outside’ (i.e beyond the data-sovereign membrane) is always mediated through an agent (e.g. a human or IoT device), who submits the contents along with a record containing metadata that can be recognised and validated by other agents (see <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain’s validation rules</a>). In other words, we record the provenance and context associated with any data point. Since other Holochain apps are already operating within their respective data-sovereign membrane, and self-host their own data, participants in those networks may reveal relevant data to the data commons ecosystem for query. As for storing all this data, Holochain already provides us with mechanisms for distributed data storage (see <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain’s DHT</a>), with capacity scaling linearly with the number of peers.&nbsp;</p> Discovery <p>With a data commons, one is presented with the challenge of effective data discovery. Since those who control the map control the territory, it is important to mitigate against monopolies on discovery mechanisms. Google’s search engine dominance engenders a kind of monoculture with respect to the very way we discover new information. Since search/discovery algorithms privilege certain data over others by design, it may be necessary to mitigate against algorithmic monopolies by encouraging a multiplicity of discovery services. Since the data commons is essentially a giant peer-to-peer (P2P) network composed of human and non-human agents, it may be useful to conceptualise these services as ‘personal agents’ who crawl the data commons on our behalf, surfacing data relevant to our needs. Imagine, for example, that you are undertaking interdisciplinary research on a controversial topic and are aware of potential biases. Here, you may be inclined to engage a search agent proficient at discovering diverse/divergent viewpoints. Furthermore, agents may operate on our behalf even when we are not actively engaged in search/discovery. For example, you may initiate an agent to notify you of regional climate events or the latest research results in cancer treatments. Since the way we acquire data is an essential step in data-driven sensemaking, it is important that we have the means to parameterize and personalise data discovery in accordance with our intentions and aspirations.</p> Analysis <p>One of the first and most exciting mechanisms for sense-making that becomes available to participants of the data commons can be conceived as similar to both <a href="https://openpds.media.mit.edu/?ref=blog.holochain.org">SafeAnswers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation?ref=blog.holochain.org">secure-multiparty computation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, ‘safe answers’ refers to the ability to perform computation on user data without revealing the raw data itself. The analyst is responsible for sending an inspectable analysis algorithm to the agent whose data is being processed for insight. This way, all computation is performed locally on the machines where the data is stored (the machine of the agent on a Holochain network). The analyst receives only the return of the algorithm and has no access to the raw data itself.&nbsp;</p><p>One can imagine the unlocking potential of this type of distributed computation when it comes to personal or sensitive data. This is demonstrated by an example pertaining to personal health data. On the one hand, it can be very useful to understand, say, the amount of people in a given area who are predisposed to cancer. The disposition may be informed by genetics, lifestyle, and other factors. In a traditional data relationship between an app user and a company stewarding their data, there is no assurance that the company will not use/sell their data in a compromising way, such as to an insurance firm that may increase the excesses to the user given their predisposition. By running an algorithm on the devices of the users who are being considered in the analysis, it becomes possible to undertake sensitive and important investigations without creating a honeypot of compromising data.&nbsp;</p> Algorithm Library&nbsp; <p>A library of datasets alone is necessary yet insufficient for effective sense-making. Tools are required to effectively traverse and distil the meanings and implications contained within the datasets in order for the data to affect meaningful change in the world. In order to unlock the agentic capacities of groups endeavouring to common around data towards data-driven sensemaking we are proposing a library of open-source algorithms aimed at crowd-sourcing data-science expertise in order to make data-driven sensemaking more accessible to less data-literate folk. By introducing algorithms into the data commons ecosystem, our intuition is that a data commons is not just informed by inert data points, but rather is the interaction of these data points and the actors that engage with them towards distilling an understanding of reality. In this way, it can be useful to think of this project as a praxis for data commoning, more than simply a 'data commons'.</p> Large Language Models <p>The speed of Large Language Model (LLM) development is overwhelming, with a multitude of new tools being released that are changing everything from education, to search engines, to AI assistants. Without dedicating too much of this text to this topic, it is important to indicate the possibilities for organisations and communities to develop specialised agents fine-tuned on the capacities of the data that they are commoning around. In some ways, a generative model trained on a given set of data is a codified narrative; an artificial agent acting on behalf of the semantic patterns that inform it.&nbsp;</p> Narrative Ecosystems &amp; Cultural Evolution <p>The transformative potential of a given technological ecosystem is <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/?ref=blog.holochain.org">limited by the values and ontologies</a> associated with the dominant cultural environment in which their activity is based. Hence, while we think tools that improve our capacities for sensemaking are important — especially when grounded in data-sovereign infrastructure like Holochain — they are not panaceas. Responding to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBoLVvoqVY&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">poly/metacrisis</a> requires a transformation of the dominant culture, not merely technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In light of this, Arkology Studio has been collaborating with <a href="https://culturehack.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Culture Hack Labs</a> to advance a set of tools for narrative research. For Culture Hack Labs, effective system change necessitates understanding the narrative forms and narrative ecologies that perpetuate social and ecological breakdown. Here, <a href="https://www.culturehack.io/curriculum/curriculum/introduction-to-narratives/module-2-introduction-to-narratives-2/?ref=blog.holochain.org">narratives can be understood</a> as “interpretive social structures that frame our experience and function to bring meaning to our everyday reality, guiding our actions and decisions.” In other words, one can transform culture by intervening at the level of narratives.&nbsp;</p><p>The narrative, ‘data as resource’, reflects the tendency of modern, industrialised societies to regard nature — including her living creatures and material output — as something to be exploited for human benefit (or, rather, for those with the means to exploit her first). Through this framing, data is something to accumulate (‘big data’), gatekeep (e.g. academic journals), and exploit (e.g. behaviour profiling to sell ads). Contrast this narrative with ‘data in service to life’ or ‘data as living process’, which invites us to consider data and its associated processes as a fundamentally cooperative dynamic.&nbsp;</p><p>In recognising the power of narratives to guide cultural evolution, we have begun to explore what meaningful narrative interventions could look like in the context of a data commons. In particular, what would it mean to meaningfully shift narrative ecosystems toward more life-affirming frames without necessarily prescribing, in a top-down manner, the frames themselves? Is it conceivable, in other words, that the very insights generated within a data commons might help steer society toward a more generative future?&nbsp;</p> What’s Next? <p>In part two of this series, we investigate this question through a speculative discussion on the ‘knowledge’ layer of the Data Commons Stack. Specifically, we explore how to represent knowledge in a manner that is pluralistic rather than homogenising, and how we may more readily perceive the influence and evolutionary potential of the narratives that live within and amongst us. We propose a toolkit that draws from the knowledge emerging out of cooperative communities and allows the construction of agent/community-centric knowledge graphs; networks of insights built upon a shared node library and structurally arranged to represent the epistemic geometries of their ontological framing.&nbsp;</p><p>Our inquiry also leads us into a discussion on knowledge discovery and the risks of epistemic pluralism; in particular, how we might use open discovery patterns and quantitative measures from Integrated Information Theory to move us toward more integrative frames.</p> Guest Authors <p>This guest post, the first of two articles on data commoning, was written by Ché Coelho and Ross Eyre of Arkology Studio.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arkology/about/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Arkology Studio</a> (‘architecture’ + ‘ecology’) is a transdisciplinary design and software engineering studio whose mission is to support the development of commons-oriented socio-technical interventions for systems change. </p>

			 Gonzalo García Arahuetes is a Back-End Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-garcia-arahuetes/">Gonzalo García Arahuetes</a>, and I was born in Segovia, Spain. I work as a Back-end Developer at Tokeny, although it would have been crazy for me to think of such a job some years ago, since my initial formation had nothing to do with computers. I started Law and Business Administration studies in Madrid but soon changed it for Humanities and moved to Barcelona for my master’s degree. Although I did a lot of research on Literature and Philosophy, I eventually started some courses on Digital Humanities, focused on database maintenance and data management, and this is how I became more and more curious about technology and its ethical and political implications. With that in mind, I started another master’s degree in Web Development and began to study the consequences of blockchain for economies and individuals.</p>
<p>I love keeping those two paths alive, as I regard them as complementary. While my professional career is devoted to web development and tech-related issues, I am still working on a Ph.D. thesis on Peter Sloterdijk’s early work, and I dedicate a great deal of my free time to books, writing, and research.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>I was working for a small start-up as a Full-Stack developer. One day, I saw a job offer from Tokeny for senior developers. I applied, specifying that I was not a senior at all but that I had plenty of curiosity for the blockchain world and was eager for an opportunity like this. Of course, I expected no response, but Luc himself, the CEO, replied! We had a very pleasant meeting, and he told me that all he wanted were ‘smart and motivated people.’ The process took some time because Tokeny was opening its Spanish office in Barcelona, but joining this team was the perfect decision for me.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Luc wanted a team of ‘smart and motivated people,’ and I think that is what he got! Working at Tokeny means sharing time and goals with some of the most fun, skilled, and professional people I have met. On top of that, it is a company committed to remote work, which makes life so much easier for all of us in terms of schedule and location. In a few words, I would say that Tokeny always considers the workers’ necessities in the first place.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life?  
<p>My family is at the top: my wife Yaos and my little Lila, who was born in June. Other than that, I am very passionate about many things: books, films, my guitars, my friends, cooking, sports… In this regard, being passionate about something reveals its ambiguity (for the word ‘passion’ has a very ancient origin, always related to suffering): I love all these things, but often, it is demanding to keep up with them and not end up frustrated or exhausted.</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I am rather cautious when it comes to making long-term plans for my life, not to mention having big dreams about changing the world. I always remember Walt Whitman’s beautiful verses: “The Earth, that is sufficient, I do not want the constellations any nearer, I know they are very well where they are, I know they suffice for those who belong to them.” In my opinion, being focused on big dreams and aims keeps us from noticing that sometimes we are just carried away. Knowing that the tide is dragging you may or may not make a better swimmer out of you, but at least you will take it easy and stop worrying about reaching a certain place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>My personal view is that we are on the verge of mass adoption for blockchain technology. Given that scenario, being part of a company so involved in the transformation of the entire financial industry is a thrilling and adventurous experience. There is so much yet to learn and to witness!</p>

 Stakers can claim DF64 rewards. DF65 runs Nov 23— Nov 30,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 64 (DF64) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 100K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Nov 16, 2023 and ended 12:01am Nov 23. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>“<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa">Predictoor Data Farming</a>” is a new Ocean incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via 37K OCEAN + 100K ROSE (≈$24K USD) in weekly extra sales to Predictoor data feeds [1]. This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF65 is live today, Nov 23. It concludes on Nov 30. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF65  Section 5: Challenge DF Wind-down   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has three substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and earn.<br>– Challenge DF. Accurately predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are four ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), Challenge DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream.

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF65 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.

<p><br>
Northern Block Product Update: Supporting Mote Credential Exchange Protocols and Credential Formats<br><br></p>
 
<p>We’re excited to announce that Northern Block products now support two credential exchange protocols – DIDComm/Aries-based protocol implementations and the newly added OpenID4VC. Additionally, we’ve expanded our support to three credential formats: AnonCreds, JWT, and JSON-LD.</p>
<p>As staunch advocates for open agent technology, which is crucial for digital wallets and achieving digital trust, we’ve consistently integrated DIDComm and various Aries-based implementations (such as ACA-Py, AFJ) into our products. The recent focus on the European Union’s Architectural Reference Framework (ARF) has highlighted the importance of the Open ID for verifiable credential specifications. We’ve embraced these specifications in response to feedback from issuers who appreciate the protocol’s simplicity and the widespread availability of OpenID/oAuth resources, making the issuance of verifiable credentials more streamlined.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide our customers with the flexibility to receive and store their preferred credential format via any protocol. We also strive to enable verifiers to accept a diverse range of credentials and protocols available in the market. Looking ahead, we plan to support the mobile driving license (mDL) standard.</p>
<p>Here’s what we now offer:</p>
 
 
 For Issuers: Our platform now allows issuers to use either DIDComm/Aries or our OpenID4VCI issuer to issue an AnonCred, JWT, or JSON-LD credentials. (Note: our issuance service allows users to issue AnonCreds and JSON-LD through DIDComm, and JSON-LD and JWT through OpenID4VCI) 
 For Holders: Customers using our wallet or wallet SDK can now receive and store in any of the three formats over DIDComm/Aries or OpenID4VC implementations. 
 For Verifiers: Our verifier customers can now consume credentials in their preferred combination of formats and protocols. (Note: our verifier toolkit allows for presentations of AnonCreds and JSON-LD over DIDComm, and JSON-LD and JWT over OpenID4VP) 
 
 
<p>We’re excited to see how these enhancements will empower our users and pave the way for more innovative uses of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Here’s a short video showcasing how our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet can now receive credentials from various protocols:<br><br></p>
 
 
    
 
 
<p><br>Contact us for a demo/conversation – or feel free to test it out yourself. We’re happy to chat with anyone 🙂 –&gt; info@northernblock.io</p>

Join this insightful conversation as they unpack the significance of 1Kosmos’ recent certification by the Kantara Initiative for the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. Watch now:<p></p>
  
<p></p>
 
 
 Robert MacDonald:<p></p>
 
<p>Hi, Rob MacDonald here, vice president of product marketing at 1Kosmos, and welcome to our vlog.</p>
<p>Today, I’ve got Huzefa with us, our co-founder and COO. How you doing today, Huzefa?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Very good, Robert. Very good to see you. It’s been a while.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>It has been a while. I guess the unfortunate thing of working remotely, we don’t get to see each other more often. But, welcome.</p>
<p>Today, we want to talk a little bit about one of our latest announcements. So we just announced a new certification by the Kantara Initiative and it’s for the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. So for those of you that know the acronym, that’s UK D-I-A-T-F. I know you had a lot to do with that so why don’t you tell me a little bit about what that framework, the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework is all about?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>No, absolutely. So the UK Digital Identity Attribute Trust Framework came into existence a few years back and it was a standard that has been designed by the UK government, primarily designed that’s just not for corporations, but for regular citizens where any time if you want to hire somebody, if you’re renting an individual or any kind of a background service they’re providing, which requires a user to be proofed, how do you do it based on standards?</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Okay, right.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>This is a very good development in general because traditionally we’ve all been used to the NIST standard here in the United States. I know it’s been more widely being adopted as well.</p>
<p>Now local governments are creating their own standard for identity proofing. Yeah. So we saw that, we said, you know, our friends at Kantara were the ones who were reviewing and approving vendors who wanted to sign up for the standards. So we went through that process and came through it.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. So are there specific specifications that we’re certified to against that framework?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yes. So there are specifications around how you would proof an individual, what are the different levels that would go with respect to it. And we have subscribed to a level which will require a user to scan one of their digital documents, take a live selfie, and prove that cryptographically that we have a secure credential for a specific user.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>And since UK, how do you make sure that you are keeping the data very secure on our end as well?</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Great. Fair enough. So what does that certification in general say about our platform?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>This is something that we have looked at it just from the inception of the company. Don’t just build technologies, but do it based on standards as well.</p>
<p>I believe our first certification that we signed up for was for the NIST 800-63-3. We are very much into the weeds of the revision four, which is coming out, too. We saw the UK standard that was developed and then we signed up for it. And I don’t want to peel the curtain a lot, but we are involved in a lot of new standards that are coming across the globe as well, right?</p>
<p>So at 1Kosmos, we want to prove that who the individual is behind the device. To do that, you have to effectively proof a user and you have to do that based on standards as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Fair enough. So we continue to add a lot of certifications to our list. We’ve got a whole webpage dedicated to it on our website. We’ve got corporate certifications like ISO and SOC 2. We’ve got product certifications like NIST, FIDO, and iBeta. What does this certification mean to us as an organization?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, we love certifications. We have a lot of time to go through the certifications.</p>
<p>I mean that’s important, right? It’s important because have different geographies, you want to make sure that those users understand that what we are providing, that this particular technology has been vetted, vetted by their local government based on their standards as well. So I think it’s extremely important, specifically in this case for the UK market, that we are providing a digital identity platform that has been proofed, verified and not just a set of capabilities that are available for them to use.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Fair enough. And that kind of leads into my next question. It is probably more important than the last, but what do these certifications mean to our partners? What does it mean to our customers and even future partners and customers of 1Kosmos?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So anybody, so I’m talking specifically with respect to the UK certification that we have, right? If you are an entity in UK, especially if you are in the public service area, and if you have citizens that need to be proofed or even if you’re in the private sector and you are looking to hire individuals and you want to do that based on a company that is subscribing to these standards, a company that can prove those individual users and securely have them provide access to whatever service that they would like, they can sign up with us.</p>
<p>And what we would then allow to do is these individuals have been proved, have been verified based on this particular standard, this is a result of what the proofing is, we would then provide it to that particular service as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Cool. So what is it about our platform that enables us to meet these seemingly pretty stringent guidelines in your opinion?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>I would say that our platform has been very, very modular, right? So anybody who’s new to this particular podcast, we provide a set of different capabilities, identity proofing, using that particular identity to give secure access to a variety of different systems by using user’s biometrics. And the third aspect of it is to create a digital identity wallet, which will allow a user to be in control of their identity and share their attributes to whatever service that they would like.</p>
<p>What this has allowed us to do is that every specific capability, we have pretty modular where if there are certain standards, if there are certain capabilities that we need to prescribe to, it’s fairly easy for us to make that available as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Cool. Okay. So thank you for all that, by the way.</p>
<p>What’s next for 1Kosmos? I mean, like I said earlier, we kind of touched on it briefly, some of the other certifications we have, but what’s next in line for us?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>More certifications.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Continue to update the website, Rob, okay.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>We’re going through FedRAMP right now. Hopefully we will go through that process fairly soon.</p>
<p>I alluded to this earlier, but there are more government-based standards that are coming up and we are looking to prescribe to that. We are looking to get certified against them as well, not just in US and North America or in UK, but we’re talking about Asia and other parts of Europe as well. So just stay tuned, right? These are developments that are happening and we’ll be looking forward to announce them soon.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. Listen, Huzefa, thank you for taking the time to talk to us about the certification today. This is pretty awesome news and I look forward to talking to you about the next one.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Wonderful. Good catching up with you as well, Rob. Thanks.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Talk to you again.</p>

				  Indicio’s Digital Travel Credential streamlines identity verification at border crossing points for a faster and more secure journey.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>Never would I have thought I’d use the word ‘beautiful’ to describe my experience passing through immigration when traveling internationally, but that’s exactly how it felt last week in Aruba. The reason? <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-301989815.html">Aruba’s Happy One Pass (AHOP).</a> I was able to walk through border control without having to take my passport out of my pocket. It was so quick and smooth that I didn’t realize it happened.</p>
<p>With this system, you can actually go from the airplane to the beach in just 30 minutes, completely transforming the typical airport and arrival experience. And lucky travelers to Aruba will begin using the same technology to enter and depart the island nation in March 2024. This is not a federated system that sends information to other third parties and is held by others. Travelers hold their digital passport data just like they hold their physical passports — and there is full consent for data sharing at each step of the process.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. Every traveler must apply for an Embarkation Debarkation card (ED card) to enter Aruba. The night before flying to Aruba, I downloaded the AHOP app on my personal mobile phone using a special invitation sent by the Government of Aruba. Then I used my mobile phone camera to scan my passport and the RFID scanner to collect the information from the chip inside, allowing me to create a Digital Travel Credential (DTC). After taking a selfie, my face was matched and liveness was checked to ensure the passport was actually mine. Then, I sent my DTC, directly to the government of Aruba during my ED Card application process. They used my biometrics and personal information to process my application and send me my approved digital ED card. In other words, the Government of Aruba was able to check my passport and clear me for arrival all while I sat on my couch.</p>
<p>The next day when I landed in Aruba, instead of standing in a long line in the immigration terminal to get my paper documents and passports visually inspected, I headed toward the “AHOP” line, where I was presented with a camera that took my photo. Within seconds, the system had matched my face with the photo I’d sent the night before, verified my immigration status, showed the security officer the match, the green light flashed and I went on my way. It was the easiest immigration system I’d ever encountered.</p>
<p>In adopting this technology, Aruba isn’t just positioning itself as a global leader in digital travel, it is extending the seamless digital experience to everything a tourist might need or want when they visit the island, from hotel check in to booking activities with approved tour operators.</p>
<p>This seamless approach to guest services fully aligns with consumer expectations that anything and everything digital should be quick, contactless, and frictionless. The bonus with the technology used by Aruba is that it does all this while providing travelers with state-of-the-art data privacy and protection.</p>
<p>While this technology will change the experience of travel and tourism, the underlying technological accomplishment — the ability to verify the source of any data and that the data hasn’t been altered — will transform every facet of digital interaction across every sector.</p>
<p>AHOP is a milestone for Indicio, its partner in the air travel sector, SITA, and Aruba. Next stop, the world.</p>

<p>Ensuring the safety of sensitive data and privacy shifts from just a priority to an absolute necessity. Authentication, the gatekeeper of these digital resources, is crucial in this fight against cybercrime.&nbsp; In this article, you will learn what it is, why it’s helpful, how it differs from other types of authentication, and how you could implement it in your organization.</p>
 What is Step-Up Authentication? 
<p>Step Up Authentication is a dynamic form of multi-factor authentication. It works by adjusting the level of security and user verification based on the associated risk of a specific action, transaction, or mobile account.</p>
<p>Different triggers can prompt Step Up Authentication’s activation, like irregular user behavior, access requests from unfamiliar locations or devices, or high-risk transactions accessing sensitive data. Users may initially authenticate via traditional methods (username/password), but Step Up Authentication comes into play as the perceived risk escalates, demanding additional login credentials.</p>
<p>Step Up Authentication uses a hierarchical model adaptive authentication scheme, scaling from simple to complex; it provides the flexibility to apply the optimal level of security based on the perceived threat or the user’s risk profile.</p>
 The Anatomy of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes operation of Step Up Authentication is a balance between risk assessment and corresponding adjustments to the step up authentication work up level. Each transaction or request initiates a process where the system evaluates the risk level and prompts the user for a related step up authentication.</p>
<p>To make these decisions, the system utilizes various risk assessment metrics. These include factors such as the sensitivity of the requested data, the location of the user’s location request, the behavior of the user, and even the time of the request.</p>
<p>Policy management plays a big role here, as it sets the rules and parameters for when and how the system should step up the authentication process. These policies, dictated by the nature of the business and its unique security requirements, ensure that the system remains secure and user-friendly.</p>
 The Evolution of Authentication 
<p>The progression of authentication techniques paints an interesting picture of human ingenuity in the face of evolving threats. Beginning with the humble password, these techniques have developed in response to escalating risks and more sophisticated threat actors.</p>
<p>The initial stage was dominated by password-based authentication systems, a straightforward and user-friendly method, yet not without its weaknesses. Passwords, being susceptible to breaches via techniques like brute-force attacks and phishing, necessitated a more robust system.</p>
<p>Subsequently, security tokens emerged as a new layer of protection. Yet, their physical nature introduced inconvenience and added risk of loss or theft. Later, the advent of biometric authentication marked a significant stride forward against identity theft, tying access to unique human characteristics such as fingerprints or retinal patterns.</p>
<p>The most significant leap in this evolutionary process was the introduction of multi-factor authentication, combining multiple layers of security to create a formidable barrier to unauthorized access to sensitive information.<br>

</p><p>While both Step-Up Authentication,&nbsp; Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Adaptive Authentication serve the goal of improved security, they differ significantly in their approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MFA  involves presenting two or more independent credentials at every step up authentication vs. event. This could include something the user knows (password), something the user has (token), or something the user is (biometrics). MFA’s strength lies in its layered defense, using multiple authentication factors and making it challenging for unauthorized users to gain access even if they compromise one aspect.</p>
<p>Adaptive Authentication employs real-time risk assessments, considering many factors such as device reputation, IP reputation, geolocation, and behavior anomalies. Based on these assessments, Adaptive Authentication may permit, or deny authentication apps, or step up the authentication process.</p>
<p>Step-Up Authentication adjusts its various authentication factors and requirements based on the perceived risk level of a transaction or request. It might begin with a simple or two-factor authentication, such as a password, and add more layers as risk escalates. It offers the flexibility of user-friendly authentication for low-risk actions and robust security for higher-risk operations.</p>
 Viewing vs. Editing Data 
<p>One of the significant features of Step-Up Authentication is its ability to adapt to the nature of the user’s actions. For instance, when a user views data, the authentication process might require only the user’s password or a simple username and password in/password combination. This allows users to perform low-risk actions with minimal friction.</p>
<p>However, when the same user attempts to edit or export sensitive data, the system recognizes the higher risk and steps up the authentication process. This could involve using additional authentication credentials, such as a one-time password, biometric verification, or answering security questions. This dynamic response to requires users based on the action type underlines the adaptability and intelligence of Step-Up Authentication.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication in Practice 
<p>In practice, you’ll encounter Step Up Authentication in different scenarios, Financial institutions often apply it during high-value transactions. Cloud services employ it when users request access to susceptible information. It’s becoming increasingly ubiquitous across digital platforms, from email services to social media networks.</p>
<p>Sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and corporate entities, utilize Step Up Authentication as an essential tool in their security arsenal. It is increasingly recognized as a powerful means to secure sensitive data, protect user identities and stolen credentials, and maintain system integrity.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication Use Cases 
<p>Step-Up Authentication is not just a theory but a reality with practical applications across various digital platforms. For example, take a standard action like transferring funds from a banking app. Users might log in to the app using a username/password or biometric authentication. However, when the user initiates a high-value transfer, the system might request additional identity verification as a one-time password (OTP) sent to the user’s registered mobile number or email.</p>
<p>Another use case can be found within corporate systems; an employee may be able to access common, low-sensitivity resources using a simple password. Still, when attempting to access further sensitive resources, more sensitive information, or administrative controls, the system prompts them to undergo further authentication, such as answering security questions or presenting a physical token.</p>
 The Strengths of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>By assessing its impact, the merits of Step Up Authentication become abundantly clear. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to bolster security, creating a robust defense against a wide array of cyber threats.</p>
<p>But its benefits extend beyond security; it contributes significantly to improving user experience, as the need for rigorous additional authentication factors and measures only arises under elevated risk conditions. This reduces friction and potential frustration in day-to-day user interactions.</p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, Step Up Authentication also aids in meeting regulatory requirements for data breach protection. Moreover, it has become a potent tool in the risk management arsenal, offering an adaptive and responsive approach to data breaches and threat mitigation.</p>
 Pitfalls and Proactive Measures 
<p>Like any system, Step Up Authentication has its potential pitfalls. These include technical implementation challenges, user acceptance, and the ever-present struggle to balance security with ease of use. However, with a strategic approach, these obstacles can be navigated effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proactive problem-solving measures, such as comprehensive user education programs, policy optimization, and ongoing system monitoring and updating, are key to addressing these challenges.&nbsp;</p>
 Security Implications and Concerns in Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Though a significant security improvement, step-Up Authentication has potential risks and vulnerabilities. Understanding these security implications and how they can be mitigated is essential to ensure robust protection against cyber threats.</p>
<p>One potential concern is user acceptance and cooperation. Given its nature, users may need clarification on the changing requirements for authentication. This issue is not just a usability concern but also a security concern, as user non-compliance or bypass attempts can introduce vulnerabilities into the system.</p>
<p>Another concern revolves around the accuracy of risk assessment. The effectiveness of Step-Up Authentication depends primarily on correctly identifying and responding to potential risks. Inaccurate risk assessments can lead to security breaches if high-risk actions are not identified correctly and high-risk resources don’t trigger a step-up in authentication.</p>
<p>The additional security measures used in Step-Up Authentication, like biometrics or security questions, bring potential vulnerabilities. For instance, biometric data can be spoofed, and security questions can often be guessed or discovered through social engineering.</p>
 Mitigation Practices for Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Mitigating these concerns involves several strategies:</p>
 
 Clear communication about how the system works and its necessity can be beneficial to increase user acceptance.&nbsp; 
 User training can also help ensure that users understand the authentication requirements. 
 Refinement of the risk assessment algorithm and learning from past mistakes are critical for improving risk assessment accuracy.&nbsp; 
 Regular auditing and testing can help identify potential weaknesses in the risk assessment process. 
 
<p>As for the vulnerabilities related to additional security measures, it is key to ensure these are implemented with their own security best practices. For instance, biometric data should be stored securely, and liveness detection tools, like <a>BlockID,</a> should be used to prevent spoofing.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Within an organization, inactive user accounts can persist for various reasons, including former employees, service providers, and service accounts associated with products or services. These accounts may remain inactive temporarily or for extended periods. If an account remains inactive for 90 days or more, it is more likely to remain inactive. It’s crucial to periodically review these inactive accounts and eliminate any that are unnecessary. Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews now offers the capability to detect inactive accounts effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Entra ID Governance Access Review feature, it’s possible to identify accounts that have not been actively used to sign into Entra ID, either interactively or non-interactively, for up to 720 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accounts that are left inactive are susceptible to being targeted by cybercriminals for several reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inactive accounts may still use well-known passwords or credentials that have been compromised.&nbsp; 
 Inactive accounts are less likely to have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.&nbsp; 
 Due to their inactivity, these accounts may go unnoticed by advanced security controls in place.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While organizations with a formal JML (Joiners, Movers, and Leavers) process in place can mitigate some of these risks, regular reviews are still essential to ensure that security measures are effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding the standards for monitoring accounts&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-navigator">CIS Control V8 Safe guard 5.3</a> it’s recommended to delete or disable any dormant accounts after a period of 45 days of inactivity, where supported. This is also aligned with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-privileged-access#pa-4-review-and-reconcile-user-access-regularly">Azure Security Benchmark v3 PA-4 Control</a> - Review and reconcile user access regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Moderate Baseline - AC-2(3) Control&nbsp; - <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf">https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Management | Disable Accounts - Disable accounts within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when the accounts: (a) Have expired; (b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual; (c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or (d) Have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period].&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These standards serve as additional confirmation of the importance of monitoring inactive or dormant accounts. Let's proceed to explore how Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews can assist in identifying these inactive accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setting up Entra ID Governance Access Reviews&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that it's essential to review the licensing requirements for Microsoft Entra ID Governance before proceeding. Check out <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-is-generally-available/ba-p/2466932">this blog</a> about Microsoft Entra ID Governance to learn more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set up an access review for inactive accounts, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Log in to Entra as the Identity Governance administrator at <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">https://entra.microsoft.com/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Navigate to Identity Governance and select Access Reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar1 - Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews plane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Select '+ New access review' to proceed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar2 – initiate configuration of new access review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;On the next page, choose 'Teams + Groups' as the review type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar3 – Defining review scope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. For the review scope, choose 'Select Teams + groups.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar4 – Targeting teams and groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Then, visit the link under '+ Select group(s)' and choose the desired group from the list. In this demo, we are using a group that includes all standard users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar5 – Choosing the security group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Select the option 'Inactive users (on tenant level) only' and specify the number of days an account should be inactive; this can range up to 720 days. Once the settings are configured, choose 'Next: Reviews.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar6 – Choosing inactive users as review type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. In the review pages, select the reviewers for the task. You can also configure a multi-stage review process to align with your organization's requirements. Once the review settings are defined, use 'Next: Settings.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar7 – defining reviewers and schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Under the settings page, you can specify what actions should occur upon completion of the review. You can choose to auto-apply results or leave it for manual review. Additionally, you can utilize 'No sign-in within 30 days' data as a decision-making aid. After configuring the settings, use 'Next: Review + Create.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar8 – Post review settings and other advanced settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. On the last page, define a name for the review task and then choose 'Create' to finalize the setup process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar9 – Configuration summary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This completes the setup process for an Access Review targeting inactive accounts. The next step is to review the results of the access review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the review is complete, the assigned reviewers will receive an email notification:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar10 – Access review notification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the review results, reviewers can access details about the users and recommended actions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar11 – Access review results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using the link for the details, reviewers can access additional information:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar12 – Additional information about task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the findings, reviewers can choose to approve or deny access for the identified accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews provide a valuable tool for identifying and managing inactive accounts within the organization. This can be seamlessly integrated into the Just-in-Time (JML) process, ensuring regular reviews to identify and address inactive accounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yuting and Nico are the founders of ZKorum. Yuting earned her Bachelor's degree at NYU Abu Dhabi and her Master's at ESSEC Business School. Nico is a Software Engineer and previously worked on projects that utilized Filecoin. </p><p>Nico is passionate about self-sovereign identity, and when he and Yuting joined forces, they started building this vision of a social network that runs on verifiable and anonymous data. </p><p>They both recognized a big problem with social media today. It's incredibly invasive and full of bots, scams, and disinformation. We cannot trust anyone online, and we have no way to prove that we are who we say we are unless we trust a third party to verify our identities. For example, some apps require you to verify your identity by uploading your ID. But this is very invasive. </p><p>Furthermore, our personal information is being collected and sold online every day by data brokers. In fact, the global data broker market was valued at <a href="https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/report/global-data-broker-market#:~:text=The%20global%20data%20broker%20market,US%24545.431%20billion%20in%202028.">$319 billion</a> in 2021. According to the <a href="https://epic.org/issues/consumer-privacy/data-brokers/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a>, data brokers collect and aggregate numerous types of personal information, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, gender, age, marital status, children, education, profession, income, political preferences, cars, and real estate owned. </p><p>Is there a better solution? How can we verify ourselves without trusting the third-party verifier and keeping our personal information safe?</p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs! A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method or protocol used to demonstrate the authenticity of a statement or the possession of certain knowledge without revealing the actual information or knowledge itself. </p><p>Currently, ZKorum uses zero-knowledge proofs by acting as both the issuer and the verifier of Verifiable Credentials. Most large organizations already own a domain name and distribute unique email addresses to their members. Using this infrastructure, ZKorum can issue the user corresponding Verifiable Credentials, such as "female employee of XYZ Company." In this way, the user can prove her eligibility without revealing any unique identifier. ZKorum's closed-source competitors also rely on email addresses to verify that users indeed belong to those companies, but by being 100% open-source, ZKorum minimizes the trust that users need to put in them. In other words, "Don't trust, verify." Even in the event of a security breach, data would already be anonymized and unlikable to user profiles. &nbsp;</p> ZKorum as a Social Site <p>Yuting and Nico wanted to build an online forum where communities and verified members could create and participate in anonymous polls, surveys, discussions, and votes - a progressive web app where anyone can browse the existing public surveys and view their results.</p>Example Poll (Source: ZKorum)<p>ZKorum strives to create a safe and inclusive space where everyone feels secure and comfortable sharing their experiences and exchanging opinions without fearing backlash. That is why privacy-preserving technology is so important!</p> How is ZKorum using Fission Tech? <p>ZKorum is using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> for passwordless authentication between the client and the server. Since ZKorum took a DID-centric authentication approach using a wallet, they needed cryptographic keys.</p><p>However, ZKorum innovated even further by taking the security and seamlessness of UCAN authentication and combining it with the ease of use of email address verification. A one-time code is used to register a new user and their device, and then every request is signed using the device’s DID. Currently, ZKorum is utilizing the WebCrypto API to store cryptographic secrets in the browser, but eventually, it will switch to passkeys. ZKorum opted to hide the UCAN authentication behind the email address login flow because users are used to it, and they did want to overwhelm folks with technical jargon or multiple steps. ZKorum's end users are not expected to be highly technical users. They might be, but there is no assumption there. The idea is that anyone who can answer surveys on a computer will be able to understand how to use the ZKorum web app.</p> Future Plans <p>Yuting and Nico see ZKorum as a powerful way to protect people's privacy by separating a user's profile from their actions, also known as unlinkability. They want to build an open-source library providing this core feature of unlinkability, making it available for other developers to use across different products of their own.</p><p>ZKorum also actively provides feedback to the EU regulators and builders working on the EU ID Wallet. ZKorum aims to be compatible with official Verifiable Credentials, such as the European Digital Identity.</p><p>Yuting and Nico are also working with the Master's Program at ESSEC Business School in France to issue Verifiable Credentials, which would be a novel way to engage the student body and gather their opinion.</p> <p>If you want to learn more about Zkorum, please visit their <a href="https://zkorum.notion.site/9c3e955c69204a2a82d23dd2e2621a30?v=1d312aa5f20b43a09f95a94ca98b75ac">website</a>.</p>

<p>In a previous blog we introduced <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/digital-certificate-linting/">Digital Certificate Linting</a>. It is interesting how certification authorities (CAs) have deployed certificate linting of public trust certificates without policy requirements from the browsers or the CA/Browser Forum. Linting does not need to be mandated as it naturally helps CAs to be compliant by limiting certificate miss-issuance. This also increases customer service as certificates do not need to be revoked and reissued.</p>
<p>Over a number of years, Entrust has slowly deployed linting. Our first goal was to ensure the linters were not developed by the same team which developed our products. The thought was to minimize the duplication of errors in the policy software and the linting software. We focused on using third party linters for TLS certificates such as cablint and <a href="https://github.com/zmap/zlint">zlint</a>.</p>
<p>Entrust first ran linting against all of our active TLS certificates to find issues and remove errors. We ran post-issuance linting to detect errors, which do not interfere with certificate issuance. When we were happy with the results, we implemented pre-issuance linting.</p>
<p>With pre-issuance linting, if there is a linting error detected a certificate should not be issued. When a pre-certificate is issued for certificate transparency (CT) logging, then the pre-certificate with a linting error will be revoked. The goal of pre-issuance linting is to not miss-issue certificates and provide the details of the error to the team in order to correct the issue.</p>
<p>Although the public certificate linters were designed for TLS certificates, we expanded post-issuance linting to all certificate types. This was done first by only using the non-TLS components of the linters, plus adding other specific components. For each issuing CA, we created a certificate profile, which the CA could issue. This would separate each CA to its certificate type and would narrow down the CA scope to its key usage, extended key usage, permitted key size, hash algorithm, certificate policy, CRL link, etc. We also added in weak key checking, CT logging requirements, and ensured the subject name met the requirements which were validated.</p>
<p>Certificate linting can support the three per cent self-audit requirement from the CA/Browser Forum baseline requirement documents. In fact, since linting is done in an automated fashion, it can be extended to 100 per cent of the certificates. The result is the most extensive and non-subjective self-audit methodology, which may be the primary source of detecting certificate miss-issuance. In the case where a CA miss-issues a certificate which is not detected by linting, the CA may consider updating the linting software to better detect the error in the future. In addition, the linting results and actions can also be provided to the compliance auditor, which shows extensive monitoring and actions when an error is detected.</p>
<p>All CAs issuing publicly trusted certificates should consider certificate linting. Also, CAs which perform linting, but have miss-issued certificates should consider whether linting can be updated to detect the error in the future. Updates to shared linting software will reduce the risk to browser users and the inconvenience to secure server operators.</p>

To us, this recognition is an acknowledgement to our deep understanding of the market, our teams of innovators, and our close collaboration with customers, partners, and industry experts to deliver the products and services needed in the dynamic, digital economy.</p>

<p>We take pride in our history of providing simple and safe access experiences for all identities across any environment and we're thrilled to be recognized as a Leader in this space. And now that ForgeRock has joined forces with Ping Identity — another recognized Leader in the Magic Quadrant for Access Management — we anticipate even greater opportunities to serve customers' needs through broader and deeper product capabilities.</p>

<p>For more information, please download the full <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2023">2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management report</a>.</p>

<p>Ping Identity's PingOne Cloud Platform and ForgeRock Identity Cloud were both named as a Leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management. The two solutions were evaluated independently before Ping Identity and ForgeRock were combined on August 23, 2023.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 ForgeRock Product Capabilities 

<p>ForgeRock Access Management capabilities come together seamlessly through identity administration and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">access orchestration</a>.</p>
	
<p>ForgeRock's identity administration capabilities help our customers connect and manage their identity data in ways that align with their business objectives. For example, our customers can create organizational hierarchies that represent the reality of their specific customers, brands, partners, suppliers, and more. Next, customers can create relationships between users and organizations to best manage different experience and security requirements for each different user population. At runtime, this data is provided as an input to the orchestration flow, which delivers personalized user journeys based on the dynamic data inputs — all from a single platform.</p>
	
<p>Recent <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> enhancements noted by Gartner include:</p>

  <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">New signals for threat detection</a>: Our AI/ML-powered big data architecture ingests data from various sources and converts that data into signals, giving customers fine-grained control over how the signals are weighted for risk, synthesized, and interpreted. Out-of-the-box signals detect anomalous user behavior, suspicious IP addresses, credential stuffing and brute-force attacks, impossible traveler scenarios, and bots. We are bringing rich signals and prevention from the endpoint to the application and building practical features around those signals to ensure they are explainable and usable in real-world scenarios. 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration/capabilities">New flows and connectors to orchestration trees</a>: Intelligent Access (“Trees”) gives customers ultimate control of their user identity experiences through the use of low-code orchestrated identity journeys. We continue to evolve this capability, providing new journeys and nodes (the building blocks of journeys) for common use cases. We also have extended our cloud solution to include Trust Network marketplace nodes for common partner integrations. 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">Passkeys compatibility</a>: We have always been a leader in the passwordless space with early adoption and support of FIDO standards, including WebAuthn. This year, we added support for passkeys, further strengthening our ability to support CIAM and workforce use cases looking to go truly passwordless. 
  ForgeRock and Ping Identity: A Winning Combination 

<p>As we look into the next year, the combination of ForgeRock and Ping Identity will drive further innovation and greater customer value in the access management space. I believe having a unified vision and strategy is a winning combination for customers seeking the best solutions for their often complex needs — and our collective team has years of expertise and diverse backgrounds to help on that journey.</p>

<p>The European Digital Identity (EUDI), a cornerstone of the eIDAS regulation, represents a cross-border digital identity initiative set to revolutionise electronic identification in the EU. Available to all EU citizens, residents, and organisations, EUDI is designed to offer a unified, secure, and efficient method for online identity verification. Central to its functionality is the innovative EUDI Wallet, a sophisticated platform for electronic identification that digitally encapsulates individual identities. This wallet integrates various attributes and credentials, ensuring they are stored and managed with utmost security and respect for privacy. As an integral part of the EU digital identity and trust services framework, EUDI extends beyond the wallet, offering a comprehensive solution for digital identity management across the European Union.</p>
 Why is EUDI Needed? 
<p>Although the majority of countries within the EU have some form of national digital identity solution or eID, only 60% of citizens from 14 member states are able to use their eID in another state (cross-border). That leaves over 150 million people in the EU alone without access to strong cross-border authentication, and with only 14% of public service providers allowing cross-border authentication. Yet, 63% of EU citizens want a single eID for online services across the EU according to the Eurobarometer survey (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU Commission</a>). The EUDI will provide an EU-wide digital identity that will allow for cross-border trust service usage.</p>
 Key features of EUDI 
 User-Centric Control: 
<p>At the heart of the EUDI’s design is user-centric control, aligning with eIDAS principles. It empowers both individuals and businesses to manage their electronic identification and digital identity with autonomy. Users have the discretion to select the information they share, the entities they share it with, and the purposes for which it is used. This feature not only enhances user autonomy but also bolsters privacy protection within the digital ecosystem.</p>
 Interoperability: 
<p>EUDI exemplifies interoperability as envisaged in the EU digital identity framework. It offers a harmonised solution across the EU, enabling seamless cross-border access to digital services. An EUDI issued in any member state is recognised across all others, facilitating service access without the need for redundant verification. This interoperability is a significant step towards realising a cohesive digital Europe.</p>
 Security: 
<p>Security is a paramount feature of the EUDI, incorporating state-of-the-art encryption and authentication mechanisms. These technologies protect against identity theft, fraud, and other cyber threats, making EUDI a reliable and secure tool for electronic identification and online transactions.</p>
 Accessibility: 
<p>The EUDI champions digital inclusion, crafted to be accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities or limited access to technology. This inclusive approach is integral to the EU digital identity and trust services ethos, ensuring equal access to online services across all member states.</p>
 Expandability: 
<p>Designed to be versatile, the EUDI supports a wide array of applications, from basic online authentication to more complex uses like digital licenses and insurance. It even facilitates instant payments using the digital Euro, showcasing its adaptability to various digital identity needs and trust services within the EU framework.</p>
 Benefits of EUDI 
<p>The EUDI will be available for all EU citizens that are eligible for a national ID card and will be recognised across the EU. It will be a secure way to share information with services, allowing users to control how much information they want to share. The EUDI will be operated via digital wallets on mobile phones and other devices and will enable users to identify themselves both online and offline. The EUDI wallets will allow users to store and exchange government-provided data (i.e. name, date of birth and nationality), information provided by trusted private sources, and to use the information as confirmation of the right to reside, work, or study in a certain member state. It ultimately provides a cross-border digital identity that will benefit citizens across the EU.</p>
 Practical Uses of EUDI 
<p>There are a variety of key use cases that the EUDI can be used for, including public service applications and requests, opening bank accounts, tax returns and applications to universities, alongside proof of identity, storing medical prescriptions, and securing transactions. There are some use cases that underpin the development of the EUDI Wallet, to support meeting objectives.</p>
 Practical Example of EUDI Usage 
<p>Currently, opening a bank account involves multiple steps that may involve in-person meetings, signing paperwork and a tedious back and forth if any documents are missing. In addition, any cross-border banking is hampered by the lack of standard document formats, document coverage/accuracy and even simple language barriers. However, with the introduction of the EUDI a user would simply be able to respond to the bank’s request by selecting the required documents that are stored on their EUDI wallet, already in a standard format. These documents will then be sent securely to the bank as verifiable digital documents, for the bank to process and continue with the application.</p>
 The interplay between EUDI pilots and eIDAS Regulation 
<p>After a six-month delay, the EUDI pilots are now starting and will continue well into 2024. Unusually, the actual eIDAS legislation is still being developed at the same time, even as the pilots are running. In addition, there are two further parallel streams: writing of the standards and documenting the reference implementation. All four of these elements: legislation, standards, reference implementation and the pilots, are dependent on each other. The standards must comply with the law, the reference implementation needs to implement the standards, and the pilots should utilise the reference implementation. Ideally, feedback from the pilots should in turn guide the legislative process, closing the circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loop of interdependencies is caused both by the repeated delays in defining the base architecture and by the aggressive “Swiss knife” approach to the EUDI by the European Commission. What is often missed, however, is that the main hurdles regarding the whole EUDI project are not technical, or legal framework but political. The EUDI is designed to be much more than a simple mobile authenticator and therefore it must forge a compromise between 27 nation states from minute technical details to very profound decisions potentially affecting hundreds of millions of people – for example, whether to force every resident to adopt a persistent unique identifier.</p>
 The road to hell is paved with eternal secrets 
<p>When we think of strong digital identities, likely the first thing that we visualise is a unique identifier or a “name tag” that is then linked to a natural person for life. That is indeed one possible solution, but perhaps surprisingly there are alternative designs as well. The 27 EU member states have widely varying approaches. In some member states, one is automatically assigned a persistent unique identifier before leaving the maternity hospital. Elsewhere one will be assigned only in specific circumstances, while finally some member states do not assign such identifiers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On paper, having an identifier can simplify many governmental processes and ease digitalisation. However, its unchanging nature makes it very unwieldy in practice. The identifier will continue to exist, unchanged, for the lifetime of an individual. As the end users are required to use it to identify themselves in both on- and offline transactions, it becomes very challenging to simultaneously keep it secret for their entire lifetimes. The same applies to every private and public organisation who stores or processes it, and sadly it takes just a single data breach to lose control of it forever. In the age of pen and paper perhaps this was deemed a not so omnipresent threat. But as digitalisation marches on and KYC legislation spreads from finance to the hospitality industry and beyond, having copies made of one’s personal documents is turning from an exception to a standard policy. As it stands, the persistence and omnipresent use of the unique identifier leaves the unfortunate victims of identity theft with only bad options: either be on constant lookout for any misuse for life or go through the massive process of changing the identifier (if allowed by national legislation) and then getting every single document from one’s birth certificate to school records to work contracts changed to reflect the new identity.</p>
<p>Nothing is certain until the legislation is finalised, but currently it seems likely that the EUDI will controversially force everyone to adopt such an identifier yet seeks to bypass some of the shortcomings both via the magic of public key cryptography and by optionally allowing the creation of pseudonyms – aliases that only officials are able to link to an individual. For example, there could be a ‘healthcare me’, distinct from a ‘banking me’ and a ‘social media me’. Officials would be able to link all three together, but a cybercriminal or a data breach would be (hopefully) limited to an identity affecting a single sector. Of course, this is not a perfect solution, but it certainly is better than no solution.</p>
<p>Once again it should be emphasised that the 27 member nations have very differing opinions on how to best proceed and marking features as optional – like the pseudonyms mentioned above – is a well-known compromise when the standardising body cannot gather enough support to either include or exclude it from the core standards. Optional features rarely become universal, and worryingly it seems likely that any optional features of the EUDI will not be exceptions to this rule. Any optional features will be adopted by some of the member states, while others will decline to take them into use. This threatens the fragmentation of the whole European digital market from day one… which is exactly how the situation stands after eIDAS version 1, and what the EUDI is seeking to solve.</p>
<p>Controversies around the fundamental design principles highlight both the importance of the whole EUDI project, as well as how politically influenced or even driven any cross-border effort can be. It is wrong to say that international projects would be generally disadvantaged from intense debate though, as having over two dozen interest group opinions and different viewpoints is a tremendous advantage to any undertaking. The varied features and pilots of EUDI would not be possible if a single member state would have to carry all the burden by themselves.</p>

             November 2023   
	 
		 
			 Navigating the Booming Trend of Tokenized T-Bills&nbsp; 
 
<p>In recent weeks, the tokenization of Treasury bills (T-bills) has become a trending and popular topic, with on-chain data from our friends from RWA.xyz (see the chart below) revealing a total value of approximately $750 million and an average yield of 5.24%.&nbsp;This marks a remarkable 700% increase for the year, sparking market enthusiasm. However, it’s worth noting that the actual aggregate value of tokenized real-world assets, including T-bills, exceeds reported figures due to traditional players withholding on-chain data, indicating&nbsp;a larger market size than apparent.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>While it is fascinating to see the surging assets brought on-chain, a fundamental question arises:&nbsp;‘Why tokenize?’&nbsp;If the motivation behind tokenizing T-bills is solely market-driven, without added value, it won’t succeed in attracting traditional issuers and investors into the market.&nbsp;Traditional T-bills are already extremely accessible and liquid&nbsp;for US citizens. Individuals outside the US can easily purchase and sell T-bills ETF via fintechs or distributors.</p>
<p>The true value proposition of tokenized T-bills lies in transferability and interoperability,&nbsp;providing holders with unique utilities and automation beyond the scope of traditional forms. This encompasses the capacity for peer-to-peer transfers with eligible counterparts, trading across diverse platforms, utilizing them as collateral for borrowing, and staking to earn additional yields.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>To access these advantages,&nbsp;issuers need control to enforce compliance at the token level, requiring sophisticated smart contracts. Basic standards like ERC20 and ERC721 (NFT) are inadequate, as they are inherently permissionless, allowing unrestricted transfers. This limits issuers to conducting KYC only during the onboarding and redeeming process, with intermittent actions going uncontrollable by issuers.</p>
<p>Hence, the issuance of tokenized T-bills must adopt&nbsp;permissioned token standards such as ERC3643. This enables tokens to embed data and compliance rules&nbsp;to ensure compliant automation, transfers, and interactions throughout the entire token lifecycle while enabling issuers to obtain controls.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Having successfully supported clients in tokenizing T-bills and money market funds through the ERC3643 standard, we’re here to assist if you’re contemplating a similar issuance with a turnkey and white-label solution.</p>

<p></p><p>It was Friday night in New Orleans, and I was ready to kick off the weekend in true local style with a drink. I ordered my favorite wine on a food delivery app, but before the sale could be finalized, the wine store needed to verify my age. Seamlessly, they connected to my digital <a href="https://lawallet.com/">LA Wallet</a>, and without sharing any extra details, my wallet confirmed I was 21+. Within 30 minutes, I was sipping my wine, in awe of the blend of tradition and cutting-edge technology - technology that I'm fortunate to work on, and also enjoy the convenience of.</p> LA Wallet<a title="Direct link to LA Wallet">​</a> <p>Louisiana leads the way with its fully operational mobile driver's license (mDL) system. In the Big Easy, where I live, we go with the flow - meaning you never know what your day may entail. In such a culture, I've really enjoyed the convience of having things like my driver's license and COVID vaccination cards readily available on a mobile app for whenever I may need them.</p><p>Recognized legally as an equalivalent to physical identification, LA Wallet is my go-to for age-restricted purchases/entry, voting, and (heaven forbid) police encounters.  Because of this, the mDL ensures legal compliance and security while leveraging the convenience and accessibility of mobile technology. They accomplish this by using Verifiable Credentials.</p> Verifiable Credentials<a title="Direct link to Verifiable Credentials">​</a> <p>In the simplest terms, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> are digital versions of traditional documents like driver's licenses, passports, or university degrees. But they're more than just digital copies; they're secured with encryption, making them tamper-evident and instantly verifiable.</p><p>When the store connected to my LA Wallet, it wasn't just pulling up a digital version of my driver's license. Instead, the app used a Verifiable Credential – a piece of digital data that proves certain information about me without revealing everything. In this case, it confirmed that I am over the age of 21. The beauty of this system is in its respect for privacy; it didn't disclose my exact age, or any other personal detail that would be available had I shared my full driver's license.</p><p>Once my age was verified, the vendor allowed the purchase, and the delivery proceeded as planned. The entire process was seamless, fast, and respectful of my privacy. This is particularly interesting in my scenario where there's likely legal responsibilities for the delivery company as well as the wine vendor to verify my age. My mDL is a trusted source that can provide this proof to all of the involved parties without sharing all of my details.</p><p>This experience is a prime example of how Verifiable Credentials can simplify and secure everyday transactions. As we move more into the digital realm, the need for secure, private, and efficient verification methods becomes increasingly crucial. Verifiable Credentials meet these needs by offering a way to share necessary information without over-sharing.</p><p>The use of Verifiable Credentials is set to expand in various sectors, from healthcare to finance. As technology continues to evolve, it's exciting to see how innovations like Verifiable Credentials are making our digital lives more convenient and secure. It's not just about the technology; it's about how it enhances our daily experiences, one verification at a time.</p>

   The blog post discusses Federated Identity and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), comparing the two architectures. Functionally, there's a lot in common. Technically, not so much. Read on to learn more!

<p>Understanding federated identity and how it compares to self-sovereign identity (SSI) requires a basic understanding of when, where, and how digital identities are used online today. There is no “one size fits all,” though passionate proponents of various technologies may beg to differ. Alas, the world is not that simple: Different use cases drive different architectures and prioritize different technologies. That makes for quite a bit of confusion and a rather long blog post.</p>



 Why the confusion? 



<p>One question you might ask is, why is there so much confusion, anyway? The terms don’t look anything alike, so surely they must be entirely different things! Well, no, not at a functional level. (The technology stacks used to support that functionality differ, but we’ll discuss that later.)</p>



<p>First, let’s recognize that not everyone even likes the term SSI. It’s unclear whether digital wallet technologies fall under this category; some people say they do, others don’t. Other people are immediately turned off by how early proponents of SSI focused almost exclusively on blockchain technology. For the sake of this post, know that I’m coming at this from the perspective of SSI as an architecture that encompasses a user-centric focus for digital identity credentials. YMMV.</p>



<p>Both Federated Identity and SSI models support similar (but not wholly overlapping) use cases. For example, both models can support remote identification, authentication, and/or authorization to online services. Both require an entity that holds the source records, issues credentials, and supports the possibility of a third party using those credentials. It’s also possible (but rarely implemented in the Federated Identity model) that the person engaged in the transaction has some control over what exactly is shared with the third party requesting the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more!&nbsp;</p>



 Discovery 



<p>In both models, there is also the requirement that an individual be able to make some choices about what credential they want to use. Within Federated Identity, that means being able to pick the identity provider (IdP) from a list or type an identifier for it into a dialog box. In the SSI model, that means being able to pick from a list of locally stored credentials OR picking the correct container (aka, the digital wallet) used to store the appropriate credentials.</p>



<p>If this sounds like a UX nightmare, it is. Federated identity has been used in production environments for decades, and they still haven’t definitively solved what’s referred to as “the discovery problem.” In the research and education sector, for example, a single relying party (RP) might need to offer a choice of nearly 6,000 IdPs for the user to select from. The SSI model is realizing the same pain now, exacerbated by the desire not to let any third party know more information than they absolutely have to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there is just enough functional similarity to make things interesting when talking about these two architectures. Some might even say that SSI is just another flavor of Federated Identity (note: that way lies madness). Now, let’s talk about some of the differences.</p>



 Federated Identity 



<p>What use cases drive decisions toward one model and not the other? Well, for one thing, it provides the company that operates the IdP control over the authentication process and the information shared during the transaction. In the case of an enterprise organization, that makes a lot of sense. Authentication and authorization in this use case is by, for, and about an individual as they relate to a company. It’s not about the individual’s private information; it’s the data about them as associated with and owned by the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s all a question of functional requirements. The technology stacks, however, are quite different. When talking about federated identity models, protocols like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml">Security Assertion Markup Language</a>&nbsp;(SAML),&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol">OpenID Connect</a>&nbsp;are what describe (and constrain) everything including the claims, the assertions used, the structure of the attributes shared, the way identity provider discovery is handled, and more. A great deal of control is given to both the RP and the IdP, and there is a coarse level of control for the individual (generally in the form of “you can either choose to log in or not, but you aren’t guaranteed control over what information is shared as a result”).</p>



 SSI 



<p>The SSI model is a very different beast in the underlying assumptions, protocols, and architecture used. The most important entity involved in any transaction is the individual, aka the user (not my favorite term, but it’s pretty common in the documentation). The individual decides what information is shared and with whom. In a typical use case, when an individual uses a credential in an SSI model, nothing reports back to the issuing authority that lets them track what the individual is doing with their credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, the individual has discrete control over every bit of information in their credential. In fact, the protocols are being designed to ensure a minimum of information is shared in an identity transaction. For example, when a third party asks for verification that the individual is over 55, all they should get in return is a ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ They should not get the date of birth, home address, a photo, and whether the individual has chosen to donate organs upon death: the information shared when presenting a physical US driver’s license to verify age. Another name for this is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dock.io/post/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a>.</p>



<p>When considering the protocols, SAML (as far as I know) will never properly fit in an SSI world. OAuth and OpenID Connect may, and there’s work in progress to make that happen (check out&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;if you want to know more). Work is also underway regarding the credential itself, most notably the W3C’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/">Verifiable Credential</a>&nbsp;efforts, the&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF’s SD-JWT specification</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ul.com/resources/new-isoiec-standard-electronic-credentials">ISO’s mdocs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 New Solutions 



<p>The good news is that, as one likes to see when it comes to evolving technologies, SSI is helping solve some of the challenges that traditional Federated Identity models weren’t able (or chose not to for reasons that made sense at the time) to support. I already mentioned selective disclosure. SSI models have this as a fundamental requirement of the technology, not just something that an IdP might implement on behalf of its users but rarely under the control of its users. Big privacy win here!</p>



<p>Another possibility in this brave new world is cross-device support. Rather than a password that has to be memorized and/or copied over to multiple devices (for example), a credential that lives on one mobile device can be used in an authentication or authorization process on another device, like a desktop or tablet. (I will note that this may fall under the category of “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.” There will be a LOT of different types of credentials, even identity-focused ones, available to the individual. They are not all designed with authentication in mind.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, when a credential is designed for authentication and authorization AND moves us away from relying on passwords, it is really a Very Good Thing.&nbsp;</p>



 New Problems 



<p>Sign me up! Let’s do it! Rah Rah, go, team!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or, maybe not quite yet, because new challenges must be addressed before people decide to jump on the SSI bandwagon.</p>



<p>For one thing, the UX challenges are pretty significant. The technologies under development to move ahead in an SSI model support more than just identity. They also support payment systems, transportation tickets, library cards, insurance cards, hotel keys, car keys – the list goes on. It’s one thing to compare this model as similar to having all these cards in a physical wallet, but there comes the point where there are too many cards for me to find the right one when I need it. Surely, a computer can search for the one I need, right? Right?</p>



<p>Well, not yet. This is where the privacy considerations make usability that much harder. Credentials are often stored in a digital wallet, and that wallet protects the credentials from any random request. Arguably, the wallet shouldn’t have anything to do with the credentials it holds any more than a physical wallet has anything to do with the cards it holds. Just to make sure we’re maxing out on the potential for complexity here, there may be more than one wallet holding various credentials!&nbsp;</p>



 More New Problems 



<p>Not everyone wants to live in a paternalistic nation-state that assumes people are unlikely to make good choices and protects their population by restricting various freedoms and technical innovations. That said, not everyone wants to live in a completely libertarian environment that leaves individuals responsible for their actions, whether or not the ramifications of those actions are clear. Trying to find the compromise in the middle usually involves some level of transparency and accountability so that it’s possible to verify all parties did the right thing as defined by contract or law.</p>



<p>That’s not too hard in a traditional Federated Identity system. The IdP has logs of transactions. The RP has logs, too. The only entity that (probably) doesn’t have logs is the individual (although the IdP and the RP sometimes make their logs visible to the user). With two out of three parties having info on what happened, cross-checking becomes possible if something goes to court.</p>



<p>However, In an SSI model, the entity that issues the credential knows that it issued it. When it comes to the credentials being used, however, they (in some implementations) don’t know anything – on purpose. The RP (aka, the Verifier) may only know a potentially small subset of information that doesn’t identify the individual at all. Whether the individual (or the device or application holding their credential) has a transaction log is still under debate and may be an implementation detail. Some developers may implement one (and get yelled at regarding the privacy implications), and some may not (and get yelled at for not supporting accountability and transparency).&nbsp;</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>The functionality of Federated Identity and SSI architectures is similar if you tilt your head just right. Both serve to support remote authentication and authorization. Both have one party responsible for creating the digital identity credential, another party expected to consume it, and an individual (and their devices) instigating the transaction in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technical decisions that inform the protocols and subsequent implementations, however, are where the designs quickly divide. While no one wants to support more identity systems than is necessary; the traditional Federated Identity model and the newer SSI architecture are not mutually exclusive. They just focus on solving different problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t help that SSI technologies are very young and under active debate and development. The technology you see right now is not fully baked, and it still needs to grow to solve everything technologists hope it will. Of course, you can wait for that and ask someone to let you know when it’s all resolved. Or, as always, my preferred option: you can get involved in the discussions to ensure you help guide these technologies’ development and deployment.</p>

 Although financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK’s financial services industry, when it comes to crypto, there appears to be confusion over what is and what isn’t allowed, and who the new rules actually apply to. Our Global Head of Crypto and FinTech, Jason Tucker-Feltham explains all. 



 



<p><br>Within just 24 hours of the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a> (FCA) releasing its<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-issues-146-alerts-first-24-hours-new-crypto-marketing-regime#"> financial promotions regime</a> for the crypto industry, it had issued 146 alerts of unregulated crypto firms illegally promoting crypto assets in the UK.</p>



<p>While these startling high numbers could be interpreted as a reflection of the FCA’s commitment to safeguarding consumers and fostering a responsible crypto industry amidst ongoing regulatory developments, it also showcases how unprepared the UK’s crypto industry is. Or, at the very least, how difficult the FCA registration process for crypto firms can be.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a financial promotion? 



<p>According to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/section/21">Section 21</a> of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, a financial promotion refers to “an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, communicated by a person in the course of business.”</p>



<p>In other words, financial promotions are advertisements or other promotional materials used by financial firms to market their products to consumers. Financial promotions can be disseminated via newspapers, mailings, product brochures, social media platforms (remember the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183/"> Kim Kardashian scandal for touting crypto in 2022?</a>), websites, in fact, any medium if they include an invitation or incentive targeting consumer credit activity.</p>



<p>The FCA regulates the conduct of nearly 50,000 firms to ensure the fairness, honesty, and competitiveness of the UK’s financial markets. According to the <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/">FCA Handbook</a>, all financial promotions must be clearly identifiable, accurate, balanced, and not misleading. Promotions must explicitly mention prominent risk warnings and must not contain inappropriate incentives. Since financial promotions by firms can influence a consumer’s decision when choosing a financial product or service, they must comply with specific FCA rules. Firms must also, of course, be registered with the FCA.</p>



<p>The fact that the FCA had to issue so many alerts on the first day of the new regime emphasizes its vigilant approach to crypto asset promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s not only the UK that has measures in place to protect consumers from unregulated entities. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) regulates financial promotions in the US, while in Canada, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency.html">Financial Consumer Agency of Canada</a> protects the rights of consumers of financial products and services.&nbsp;</p>



 Financial promotion punishments. 



<p>So, what punishment awaits the 146 companies that broke the rules on the very first day of the regime? Well, as per the FCA Handbook, anyone committing a financial promotion criminal offense may face up to two years of imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The FCA will assess the severity of the breach to determine the appropriate penalty level, which ranges from Level 1 to Level 5.</p>



<p>Crypto firms in the UK have been aware of the upcoming rules, and the potential repercussions of sending out financial promotions for quite a while. In 2022, there were <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/annual-reports/annual-report-2022-23.pdf">1,882 warnings issued</a>, marking a 34% increase from the previous year. As a result, 8,582 financial promotions were amended or withdrawn, which was 14x more than observed in 2021. Financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK financial services industry.</p>



 Riding the wave of crypto. 



<p>The rise of crypto and <a href="https://crypto.com/university/bull-vs-bear-market-difference">extreme market cycles</a> have resulted in many wondering if they too could benefit financially from investing in crypto assets. Recent reports suggest there are as many as <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/newsroom/press-releases/crypto-wealth-report-2023#:~:text=There%20are%2088%2C200%20crypto%20millionaires,investment%20migration%20specialists%20Henley%20%26%20Partners.">88,200 crypto millionaires</a>, including some fairytale stories of people amassing their wealth by investing very small amounts. However, the sheer number of <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/heres-how-many-crypto-coins-failed-last-year/#:~:text=How%20many%20cryptocurrencies%20have%20failed,to%20fail%20than%20new%20ones.">cryptocurrencies that have ceased to exist</a> is less highlighted, and as a result, many people’s investments have just been completely wiped out. As such, the financial promotions regulation seeks to protect the most vulnerable, especially from influential celebrity endorsements.</p>



<p>In March 2023, the SEC charged eight celebrities, with some of the most notable examples including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/22/sec-sues-celebrities-cryptocurrencies-lindsay-lohan-tron">Lindsay Lohan and Jake Paul</a>, for failing to mention that they were partaking in a paid promotion.</p>



 UK’s proposed crypto regime. 



<p>The addition of crypto to the UK’s financial promotion regime marks a step toward a full <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">crypto regulatory framework</a>. Much like its European equivalent, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> (Markets in Crypto Assets), a core aim of the UK’s proposed crypto regime will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>The UK’s proposed crypto regime is expected to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">take effect</a> in 2024, and crypto firms wishing to operate in the UK must register with the FCA and adhere to its regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government’s proposed <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">changes</a> for crypto firms include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/britain-sets-out-plans-to-regulate-crypto-industry-in-wake-of-ftx-collapse.html">Establishing</a> a world-first system for crypto lending<br>  Introducing new regulations to safeguard consumers from market manipulation<br>  Enforcing a market abuse system for cryptocurrency trading<br>  Requiring crypto exchanges to have clear and detailed requirements for admission criteria<br>  Mandating disclosures for new crypto assets<br>  Offering a 24-hour <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/letter-to-cryptoasset-firms-financial-promotions-regime.pdf">cooling-off</a> period for new investors<br>  Banning referral bonuses  



<p>The FCA will regulate crypto firms under the current <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/finalised-guidance/fg23-3.pdf">promotions</a> law, which is expected to protect consumers from misleading or inappropriate crypto <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/cryptoasset-registration-flowchart.pdf">promotions</a>. The FCA’s rules for marketing crypto assets include the following:</p>



  Advertisements must be transparent, fair, not misleading  



  Crypto asset firms must ensure consumers have the necessary understanding and expertise to invest in crypto<br>  Crypto promotions must establish clear risk warnings  



 Weighing the benefits and drawbacks of the new regulations. 



<p>These new crypto regulations will prevent users from being exposed to unregulated platforms and crypto scams like the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/09/ftx-takes-its-place-among-historys-most-infamous-financial-scandals/">FTX scandal</a>, which involved the collapse of a crypto exchange, in November 2022. The collapse was due to a liquidity crisis that revealed an US$8 billion hole in company accounts.</p>



<p>Of course, a potential drawback of the financial promotions regime is that only firms registered with the FCA or partnered with someone registered by the FCA will be able to operate in the UK, which may pose a barrier to entry for firms. This is because becoming FCA-<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/registering">registered</a> in order to comply with the financial promotions regime could prove costly, not to mention time-consuming. Registering as a crypto asset firm falls into <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/FEES/3/Annex1A.html">Category 6</a> of the FCA’s pricing categories, meaning that firms currently have to pay at least £10,000 to register. The FCA also imposes an annual fee following authorization.</p>



 Promoting crypto in the UK? 



<p>The recent publication of the UK’s revised ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets</a>’ marks a crucial advancement in the nation’s journey towards cryptocurrency regulation. The document, released by HM Treasury, outlines the present regulatory framework for crypto assets, definitions of different kinds of crypto assets, and a proposed policy approach to introducing crypto asset activities under the UK’s regulatory boundaries. As of April 2023, the FCA had registered just <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/business-plans/2023-24">41</a> crypto asset firms under its AML regime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balanced regulation that ensures consumer safety while maintaining an attractive marketplace for crypto firms is crucial, especially to fully realize the UK government’s aims to become a major crypto hub.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, they are also a requirement to be able to comply with FCA requirements. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/"> identity verification solutions</a> work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>We often think about our personal identities when we think of verifiable identifiers and verifiable credentials. We think of things like personal credentials, mobile driver’s licenses, or professional accreditations. But what about using the same tools and principles when it comes to managing the identity of an organization? How do the same tools and principles apply when managing the identity of an organization? Is it easier or more challenging to implement these concepts for organizational identities compared to personal ones? And importantly, what are the implications and impacts of effectively managing organizational identity?</p>
<p>In this podcast conversation with Lance Byrd, we delve into these questions, exploring the nuances and potential of organizational identity in the digital age.</p>
<p>Lance has been closely involved with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/">GLEIF</a>), an initiative born out of the 2008 financial crisis. GLEIF’s primary mission is to foster a transparent global system for identifying legal entities, known as the Legal Entity Identifier (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">LEI</a>). This system is crucial for enhancing transparency in organizational identities, which is essential for effective regulation and risk assessment. More recently, GLEIF has focused on expanding the LEI’s utility by transforming it into a verifiable credential, termed the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">vLEI</a>. This discussion with Lance taps into various use cases, frameworks, and insights from GLEIF, providing a deeper understanding of the complexities and significance of organisational identity.</p>
<p>In our conversation, I was particularly intrigued by Lance’s insights on the contrast between administrative and cryptographic trust. Administrative roots of trust, which are widespread in our daily lives, often lead to persistent cybersecurity challenges. Lance elaborated on how cryptographic roots of trust offer more secure and dependable methods for identity verification. We delved into real-world scenarios, including the recent MGM/Okta cyberattack, to illustrate these concepts.</p>
<p>This discussion was enlightening, and it felt like we could easily spend many more hours exploring this topic. There might be more on this in 2024! I hope you find this podcast episode as engaging and informative as I did.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Lance and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 Differences Between Personal and Organizational Identity: We explored the unique challenges and political concerns surrounding personal identity, contrasting them with the complexities yet seemingly smoother processes in organizational identity. 
 Legal and Privacy Concerns in Identity Management: The discussion highlighted how legal structures and privacy concerns shape the management of both personal and organizational identities, with a special focus on GDPR and its implications. 
 Governance and Trust in Organizational Identity: The conversation shifted to the role of governance and trust in shaping organizational identity, using examples like the EU Banking Authority to illustrate these concepts. 
 Integrity of Signatures and Cybersecurity: We discussed the critical importance of signature integrity in preventing cybersecurity attacks, examining recent incidents like the MGM Okta attack. 
 Security Mechanisms and Key Rotation: The podcast touched upon the importance of security mechanisms like key rotation in enhancing digital security, differentiating it from traditional password changes. 
 The Interplay of Security Features and User Experience: We delved into how user experience and design play a crucial role in the adoption of security technologies, balancing ease of use with robust security measures. 
 Differences in UX Between Consumer and Organizational Contexts: The discussion concluded with an examination of the varying approaches to user experience in consumer versus organizational settings, and the challenges in changing consumer behaviour regarding privacy and security.

<p>We frequently use the word “identity” when we don’t really mean it. We frame digital identity solutions around proving who you are or proving who someone is.</p>
<p>But IRL we rarely want to know who someone else really is (and from the personal perspective, we rarely want to reveal who we really are).</p>
<p>The fact is, we do not routinely ask “Who are you?” not with any seriousness anyway. “Who you are” is just vernacular, or shorthand. And it stands for something that is very different from identity.</p>
<p>In business and administration, we are always much more precise about what we really want to know about the other party.</p>
<p>Two parties always go into a transaction with a clear idea of what they need to know about each other and what they are going to have to prove about themselves.</p>
<p>These are known unknowns. In the case of business applications, the unknowns are defined when the systems are designed (typical examples are usernames, legal names, account numbers, licence numbers, government IDs and device serial numbers). And there are recognised sources or systems from which pertinent information originates, together with conventions and mechanisms for telling if the information is reliable.</p>
<p>In general, “digital identity” should not be the question. When we design a transaction system, we should start by asking What Do We Really Need To Know about each party. And the answer should include the all-important metadata that confirms the information is fit for purpose.</p>

<p>If you were present for CEO Boris Mann's presentation at the PL Summit, you heard the alpha on Everywhere Computer. Yes, that's right. After several years of being deep in the protocol mines, Fission is thrilled to launch our first product! </p>IPVM Protocol | Everywhere Computer | Homestar Mascot<p>We've shared several exciting announcements over the past few months, so let's break them down in full context now.</p><p>IPVM is the open source protocol that powers Everywhere Computer.</p><p>Homestar is the individual node that makes up the network (similar to how IPFS Kubo, Iroh, Nabu, or other implementation nodes make up the IPFS network). It's written in Rust, and is designed for performance and composability.</p><p>Everywhere Computer is Fission's platform: a branded and supported distribution that bundles Homestar + control panel, a function &amp; workflow marketplace, and managed compute resources.</p>Slide from Boris Mann's PL Summit 2023 Presentation Writing Wasm Functions  <p>Today we've got a few sample functions to test the network, with Rust → Wasm being the happy path. We'll have some tooling and examples for JavaScript → Wasm soon.</p><p>Like NPM providing a library of functions that developers use to quickly write applications, Everywhere Computer's directory will lead to re-use of serverless functions. UCAN can be used to gate access to functions, or specific communities or companies can federate their own set of functions for internal usage only, or to share with everyone.</p> Goodbye Cloud, Hello Crowd <p>As an application developer you can take advantage of Everywhere Computer's Wasm functions to replace backend functions in a serverless style. You're not locked into any one cloud provider's serverless stack, and can pick functions from the directory rather than needing to write them from scratch.</p><p>Additionally, not every job needs to go to the cloud. Many jobs can be done locally on an application's clients desktops and browsers. Every compute cycle that gets done locally is one that you don't need to pay for in the cloud.</p><p>When it's time to scale up, you can utilize Everywhere Computer's distributed network to orchestrate jobs along the parameters you've set, allowing it to utilize whichever platforms are most efficient. Everywhere Computer never locks you into any subscription. You pay when you compute, so you never worry about getting locked into one provider. </p><p>This means your job could run on your desktop, Homestar nodes in your community network, or managed compute services from Fission and other compute providers.</p> What's Coming Next - Future Plans <p>Speaking of writing functions and workflows, one of the things we'll be exploring is to fix some of the issues with directories where developers don't get directly compensated even though potentially 10s of millions of applications use their libraries. We will look to support development of high quality, performant, and maintained functions by having compute providers pay the developers who write them.</p><p>Don't have a Wasm-compatible function but still want to connect to Everywhere Computer, taking advantage of its distributed and interoperable network? If your service is <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a>-enabled, you will soon be able to plug it in, introducing new functionality to the entire network. As has always been the plan, UCAN's capabilities model provides a flexible IAM-like backbone that can connect the open web, rather than locked to one cloud provider.</p> <p>We are so excited to share <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> with you. If you'd like to join the early access beta, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfREjmoTBOW2gyUSFypn3omifibvptH0K_IQwtFWiGORU5vAQ/viewform">complete this form</a>. We're looking for enthusiast hackers &amp; node hosts, function writers, and compute providers.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about the underlying IPVM protocol, you can join the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM Working Group</a>.</p>

 <p>Een consument doet op de website een aanvraag voor een lening, en krijgt direct uitsluitsel of de aanvraag geaccepteerd wordt of (nog) niet. Oftewel; volledig STP (Straight Through Processing) accepteren, het kan!</p> 
 <p>Dat was de afdronk van de rondetafel die we organiseerden in samenwerking met iLoan. Het onderwerp: "STP Acceptatie: Hoe bereik je dit in overeenstemming met de regels".</p> 
 <p>In de consumptief krediet sector worden daar snel grote stappen gezet. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van het Keurmerk Private Lease en de VFN gedragscode.</p> 
 <p>Tijdens de rondetafel deelden we met 20+ experts van de grootste consumptief krediet- en private lease-organisaties in Nederland tips, ervaringen en inzichten die we samen met <a href="https://www.iloan.nl/">iLoan</a> en klanten zoals <a href="https://ockto.eu/kennisbank/praktijkcase-toyota-louwman-financial-services">Toyota Louwman Financial Services</a> hebben opgedaan.</p> 
  10 inzichten over STP accepteren  
 <br> 
   
   Volledig STP werken is mogelijk - voor zowel private lease als huurkoop/consumptief krediet.<br><br>  
   100% STP betekent ruim 300 businessrules die akkoord zijn; op basis van Keurmerk Private Lease of de VFN leennormen.<br><br>  
   Een lager percentage STP betekent nog steeds veel efficiency omdat de Loan Officer/Acceptant nog maar op enkel van de ruim 300 checks een oordeel hoeft te geven (in plaats van op allemaal).  
   De normen geven nog een behoorlijke interpretatieruimte; enerzijds een kans, anderzijds ook onderwerp van in- en externe discussie.<br><br>  
   Zorg dat je 'audit trail' op orde is: doe A/B-testing met een x-aantal dossiers waarbij je de consument eerst accepteert op basis van documenten, en vervolgens met (enkel) brondata &amp; banktransacties.<br><br>  
   Gebruik die testen om business rules te finetunen, om interne goedkeuring te krijgen én een goedkeurend knikje van de toezichthouder.<br><br>  
   Volume en continue verbeteren is key: dit spel krijg je niet op orde met tientallen dossiers. Er moet veel volume/data door het proces omdat je dan onderscheid zult zien in de verscheidene 'persona's': een groep die makkelijk als STP is te definiëren, kansrijke 'oranje' aanvragen en de 'hard-rode' gevallen. Met continu verbeteren stel je doorlopend de engine bij, en zorg je ook voor draagvalk bij de loan officers/acceptanten.<br><br>  
   De loan officers/acceptanten zijn wellicht wel de belangrijkste stakeholders: zij moeten vertrouwen krijgen in het digitale proces en ook vertrouwen dat (bijvoorbeeld) 296 businessrules al automatisch gecontroleerd zijn en zij enkel de nog resterende 4 oranje velden checken. Bezuinigen op FTE kan een doel zijn, maar veel partijen focussen juist op STP van de massa om de loan officers/acceptanten vooral in te zetten op enkel de oranje posten én om meer volume aan te kunnen zonder afhankelijkheid van meer handen.<br><br>  
   Er is sterke behoefte aan een ketenoplossing zoals bijvoorbeeld gebruikt wordt in de hypotheeksector (<a href="https://ockto.eu/ockto-brondata-service">Ockto Brondata Service</a>): adviseur/dealer laat een Ockto sessie doen, Ockto slaat deze max. 90 dagen op, kredietverstrekker krijgt sleutel mee bij de aanvraag en kan met eigen datafilter toegang krijgen tot de initiële brondataset van de betreffende consument. <br>Er zijn ontwikkelingen op dit gebied met diverse partijen.<br><br>  
   En last but not least: er blijkt veel behoefte te zijn om periodiek gezamenlijk te sparren over dit onderwerp. Als ketenpartners gezamenlijk tot oplossingen komen op gedeelde uitdagingen, dan is dat winst voor iedereen én hoeft het concurrentieel voor- en nadeel daar niet meer over te gaan. Plus kunnen er in de normenkaders ook sneller verbeteringen worden doorgevoerd.

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees to your IT systems is like an intricate dance — it can either be a graceful waltz or an out-of-sync electric slide. In this post, we’ll talk about four potential trip-ups when thinking about employee access management. We’ll also show you practical steps you can take today to streamline onboarding and offboarding. Let’s take it for a spin!&nbsp;</p>
 Using a tool that’s too big (or too small) 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Imagine trying to dance the tango in tap shoes or attempting a waltz in hiking boots. Similarly, using tools that are either too complex or too basic can throw off the entire rhythm of your onboarding and offboarding dance.</p>
<p>With advanced providers like Okta, for example, you have to configure SAML, SCIM, and JIT to authenticate and manage users. This is known as <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">the SSO tax</a> and can mean a lot of work on technology that you might not really need yet. On the other hand, people who try to manage the process with Jira tickets or Notion/Docs, often forget to track and update things.</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Find a tool that’s your perfect dance partner — one that adapts to your rhythm by helping you accomplish what you need to get done today and grows with you. Instead of taking an over-comprehensive approach to SSO that may overwhelm customers and inflate costs, focus on the tasks you face today — the stuff you just need to work and to be secure. And with the right tool, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>, which will help you scale as your business expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. It’s also free for now (<a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">find out why</a>).</p>
 Trying to do it all yourself 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Picture a solo dancer trying to cover the entire stage – it might look impressive, but the risk of exhaustion and missteps is high. If you’re the Google Admin for your small startup or company, odds are you’re an overachiever, but stretching yourself too thin can have negative effects on your work and your health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Enter your dance ensemble – your application administrators. Delegating tasks during the onboarding and offboarding performance lightens the load and ensures a smoother routine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Onboard, you can assign an admin to each app your company uses, then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper admins. We also help you empower employees to initiate requests for new application access, which can also be routed to the proper application administrator.</p>
<p>In this way, automation becomes your dance partner, stepping in to handle repetitive tasks while you take center stage. Things like customizable templates, task assignments, and email notification not only help you save time but also minimize the chances of errors.&nbsp;</p>
 Putting off best practices until “later”&nbsp; 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Delaying the incorporation of best practices is akin to attempting a complicated dance routine without rehearsal – it leads to chaos and missteps. Maybe it’s too expensive to manage right now — time or budget wise — but what you end up with is a messy company footprint and opening yourself to security risks.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/right-sized-onboarding-and-offboarding-free-for-the-first-100-signups/">Onboarding and offboarding tools have overlooked the middle of the marke</a>t. There are plenty of smaller businesses that want to easily manage their processes now while setting up good practices for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>We created YeshID Onboard because we saw that gap. Specifically for 50-250 people, Onboard provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 Only focusing on onboarding, not offboarding 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. And focusing solely on onboarding is like nailing the first half of a dance and forgetting the finale. Onboarding is about efficiency, but offboarding is both a security and compliance requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. This is another area where your Product Administrators can play back-up dancers, ensuring a seamless transition.&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s dance 
<p>In the dance of onboarding and offboarding, perfecting each step is essential for a harmonious performance. Choose tools that dance to your rhythm, build a team of Product Administrators as your dance ensemble, kick off best practices from the first note, and never forget the importance of the grand finale – offboarding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID Onboard is your dance instructor for small to medium-sized businesses, offering a strategic approach to identity and access management.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: On this episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity we are joined by Gautam Hazari, from Sekura.ID as we discuss what is the missing Identity layer of the Internet. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hello and thank you for joining us, a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Today’s guest is Gautam Hazari. He is a mobile identity guru, a technology enthusiast, artificial intelligence expert and futurist. And he is the CTO of Sekura.id, the global leader in mobile identity services. Gautam led the implementation of the mobile identity initiative Mobile Connect for around 60 mobile operators across 30 countries. He has also been an advisor to startups in Digital Identity, healthcare, the Internet of Things and fraud and security management. Hello, Gautam.</p>
<p>Gautam Hazari: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good, happy to have you here in the show.</p>
<p>Gautam: My pleasure. Thanks.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s going to be super interesting. Now, we are focusing on mobile – mobile initiatives, like the one you are working with, can help us to solve the identity problems we usually discuss in this show.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself. So, if you can tell us your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. Thanks, Oscar. I have been in the identity space for quite some time now. And it started in the telecom world and that’s why I talk about mobile identity a lot. So I spent many years of my life in the telecom, so I worked with the Vodafone group for nearly 14, 15 years. What I realised is that there is one thing that the mobile operators have done quite efficiently is solving what I call the identity crisis of the internet. I started to talk about it quite passionately in different forms.</p>
<p>And in 2013, end of 2013, GSMA approached me. GSMA as you know is the GSM Association which is the trade organisation for the mobile operators. So the GSMA board was discussing that there were some assets within the mobile operators which can actually help in solving the identity crisis in the internet. Then they approached me that, “Hey, you were talking about this identity thing for quite some time, do you want to come and join?” And that’s when I joined GSMA to do the initiative for mobile operators to solve the identity crisis of the internet.</p>
<p>Then I led the technology for what was known and still known as Mobile Connect Initiative. I was the Chief Architect for Mobile Connect. And then me and my team created the reference architecture, the specification. And then of course, that’s not enough, so I went around the world, worked with the mobile operators to implement it as well. You know, at that time, there were around 62 mobile operators around the world who implemented it. And they did very passionately and this is where I met some of the founders, Mark and Keiron, in GSMA, working with the same team. And then I’m taking that journey forward in a much more accelerated and commercial way in Sekura.id.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Well, definitely a lot of your journey is in identity already and mostly in mobile, as you said. Before we start going to what you are doing in Sekura.id and we definitely want to hear more about that. I know that you have a special experience which is you have even a TEDx talk. So if you can tell us a bit of that experience.</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah. Thanks, Oscar. It has been a fascinating experience actually, while preparing for the TEDx talk and also after that. So I was invited to do this TEDx talk to share my vision and dream of a world without passwords. I have been talking about these things passionately and that’s kind of my personal journey has been as well.</p>
<p>So, I had a lot of learning, you have to compact all that you want to talk within 18 minutes and that’s very interesting, right? If you have a free floating, I mean I’m really, really passionate about this identity thing, I can keep talking for days. But if you need to give your message within 18 minutes that’s quite interesting. So I learned how to deliver the message in that concise way.</p>
<p>And after delivering that, and once the TED organisation published the video in their YouTube. Interestingly, they didn’t actually remove any part of that, generally they do some editing but they didn’t do that for me. I’m really thankful to TED on that. So it happened end of last year. It’s been just one year completed and it has been viewed more than 157,000 times. And I have been receiving some very, very interesting messages from all around the world. From identity enthusiasts to security specialist, and also, from general public as well, saying that awareness is important. And we are having some inertia, right? We have been using passwords since, you know, 1961 actually, even before the internet was invented in 1989. But we don’t actually think that we are actually using it, and the complication that it brings too. I have been fortunate enough to hear lots of personal stories as well. These viewers, they have been sharing their personal stories related to passwords, and discussing what is the solution that can actually solve this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it has been a fascinating experience and I’m really, really thankful for all the viewers who have been watching it and also most importantly, interacting with it and sharing their stories.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Yeah, I also watched and as you said, the way you explained also definitely appeals to the general audience which is of course what mostly TEDx is about, reaching wider audiences. So it’s definitely a good job you have done there. And I am happy to hear also that there have been a lot of conversation because that’s also important that people not only hear the stories or the ideas but also get involved in, spreading those problems, sharing their own pains, et cetera.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: I also know that you have written, of course, you write blogs, particularly, I read the you talk about the missing identity layer of the internet, missing identity layer of the internet. Could you tell us what is that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. I mean it’s extremely important that we acknowledge and realise that. Let me go back to when the internet was invented, right? Let’s face it, the internet was never designed to identify the human users. It was designed to identify the computers, right? That’s why there are IP addresses. Fortunately, or unfortunately, we humans don’t have IP addresses.</p>
<p>So, in the initial days of the internet, if you remember, all we used to do in the internet was browsing, right? We used to browse AOL, we used to browse Yahoo, different stories within Yahoo. So, it did not matter if for me, Gautam, is browsing AOL or Yahoo, or it’s Oscar browsing, or there’s fraudster who is browsing, right?&nbsp; Because all we did was browsing the internet. Yes, the returning user needed to be identified, not as Oscar or Gautam but whoever was browsing, right? So that’s why cookies were invented just to provide a continuity of the experience, right?</p>
<p>But then we started to do interesting things on the internet. We started to do commerce on the internet. We started to look for things on eBay and started to pay for those things. We started to do banking on the internet. We started to interact in the social media in the internet. And then it did matter whether it’s me, Gautam, doing that commerce transaction, whether it’s me, Gautam, who is doing that banking transaction or it’s you, Oscar, or it’s the fraudster. Or, in the current days, if it is that AI chatbot who is doing that transaction, right?</p>
<p>Internet was not designed to do that. Internet did not have that identity layer. So what did we do? We created a trustless model. So, if I want to pay for some things that I found on eBay, or if I want to do a banking transaction, my bank will say, “Hey, you cannot do that, because I don’t trust you. First, I’m challenging you to prove that you are Gautam.” That’s what we created, because the internet didn’t have that identity layer.</p>
<p>So how did that challenge happen? And they initially did this, this challenge happened in the form of user ID and password, right? And again, we all aware of all the complications related to password from convenience to security, right? Then we said, “Hey, passwords are not enough. Let’s add other things.” So, we started to talk about MFA, Multi-factor authentication, we added SMS OTP, right? And again, OTP, the last P is about password, right? Just changing the acronym doesn’t change the problem.</p>
<p>But then again, they said, “OK, maybe that’s not enough. Let’s add the biometrics on top.” But again conceptually what we are doing is, we are creating a trustless model where these services are challenging me and the human user to identify myself, right? And whenever the human user is involving in providing a response to the challenge, for example in form of I need to type back the password, or I need to provide back the OTP, however I give, whether by typing back the OTP or some auto read happens. Or even if I do this, let’s say, biometrics in the form of facial recognition and so on, I, as a user, is the weakest link in the chain. I do something wrong, which is perfectly fine because me, as a user, is not a security architect. As a normal user, I am not aware of all those security complications that can go away, right? And that’s where all the problems that you have seen and again, why? Because the internet was not designed to identify this human user. Internet never have the identity layer. It still doesn’t have.</p>
<p>But we almost ignored the fact that almost at a similar time, there was a parallel internet that was getting created. So, as you know, I’m actually using the world wide web as synonym to internet, so when I say internet, it’s actually the world wide web, right? So, 1989, this wed, world wide web or internet as we call it was invented. In 1991, there was a parallel internet that was created. And we never call it the internet, we call it the mobile network, right? The first SIM-based GSM mobile network was used in 1991. And that parallel internet worked completely differently.</p>
<p>So, as we discussed, in the traditional internet, if I want to do any interaction, where I, as a human user, needs to be identified, I’ll be challenged, right? My bank will challenge me, my social media will challenge me, my e-commerce provider will challenge me, even my grocery store, online store will challenge me, right? But this parallel internet, which we call mobile network, worked completely differently, still works differently.</p>
<p>If I need to make a phone call, receive a phone call, send an SMS, receive an SMS, it doesn’t challenge me. My mobile network doesn’t say that “Hey, I don’t trust you. First, you prove that you are Gautam, then only you can make a phone call.” It doesn’t work that way. It just knows that it’s me, who is Gautam. So how did they do that? They actually created this identity layer. They actually created a mechanism which identifies this human user from day one, since 1991.</p>
<p>But we know this. How did they do that? They did that using this small gadget that we always carry in our mobile phone, this is the SIM. We almost forget that I, in the SIM, stands for identity. It’s Subscriber Identity Module. SIM was created to solve this identity problem in that parallel internet, which we call the mobile network, right?</p>
<p>So, isn’t that a solution? We were just ignoring it and also, just unfortunately, these mobile operators knowingly or unknowingly, kept this with themselves, right? What we are doing at Sekura.id, I’ll just mention here, that we are bringing in that identity layer from this parallel internet which we call the mobile network into this traditional internet so that we actually solve the fundamental problem rather than keep creating technologies on top like password, like SMS OTPs, like biometrics. And that is what will solve the problem from its root and bringing in an identity layer from this parallel internet to the traditional internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you for the explanation, of the lacking, missing identity layer of the internet. And then you put a parallel, I haven’t thought of it in that way, the parallel of the mobile network which always had this identifier of the subscriber. As you say, even in the term it’s subscribe, the SIM card. So, I understand that Sekura.id solution is primarily based on the SIM card. Tell us a bit more how it works and if you can give also how it works, Sekura.id besides being based on the SIM card.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. So, GSMA doing this Mobile Connect, the conceptual idea was very similar, right? It’s to utilise the assets from the mobile operators, not just the SIM card. SIM card is a cryptographic engine. But there’s a lot of data available with the mobile operators which can help to identify the human user without challenging them. &nbsp;And also, protect them without putting a hurdle for the user, like what user ID, password, OTPs or biometrics are. They are hurdles, right? They are actually saying, “Hey, you cannot access the service until you pass that hurdle.”</p>
<p>This is where Mobile Connect started and this is the journey that we are continuing in Sekular.id as well. So, in Sekular.id, what we do is, as I say, the SIM is a cryptographic engine. And now, in the digital world, there is realisation that all the different, let’s say, identification and authentication methods where the user is actively involved, which means the user is challenged to prove who they are, or authenticate themselves, that is a limitation. A limitation in the form of that you know, if let’s say the user has got an OTP they have received, these fraudsters will always call this user and say, “Hey, I’m calling from your bank, or I’m calling from the government, you have received an OTP, can you hand it over, right?” If the user is not involved, right, these fraudsters can call the user but they have nothing to handover. So in that case, we solved this problem of all the fraudulent activities that’s going on.</p>
<p>So now, there is a realisation in the digital world as I was seeing that we need to avoid involving the user. So we need to do passive authentication. And how do we do that? Cryptographic authentication is one way to do. So, Apple last year in WWDC announced these passkeys which is basically based on the FIDO, the Fast Identity Online mechanism, where this is reliance on cryptography and cryptographic key on the device. And then that’s how we identify the user, right?</p>
<p>But exactly same mechanism is what happens in the SIM. And it is happening for the last 30 years. There is a cryptographic key which sits in the SIM which the user is not even aware of. And that’s an important thing. The user is not aware. As soon as the user is aware, or the user is involved in that awareness, OK, all these problems will happen because these fraudsters will approach the user and try to do some funny things, right?</p>
<p>And that’s another aspect that we say that here, this cryptography is humanised. If the user is not involved, it just happens behind the scene. In that case, this technology is humanised. Invisibility is more humanised. Steve Jobs used to say that technology should either be beautiful or it should be invisible. So here, this technology is invisible so that makes it much more humanised, right?</p>
<p>So, at Sekura, we’re utilising this cryptography in the SIM to seamlessly, invisibly authenticate this user. At the same time, there are a lot of what we call signals associated with the SIM which can help protect the user, at the same time, identify the user. For example, one of the largest fraud happening in the digital space right now is SIM swap fraud, right?</p>
<p>If we can identify that hey, is there a recent SIM swap happen? By recent, I mean in the last few hours, for example, to one day. If there is a SIM swap happen, in that case, that’s a red flag, that might mean that the user who is in the transaction process, who is interacting with the digital service may not be the genuine user, it could be a fraudster who have got access to the phone number of the user and using their own SIM. That’s one data signal that’s there in the mobile, with the mobile operator, that doesn’t need to involve the user to ask if something has happened or not.</p>
<p>Similarly, setting up a call redirect, right? The fraudsters can actually setup a call redirect for my number calling up the operator, doing some mechanism, some process there where they can say, “Hey, I have lost my phone, or I left my phone at my home and I’m expecting an urgent call from my family who is in the hospital. Can you please redirect all the calls to my number to this?” If I can convince the operator, in that case what will happen is, all calls, SMSs will be redirected or forwarded to me as a fraudster, right? So, if we can actually identify, is their call forward active for this number? That data itself can protect the user, again, without involving the user. So, we have identified 66 such potential data signals which can invisibly protect the user and their identity. And that’s what we do at Sekura, working primarily with the mobile operators.</p>
<p>Oscar: I like the idea of this invisibility because from the beginning you started that the human side is going to make security fail, right? But if the human doesn’t have to be involved, yeah, I’m sure, there will be less hacking. So that is definitely the concept, it’s very interesting.</p>
<p>Gautam: And just to add there, Oscar, you know, of course, there is this identity protection, there is this authentication without involving the user. That element is there. At the same time, it is allowing these good guys to access the service, right? So, as I was giving that example, it’s me, right? I’m not the fraudster. It’s me who wants to pay a particular merchant online, right? And I’m assuming I’m the good guy, right? And I want to pay. In that case, there shouldn’t be a barrier for me, right? And it’s good for the business because the business will get me to pay them. That’s what they want, right? So, in that case, it’s important that the good guys should sail through, right? For them, there is no barrier.</p>
<p>If we make it invisible for the user, in that case, these good guys can actually access, you know, without any trouble. At the same time, because it’s invisible, we can actually protect this user behind the scene as well. What does that mean is – it’s not just helping out with the identity verification, security and authentication, it’s also getting better business. Because if we put barrier to the good customers, good users, in that case, there are dropouts happen.</p>
<p>We have been told by our clients all around the world that on an average globally 20% of the users dropout due to all these, let’s say, challenges. They say, “Hey, I’m not going to use it.” SMS OTP is needed to do our transaction or to pay and OTP doesn’t get delivered or it is delayed, the user say, “Hey, I’m not going to pay now, right?” So that will direct 20% on an average globally, dropouts happen.</p>
<p>Here, if you make it invisible, you don’t have any dropouts, right? Because there are no barriers. There is no door which is closed that needs to be opened. So, in that case, the businesses get 20% more conversion, so that’s more business, more revenue. So that element is also there, if you make is invisible using the mobile operator’s asset like the SIM and all the data. That needs to be considered as well alongside security.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what if, myself as a normal user, I want to try Sekura.id, how can I use it already? There might be some services which is already available?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. So one element here is you know as you can understand, this is B2B service, right? So the businesses are using us. Businesses are protecting that. All our services are, you know, they go through one single API, right? So, it’s not the user who is accessing our services directly. As I was giving the example, I, as a user, accessing my banking service, right? And my banking service is using the Sekura.id services through the API, right? So that’s how I, as a user, as a consumer use it. Not directly through Sekura, through my services. And then again, I may not be even aware that that service is getting used, right? Because this service, as I said, for the human user it’s invisible.</p>
<p>So majority of our clients right now are mostly from the financial services, so the major banks in the UK, they are using our one or more of the services like Barclays is using our services, Virgin Money is using our services. In the US as well, Morgan Stanley, they are using our services, Flora Bank, they are using our services.</p>
<p>But again, just to reiterate, it’s not a B2C service, right? So it’s not that me, as a consumer, is using the Sekular.id services. It’s my business who is using the service to help me as a user getting protected. And at the same time, no buyer has been put by the businesses to access it. And we are actually expanding globally. As I mentioned to you earlier, I was in India, I came back yesterday, we are actually launching in there. We have some very, very exciting discussions happened across the use cases there, not just in the financial sector, beyond as well. And then we will be announcing those pretty soon.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK,as soon as they are launched, it will be interesting to know what are these use cases. So, very interesting initiative that you have in Sekura.id. So what happens for instance if – because this depends on people having good mobile networks and good phones, so what happens if that’s not available in some regions in the world?</p>
<p>Gautam: That’s a very important question you ask, right? And there are two elements you said, one is good mobile phone. One of the thing that we really passionately believe in Sekura is inclusiveness. And that’s very important for us. We have a mission statement for identity for all and everything. So no one should be excluded from identity protection, right? And this is why we tackle it from multiple angles.</p>
<p>So for example, we have platform that we have created from ground up based on all our learning from the GSMA and also my learning from Vodafone. That platform can integrate with any mobile operator in the world, right? Because all mobile operators are different. There are 700 plus mobile operators there. Right now, we are connected to around 75 mobile operators globally and we want to connect to all. Why? Because we don’t want any operators to be excluded because if we exclude that, their consumers or their users will be excluded.</p>
<p>So, one example is in India, one of the phone smallest operator is BSNL, right? It’s government-owned operator. They are quite small. They don’t have platform. And they were actually not included in this identity space. So what we have done is we have provided our platform to them so that, that platform can actually connect to that mobile operator and then it can actually expose their services, right? So that we don’t want to exclude their users.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important, as you rightly asked. What happens if I don’t have a good phone? So, this is where the principle that we use in all our services has got two major aspects. One, I already talked about – not involving the user because if you don’t involve the user, we increase the security, because user is the weakest link, right? And rightly so. And the second thing is not depending on the mobile device, because that’s extremely critical. Because let’s say, if the user can afford an iPhone 15 right? Of course, that’s extremely secure. The key chain there where the keys are stored is a hardware, right? That’s an HSN. So, it will be extremely secure.</p>
<p>But what about the user in let’s say Southeast Asia or in Sub-Saharan Africa where it’s a sub $10 phone? That may not have that much security. So, it’s unfair on the user because they cannot be pay for that advanced phone, they are getting excluded from security and identity verification. At the same time, it is unfair on the businesses, they cannot rely on a security because the user cannot afford that high end phone.</p>
<p>That’s why that’s the principle we use. We don’t rely on the mobile device. What do we rely on? The SIM. The exact same SIM is in the iPhone 15 or any of the high-end devices or in the low-end, not so expensive phone and provides the exact same security, right? The cryptographic security that I talked about doesn’t differentiate whether it’s a very high-end, expensive phone or not so expensive, much simpler phone. So that’s an important element here, right? So, our services don’t rely on the device. It doesn’t matter what device the user is using.</p>
<p>Secondly, all the data elements that I talked about is in the mobile network. This is completely independent of what device it is. So that way as well, all those data elements that I talked about, all those 66 potential data elements are independent of the device. So, that’s how we use the service and then make it inclusive end to end, for any user, right?</p>
<p>The other thing you asked about is what if there is no mobile network? It doesn’t really matter. So, the way to look into this thing is, we are relying on the mobile network. But the user doesn’t have to use the mobile device even at that moment of time for majority of the services. For the authentication services, the mobile device need to be in the network. But again, if the mobile device is not in the mobile network, it is connected to Wi-Fi or any other networks, in that case, we have fall back mechanism because we cannot really, rely on the mobile network because the device is connected to Wi-Fi, still we have a fallback mechanism.</p>
<p>And in some regions, like in US, we have worked with one of the large mobile operator there. Where we have worked with them to utilise the SIM, even if the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Because even if the mobile device is not connected to the mobile network, still there is a SIM there, right? If you can reach out to the SIM, we protect the device anyway.</p>
<p>And the other thing I was talking about, all these 66 potential data signals, they are available at the mobile operator’s secure CRMs, CVM and all the OSS, BSS system, right? So they don’t need the user to be using the mobile device at that moment of time. For example, if there is a SIM swap that has happened in the last few hours, the mobile operators databases, they already are aware of that even if there is no network. So, all our services other than the authentication service which we call SAFr Auth, all our services are data-related or signal-related services where these businesses, let’s say, this is a bank or an e-commerce provider or even a social media provider, their server makes the API call to our platform to get this data signal. So the mobile device is not involved, mobile network is not also involved there. Because again, we want that inclusivity for every user to be involved in there.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Well, definitely very novel way of addressing these problems. So I’d like to ask you one final question, Gautam, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot Oscar for asking that. The most important thing to add into their agenda is an acknowledgement that the internet doesn’t have that identity layer. Because that’s a fundamental problem. Because if we start to add technologies on top to fill the gap, that will not solve the problem. And we have seen over the years, right? We have seen user ID password, they didn’t solve that, SMS OTP or any form of OTP, they didn’t solve that. Then we added all sorts of other OTPs, right? TOTPs, authenticated apps, we even used those RSA tokens that we used to carry on. Then we evolved into biometrics. And by the way, biometrics, I’m sure your audience is aware of this, after Generative AI, every form of biometrics is challenged.</p>
<p>And then actually, you know, interestingly, LexisNexis, which is one of the largest fraud management provider on app based in US, their CEO of the government affairs came to the press. This person gave an interview to Fox News in June, saying that we are so much relying on these biometrics and after Generative AI revolution, there is a financial impact in the industry and then that impact is around 1 Trillion USD because every form of biometric is challenged through this Generative AI. Not just through deep fake, through all sorts of mechanism. I mean you can actually search the internet on those kind of fraudulent activities happening on almost a weekly basis.</p>
<p>So, let’s acknowledge that there is a fundamental issue with the internet and that’s no one’s fault because internet was not designed for that. If you acknowledge that, then we can solve the fundamental problem, right? And that can be done through the already existing identity layer which is existing in the mobile operators. Let’s work through that and solve the problem forever.</p>
<p>So, basically, what I am saying is, let’s bring in that identity layer from that parallel internet which we call mobile internet into the traditional internet. And let’s solve that problem at the root. And that’s what we are doing in Sekura.id. And that’s what we would invite all the leaders in the digital space to look into and solve the problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you very much, Gautam, for this very insightful conversation. And let us know if people would like to find more about you on the net, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot, Oscar. Thanks for inviting me. I am on LinkedIn. Please connect to me. It’s Gautam Hazari, G-A-U-T-A-M H-A-Z-A-R-I. If you Google me, you will find me there as well. And also, please visit Sekura.id, S-E-K-U-R-A.ID. You will find insightful solutions there and also we post lots of insightful stories, articles, blogs and what the future is looking like. Recently, one of my article is published in Forbes, I’m calling it Internet of Thoughts, where the future is coming and where, if you don’t solve this identity crisis in the internet it may create more issues. So, please reach out. Please look into Sekura.id and let’s solve this identity crisis together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, of course. Again, thank you very much Gautam for this conversation, and all the best.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thank you very much Oscar for having me.</p>

   Crypto exchanges and wallets are required to carry out KYC on their users as part of their compliance obligations. Automated KYC solutions make carrying out the process effectively at scale both possible and simple.  
 In this article, we explore what KYC / AML involves for crypto firms — and how adopting automated KYC can improve their security, compliance and the industry at large.

<p>Exactly one year ago, on November 16, 2022, the first post on Bluesky was created:</p>

The first post on Bluesky.
<p>Fast forward a year later, and we’ve just crossed two million users after opening the app to users around February. We’re excited to continue growing a truly open social network.</p>
 Toward Federation 
<p>Imagine you’ve just spent 10 years building your audience and making friends on a social platform, only to decide that it’s no longer for you. When you leave this platform, you’re essentially leaving behind all of your relationships, your saved posts, and more.</p>
<p>We’ve been there too, and we’re similarly tired of packing our bags each time another platform winds down and everyone collectively moves to the next big thing. Signing up for a new social network every few years and losing all our data on former ones shouldn’t be the price that we have to pay in order to keep our relationships online.</p>
<p>That’s why our biggest priority right now is launching federation, which is <a href="https://atproto.com/blog/2023-protocol-roadmap">timelined</a> for early next year. This is one of the core features of Bluesky that makes it “billionaire-proof” — you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too.</p>
 A Public Network 

<p>More exciting news: around the end of this month, we’ll release a public web interface. With this, you’ll be able to view posts on Bluesky without being logged in on an account.</p>
<p>This will make posts on Bluesky much more accessible, which will be especially useful for real-time commentary and breaking news.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Bluesky is a public social network, so your posts, likes, etc. have always been publicly accessible through the API. We designed Bluesky with the openness of the internet in mind, and you can think of your profile as a blog on the internet. To read more about data privacy on Bluesky, here’s our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/5-19-2023-user-faq">user FAQ</a>.</p>
 Other Updates 
<p>In between all of the above, we’ve also shipped some much-requested features, including:</p>
 
 Mobile push notifications: receive notifications on your phone 
 General user lists: add users to shareable lists and see their posts in one feed 
 Email verification: verify your account email for added security 
 Advanced feed and thread preferences: sort replies by time, likes, or randomly; see replies from your follows first; show/hide replies or quote posts in your feeds, and more 
 Media tab for user profiles: easily find and see the photos that a user has posted 
 A Likes tab on your own profile: see all your liked posts in one place 
 Improved startup and loading time: reduces the time spent loading the app 
 Suggested follows: get recommended follows based on each user 
 Accessibility improvements: improvements to alt text, component labels, screen flashing, and more 
 
<p>And there’s much more to come — join us for the ride! See you on <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>!</p>

  <p>Most contemporary digital identity discussions deserve another label: They are mostly about electronic trust ecosystems, considering all kinds of attributes beyond just pure identity. Additionally, nowadays they include natural persons, legal entities and (internet of) things. Everyone seems to agree the future is decentralized and all this only works with these curious wallets. Andre Kudra takes us on a journey through electronic trust ecosystems, diving into questions like: Which ones do we already have today? Some are successful, others not – why? Regulators are on it, too: What will eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDIW bring? What’s in the pipeline in other parts of the world? Will organizational digital identity (ODI) now invoke the breakthrough of decentralized identity overall? Why is decentralized identity the only way for Zero Trust Architectures which deserve the name?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/electronic-trust-ecosystems-cre23"></a>

  <p>As artificial intelligence continues its upward trajectory, a radical proposition emerges: Could AI take the helm of cybersecurity leadership? This bold discourse dives into the heart of this debate, exploring whether AI can effectively shoulder responsibilities traditionally assigned to a chief information security officer. Areas of exploration include AI's potential in threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response.</p>
<p>But where does human judgment fit into this AI-dominated picture? Is the seasoned expertise of a CISO irreplaceable? This electrifying discussion stirs the pot of the future of cybersecurity leadership, grappling with the balance between emerging AI capabilities and indispensable human expertise.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-will-not-do-ciso-job-cre23"></a>

  <p>The realm of cloud security has been extensively covered in books and articles, yet a crucial aspect remains ripe for exploration. It revolves around the fundamental understanding of what your cloud service provider offers and, equally vital, where your responsibilities lie in the realm of cloud security.</p>
<p><br> When embarking on the journey of adopting a cloud service, the foremost question to answer is, "What aspects of security do I need to oversee?" In a traditional on-premises setting, roles are distinct: IT manages infrastructure, information and cybersecurity handles security, and application developers bear the responsibility for code integrity. However, the landscape is evolving, with many organizations embracing DevOps, where these responsibilities are often shared, and the lines between development and operations blur or vanish.</p>
<p>Regardless of organizational structure, the majority of security obligations reside within your company's domain when you use an on-prem environment. Transitioning from an on-premises environment to a cloud environment presents one of the most intricate challenges—a more intricate shared responsibility model for security.</p>
<p>In the context of cloud security, two paramount concerns need close attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is the risk of misconfiguration. In a cloud environment, misconfigurations can inadvertently expose sensitive data and vulnerabilities, underscoring the critical importance of ensuring that cloud services and resources are set up correctly to mitigate such risks.</p>
<p>The second concern is insider attacks. Cloud users often lack influence over the staff of cloud service providers, making it essential to consider the possibility of insider threats. While cloud service providers typically promise robust security measures in place, it's crucial for organizations to implement their own layers of security to safeguard against insider attacks and unauthorized access, fortifying the shared responsibility model in the cloud.</p>
<p>In my presentation, I will delve into these intricacies, providing valuable insights and real-world examples of what your cloud service provider can do, irrespective of your specific needs and/or preferences.</p>

  <p>Fraud is a major cost to businesses worldwide. Banking, finance, payment services, and retail are some of the most frequent targets of fraudsters. However, insurance, gaming, telecommunications, health care, cryptocurrency exchanges, government assistance agencies, travel and hospitality, and real estate are increasingly targeted as cybercriminals have realized that most online services trade in monetary equivalents. After years of being the focus of cybercriminals, banking and financial institutions are more likely to be better secured than other industries, meaning that fraudsters are increasingly likely to attack any potentially lucrative target if given the opportunity. Fraud perpetrators are continually diversifying and innovating their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).</p>
<p>The most prevalent types of fraud businesses, non-profit organizations, and government agencies experience today are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Takeover (ATO) Fraud - occurs when fraudsters use breached passwords, phishing, social engineering and credential stuffing attacks to execute unauthorized transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Opening (AO) Fraud – also called New Account Fraud or Synthetic Fraud, often happens as a result of using stolen identities or assemblages of personal information to create synthetic digital IDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session we will provide an overview of Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms and show the highlights of our latest research in this area.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/technology-powers-fraud-prevention-cre23"></a>

  <p>Paul Fisher delves into the multifaceted approach required to foster trustworthiness within complex software supply chains. This discussion begins by delineating the critical components of software supply chains and the potential risks associated with each link—from development and deployment to maintenance and decommissioning.</p>
<p>Key to establishing a chain of confidence is the adoption of transparent processes and tools that provide verifiable evidence of security at each step. The audience will be introduced to Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), cryptographic signing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines fortified with automated security checks.</p>
<p>The talk will also consider the human aspect, emphasizing the need for cultivating a culture of security awareness and collaboration among stakeholders. This includes not only developers and security professionals but also suppliers, distributors, and end-users.<br>Finally, the talk will provide actionable insights and strategies for organizations to audit, monitor, and continuously improve their software supply chains.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/chain-of-confidence-cre23"></a>
