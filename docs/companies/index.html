 Digital identity pilot implementation to start in Q1 2024: Kick-off with 2,700 citizens from Austria, Romania and Spain to test wallet solution 



<p>Rennes/Munich, March 12, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, is pleased to announce the start of the pilot implementation phase for the EU-wide SOTERIA research project which aims to develop a user-centric, citizen-driven tool to help European citizens manage their personal data.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal of the project is to combine the creation of a digital identity to access online services with a user-friendly platform that allows for secure and easy data management, while increasing citizens’ awareness of their personal data. “SOTERIA is a large scale demonstrator that shows how a digital identity wallet can enable citizens to protect and control their personal data while making access to online services easier than ever before,” says Montaser Awal, Director of Research at IDnow and coordinator of the SOTERIA project.</p>



 E-voting, e-exam, and e-health field tests in three EU countries 



<p>Launched in October 2021, the SOTERIA project is nearing the final pilot implementation and testing phase of the identity wallet solution, which was developed by IDnow and the other SOTERIA partners as part of the project. The wallet will be integrated into the platforms of <a href="https://scytl.com/">SCYTL</a>, <a href="https://ipcenter.international/">IPCenter</a> and <a href="https://www.science.eus/en/institutions/biobizkaia">Biobizkaia Health Research Institute</a> (with the support of <a href="https://infocons.org/">INFOCONS</a> association) in Romania, Austria and Spain, respectively, for use cases in e-voting, e-exam, and e-health.</p>



<p>This month, the three pilot use cases will kick off with field tests consisting of 900 citizens each from Austria, Romania and Spain. For the e-voting and e-exam use cases, participants will authenticate themselves through the SOTERIA app and test the onboarding, which IDnow provides via proven identity verification methods. These include several new security checks developed within the project, reinforcing the fraud detection capability of the solution further. Then the citizens will go through the voting or exam process, and at the end, have the choice to add their voting receipt or their exam results to their wallet. For the e-health trial, citizens will have the possibility to add their health data to their wallet, while choosing the type of data and documents they want to store. This will allow them to have all important health information about themselves in their pockets.</p>



<p>The benefits of this testing phase are twofold: The 2,700 citizens will test the authentication process and the access to an online service with the help of a stored digital identity; while the wallet’s capability to store documents and attributes (e.g., e-voting receipt, e-exam results, e-health data) in the form of verifiable credentials will also be tested. Afterwards, the citizens’ feedback will be analyzed and evaluated by <a href="https://www.audencia.com/en">AUDENCIA</a> and will be used to improve the platform. These findings can then inform the further development of digital identity wallets under the upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS2 (electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) regulation</a>.</p>



<p>Awal adds: “Thanks to the findings in the use cases with citizens, SOTERIA will help strengthen security, privacy, and personal data protection across all layers of the digital economy, and will help pave the way for a trustworthy EU digital environment. We are very proud that the R&amp;D team at IDnow gets to lead this ambitious consortium of 13 European partners. It is testament to our innovative spirit and curiosity that forms part of our DNA at IDnow.”</p>

<p>Extreme weather events can be catastrophic to both people and the environment. But flash floods, hurricanes and winter storms also profoundly impact utilities. With electricity being the backbone of modern life and business operations, a loss of power can have disastrous consequences that require more than a flashlight and battery-powered radio to be solved. Today, utilities are meeting these challenges and risks with innovation by leaning on data and AI to prepare for the next event.</p>



 US utilities grapple with cold, catastrophic events&nbsp; 



<p>In 2023, the US experienced 28 separate <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2023-historic-year-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters">weather and climate disasters</a>, ranging from severe thunderstorms to wildfires, that caused around USD 92 billion in damages. However, over the past 12 years, the US has encountered at least five events where unforeseen freezing weather caused outages and posed threats to grid reliability.</p>



<p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S234573762250004X">Winter Storm Uri</a> wreaked havoc on Texas, leaving over 4.5 million people without power and causing economic losses between USD 80 billion and USD 130 billion. As temperatures plummeted, power plants relying on various fuel types began to fail. It became evident that the entire system was unprepared for such extreme freezing conditions and utilities began “load shedding,” which caused a city-wide blackout.&nbsp;And in December 2022, <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-nerc-release-final-report-lessons-winter-storm-elliott">Winter Storm Elliott</a> struck the US Eastern Interconnection grid, resulting in 90,500megawatts (MW) of generation experiencing unplanned outages.</p>







 Challenges to keeping the power on during severe weather 



<p>The root of the monetary damages, outages and grid unreliability can be found in these key challenges currently plaguing US utilities:</p>



 
 Inability to identify at-risk assets: Many US utilities operate on aging infrastructure (such as power lines) that is prone to breakdowns when exposed to harsh weather conditions such as heavy rain, flood waters and strong winds. Identifying at-risk assets in advance is a main challenge for utilities.&nbsp; 



 Ineffective outage predictions: Many utilities struggle to accurately predict outages, and load and energy demand due to a lack of weather forecast parameters, inconsistent data and inadequate technology. Notably, during Winter Storm Elliott, the total load forecast was underestimated by 23,047 MW. 



 Delayed or inadequate response time: Due to a lack of advanced technology and the inability to predict future events accurately, utilities are unable to mobilize crews efficiently, which leads to delayed response time.&nbsp; 



 Failure to meet winterization standards or conduct inspections efficiently: In accordance with <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/winter-storm-elliott-report-inquiry-bulk-power-system-operations-during-december-2022">guidelines</a>, utilities must develop winter weather preparedness plans, including inspection and maintenance checklists for the freeze protection measures of generating units. The lack of adherence to winterization standards and failure to inspect thoroughly ahead of storms result in freezing equipment and pipes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Ineffective vegetation management: Vegetation contact with utility lines and poles cause most power outages, and managing vegetation is one of the largest budgeted expenses for utilities. Utilities spend up to USD 8 billion per year on overhead line and vegetation management. 
 



<p>In addition to these challenges, unplanned generating unit losses and a reduction in natural gas production are significant contributing factors.</p>



 Preparing for disaster with innovation and intelligence&nbsp; 



<p>While natural disasters are inevitable, the power of data, AI, intelligent weather insights, IoT, geospatial technology and advanced asset management technologies can significantly enhance disaster management and fortify the grid.</p>



<p>The combination of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/asset-management">IBM® Maximo® Application Suite (MAS)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">IBM® Environmental Intelligence Suite</a> offers a robust tool to help utilities better prepare for extreme weather conditions:&nbsp;</p>



 1. Reliability centered maintenance:  



<p>Aging assets combined with the inability to identify at-risk assets in advance creates a complex, dangerous environment for utilities. IBM is solving these challenges by combining reliability centered maintenance (RCM), enterprise asset management (EAM), and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/predictive-maintenance">asset performance management</a> (APM) capabilities into a single platform. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/reliability-centered-maintenance">IBM Maximo Reliability Strategies application</a> enables end-to-end processes for initiating, completing and deploying RCM studies and tracking outcomes. These advanced capabilities empower organizations to make data-driven maintenance decisions, focus on critical and at-risk assets, and strategically allocate the exact level of maintenance that organizations require to preserve their functions. Utilities can also develop strategies for cold-weather reliability standards that are tailored to individual assets.<br><br>Diving deeper, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/predictive-maintenance">asset performance management (APM)</a> with MAS helps organizations determine how and when assets are going to fail and identifies at-risk assets in advance so that they can take immediate actions. Using AI-powered tools such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/remote-monitoring">IBM Maximo Monitor</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/predictive-maintenance">IBM Maximo® Health</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/predictive-maintenance">IBM Maximo Predict</a>, utilities can optimize maintenance strategies, reduce maintenance costs and prolong the lifespan of assets by proactively understanding their health and associated risks. The features of this platform can enhance asset performance in extreme situations, minimizing unplanned downtime.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Outage prediction:  



<p>MAS, in conjunction with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite&nbsp;Outage Prediction</a>, enables utilities to predict and monitor outages by location with increased confidence by using weather intelligence data and taking relevant actions. This approach improves demand response, allowing for advanced asset fixes, preparation and the quick integration of backup generation plants into the grid. As an example, discover how IBM successfully implemented IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite Outage Prediction for&nbsp;Hydro One, which resulted in a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/hydro-one-reduces-power-outage-ai/">33% improvement in power restoration</a> during an ice storm.</p>







 3. Field service management:  



<p>To overcome the challenges of delayed crew response and paper-based inspections, utilities can harness the power of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/mobile-eam">IBM Maximo Mobile</a> and MAS.

 Introduction <p>The Meteorological Aerodrome Report (<a href="https://metar-taf.com/explanation">METAR</a>) is a globally standardized format for communicating current weather conditions at airports or permanent weather observation stations. This format plays a vital role in aviation, aiding in flight planning and ensuring safety. Composed as a concise alphanumeric code, the <a href="https://metar-taf.com/explanation">METAR</a> delivers comprehensive meteorological data specific to an airport at a particular moment. These reports, consisting of letters and numbers, are issued every 30 or 60 minutes by airports and airfields.</p>METAR, Miami International Airport (KMIA) on March 9, 2024, at 15:00&nbsp;UTC<p>In the recently concluded data challenge hosted on <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/list">Desights.ai</a>, participants used exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance aviation weather forecasting accuracy. Focusing on Miami International Airport (KMIA), participants analyzed historical METAR reports spanning an entire&nbsp;decade.</p>Image showing the decoded METAR for KMIA on March 9, 2024, at 15:00 UTC, as provided by <a href="http://metar-taf.com">metar-taf.com</a><p>The challenge began with an in-depth exploration of EDA, where participants meticulously examined trends, patterns, and anomalies within the METAR data. Through this process, they gained valuable insights into Miami’s meteorological landscape, including seasonal variations and significant weather events impacting KMIA operations.</p><p>Transitioning to AI and machine learning (ML), participants developed models for precise weather prediction at KMIA. They addressed critical questions about prediction accuracy and model performance across weather phenomena. Additionally, they explored the influence of geographical and seasonal factors on prediction outcomes, aiming to enhance the applicability of their models in real-world aviation scenarios.</p> Winners Podium <p>The podium submissions exemplified ingenuity and precision in aviation weather forecasting. Participants showcased their expertise through innovative approaches, leveraging advanced machine-learning techniques to deliver accurate predictions. Let’s explore the top three submissions that stood out for their excellence and creativity in tackling this complex data challenge.</p> Andrey Bessalov — 1st&nbsp;Place <p>Andrey demonstrated a meticulous and methodologically sound approach to weather forecasting, using three critical&nbsp;stages:</p><p>1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Andrey undertook an extensive data preprocessing exercise to clean and prepare the METAR data for analysis. It involved handling missing values, encoding categorical data, normalizing measurements, and converting various data types. He also applied feature engineering to extract additional information from the data, including time-based features and rolling averages.</p><p>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Development: He performed an exploratory analysis to understand the characteristics of the data, such as the distribution of various weather parameters and their correlations. Patterns and anomalies in the data, like seasonal variations, were identified. Andrey developed a machine-learning model and trained it to predict METAR data for the next hour, comparing different models ( linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks) and choosing the best based on performance. He analyzed which features were most influential in predicting weather conditions and evaluated the model based on its accuracy.</p><p>3. Individual Weather Component Analysis and Final Algorithm: The project involved detailed analysis and modeling of various weather components, such as air temperature, dew point, air pressure, wind speed and direction, visibility, rain, fog, thunderstorms, and clouds. Andrey built separate Xgboost models for each component to predict future values one hour ahead. He validated the models using data from 2023, with training data from 2014 to 2022. The final step was the creation of an algorithm to process the data, create features, make predictions for individual components, and then convert these predictions into METAR format for practical use.</p> Dominikus Brian — 2nd&nbsp;Place <p>Dominikus’ primary objectives were to explore the relationships between different meteorological data, uncover statistical patterns influencing weather, and demonstrate the use of historical METAR report data in building a predictive machine-learning model.</p><p>His submission outlined essential findings from the exploratory data analysis and machine learning model development. It employed a Long-Short Term Memory Neural Network to predict next-hour weather conditions around Miami International Airport, revealing that models with shorter memory spans are generally more effective. The study faced challenges in accurately predicting wind direction and cloud types while achieving high accuracy in predicting temperature, dew point, air pressure, and visibility. Additionally, it observed yearly weather trends, such as an increase in mean temperatures and seasonal variations like stronger winds in the latter half of the year. The study also included correlation analyses showing various relationships between different weather&nbsp;factors.</p><p>His report comprehensively explored employing machine learning in weather forecasting, focusing on Miami International Airport. It highlighted the effectiveness of models with shorter memory spans and the interconnectedness of various weather factors. The insights gained are valuable for understanding meteorological dynamics specific to the airport and developing a machine-learning pipeline for weather prediction. Plans include refining the model’s efficiency and exploring its applicability to other airports, broadening the scope of the study’s utility in aviation and related&nbsp;fields.</p> Anamaria Loznianu — 3rd&nbsp;Place <p>Anamaria presented a structured approach to predicting weather conditions using METAR data. She applied predictive models, including MultiOutputRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to forecast weather values like wind direction, speed, gusts, visibility, temperature, dew point, and pressure. The report mentioned significant discrepancies in some predictions, such as temperature, while acknowledging the better accuracy of models like RandomForestRegressor and&nbsp;LSTM.</p><p>In addition to historical data, Anamaria explored using real-time data from airports surrounding Miami to improve weather predictions. This included a novel approach of using real-time data from nearby airports to refine weather predictions for Miami. She analyzed weather patterns from eight nearby airports and examined how these patterns influenced Miami’s conditions, then aggregated the latest METAR data from nearby airports and analyzed whether weather patterns at these locations influenced Miami’s conditions.</p><p>Her report concluded that while historical data is vital for recognizing patterns, forecasting weather in the short term is most effective when combining current data with the overall direction of weather systems. While the MultiOutputRegressor showed significant discrepancies, especially in temperature predictions, the RandomForestRegressor and LSTM models delivered more accurate results with significantly lower error&nbsp;rates.</p> Interesting Facts  Data Preprocessing and&nbsp;Parsing <p>The challenge required processing approximately 90,000 METAR lines from the Miami International Airport (KMIA) spanning over ten&nbsp;years.</p> General Weather&nbsp;Trends <p>The study observed seasonal temperature variations, with Miami experiencing warm, humid summers and mild, dry winters due to its tropical monsoon climate. Rainfall is significant during the summer, while winters are the peak tourist season due to comfortable weather. The city is also susceptible to hurricanes and tropical&nbsp;storms.</p> Yearly Weather&nbsp;Trends <p>The report noted an increase in mean temperatures from an average of 25.01°C in 2014 to 26.24°C by 2023. It also highlighted seasonal variations, such as stronger winds in the second half of the year, poorer visibility in fall and winter, decreased air pressure, and more predominantly eastward wind directions towards the year-end.</p> Seasonal Analysis <p>The data showed clear seasonal patterns. The highest temperatures occurred in summer (July-August) and during late afternoons (16:00 to 18:00), while the lowest temperatures were in winter (December-January) and early mornings (6:00 to&nbsp;9:00).</p> Challenges in Predicting Certain Weather&nbsp;Features <p>Among the primary features analyzed (wind direction, wind speed, visibility, cloud types, cloud heights, temperature, dew point, and air pressure), wind direction and cloud types were the most challenging to predict accurately. In contrast, temperature, dew point, air pressure, and visibility were predicted with high accuracy.</p> 2024 Championship <p>Did you know that our reward structure has changed? The prize pool is now $10,000 for every challenge, and it pays the top 10 participants.</p><p>In addition to the monetary rewards, we’ve also revamped our points system to better recognize our top performers’ achievements. Points will now be awarded to the top 10 finishers in each event, with 100 championship points up for&nbsp;grabs.</p><p>Collect points in each challenge for the 2024 Championship. Last year’s Championships’ top 10 received an additional $10 for every point earned during the&nbsp;year.</p><p>The top 3 in each challenge may work with Ocean on a dApp that monetizes their algorithm. Unlike other platforms, data scientists keep the IP. Now, we help them bring it to market, as&nbsp;well.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>The health sector faces a staggering array of challenges and consequences in the relentless battle against cyberthreats. Surprisingly, it’s not just a battle against malicious outsiders — within healthcare organizations internal users represent 39% of all threat actors.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human error in the forms of data loss and misuse are the most common ways internal actors pose a threat to the healthcare organizations they work for. With the average cost of a breach at $10.93 million2, it is essential to ensure that healthcare providers, employees, contractors, and partners only have access to the internal apps and systems that they need to do their jobs — and nothing more — to keep the risk of internal threats at bay.</p>

 As the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ecommerce">ecommerce</a> market grows exponentially, six trends projected to heavily impact the <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/global-ecommerce-growth-forecast-2022">global market</a> are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), augmented reality, live commerce, online-to-offline ecommerce, social commerce and voice assistants. 
 



 
 Generative AI opens up greater opportunities for value-creating personalization, dynamic pricing, user-friendly <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbots</a>, voice assistants, virtual assistants, and improved customer search. 
 



 
 Social commerce, a form of ecommerce in which a social media platform serves as both a marketing channel and a shopping destination, is expected to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/e-commerce-at-the-center-of-profitable-growth-in-consumer-goods">grow by more than 50%</a> between 2021 and 2025.  
 



 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ecommerce">ecommerce</a> market has grown exponentially over the last decade. The ecosystem has become more complex as business models advance and new ecommerce trends appear. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the rate of digital adoption <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-resilience-consumer-survey-finds-ample-scope-for-growth">doubled across the globe</a>. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/solving-the-paradox-of-growth-and-profitability-in-e-commerce">Some forecasts</a> suggest online retail might be responsible for half of all retail revenues by next year. </p>



<p>But, as many companies found out, expanding a business’ digital footprint or placing more emphasis on its online store didn’t guarantee profit. In what McKinsey refers to as <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/solving-the-paradox-of-growth-and-profitability-in-e-commerce">“the e-commerce catch-22,”</a> many retailers with significant growth in ecommerce sales through 2020 and 2021 saw their margins decline.</p>



<p>In part, this is because of high saturation in the market: An electronics or home goods retailer now competes globally, not just with its direct competitors, but with small-scale online stores and ecommerce giants like Amazon. This can force businesses to bring down prices to compete. </p>



<p>Shipping and logistics can get complicated in new markets and are subject to global supply chain interruptions. Consumers today, having become accustomed to ecommerce staples like same-day delivery and customized products, expect a seamless and unified digital shopping experience. They also expect the ability to use the payment option of their choice. Increasingly, these customers desire benefits like free shipping or designated loyalty programs. Also, and to successfully market to digitally native demographics like Gen Z, businesses must demonstrate a commitment to sustainability.</p>



<p>In the constantly shifting, rapidly expanding ecommerce ecosystem, businesses must think creatively about their digital strategies and how best to create dynamic, interactive shopping experiences that improve <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer relationships</a>. In the midst of a massive shift in how consumers purchase goods and services, here are some ecommerce trends that are projected to impact the <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/global-ecommerce-growth-forecast-2022">global USD 3.3 trillion market</a> and enhance a customer’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-experience">digital experience</a>:</p>



 
 Artificial intelligence (AI) 



 Augmented reality 



 Live commerce 



 Online-to-offline ecommerce 



 Social commerce 



 Voice assistants 
 



 Trend: Artificial intelligence (AI) 



<p>It’s often said that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> is ushering in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/win-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-with-artificial-intelligence/">fourth industrial revolution</a>, and the technology’s impact on digital commerce has been immense. Personalized shopping experiences are no longer an aberration, but something customers expect. Digital optimization and automation tools have made it cheaper and easier for businesses to use customer data or third-party data, creating intelligent ecommerce sites. AI-enabled marketing and product discovery tools help facilitate customer engagement and retention, if deployed correctly.</p>



 Personalization 



<p>AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of customer data, including browsing history, purchasing behavior, and demographic information to deliver personalized product recommendations and tailored shopping experiences. AI-based personalization surfaces goods a consumer is most likely to buy, reminds customers when it’s time to refill an order, and offers shopping experiences tailored to an individual’s preferences. These personalized shopping experiences can be deployed in several touchpoints including product pages, email campaigns, and during the checkout process.</p>



 Dynamic pricing 



<p>Dynamic pricing, most famously deployed by ride-share companies but increasingly used in other markets, allows retailers to adjust prices in real-time based on factors like demand, inventory levels, and competitor pricing. For some ecommerce businesses, dynamic pricing can help maximize revenue while remaining competitive in the market, though it’s crucial to carefully select the AI’s parameters to avoid unrealistic pricing structures that might deter new customers.</p>



 Chatbots and virtual assistants 



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51435">Gartner</a>, by 2027 chatbots will become, for as many as a quarter of organizations, the technology providing personalized customer support in natural language, answering questions, and addressing consumer concerns in real-time. As some researchers <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/marketing-and-sales-operations/global-marketing-trends/2022/end-to-end-customer-experience-ai.html">have cautioned</a>, it’s imperative to find synergy between <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/conversational-ai">conversational AI-assisted</a> customer service and the humans that manage it, to ensure customers have a productive online shopping experience from end-to-end.</p>



 Search and discovery 



<p>AI-powered search and recommendation engines use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> algorithms to better capture user intent, improve search relevance, and enhance product discovery. For example: Large retailers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/business/lily-ai-retail-shopping.html">are engaging third-party AI</a> to make searching for products in natural language simpler, so shoppers can search by pattern or style and find the exact item they’re looking to buy.</p>



<p>The AI revolution has also facilitated the creation of new kinds of ecommerce brands that are built on the technology. In recent years, for instance, ecommerce companies based on a subscription model—like Blue Apron and BarkBox—<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/using-analytics-and-ai-subscription-e-commerce-has-personalized-marketing-all-boxed-up/">have grown over 1,000%</a>. Direct-to-consumer subscription brands like these often harness AI and advanced analytics to provide their customers with personalized product selections.</p>



 Trend: Augmented reality 



<p>With the advancement of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, brands are increasingly able to enhance digital experiences and weave digital touchpoints into traditional buying channels. For purchases that are heavily dependent on environmental context—e.g., a new living room couch—consumers can reduce uncertainty and the likelihood of returning a product by “trying it out” in their living room. Particularly in markets like travel, hospitality, and consumer retail, AR and VR have the potential to enhance customer experiences by giving them the best possible preview of a product before they buy.</p>



 Enhanced product visualizations 



<p>One of the primary benefits of integrating AR and VR into ecommerce is the ability to provide customers with a lifelike and immersive preview of a product. This function can be useful in industries where consumers make large and contextually sensitive purchases. In the real estate industry, <a href="https://nyti.ms/2kbYAo9">several firms have experimented</a> with technologies that allow customers to view properties remotely. In recent years, IKEA has <a href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/innovation/ikea-launches-ikea-place-a-new-app-that-allows-people-to-virtually-place-furniture-in-their-home-170912/">started a successful AR mobile app</a> that allows customers to view the furniture retailer’s goods in their own homes.</p>



 Virtual try on experiences 



<p>Virtual try on experiences, when designed properly, have the potential to transform the fashion and beauty industries. With this technology, customers can use their smartphones or webcams to remotely try on clothing, accessories, or makeup. For example, several optical retailers allow consumers to digitally “try on” a pair of glasses. And Sephora has been massively successful with an <a href="https://medium.com/marketing-in-the-age-of-digital/how-augmented-reality-lets-sephora-try-on-something-different-23b4446fd5c1">app that renders makeup selections</a> on a user’s face in real-time.</p>



 Trend: Live commerce 



<p>Live commerce originated in China. Just six years after it emerged in 2016, the industry was projected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/10/business/live-shopping-us.html">bring in USD 647 billion in the country</a>. In the United States, the market is still emerging, bringing in a forecasted USD 32 billion as of 2023. </p>



<p>During live commerce events, customers can interact with a host over a live-stream as they purchase products—often by using digital wallets—in real-time. The sales tactic, which started with the Chinese social media network Alibaba, has been adopted by businesses like TikTok, Amazon, and the clothing resale platform Poshmark. During shopping events, influencers or celebrities might offer specific products, encouraging consumers to discuss the item and eventual sale over a chat client. Using live commerce, businesses can highlight markdowns or promotions, encouraging a sense of camaraderie around a specific event.</p>



 Trend: Online-to-offline ecommerce 



<p>Online-to-offline (O2O) ecommerce refers to a wide variety of ecommerce experiences that seamlessly integrate digital channels with physical retail experiences, thus creating a holistic customer journey spanning both online and offline touchpoints. And while it might initially sound counterintuitive, getting customers back to shopping in-store has become a major imperative for <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/five-trends-shaping-the-future-of-e-commerce-in-china/">some ecommerce retailers</a>. Offering select experiences in physical locations can engender customer loyalty and uncover new target markets.</p>



<p>In one high-profile example, Amazon purchased Whole Foods and integrated in-store grocery shopping with the ecommerce giant’s digital ecosystem. But a host of other businesses, from the massive social media company Alibaba in China to the small direct-to-consumer furniture brand Magnolia Market, have also opened physical locations based on their ecommerce stores.</p>



<p>Some examples of online-to-offline ecommerce initiatives include:</p>



 
 Omnichannel shopping experiences where a customer orders a product online and picks it up in a store 



 Physical showrooms for furniture that will be ordered online and delivered to a customer’s home 



 QR codes or other bar codes that can be scanned in-store to learn more about a product online 
 



 Trend: Social commerce&nbsp; 



<p>Social commerce, a form of ecommerce in which a social media platform serves as both a marketing channel and a shopping destination, is expected to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/e-commerce-at-the-center-of-profitable-growth-in-consumer-goods">grow by more than 50%</a> between 2021 and 2025. Like live commerce, it often takes the form of a mobile shopping experience, and is a leading ecommerce trend that is expected to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2022/01/27/social-commerce-is-a-12-trillion-opportunity-and-the-next-global-shopping-revolution/?sh=6734885c1d98">generate USD 1.2 trillion globally by 2025.</a></p>



<p>Using this approach, organizations can use social media’s reach to facilitate product discovery, encourage social purchasing decisions, and foster customer engagement. Several platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, have built social commerce into their platforms to facilitate the process. </p>



<p>Seamless shopping experiences through a social media channel capitalize on existing social behaviors and streamline the path to purchase, increasing conversion rates. Using social recommendation and discovery processes, customers can find the most relevant products. Often, brands that use social commerce will partner with influencers or engage with user-generated content to connect with their audience. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-clinique-uses-tiktok-to-appeal-to-younger-skincare-shoppers-2021-8">Brands like Clinique</a> have successfully engaged new and younger markets through a combination of savvy social media marketing and social commerce.</p>



 Trend: Voice assistants&nbsp; 



<p>Voice assistants integrate voice-enabled technologies, such as smart speakers, to facilitate the shopping process and streamline interactions between consumers and online retailers. This approach uses AI to enable users to search for products and place orders through various payment methods. Users can track shipments and select to receive custom recommendations using voice commands.</p>



<p>In addition to fostering an inclusive shopping experience for those who might have difficulty navigating traditional interfaces, voice search-assisted ecommerce provides a convenient and hands-free experience for online shoppers who might be multitasking. The intuitive nature of ordering by voice can be useful for businesses selling grocery staples or home goods. Though businesses are increasingly developing voice search-friendly product descriptions and creating their own back-end voice assistant products, the trend has been growing for several years. For example, since 2017 Dominos has operated its own app for mobile devices through which customers can quickly order a pizza.</p>



 The future of ecommerce 



<p>Given the rate at which ecommerce is expanding globally, new digital commerce forms are appearing at a rapid clip. In leading-edge countries like China, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/ecommerce-sales-china-global-growth/">which accounts for more than half of all digital retail sales</a> worldwide, new ecommerce trends like social commerce and live commerce have developed at a shocking rate. Over a period of less than five years, live commerce in China grew from an emerging innovation to a channel through which two-thirds of consumers in the country <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/its-showtime-how-live-commerce-is-transforming-the-shopping-experience">bought a product in the course of a year</a>.</p>



<p>For most organizations, it’s no longer enough to list items from a brick-and-mortar store on an ecommerce platform or merely allow integrations with PayPal. According to the IBM Institute for Business Value, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ai-retail">just 14% of 20,000 consumers recently surveyed</a> across 26 countries were satisfied with online shopping. There’s much room for innovation to provide a delightful <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-experience">ecommerce experience.</a></p>

<p>In the tech world and beyond, new 5G applications are being discovered every day. From driverless cars to smarter cities, farms, and even shopping experiences, the latest standard in wireless networks is poised to transform the way we interact with information, devices and each other. What better time to take a closer look at how humans are putting 5G to use to transform their world.</p>



 What is 5G? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/5g">5G (fifth-generation mobile technology)</a> is the newest standard for cellular networks. Like its predecessors, 3G, 4G and 4G LTE, 5G technology uses radio waves for data transmission. However, due to significant improvements in latency, throughput and bandwidth, 5G is capable of much faster download and upload speeds than previous networks.</p>



 How is 5G different from other wireless networks? 



<p>Since its release in 2019, 5G broadband technology has been hailed as a breakthrough technology with big implications for both consumers and businesses. Primarily, this is due to its ability to handle large volumes of data generated by complex devices using its networks.</p>



<p>As mobile technology has expanded over the years, the amount of data users generate every day has increased exponentially. Currently, other transformational technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI),</a> the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT</a>) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning#:~:text=Machine%20learning%20(ML)%20is%20a,learn%2C%20gradually%20improving%20its%20accuracy.">machine learning (ML)</a> require much faster speeds to function than 3G and 4G networks offer. Enter 5G, with its lightning-fast data transfer capabilities that allow newer technologies to function in the way they were designed to.</p>



<p>Here are some of the biggest differences between 5G and previous wireless networks.</p>



 
 Physical footprint: The transmitters used in 5G technology are smaller than in predecessors’ networks, allowing for discrete placement in out-of-the-way places. Furthermore, “cells”—geographical areas that all wireless networks require for connectivity—in 5G networks are smaller and require less power to run than in previous generations. 



 Error rates: 5G’s adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), a schematic that WiFi devices use to transmit data, is more powerful than ones in 3G and 4G networks. This makes 5G’s Block Error Rate (BER)—a metric of error frequency—much lower. 



 Bandwidth: By utilizing a broader spectrum of radio frequencies than previous wireless networks, 5G networks can transmit on a much wider range of bandwidths. This increases the number of devices they can support at any given time. 



 Lower latency: 5G’s low <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency">latency</a>, a measurement of the time it takes data to travel from one location to another, is a significant upgrade over previous generations. This means routine activities like downloading a file or working in the cloud is going to be much faster with a 5G connection than a connection on a different network. 
 



 How does 5G work? 



<p>Like all wireless networks, 5G networks are separated into geographical areas known as cells. Within each cell, wireless devices—such as smartphones, PCs and IoT devices—connect to the internet via radio waves transmitted between an antenna and a base station. The technology that underpins 5G is essentially the same as in 3G and 4G networks, but due to its lower latency, 5G networks are capable of delivering much faster download speeds—in some cases as high as 10 gigabits per second (Gbps).</p>



<p>As more and more devices are built for 5G speeds, demand for 5G connectivity is growing. Today, many popular Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as Verizon, Google and AT&amp;T, offer 5G networks to homes and businesses. According to Statista, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1133823/north-america-5g-subscriptions/">more than 200 million homes</a> and businesses have already purchased it with that number expected to at least double by 2028 (link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at three areas of technological improvement that have made 5G so unique.</p>



 New telecom specifications 



<p>The 5G NR (New Radio) standard for cellular networks defines a new radio access technology (RAT) specification for all 5G mobile networks. The 5G rollout began in 2018 with a global initiative known as the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3FPP) that defined a new set of standards to steer the design of devices and applications for use on 5G networks.</p>



<p>The initiative was a success, and 5G networks began to grow swiftly in the ensuing years. Today, 45% of networks worldwide are 5G compatible, with that number forecasted to rise to 85% by the end of the decade according to <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/dataforecasts/network-coverage#:~:text=The%20build%2Dout%20of%205G,around%2085%20percent%20in%202029.">a recent report by&nbsp;Ericsson</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



 Independent virtual networks (network slicing) 



<p>On 5G networks, network operators can offer multiple independent virtual networks (in addition to public ones) on the same infrastructure. Unlike previous wireless networks, this new capability allows users to do more things remotely with greater security than ever before. For example, on a 5G network, enterprises can create use cases or business models and assign them their own independent virtual network, dramatically improving the user experience for their employees by adding greater customizability and security.</p>



 Private networks 



<p>In addition to network slicing, creating a 5G private network can also enhance personalization and security features over those available on previous generations of wireless networks. Global businesses seeking more control and mobility for their employees increasingly turn to private 5G network architectures rather than public networks they’ve used in the past.</p>



 5G use cases 



<p>Now that we better understand how 5G technology works, let’s take a closer look at some of the exciting applications it’s enabling.</p>



 Autonomous vehicles 



<p>From taxi cabs to drones and beyond, 5G technology underpins most of the next-generation capabilities in autonomous vehicles. Until the 5G cellular standard came along, fully autonomous vehicles were a bit of a pipe dream due to the data transmission limitations of 3G and 4G technology. Now, 5G’s lightning-fast connection speeds have made transport systems for cars, trains and more much faster than previous generations, transforming the way systems and devices connect, communicate and collaborate.</p>



 Smart factories 



<p>5G, along with AI and ML, is poised to help factories become not only smarter but more automated, efficient and resilient. Today, many mundane but necessary tasks associated with equipment repair and optimization are being turned over to machines thanks to 5G connectivity paired with AI and ML capabilities. This is one area where 5G is expected to be highly disruptive, impacting everything from fuel economy to the design of equipment lifecycles and how goods arrive at our homes.</p>



<p>For example, on a busy factory floor, drones and cameras connected to smart devices utilizing the IoT can help locate and transport something more efficiently than in the past and prevent theft. Not only is this better for the environment and consumers, but it also frees up employees to dedicate their time and energy to tasks that are more suited to their skill sets.</p>



 Smart cities 



<p>The idea of a hyper-connected urban environment that uses 5G network speeds to spur innovation in areas like law enforcement, waste disposal and disaster mitigation is fast becoming a reality. Some cities already use 5G-enabled sensors to track traffic patterns in real time and adjust signals, helping guide the flow of traffic, minimize congestion and improve air quality.</p>



<p>In another example, 5G power grids monitor supply and demand across heavily populated areas and deploy AI and ML applications to “learn” what times energy is in high or low demand. This process has been shown to significantly impact energy conservation and waste, potentially reducing carbon emissions and helping cities reach sustainability goals.</p>



 Smart healthcare 



<p>Hospitals, doctors and the healthcare industry as a whole already benefit from the speed and reliability of 5G networks every day. One example is the area of remote surgery that uses robotics and a high-definition live stream connected to the internet via a 5G network. Another is the field of mobile health, where 5G gives medical workers in the field quick access to patient data and medical history, enabling them to make smarter decisions, faster, and potentially save lives.</p>



<p>Lastly, as we saw during the pandemic, contact tracing and the mapping of outbreaks are critical to keeping populations safe. 5G’s ability to deliver of volumes of data swiftly and securely allows experts to make more informed decisions that have ramifications for everyone.</p>



 Better employee experiences 



<p>5G paired with new technological capabilities won’t just result in the automation of employee tasks, it will dramatically improve them and the overall <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/employee-experience">employee experience</a>. Take virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), for example. VR (digital environments that shut out the real world) and AR (digital content that augments the real world) are already used by stockroom employees, transportation drivers and many others. These employees rely on wearables connected to a 5G network capable of high-speed data transfer rates that improve several key capabilities, including the following:</p>



 
 Live views: 5G connectivity provides live, real-time views of equipment, events and even people. One way in which this feature is being used in professional sports is to allow broadcasters to remotely call a sporting event from outside the stadium where the event is taking place. 



 Digital overlays: IoT applications in a warehouse or industrial setting allow workers equipped with smart glasses (or even just a smartphone) to obtain real-time insights from an application, including repair instructions or the name and location of a spare part. 



 Drone inspections: Right now, one of the leading causes of employee injury is inspection of equipment or project sites in remote and potentially dangerous areas. Drones, connected via 5G networks, can safely monitor equipment and project sites and even take readings from hard-to-reach gauges. 
 



 Edge computing 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">Edge c</a>omputing, a computing framework that allows computations to be done closer to data sources, is fast becoming the standard for enterprises. According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-edge-computing-means-for-infrastructure-and-operations-leaders">this Gartner white paper</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), by 2025, 75% of enterprise data will be processed at the edge (compared to only 10% today). This shift saves businesses time and money and enables better control over large volumes of data. It would be impossible without the new speed standards generated by 5G technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultra-reliable edge computing and 5G enable the enterprise to achieve faster transmission speeds, increased control and greater security over massive volumes of data. Together, these twin technologies will help reduce latency while increasing speed, reliability and bandwidth, resulting in faster, more comprehensive data analysis and insights for businesses everywhere.</p>



 5G solutions with IBM Cloud Satellite 



<p>5G presents big opportunities for the enterprise, but first, you need a platform that can handle its speed. IBM Cloud Satellite lets you deploy and run apps consistently across on-premises, edge computing and public cloud environments on a 5G network. And it’s all enabled by secure and auditable communications within the IBM Cloud.</p>

<div class='wrap'>


<p>Companies with diverse workforces are better positioned to deliver truly customer-centric experiences to all consumers. For example, when building technology, it is important that employees are aware of the cultural connotations of color schemes, symbols, and graphics. Red signifies good fortune in Chinese culture but can denote danger or caution in Western cultures.</p>



<p>Similarly, icons and symbols that are used in software should be universally recognizable or adaptable to different cultural contexts. A seemingly simple color choice can influence everything from purchase decisions to software adoption by different communities. Companies that prioritize a deep understanding of the needs and preferences of culturally diverse global consumers gain a competitive edge.</p>



 Disparities in the tech workforce can undermine the customer-centric mission 



<p>Living and working in the melting pot of technology and innovation in Silicon Valley, California, I’ve seen firsthand the disparities that exist in the tech workforce. For example, the Black community, which makes up about <a href="http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/bayarea.htm">7% of the population</a> in this region, represents a meager <a href="https://www.umass.edu/employmentequity/sites/default/files/CEE_Diversity+in+Silicon+Valley+Tech.pdf">1.5% of the tech community</a>. This lack of representation on a local level reflects broader trends across the US and other Western countries.</p>



<p>This disparity is not only a social concern; it’s a significant business challenge. When tech companies fail to represent the diversity of the society in which they operate, they miss out on the rich insights and perspectives necessary to create truly customer-centric products. This oversight can lead to a failure in understanding and catering to a wide array of customer needs, ultimately impacting the company’s bottom line.</p>



<p>The tech companies that first address and bridge this diversity gap have a unique opportunity to gain a substantial competitive edge. They can tap into markets and customer segments that have been historically overlooked, thereby broadening their reach and impact.</p>



 How can tech companies effectively embrace diversity? 



<p>One approach is through targeted recruitment strategies that focus on attracting a diverse pool of candidates. This involves reaching out to different communities and ensuring that the recruitment process is free from biases that might deter diverse talent. Mentorship programs can play a crucial role in nurturing and retaining diverse talent, providing them with the support and guidance that is needed to succeed in the tech industry.</p>



<p>There are also numerous organizations that can help. For instance, organizations <a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/Business-Schooled-9c799f1a/ad6dde71">like the Black Data Professionals Association (BDPA)</a> advocate for bringing underrepresented communities into tech. The work that they do helps businesses achieve their own diversity goals. While changing the lives of individuals by offering them opportunities in technology that they may not realize existed because they don’t typically see people like themselves in these roles.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Another critical aspect is conducting diversity training for all employees. Such training&nbsp; builds a more inclusive workplace culture, where differences are valued and celebrated, rather than just tolerated. It’s about fostering an environment where every employee feels empowered and respected. In this environment, innovation and creativity are applied in culturally diverse directions to generate new business opportunities.</p>



<p>In addition to these internal strategies, companies can look to external programs like <a href="https://skillsbuild.org/">IBM® SkillsBuild®</a>. Such initiatives offer resources and training opportunities to develop a diverse talent pool, equipping underrepresented groups with the skills necessary to thrive in the tech sector.</p>



<p>However, implementing these strategies is just the beginning. To truly measure their impact, it’s essential to gather customer-centric metrics such as net promoter score, customer satisfaction score and customer lifetime value. These metrics provide insights into how well a company is meeting the needs of its diverse customer base and can guide further strategy refinements. You can only manage what you measure.</p>



<p>The need for diversity in tech goes beyond social equity; it’s a strategic business move.</p>



<p>As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and diverse, . The tech industry, which is driven by innovation and change, has the potential to lead by example in this regard, creating not just better products but a better, more inclusive future for all.</p>

<p>Over 40% of financial institutions (FIs) are dealing with increased fraud and financial crime, putting more pressure on banks to choose between friction and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quick overview: Conventional KYC methods are becoming obsolete. These outdated approaches demand time-consuming, manual processes that are inefficient for banks and tedious for customers. But the new era of KYC is here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials: Reusable credentials are a revolutionary verification solution where the customer only has to verify themselves once. This cutting-edge technology removes friction from operations and fortifies every touchpoint (in the branch, app, contact center, etc.), ensuring heightened security. With reusable credentials, banks can:</p>



 
 Stop fraud by reducing weak security points 



 Take the pressure off your employee&nbsp; and prevent human error 



 Create a better customer experience with seamless processes at every touch point. 
 



<p>Why this matters: This is the next step in identity verification. There is now a way to have less friction without having to sacrifice security through reusable credentials.<br></p>



<p><a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">👀 See how reusable credentials are reshaping bank operations in our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.”</a>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The big picture: Humans are human, which means we can make mistakes or be taken advantage of by social engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.social-engineer.com/state-of-vishing-report/#:~:text=Social%2DEngineer%27s%202023%20State%20of,%2C%20network%2C%20or%20financial%20breach.">State of Vishing Report</a> found a 10% increase in compromises when the fraudulent caller was a female as opposed to a male caller. Reusable credentials instantly take care of this problem. Your customer will have a hyper-secure, encrypted credential that your employee will request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No guesswork is involved. Your customers and employees know that the account is secure.</p>



 Dive Deeper 



 Why the Traditional KYC Methods Are Not Working 



<p></p>



<p></p>



 The Achilles’ heel of current KYC processes is its temporary nature. 



<p>Once the initial identity verification occurs during account opening, it becomes a one-time, non-reusable process. This leaves day-to-day interactions vulnerable, forcing employees to repeatedly verify customer information through methods susceptible to exploitation, such as:</p>



 
 Security questions 



 Teller judgments on IDs 



 SMS verifications 



 Over-the-phone verification. 
 



<p>Using reusable credentials allows customers to be seamlessly verified at every touch point. No reverification. No room for fraud. Only a seamless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Stop Fraud with Reusable Credentials 



<p>In the continual battle against fraud, where every weak link in security can lead to losses, reusable credentials fortify FIs. Traditional KYC methods are vulnerable to social engineering and create an environment where fraud can thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A FI employee <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/19at82r/call_center_loses_1500_in_provisional_credit_to_a/">shared their story</a> showcasing that humans are unfortunately susceptible to social engineering: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[A] member is claiming he attempted a deposit of $2,900 over the long weekend that was not processed … I thought it was a no-brainer. [The] account was [less than] 45 days old, and aside from the initial $10 deposit to open the account there was no other activity. There’s no way a supervisor would agree to PRCR. And yet, when the ticket came in, there was a comment that the Call Center’s director approved a PRCR of $1,500 “so the member can pay his bills.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sure enough, within an hour, the member pulled $800 out at another ATM. A few hours later, another $200. The next day, about a dozen or so $10 withdrawals from Cash App, and finally another ATM [withdrawal] of $330. [The] account now has less than $15.</p>



<p>Any odds on us seeing this $1,500 coming back to us? [The] call center rep feels bad because she is “normally a really good judge of character.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The problem: Weak points of traditional security measures. Security questions, often easy targets for social engineering, can be guessed or manipulated. Bank tellers, despite their expertise, may struggle to differentiate between authentic and forged IDs. SMS-based verifications, a common practice, can expose customers to phishing attacks.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The solution: Embracing reusable credentials that close vulnerabilities for identity verification. By adopting an approach similar to the success of TSA Precheck in travel, banks can usher in a new era of fraud resistance. They provide a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding, making fraud attempts nearly impossible.</p>



<p>Fraud prevention is not just a reactive measure; it’s a company-wide initiative. Reusable credentials significantly reduce the workload associated with fraud-related projects, allowing financial institutions to reallocate resources.</p>

 Take the Pressure Off Your Employees 



<p>“Tellers are the first line of defense. It’s our job to protect your account. But we aren’t perfect. Just like any sort of defense, we make mistakes or miss things. We are human and are subject to human error.” – A teller talking about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/ag2aiv/bank_tellers_of_reddit_what_security_do_you_guys/">their experience.</a></p>



<p>The heartbeat of any financial institution is its dedicated workforce, tirelessly navigating the delicate balance between service and security. Traditional KYC and identity verification require manual processes and diverse verification methods that put immense pressure on employees to stop fraud while providing a great customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials revolutionize this situation by offering a streamlined solution that alleviates the pressure on bank employees. Employees are freed from repeatedly needing to validate customer information with a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding. This shift enhances operations and empowers employees to focus on delivering excellent customer experience.</p>

 FAQ: Reusable Credentials and Decentralized Identity&nbsp; 



What is the reusable credentials process?




 
 The First Identity Verification A decentralized identity (DI) system verifies a customer’s identity during account creation using robust authentication methods. 
 







 
 Creation of Reusable Credentials: Once the identity is verified, the DI system generates a reusable credential. These credentials are encrypted, making them tamper-proof and incredibly secure. 
 







 
 Customer-Controlled Data: Unlike conventional identity systems where the FIs oversee and store user data, decentralized identity transfers this to the customer. For banks, this translates to customers possessing their credentials securely stored on their devices, offering the convenience of storing and presenting credentials directly within your banking app and interfaces. 
 







 
 Persistent Verification: Reusable credentials stop the need for repetitive verification processes. Whether logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, customers simply present their reusable credentials as irrefutable proof of identity. 
 




What are the benefits for banks to use reusable credentials?
 
 Enhanced Security: Reusable credentials reduce reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud, replacing security questions susceptible to social engineering or SMS-based verifications vulnerable to phishing. 
 



 
 Frictionless Customer Experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for bank customers to enjoy continuous and secure interactions across various touchpoints. 
 




How can banks use reusable credentials to prevent fraud?
 
 The Highest Level of Security: Reusable credentials use advanced cryptographic techniques to make information tamper-proof and nearly eliminate the risk of fraud. 
 



 
 Absolute Proof of Identity: Once a customer’s identity is verified and turned into a reusable credential, it becomes irrefutable proof of their identity, minimizing the risk of social engineering or phishing. 
 



 
 Strengthen Security Points: Reusable credentials limit places where fraudulent activities can occur, minimizing potential attack points found in traditional verification methods. 
 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance, including:</p>



 
 Healthcare 



 Government services 



 Education 



 Farming 



 Mining 



 Travel and hospitality 



 Retail and e-commerce

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/software-development">Software development</a> is one arena where we are already seeing significant impacts from <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> tools. The benefits are many, and significant productivity gains are currently available to enterprises that embrace these tools. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unleashing-developer-productivity-with-generative-ai">McKinsey study</a> claims that software developers can complete coding tasks up to twice as fast with generative AI.</p>



<p>The consulting firm’s research found, unsurprisingly, that complex coding tasks were not severely affected by the use of generative AI, so worries about AI replacing developers can be safely laid to rest. However, there are “low hanging fruit” use cases where AI can drastically speed up team productivity, and improve the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/the-modern-developer-experience">developer experience</a>.</p>



<p>But before we get into how generative AI tools can make an impact, let’s speak more generally about improving developer productivity with methodologies, frameworks and best practices. Generative AI is just one tool in the toolbelt.</p>



 Measuring and improving developer productivity 



<p>Measuring developer productivity, a subset of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/employee-productivity">employee productivity</a>, represents a multifaceted challenge. Traditional metrics, such as lines of code written or hours worked, often fall short in capturing the intricacies of complex workflows. They may not adequately reflect the quality or broader impact of a developer’s work, and a proper evaluation may require the incorporation of external factors like customer satisfaction. It is crucial to recognize that developer productivity extends beyond mere code generation; it encompasses the delivery of high-quality outputs that consistently satisfy customers, while mitigating the risk of burnout. A burned-out developer is usually an unproductive one.</p>



<p>DevOps Research and Assessment metrics (DORA), encompassing metrics like deployment frequency, lead time and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mttr">mean time to recover</a>, serve as yardsticks for evaluating the efficiency of software delivery. These developer productivity metrics empower engineering managers and Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) to gauge individual and team performance accurately.</p>



<p>Project management tools, like the widely adopted Jira, track progress, manage tasks and facilitate contribution analysis. Implementing the SPACE framework—Software engineering, Productivity, Analytics, Collaboration and Efficiency—offers a holistic approach to software development. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as story points and real-time productivity tools serve as benchmarks for consistently measuring and improving software developer productivity.</p>



<p>Diversifying productivity measurement beyond individual performance necessitates a comprehensive understanding of team dynamics. Collaboration platforms like GitHub act as catalysts for a culture of open communication, collaborative code reviews and easily facilitated pull requests. Such platforms not only enable team members to learn from each other but also provide a collective space for skill enhancement. The strategic introduction of new features and the consistent delivery of high-quality code not only bolster the product’s competitiveness but also contribute significantly to end-user satisfaction.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> emerged as a transformative methodology that seamlessly integrates development and operations practices, optimizing the efficiency of the software development lifecycle. By fostering collaboration between developers and operations teams, DevOps aims to streamline processes, minimize lead time and elevate deployment frequency. In doing so, it paves the way for an environment conducive to continuous innovation and improvement. DevOps helps to address bottlenecks and proactively manage technical debt, which allows for a work environment that keeps developers happy and chugging along.</p>



<p>Engineering managers can perform regular contribution analysis and use this information to integrate new tools and address employee experience concerns, shaping a conducive environment for developer productivity. The adoption of the YES (Your Engineering Success) model underscores the importance of cultivating a positive and supportive culture within the team, fostering an atmosphere that encourages innovation and creativity. This holistic approach ensures that developer productivity is measured and optimized in a manner that not only enhances individual and team performance but also nurtures the overall well-being of the development workforce.</p>



 How generative AI can help 



<p>There are a number of ways that AI can streamline development workflows. Here are some more common use cases:</p>



 Eliminating repetitive tasks 



<p>Coding often involves simple, sometimes tedious tasks, and this is where generative AI tools tend to shine. Repetitive, routine work like typing out standard functions can be expedited with auto-complete features. Tools like OpenAI’s Codex can suggest lines of code or entire functions based on natural language descriptions. Code documentation can be sped up by helping developers automatically adhere to specific documentation formats.</p>



 Natural language interfaces 



<p>Generative AI can facilitate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language</a> interfaces for software development tools. Developers may be able to interact with development environments, debugging and version control systems using natural language commands, making it more accessible for those without extensive programming expertise.</p>



 Code suggestion 



<p>Generative AI can also help beginners by providing context-aware suggestions, explanations and guidance as they write code. This can accelerate the learning curve for new developers and democratize access to software development.</p>



 Code improvement 



<p>Generative AI can suggest improvements to existing code by identifying redundant or inefficient portions. This can aid in maintaining code quality and performance over time. Problems that may have been tricky to pinpoint can be found and rectified much more quickly by implementing AI-suggested solutions, which can even be done automatically.</p>



 Code translation 



<p>Generative AI can also translate code from one language to another, streamlining code conversion or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">app modernization</a> projects, such as updating legacy applications by transforming COBOL to Java.</p>



 Code testing 



<p>Generative AI can be employed in creating test cases automatically. It can analyze code and generate test inputs, helping to improve test coverage and identify potential issues early in the development process.</p>



 Bug detection 



<p>By analyzing large codebases, generative AI can assist software development teams in identifying and even automatically fixing bugs. This can lead to more robust and reliable software, as well as faster development cycles.</p>



 Personalized development environments 



<p>Generative AI could help create personalized development environments that adapt to individual developer preferences and coding styles. This would enhance productivity and make the coding experience more comfortable for programmers.</p>



 Enhanced Documentation 



<p>Generative AI can assist engineering teams in generating documentation by summarizing code functionalities, explaining algorithms and providing context. This can be useful for maintaining clear and up-to-date project documentation.</p>



 How generative AI for coding software works 



<p>Generative AI in coding works by leveraging <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> models that are trained on large datasets of code. These models, are capable of understanding the structure and syntax of programming languages.</p>



 Pre-training the model 



<p>Generative AI models are pre-trained on massive datasets containing diverse examples of code written in various programming languages. During pre-training, the model learns to predict the next word or token in a sequence of code based on the context of the preceding words. This process allows the model to capture the syntax, semantics and patterns inherent in different programming languages.</p>



 Understanding context 



<p>When presented with a coding prompt or query, the generative AI model processes the input and uses its learned knowledge to understand the context and intent. The model considers the relationships between different code elements, such as variables, functions and control structures, to generate relevant and syntactically correct code.</p>



 Code generation 



<p>Using the learned patterns and contextual understanding, the generative AI model generates code snippets as output. The generated code is based on the input prompt and follows the structure and style of the programming languages in which the model was trained.</p>



 Adapting to user feedback 



<p>Generative AI models often have mechanisms to adapt and improve based on user feedback. Developers can provide feedback on the generated code, helping the model refine its understanding and improve future outputs. This iterative feedback loop contributes to the model’s ability to generate more accurate and contextually relevant code over time.</p>



<p>While generative AI in coding is a powerful tool, it is not a substitute for the creativity, problem-solving and domain expertise of human developers. It serves as an augmentation tool, assisting developers in coding tasks, providing suggestions and potentially speeding up certain aspects of the development process. Developers should use generative AI responsibly, validate generated code thoroughly and complement its outputs with their own expertise and understanding.</p>



 A hypothetical use case 



<p>Imagine a programmer who is tasked with implementing a complex feature for a web application project. Facing the challenge of intricate data manipulation and dynamic content rendering, she decides to integrate generative AI into her development workflow to expedite the coding process. She begins by carefully defining the requirements of the new feature, encapsulating the core logic and structure into a coding prompt. Leveraging a generative AI tool trained on a diverse dataset of web development code, she inputs her coding prompt, prompting the model to autonomously generate a preliminary code snippet aligned with the specified requirements. This generated code includes functions for data processing, event handling and dynamic content rendering.</p>



<p>She enters into an iterative process of refining and fine-tuning the generated code. Through this interaction, she ensures that the AI-generated code adheres to the project’s coding conventions and architectural nuances. With the generated code now meeting her satisfaction, she integrates it into the existing codebase of the web application. Despite the accelerated development process facilitated by generative AI, she recognizes the indispensable role of human validation in thorough testing to ensure the feature’s correctness, responsiveness and reliability.</p>



<p>The integration of generative AI into her workflow not only expedites the coding process but also empowers her to allocate more time to higher-level design aspects, user experience considerations and comprehensive testing. This use case exemplifies how generative AI serves as a valuable ally, augmenting the capabilities of developers and contributing to the overall efficiency and quality of the software development lifecycle.</p>

<p>In a warming world, the transition from fossil fuels to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a> is heating up. Global capacity for renewable power generation is expanding more quickly than at any time in the last thirty years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/massive-expansion-of-renewable-power-opens-door-to-achieving-global-tripling-goal-set-at-cop28">The agency predicts</a> that by 2025, renewable energy will surpass coal to become the world’s top source of electricity. Wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation are forecast to exceed nuclear power generation in 2025 and 2026, respectively. And by 2028, <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">68 countries</a> will boast renewables as their main source of power.</p>



<p>The acceleration in clean, renewable energy power generation comes not a moment too soon for policymakers and advocates concerned with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/climate-change">climate change</a> caused by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p>



 Policies driving development 



<p>At 2023’s United Nation’s Climate Change Conference (COP28), governments set a goal to triple global renewables power capacity by 2030. This will ideally help advance <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decarbonization">decarbonization</a>, mitigate climate change and achieve <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/net-zero">net-zero</a> emissions, <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/massive-expansion-of-renewable-power-opens-door-to-achieving-global-tripling-goal-set-at-cop28">according to the IEA</a>.</p>



<p>To develop renewable energy technology, governments are turning to various public policy measures. The European Union’s Green Deal Industrial Plan, India’s Production Linked Incentives (PLI) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US are all policies designed to further stimulate the integration of sustainable energy. Supportive economic policies in China have accelerated onshore wind and solar photovoltaic energy projects there, helping the country surpass national 2030 targets years ahead of schedule. (This is crucial to the goal of tripling worldwide renewables as China accounts for almost 60% of all new global renewable energy capacity <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">expected to come online by 2028</a>.) In addition, evolving regulations on corporate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/esg-reporting">environmental, social and governance (ESG)</a> initiatives around the world are increasing demand for renewable energy in the private sector, encouraging further growth.</p>



 Renewable energy growth by type 



<p>Broad policy measures notwithstanding, policy support often varies depending on the type of renewable energy in question. Let’s take a closer look at several types of renewable energy resources and the trends taking shape in each category.</p>



 Solar power 



<p>In 2023, solar photovoltaic energy made up three-quarters of renewable capacity additions around the world, according to the IEA. Capacity growth stemmed from both utility-scale plants and consumer adoption of distributed PV systems—on-site solar power generation at homes and businesses—<a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">accounted for the other half</a>.</p>



<p>Continued policy support from governments around the world remains the primary driver of this growth. For example, some policymakers incentivize renewable power generation by individuals and businesses through net-metering programs that allow utility customers to send excess energy generated back to their utilities for credits. Other incentives encouraging the production and use of solar power include <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">feed-in-tariffs</a>, tax credits and auctions in which solar power providers compete on energy market price to win contracts.</p>



<p>The expansion of the solar PV supply chain is enabling the manufacturing necessary to meet the demands of the growing industry. More manufacturing capacity in the US, India and the EU is expected to help diversify the solar PV supply chain, but China continues to dominate the space. (The country was home to <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/solar-pv">95% of new solar technology manufacturing facilities in 2022</a>.) And advancements in solar photovoltaic technology are producing <a href="https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/the-next-generation-of-solar-energy/">lighter, less expensive, more efficient solar panels</a> that will continue to increase generation capacity over time.</p>



<p>Based on the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), if current growth rates are maintained through 2030, solar PV is “on track” to meet annual generation capacity of approximately 8,300 terawatt hours (TWh) <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">by the end of the decade</a>. In addition, solar PV is expected to be the dominant source of energy in the production of low-emissions or green hydrogen. Low-emissions hydrogen (in contrast to hydrogen produced with fossil fuel power) can potentially drive <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/how-wind-energy-can-help-clean-hydrogen-contribute-zero-carbon-future">greater decarbonization efforts</a> in businesses ranging from steelmaking to ammonia production, where hydrogen is used for industrial purposes.</p>



 Wind power 



<p>As with solar power, public policies have been key to driving wind energy expansion, but growth projections vary by region. China saw a 66% increase in wind power capacity in 2023 and is on track for more additions in the coming years. Project development, however, has been slower than initially expected in Europe and North America. Offshore wind projects have been especially vulnerable: In 2023, in the US and UK alone, developers <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/wind">canceled offshore projects</a> with total capacity of 15 gigawatts (GW).</p>



<p>Recent public policies may help support the industry during this challenging period. In 2023, the European Union announced its Wind Power Action Plan, with measures to improve permitting, auction processes and financing access as well as <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">expand workforce training</a>. In the same year, nine European countries announced plans to increase offshore wind power capacity to over 120 GW by 2030 and over <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/floating-offshore-wind-shot">300 GW by 2050</a>. Meanwhile, in the US, the government is investing in the development of floating wind farms. The deployment of floating wind farms with a capacity of 15 GW is <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/wind">expected by 2035</a>.</p>



<p>For wind power to meet the goals of the IEA’s NZE, average annual growth would need to <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/hydroelectricity">reach or surpass 17% per year until 2030</a>.</p>



 Hydropower 



<p>Currently, hydropower generates more power—reaching 4,300 TWh in 2022— than all other clean energy sources combined and will remain the largest source through 2030, according to the IEA. Despite small but steady growth and proven reliability, new hydropower additions are forecast to <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/hydroelectricity">decrease 23%</a> over the next decade due to development slowdowns in Europe, China and Latin America.</p>



<p>Over the past 20 years, energy industry focus has shifted from hydropower, with most countries focusing policies and incentives on expanding solar and wind power. Today, <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/hydroelectricity">less than 30 countries</a> offer policies to support new hydropower development and refurbishment of existing plants versus over 100 countries with policies to support wind and solar PV.</p>



<p>To meet the NZE Scenario, hydropower would need to grow at an annual rate of <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">at least 4%</a>.</p>



 Biofuel 



<p>Global biofuel expansion is underway, thanks largely to supportive government policies in emerging economies such as Brazil, India and Indonesia. Demand is largely driven by the transportation sector in those countries, while supply is enabled by the availability of biomass feedstock. Brazil leads the way in biofuel expansion, accounting for a projected <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">40% of growth by 2028</a>.</p>



<p>Biofuel expansion is more limited in the EU, US, Canada and Japan due in part to high costs and the growing popularity of electric vehicles. The main areas of growth for biofuels in these countries are the renewable diesel and biojet fuel segments. Overall, biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel, in combination with electric vehicles (EVs), have the potential to offset the oil equivalent of four million barrels by 2028. Such milestones notwithstanding, the <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">IEA predicts</a> that biofuel expansion will still fall short of 2030 NZE goals.</p>



<p>Biogas: While the growth of the biogas industry began in the 1990s, the last two years have seen an increase in policy support for the natural gas alternative. Currently, almost half of all global biogas production comes from Europe, with <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">20% of that from Germany alone</a>.</p>



<p>Historically, biogas has been used at heat and power plants. More recently, however, governments have encouraged industrial and transportation uses for biomethane, a biogas which, as its name suggests, contains a substantial concentration of methane. With 13 countries implementing strong new policies supporting biogas since 2022, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems">the IEA projects</a> that biogas production growth will accelerate through 2028.</p>



 Geothermal energy 



<p>Technological developments are creating opportunities to bring geothermal energy to more places. For example, through Enhanced Geothermal Energy Systems, fluid is injected underground in areas without naturally occurring hot water sources. The fluid heats up underground and then is pumped to the surface, <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/deebef5d-0c34-4539-9d0c-10b13d840027/NetZeroby2050-ARoadmapfortheGlobalEnergySector_CORR.pdf">where it generates electricity</a>. Various geothermal projects are planned or underway around the word, including in North America, Europe and Asia.</p>



<p>Such advancements notwithstanding, advocates for geothermal energy say policies are needed to take advantage of its untapped potential. The capital-intensive nature and financing costs of geothermal projects can be prohibitive. The evolution of economies of scale and continued technological advancements could help drive down costs, but for now, the IEA forecasts that only about 1% of renewable energy will be sourced from geothermal energy production by 2030.23</p>



 Technology to support evolving renewable energy 



<p>As more renewable energy is added to energy systems, technology will play a crucial role in keeping the energy supply flowing while ensuring energy security and the stability of power grids.</p>



<p>Because renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar, are vulnerable to environmental conditions, ensuring optimal production and distribution is crucial to providing a stable, resilient power supply. <a href="https://research.ibm.com/projects/renewables-forecasting">Renewables forecasting</a> is rapidly becoming an important tool in the energy transition. For example, solutions such as the IBM Renewables Forecasting Platform within the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite </a>can provide <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/V3PG5DNY">day-ahead wind and solar forecasts with 92% accuracy</a>.</p>



<p>Better storage will also help make power systems more resilient. Solar, wind and hydropower all require energy storage systems (ESS) to provide a consistent energy supply. As grid-scale battery technology evolves, utility companies will be able to store electricity long-term to better manage load during periods of low- or non-production. For instance, flow batteries are a low-cost and scalable form of long-term grid-scale energy storage currently being developed.</p>



<p>From batteries to solar arrays, effective asset management is an important component in supporting a clean energy transition; intelligent asset management and predictive maintenance can monitor asset health and prolong its lifespan. For instance, the New York Power Authority (NYPA) is streamlining its asset management with the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo">IBM Maximo® Application Suite</a>. The goal is to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/new-york-power-authority">digitalize the state’s energy infrastructure</a> and transform it into a clean, reliable, resilient and affordable system over the next decade.</p>

<p>Both companies have been on an transformative journey for the past four years: making seamless travel a reality. We have developed new solutions to the challenge of digitizing identity documents; we have set new standards for biometrics, data privacy and protection; we have won some of the most prestigious awards in the digital identity space; and, most of all, we solved one of the most challenging trust problems in the world: how to pre-clear passengers for immigration ahead of their arrival and get them across borders in seconds.</p>
<p>In delivering the world’s first implementation of a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) following ICAO standards, in Aruba in March 2023, we drew a map of the future. It’s a seamless world, where verifiable identity and data makes interacting with each other smoother, faster, and more secure — because we now have genuine confidence that identity and data can be trusted.</p>
<p>For airports and airlines and governments, that future is here, it’s happening right now; we’re implementing it. That is why our partnership with SITA is so exciting. It means global reach at the start of a new era. For travelers, it’s the end of rushing to wait. We’re freeing data to do what it can do when it’s trusted: Speed everything up, make everything simple.</p>
<p>But the technology we developed for the DTC is transformational for every industry, business operation, and service where identity and data need to be authenticated and trusted and where paper-based processes and traditional digital approaches are getting in the way of making things simple, efficient, and fast.</p>
<p>Because we’ve created the most powerful form of digital identity, that power can be used in so many innovative ways, big and small, to create better processes, products, and customer experiences. And because our solutions work on any system, we have an organic way to integrate identity and data across all sectors, creating spectacular new opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p>Travel is leading the way —&nbsp;but we are delivering exciting use cases from agriculture to AI, education to finance that are not far behind. Innovation in one use case feeds innovation in another. Suddenly, a landscape of borders — not just geographic and national — but sector and vertical, can be easily crossed. The digital world created by the internet is open when you can authenticate and trust. This is what we’re doing. And we’re tremendously excited about this investment because it helps to accelerate our development roadmap to deliver these benefits to all.</p>
<p>Indicio has distinguished itself by making our customers’ ideas become a reality. Our team members are world-class visioneers. So watch this space as we accelerate — and drop us a line if you’d like us to make your vision for a smarter, smoother, safer world real too.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Heather Dahl</p>

 Stakers can claim DF79 rewards. DF80 runs Mar 7 — Mar 14,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 79 (DF79) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am February 29, 2024 and ended 12:01 am March 7. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF80 is live today, March 7. It concludes on March 14. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><blockquote>Heads up: for DF81 (starts Mar 14), OCEAN rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF80   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF80 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>In this episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast, host Mathieu Glaude, alongside Hakan Yildiz from <a href="https://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> and Vladimir Simjanoski from <a href="https://www.blokverse.com/">Blokverse</a>, engage in an insightful examination of the intricate world of digital credential protocols, including Aries, OpenID4VC, ISO, and KERI. This episode is a treasure trove of insights on the future of digital identities, focusing on interoperability, privacy, and combating challenges like deepfakes.</p>
<p>The discussion begins by comparing digital credential exchange protocols and their applicability in varying contexts, from government-issued digital identities to private-sector applications. A highlight is the exploration of the architectural models—server-client vs. peer-to-peer—and their impact on the scalability and privacy of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Privacy considerations take center stage, especially concerning surveillance and data-sharing autonomy. The episode also tackles the critical issue of deepfakes, proposing enhanced content authenticity through digital credentials as a solution.</p>
<p>Interoperability emerges as a central theme, with a vision of wallets supporting multiple protocols to facilitate diverse interactions between issuers, holders, and verifiers. This flexibility is seen as key to the widespread adoption of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Mathieu invites listeners to actively participate in shaping the future of digital credential protocols by joining the Trust over IP Foundation’s Credential Exchange Protocol Task Force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast is a must-listen for anyone interested in the future of digital identities and the role of technology in securing and verifying digital credentials.</p>

<p>Startups build ad-hoc IAM systems, a tangled mess of spreadsheets, emails, and memory traces in the brains of the team members. As organizations grow, the tangles grow. Think about it:</p>
 
 When a new hire joins, how easy is it to get them productive? How long does it take until they’ve been given access to everything they need?&nbsp; 
 When it’s time for a compliance audit, do you need to sweat over spreadsheets, check multiple app interfaces, and comb through email chains, hoping you don’t miss something?&nbsp; 
 Is “Shadow IT” growing? When well-meaning employees start using convenient new apps, are they bypassing IT? Or does IT maintain visibility and control without bureaucracy?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Is offboarding easy? When someone leaves, can you quickly cut access to all the apps they used while retaining access to the data they created?&nbsp; 
 
<p>Cheer up! Things will get worse.</p>
<p>As your company grows and your tech stack gets more complex, whatever chaos you had will get worse. Why?</p>
 
 You’re juggling multiple playbooks. One spreadsheet for onboarding, a checklist for audits, a half-remembered process for software requests. 
 Time becomes essential. Onboarding tasks, regular access reviews, or even handling forgotten password resets shouldn’t rely on your memory. 
 Your processes aren’t static. New apps get adopted, rules change, one-off issues reveal cracks in your workflows. Updating your playbooks becomes a time-consuming chore. 
 Your organization changes. New groups appear. Old groups merge. Consultants, temps, and suppliers need access 
 Collaboration is a nightmare. Chasing down other teams to get tasks done, sending reminders, consolidating responses, and hoping they update the results in the right place… it turns your attempted efficiency into another massive time suck. 
 
<p>The YeshID Difference: One Playbook, Total Control</p>
<p>Now imagine this:</p>
 
 Effortless orchestration: A new employee begins, and your centralized YeshID playbook spins into action. Accounts are created, exploiting the best available integrations. For anything without an integration, YeshID creates tasks with clear owners and deadlines. Task reminders? Automatically sent to the right department. You get progress reports, not a growing sense of dread. 
 Compliance is no sweat: Audit looming? YeshID pulls who has access to what and current settings across every supported app, then surveys users and managers to verify who truly needs what access. Reports become accurate and stress-free. 
 Offboarding without the panic: Employee departs, and your playbook cuts off access to integrated apps instantly. It also generates tasks with clear owners for everything else, ensuring no security holes slip through the cracks. 
 A playbook that evolves with you: YeshID is your adaptable IT brain. It leverages your IAM, automates manual steps, sends timely reminders, and handles approvals across teams. Change a process? Update the playbook, and everyone instantly follows the latest version. 
 
<p>Sound too good to be true? Let YeshID be your partner in keeping your identity and access management realm simple, effective, and secure. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Get YeshID Onboard for free</a> and start today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As businesses adapt to the evolving digital landscape, cloud migration became an important step toward achieving greater <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing-benefits">efficiency, scalability and security</a>. Cloud migration is the process of transferring data, applications and on-premises infrastructure to a cloud computing environment. This shift involves a fundamental change in the way a company operates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why migrate to the cloud?&nbsp; 



<p>There are many reasons for migrating from on-premises infrastructure to cloud. Businesses are increasingly embracing cloud infrastructure due to its scalability, flexibility and cost-effectiveness, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing-benefits">among other benefits</a>. Recent statistics indicate a significant rise in companies adopting cloud services to meet their operational and cost saving needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud-based collaboration tools enable team members to work together from diverse locations, enhancing productivity and enabling remote work. Cloud migration can also help reduce a business’s carbon footprint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, cloud providers regularly update their services, supplying access to the latest features, security patches and technology advancements.&nbsp;</p>



 Types of cloud migration&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The specific strategies and scenarios for cloud adoption and migration depend on the needs of the organization and its current IT infrastructure. It is important to understand the cloud migration best practices for effective execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Complete data center migration involves the transmission of all company data to the cloud.&nbsp; This migration approach is favored when businesses seek to fully use the benefits of the cloud, including scalability, flexibility and advanced features. By transferring all data and operations to the cloud, organizations can reduce operational costs and retire traditional on-premises setups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hybrid cloud migration is relocating a portion of resources to the cloud while keeping some data on-premises. This approach suits scenarios where businesses have specific data compliance needs, keeping sensitive or critical data on-premises while leveraging the cloud for other operations. The hybrid model allows organizations to gradually transition to the cloud, managing risks associated with a complete migration while benefiting from cloud scalability and flexibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud-to-cloud migration occurs when organizations move resources from one cloud to another. This migration type is driven by the pursuit of cost efficiency or for better security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multicloud migration is a strategic approach that involves utilizing services or resources from multiple cloud service providers. Multicloud environments range from leveraging software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions for portability to orchestrating enterprise applications across various platform-as-a-service (PaaS) or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings from leading cloud vendors like Amazon Web services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), through a centralized management console.&nbsp;</p>



 Cloud migration strategies&nbsp; 



<p>There are several types of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration">cloud migration strategies</a> that organizations employ, based on their specific needs. These include rehosting, re-platforming, refactoring, repurchasing and retiring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Rehosting&nbsp; 



<p>Rehosting, also known as Lift and Shift, involves moving applications from an on-premises environment to the cloud without making significant changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Re-platforming&nbsp; 



<p>With a re-platforming migration, some adjustments or optimizations are made to the applications before moving them to the cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Refactoring&nbsp; 



<p>Refactoring involves modifying or redesigning applications to fully leverage cloud-native features. This migration type often involves breaking down monolithic applications into microservices, making them more scalable in the cloud environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Repurchasing&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Repurchasing involves retiring an existing application and replacing it with a SaaS alternative. Instead of migrating the application to the cloud, businesses opt for a cloud-based SaaS solution that meets their needs. </p>



 Retiring&nbsp; 



<p>Retiring involves decommissioning outdated or unused applications as part of the migration process. This helps in reducing maintenance costs and eliminating redundant resources.&nbsp;</p>



 Common cloud migration challenges&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Performance bottlenecks&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Performance bottlenecks particularly occur during the testing phase when migrated resources are validated, which can pose a significant challenge during cloud migrations. The transition to a cloud environment can introduce differences in performance compared to on-premises setups, necessitating careful identification of bottlenecks, latency, issues and other performance-related challenges. Successfully addressing these issues during testing is essential to make sure that applications and services operate smoothly post-migration, minimizing disruptions and maintaining optimal performance for end-users.&nbsp;</p>



 Cost overruns&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Estimating and controlling expenses throughout a cloud migration and beyond is hard work. Although cloud services can offer long-term cost savings, the initial migration phase often incurs significant expenses related to data transfer, re-architecture and training. Additionally, without proper monitoring and optimization, ongoing cloud usage costs can escalate rapidly, leading to budget overruns and financial strain. To address this challenge, organizations must implement robust cost management strategies, leveraging cost optimization tools and continuously monitor and adjust their cloud resources to promote cost-efficiency and alignment with business objectives.&nbsp;</p>



 Time and resource commitment&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Achieving a successful cloud migration entails significant time and resource commitment due to the intricate nature of cloud migration projects. These endeavors demand meticulous planning, extensive testing and skilled personnel, all of which can strain an organization’s resources and divert attention from other critical business initiatives. Without adequate planning and resource allocation, businesses may face disruptions to operations and potential project failure, emphasizing the importance of careful consideration and investment in cloud migration initiatives.&nbsp;</p>



 Scalability and performance&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Scalability and performance present notable challenges for cloud migrations, despite the inherent scalability benefits of cloud computing. It’s critical to make sure that the selected cloud solution can effectively manage the increasing volumes of data and processing demands, both at present and as the business expands. For instance, a rapidly growing online gaming company migrating to the cloud for scalability might encounter issues if auto-scaling features are not configured optimally. This could result in subpar performance or unexpectedly high costs during peak traffic periods, highlighting the importance of thorough planning and testing for seamless scalability and performance in the cloud environment.&nbsp;</p>



 Vendor lock-in&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Vendor lock-in causes organizations to risk becoming dependent on a single cloud provider’s proprietary services, APIs and pricing models. This dependency can limit flexibility, hinger innovation and cause costs to increase over time. Moreover, transitioning away from a cloud provider can be complex and costly because of data transfer fees, re-architecture efforts and potential app rewrites. To mitigate this risk, you must carefully consider your cloud strategy, adopt multi-cloud or hybrid cloud architectures and implement cloud-agnostic solutions wherever possible to maintain flexibility and avoid being locked into any one cloud vendor’s ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Service disruption&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Due to the complexity of transitioning mission-critical applications and services during a migration from on-premises to the cloud, service disruptions pose a significant challenge. Migrating workloads from on-premises data centers to the cloud often involves reconfiguring network settings, transferring large volumes of data and adapting to new cloud-native architectures. During this transition, any interruptions or downtime can lead to lost revenue, decreased productivity and damage to your organization’s reputation. You must safeguard seamless continuous service to minimize disruptions and maintain business operations throughout the migration process.&nbsp;</p>



 How to avoid cloud migration challenges&nbsp; 



<p>There are many benefits to cloud migration but that doesn’t mean the cloud migration process is not without its own challenges. A well-developed strategic approach is crucial for a smooth migration and to navigate potential challenges, but a strategic approach alone is not enough to avoid the associated challenges. What’s needed is a comprehensive solution that not only manages, automates and continuously optimizes your cloud environment in real-time but also helps you in planning and executing a successful cloud migration, whether you are transitioning from on-premises to the cloud or migrating between cloud providers. IBM® Turbonomic® supports your cloud provider, whether it’s private or public cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With IBM Turbonomic you can avoid many challenges associated with cloud migrations, like&nbsp;</p>



 
 Service disruptions: Dynamically optimizes workloads performance and resource allocation for uninterrupted operations&nbsp; 



 Vendor lock-in: Provides insights and recommendations for workload placement across multiple cloud providers, reducing dependency on any single vendor’s ecosystem.&nbsp; 



 Cost overruns: Continuously optimizes resource utilization and provides insights to help control cloud spending (during a migration and after).&nbsp; 



 Time and resource commitments: Automates workload placement and optimization, reducing manual effort and streamlining the migration process.&nbsp; 



 Performance bottlenecks: Dynamically identifying and addressing workload performance issues for smooth operation post-migration.&nbsp; 
 



 IBM Turbonomic What-If Planning: cloud migration edition&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>IBM Turbonomic makes sure your cloud migration runs smoothly no matter what challenges are thrown your way, but what makes the platform special is its ability to run What-If planning scenarios. IBM Turbonomic has a plan specifically tailored for cloud migrations called ‘Migrate to Cloud’, offering invaluable foresight and strategic insight for a seamless transition to the cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plan simulates the migration of on premises virtual machines (VMs) to the cloud, or the migration of VMs from one cloud provider to another. This plan focuses on performance and cost optimization by selecting the most suitable cloud resources for your VMs and their associated volumes. Additionally, the plan can recommend cost-savings measures such as transitioning workloads from on-demand to discounted pricing and purchasing more discounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘Migrate to Cloud’ plan calculates costs based on your negotiated billing and price adjustments with your cloud provider, covering compute, services (for example, IP services) and licensing fees. Additionally, the plan factors in discounted purchases for VMs eligible for discounted pricing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plan results show:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Projected costs&nbsp; 



 Actions to execute your migration and optimize costs and performance&nbsp; 



 Optimal cloud instances to use, combining efficient purchase of resources with assured application performance&nbsp; 



 The cost benefit of moving workloads from on-demand to discounted pricing&nbsp; 



 Discounts you should purchase&nbsp; 
 



<p>Turbonomic shows results for two migration scenarios, Lift and Shift and an optimized cloud migration. For the Lift and Shift results, Turbonomic shows the migration of your VMs to cloud instances that match their current resource allocations. As for the optimized plan, Turbonomic actively seeks opportunities to optimize both cost and performance. Through the analysis of historical VM resource utilization, Turbonomic discovers instances of over-provisioning. In an optimized migration scenario, Turbonomic will suggest transitioning these VMs to more cost-effective instances without compromising performance, showcasing the resulting cost savings. Furthermore, when examining the actions for an optimized migration, Turbonomic provides charts that plots the historical utilization data used in the analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By simulating cloud migrations, Turbonomic enables organizations to anticipate potential challenges, such as resource constraints or performance bottlenecks and proactively address them before implementation. This capability empowers businesses to optimize their migration plan and strategy, mitigate risks, reduce cloud costs and maximize the success of their cloud migration initiatives. With Turbonomic’s What-If planning, organizations can confidently navigate the complexities of cloud migration and achieve their desired outcomes with minimal disruption.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/why-we-need-diverse-multidisciplinary-coes-for-model-risk/">As my colleague Phaedra Boinodiris recently wrote</a>, “The importance of diversity in AI isn’t opinion, it’s math.” Referencing the <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Diversity_prediction_theorem">diversity prediction theorem</a>, she demonstrated how, when the diversity in a group is large, the error of the crowd is small. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0403723101"></a>Unfortunately, according to the <a href="https://ibm.co/women-leadership-2023">2023 IBM Institute for Business Value Women in Leadership</a> study, women only hold:</p>



 
 12% of C-suite and board-level positions 



 14% of senior VP positions 



 16% of VP or director positions 



 19% of senior manager positions 
 



<p>Even as we increase our C-suite presence year over year, we are not equally filling the leadership pipeline. This lack of a pipeline in the leadership funnel is an enormous problem, and a huge reason why the gap is growing. If we don’t start doing some things differently, the gap will never close.</p>



<p>This year’s report from the IBM Institute for Business Value, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/women-leadership-ai">Forging the future with AI: Women can take the lead</a>, beautifully identifies what I believe are the right areas—including leadership, allyship, and risk-taking—to address the inequality we’re seeing. I believe the stories from other women leaders that are in this report will inspire women in the workforce to rise to the challenges and opportunities posed by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> and address current workplace dynamics. I know they inspire me.</p>

 Why women can—and must—lead generative AI 



<p>Addressing the challenges with gender inequality and making real change requires an intentional, continuous drumbeat from all of us, women and men. It must be an unrelenting commitment. And I think technology like generative AI can help us do this.</p>



<p>We are in the early days of the true, transformative impact of generative AI. The areas where generative AI is having a business impact right now—marketing, HR, and customer service—traditionally have more women in them. Additionally, the skillsets and attributes needed to cut through the confusion and implement generative AI—empathy, open communication, transparency, strategic vision—are attributes where women are, stereotypically, known to be stronger. Unfortunately, these <a href="https://ibm.co/women-leadership-2023">attributes are often undervalued in the workplace</a>, even though women are more often evaluated for them.</p>



<p>Am I saying that we play to stereotypes? Not quite. I’m saying that those characteristics are invaluable strengths that we should lean into. Our empathy, our listening and communication skills, and our strategic minds are positive characteristics that the world needs.</p>



<p>When you put these things together, there is this huge opportunity for women to step up. Now is the time to be bold and take those risks.</p>



 What is holding women back? 



<p>If we have this opportunity to close the gender gap, why isn’t it happening? Why are women more hesitant than men when it comes to adopting AI?</p>



<p>It is partly due to lack of representation. While 73% of business leaders believe having more women leadership is important for mitigating gender bias in AI, only 33% currently have a woman in charge of decision-making for AI strategy.<a>[1]</a> Then there are concerns about job security. As the report states, women claim to be more concerned about being replaced by AI, compared to their male counterparts (46% versus 37%), and 59% of women claim they are waiting for company policies to tell them how and where to adopt generative AI.</p>



<p>There isn’t a single barrier, and there isn’t a single solution. But it’s clear to me that three big blockers are inconsistent leadership strategies, women as the minority (also known as a lack of diversity), and a lack of male allies. Unfortunately, these factors fuel each other and contribute to this vicious cycle that widens the gender gap.</p>



 What will help break the vicious cycle? 



<p>Forget gender and AI for a second. Take any situation in which you are the minority. It’s more difficult to speak up, to be heard, and to feel valued. It’s hard for any minority to stand up and take risks. For women in business, especially in tech, we are often the minority in the room. As we start to see more women around us, it will be easier, safer, to share our points of view.</p>



<p>How do we get more women in the room? Intentional leadership, to start. Not only hiring more qualified women but creating workplaces and roles that are appealing to women. When planning meetings, putting together a panel of speakers, or brainstorming projects, ask yourself: Are women equally represented in the room? Are we elevating women’s voices and ideas as much as their male counterparts?</p>



<p>It may be an unpopular belief, but yes, we do need our male colleagues to help us with closing this gap. This is true of those who are leaders, but also those who can be allies. They can help promote us, give us the floor to speak, ensure that we are heard. For women, if you don’t have male allies, you need to find them.</p>



 Connecting all the pieces 



<p>As I mentioned, this is a puzzle. There is no silver bullet or step-by-step recipe to follow. There are pieces to fit together to close the gap. If we don’t make the necessary changes, the gap will widen. But closing it is a process. Luckily, the current environment is increasingly conducive to making these changes. More people are listening. It’s no longer a secret problem.</p>



<p>The puzzle pieces are now being illuminated by the light of day and we need ‘all hands on deck’ to solve for the full picture. As I see it, some of those key puzzle pieces are:</p>



 Executive leadership 



<p>It starts at the top: Leadership must realize this is an issue and set the stage. They need to be even more intentional and give their strategies real teeth.</p>



 Allyship 



<p>Women: Find male allies! Men: Be allies to the women around you. When male allies are in place, they can lift women’s voices and give added support to our perspectives in a way that is harder to do when you’re the minority.</p>



 Bold women willing to take risks 



<p>Leadership and allyship are not enough. There is an onus on women to be bolder and take more risks. As the IBM Institute for Business Value report illustrates, men are looking at generative AI to advance their careers, while women are looking at it as a way to keep our jobs. That alone leads to an enormous difference in how we approach learning and implementing generative AI.</p>



<p>As leadership support, male allies, and opportunities fill the room around us, we need to lean in. Is it scary? Sure. It’s tough, but so are women. We are resilient.</p>



<p>I think of my mother. She’s my hero, my superhero. She has the highest EQ of anyone I’ve ever known. Very giving, very perceptive, very in tune with others. And even she would say, “People cannot read your mind.” She taught us to speak up, to follow our passions, set our goals, and work hard to achieve them. And very importantly, to not accept ‘no’ as the final answer. That is the resilience and toughness I got from her.</p>



<p>As women, we need to lean into our resilience and innate strength. It is on us to be bolder, to take those opportunities and speak up. When it comes to being innovative and taking risks, if we fall or fail, we need to stay focused on the goals we set. Get back up, do what you need to do, help lift other women along the way.</p>



<p>Those are pieces of the puzzle we can control for ourselves: hard work, confidence, faith or mindfulness, resilience. And of course, the choice to pay it forward for the next wave of women leaders.</p>

<p>Reusable credentials leverage ground-breaking decentralized identity and blockchain technology to create a cryptographically protected&nbsp;digital ID that is persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. The same credential ecosystem creates proof of identity for any customer interaction with the credit union.</p>



<p>While planning your visit to D.C. and all of the key sessions and events, why not schedule a one-on-one meeting with the team from Anonyome Labs, where we’ll show you exactly how reusable credentials can work for your institution and, as a bonus, give you access to our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.” This valuable tool will be a great resource to take back home to your credit union team for review.</p>



<p>We are excited to also share that on Day 4 of the conference (March 6), you can catch our team during an exclusive interview with Anonyome Labs’ VP of Sales, Matt Ure, on CU Broadcast Hosted by Mike Lawson.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is proud to be a sponsor of the first America’s Credit Unions GAC, the massive in-person and online event highlighting the meaningful work credit unions do to improve the financial well-being of their members and communities. This year’s program includes keynotes by former U.K. Prime Minister, The Rt Hon Theresa May MP, and renowned actor-humanitarian Gary Sinise.</p>



<p>Don’t miss this important opportunity to advance the credit union industry with the latest innovations and offerings. &nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll find the team from Anonyome Labs in the industry hall of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center every day of the conference, March 3 to 7. Come say hi!</p>

 Bot detection is essential for identifying nonhuman traffic on websites, mobile apps, and APIs, protecting against threats like account takeovers, transaction abuse, and denial of service attacks. With the bot detection market expected to grow from $667 million in 2023 to $3.6 billion by 2033, at an 18.3% CAGR, according to <a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/bot-security-market">Future Market Insights</a>, the demand for such technologies is rapidly increasing. This growth is driven by the anticipated rise in beneficial bots, such as AI agents and search engine crawlers, and harmful bots, which can cause significant disruptions and fraud. To address these challenges, leading providers are developing advanced solutions beyond traditional firewalls, incorporating behavioral analysis and device risk signals to identify and block malicious bots more effectively. 



 







 Evolving Threats and Modern Defenses Against Bots 



<p>The bot detection solutions market is evolving rapidly to address the growing sophistication of bots and the expansion of threat vectors. Vendors leveraging behavioral signals are well-positioned to dominate a market facing complex challenges from advanced bot activities and diverse threats. As fraudsters employ artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to launch sophisticated bot attacks, solution providers are countering with passive detection methods that emphasize user experience while effectively identifying bots. According to the <a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/bad-bot-report/">Imperva Bad Bot Report</a>, about two-thirds of bots in 2022 were highly sophisticated malicious bots, the highest level ever recorded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern defenses include behavioral biometrics and device signals, moving from traditional firewalls and CAPTCHAs to more subtle, low-friction detection techniques like analyzing mouse movements and keystroke dynamics. The scope of bot detection has broadened from focusing mainly on account takeovers and transaction abuse to addressing emerging threats like programmatic ad fraud, social media fraud, and asset theft in gaming. With the rise of beneficial AI agents, distinguishing between helpful and harmful bots has become paramount, highlighting the importance of sophisticated bot detection solutions that can navigate the nuanced landscape of modern cyber threats.</p>



 The Importance of Bot Detection Across Use Cases 



<p>Bot detection serves multiple use cases, including thwarting and identifying account takeovers, web scraping, transaction abuse, programmatic ad fraud, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, such as:</p>



 
 Account Takeover Protection 



 Web Scraping Detection 



 Transaction Abuse Prevention 



 Programmatic Ad Fraud Detection 



 Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention

 The Urgent Need for Bot Detection 



<p>Businesses across various sectors, particularly the advertising industry, are becoming acutely aware of the financial losses attributed to malicious bot activities. Advertisers’ growing concerns over the legitimacy of website impressions have driven publishers towards adopting bot detection technologies, highlighting a pivotal shift towards ensuring the integrity of digital advertising practices. This awareness has led to an escalated demand for sophisticated bot detection solutions to safeguard against escalating financial threats. The evolution of bots, marked by their sophistication and the diversification of threat vectors beyond traditional attacks like denial of service (DoS) and account takeovers (ATO), has made them a tool for exploitation in more complex fraud schemes. Consequently, the necessity for accurate and authentic web traffic metrics has never been more critical.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kasada.io/2023-state-of-bot-mitigation/">96% of Organizations Faced Financial Losses Due to Bots</a>: Leading to company-wide mandates to reduce the risk of bot attacks such as account takeovers and transaction abuse.&nbsp; 



 $84 Billion in Digital Advertising Fraud: In 2023, <a href="https://www.ana.net/miccontent/show/id/er-tv-may19-whiteops">digital advertising fraud amounted to $84 billion</a> and is projected to escalate to $172 billion by 2028 due to rising bot activity. 



 69% Increase in CTV Bot Fraud: In 2022, bot fraud in Connected TV (CTV) surged, <a href="https://doubleverify.com/newsroom/ctv-ad-fraud-surges-with-a-69-increase-in-bot-fraud-in-2022-and-significant-growth-in-ctv-fraud-schemes">leading to inflated video ad impressions</a>. This rise is part of broader trends in emerging fraud vectors, including programmatic ad fraud and AI-generated fraud on social media. 



 <a href="https://artsci.wustl.edu/ampersand/are-bots-winning-war-control-social-media">Estimated 68% of Twitter Users are Bots</a>: This highlights concerns over first-party fraud risk and misinformation spread, urging social media companies to implement robust bot mitigation strategies. 



 <a href="https://cmosurvey.org/">57% of Marketing Campaign Spending on Digital Channels in 2022</a>: With rapid growth expected, advertisers are emphasizing the need for bot detection to ensure traffic legitimacy. 



 Publishers Moving to First-Party Ad Strategies: Due to Chrome’s cookie deprecation, there’s a heightened demand from publishers for accurate user metrics. 
 



 How Bot Detection Works 



<p>Upon the arrival of website traffic, a web application firewall serves as the first line of defense as traffic progresses through the login flow – detection analysis is informed by passive signals such as mouse and keystroke dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Hundreds of keynotes and sessions in six tracks are awaiting you. While the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">agenda</a> is already far developed, there still will be some additions. Anyway, time to have a look at the agenda. I did and selected ten favorite sessions from that long list.</p>
<p>In the morning of June 4th, one of the pre-conference sessions is the EIC2024 Decentralized ID Deployment Bootcamp. The first part of it is about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5479/1">Decentralized ID Basics, Trends &amp; Adoption: Strategic Insights Sprint for Executives</a>. Run by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3037">Dominik Beron</a>, CEO of walt.id, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1568">Drs. Jacoba C. Sieders</a>, independent consultant, and me, we will look at where decentralized identity stands and how we expect this to evolve. The session will provide you with the understanding about everything you need to know about decentralized identity for the many other conference sessions around this topic, including eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDI wallet. A great start to the conference and a good reason for travelling in early.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of June 4th, you must not miss the keynote of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3419">Dr. Moritz Heuberger</a>, Advisor to the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community, on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5490">eIDAS 2.0 in Germany: Progress, Impact, Challenges</a>. With the European Parliament just recently voting for eIDAS 2.0, it is now about making it a reality.</p>
<p>Another highlight session on this subject is the panel on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5510/1">Latest on eIDAS Legislation and What it Means for People, Business and Government</a>. Here, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3462">Dr. Rob Brand</a> from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, Dr. Moritz Heuberger, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3453">Vedran Lalic</a>, Head of Office at European Parliament, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3243">Viky Manaila</a>, Trust Services Director at Intesi Group, will look at the eIDAS regulations and its impact.</p>
<p>Another important theme at EIC is what I have named “AIdentity”, the intersection of AI and Identity. One of the sessions you should attend is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/775">Dr. Scott David</a> will lead a panel including <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/368">Joe Andrieu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/709">Joni Brennan</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3447">Wenjing Chu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3515">Lynn Parker Dupree</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3507">Anil John</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2786">Nick Mothershaw</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/626">Drummond Reed</a>. AIdentity is one of the big challenges to address, with digital doubles (or twins) acting on our behalf.</p>
<p>One more session around Decentralized Identity you must not miss is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5590/1">The Wallets we Want</a>. There will be wallets. But will this be the wallets we (the consumers) want? Listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2874">Daniel Goldscheider</a> from the OpenWallet Foundation, Anil John, Technical Director of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3241">Paolo de Rosa</a>, Policy Officer at the European Commission, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3556">Dr. Pramod Varma</a>, CTO of the EkStep Foundation and former Chief Architect of Aadhaar.</p>
<p>The intersection of traditional CIAM and future decentralized identity will be the topic of the panel Panel: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5602/3">Decentralized Identity for Onboarding and CIAM</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1582">Daniel Buchner</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3513">Nick Lambert</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3129">Rob Otto,</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3554">Nick Price</a> will look at how CIAM can benefit from decentralized identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1005">Martin Sandren</a>, IAM Product Lead at IKEA, will talk on June 6th about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5608/2">Passkeys in the Enterprise</a>. This is a talk from practice about passkeys, a means for authenticating to services that is becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Another brilliant speaker is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3401">Emilie van der Lande</a>. She will talk about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5614/1">AI's Shadow Realm: Navigating the Ethical Abyss</a>. Her talk is about the multifaceted ethical, social and technical challenges that emerge as AI systems become increasingly integral to our daily lives.</p>
<p>As many know, I’m an advocate of policy-based access control (PBAC), authorization, and just-in-time access. In the panel <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5615/2">Why Authorization Standardization is Imperative</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/924">Allan Foster</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/675">David Brossard</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/589">Gerry Gebel</a> will talk about standardization for authorization and how to finally deliver on the promise that XACML once held.</p>
<p>While EIC 2024 is at the forefront of the global Identity Management evolution, you will also find a lot of down-to-earth topics on the agenda. One I want to highlight is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5699/2">Best Practices for Resynchronizing AD and Entra ID After Forest Recovery</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3542">Jorge de Almeida Pinto</a> will talk about this. In an age of ever-increasing cyberattacks, we must prepare for disaster. Thus, we must improve our recovery skills.</p>
<p>EIC 2024, as always, stands for both though leadership and best practices. Have a look at the agenda and don’t miss the prime discount – book latest on March 8th to benefit from the special price. EIC, as always, will be a fully hybrid event. If you ever can’t join in Berlin or not for the full four days, you still can join EIC and enjoy the great sessions and speakers.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> There is no such thing as Privacy 
<p>In 1999, the then CEO of Sun Microsystem Scott McNealy famously said, "<a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/sun-on-privacy-get-over-it/">You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it</a>."&nbsp; In 2008, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm">TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson published his bank account details</a> after rubbishing the furore over the loss of 25 million people's personal details on two computer discs and subsequently lost money.&nbsp; Now we have reams of data protection regulations and laws, but was Scott McNealy right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1:&nbsp;An image generated by AI - Is this the future of privacy on the internet?</p>
 What is Privacy? 
<p>Different groups of people and societies consider different aspects of their life to be private. For example, while there has been concern that teenagers don’t appreciate the privacy implications of what they post on social media, a <a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communities-murphy-marwick-2014.pdf">UK study</a> found “…[they] are less disturbed by abstract invasions of privacy by government agencies and corporations than the very real and ever-present experience of trying to negotiate privacy in light of nosy parents.”</p>
<p>In Europe, the notion of privacy developed to counter the way governments had used personal data to identify and oppress individuals during the first half of the twentieth century. This led to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - “<a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/law-reference/european-convention-human-rights-article-8-0#:~:text=1%20Everyone%20has%20the%20right,his%20home%20and%20his%20correspondence.">Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence</a>.”</p>
<p>This legislation was conceived when only governments had the resources to collect and process data about large numbers of people and punched cards were state-of-the-art data processing technology.</p>
 GDPR, Schrems II and EU-US Data Privacy Framework 
<p>EU data protection has evolved over time. In 1995 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31995L0046">EU Directive (EC/95/46)</a> was enacted to enable the free flow of personal information between member states. In 2018 this was superseded by the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a>.&nbsp; In 2020 a law student, Maximilian Schrems, brought a case against Facebook objecting to Facebook transferring his personal data to the US. The so called <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II judgement</a> invalidated the the EU-US Data Protection Shield and led to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework which was <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en">approved by the European Commission on 10th July 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This long running saga revolved around access by the US Government to personal data of EU residents and whether the safeguards around the use of this data were equivalent in the US to those in the EU.&nbsp; So, it was really all about government access.</p>
<p>These regulations have obliged organizations and cloud service providers to adopt complex technical and legal measures to protect the personal data that they hold.</p>
<p>Properly protecting this data is a good thing but does it ensure privacy?&nbsp; Is it any more effective than the toilet brush in Figure 1?</p>
 Data is the New Capital 
<p>The last twenty years have seen a massive explosion in the amount of data that can be collected, stored, and processed.&nbsp; Digital technology and the internet have made this possible and cloud services have made this affordable.&nbsp; Data analytics, Machine Learning and AI, in turn, have made this data extremely valuable.&nbsp; Data is the new capital.</p>
<p>Data has always been a valuable asset. The Rothschild’s family fortune was initially made by arranging to be the first to know the outcome of the battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; Analysis of deaths and disease in the 18th and 19th centuries underpinned financial services such as life insurance and annuities.</p>
<p>Although social media is often cited as the cause of the data explosion, its roots can be traced earlier.</p>
<p>In 1989 a husband-and-wife team set up a <a href="https://www.dunnhumby.com/united-kingdom/">data analytics company</a> in their home in Chiswick in London. Their approach involved understanding how to retain customers by analyzing their shopping behavior—what they referred to as being&nbsp;“voyeurs of the shopping basket.” &nbsp;&nbsp;This led to the development of customer loyalty cards.</p>
<p>The data collected by these cards provide the retailer with a deep insight into the buying habits of their customers. This data helps them to optimize the products stocked in individual stores, to identify premium customers, and, <a href="https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningtimes/target-really-predict-teens-pregnancy-inside-story/3566/">it is claimed</a>, even work out when a customer is pregnant.</p>
<p>At the start of the COVID pandemic, UK supermarkets used this data to identify and offer support to vulnerable customers before the government.</p>
<p>The person using these cards agrees to provide intimate details of their lives in return for some loyalty benefits. For retail customers, these details include dietary habits, indicators of their health problems through the purchase of off-the-shelf medication and their sexual activity.&nbsp; For hospitality cards, the data provides insights into the card holder’s travel, location, preferences, and companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, people can choose to reveal their personal information in return for some rewards and data protection laws obliging the organizations that collect this data to protect it and limit how it is used.</p>
 Anonymity 
<p>While people knowingly disclose some personal data there is also a large amount of data about them that they may not be aware of. &nbsp;For example, the internet contains millions of images of peoples’ faces uploaded to social media, published on news websites, and other open sources.&nbsp; This includes people who may not have been the main subject of a photo but who were in the background.&nbsp; This data can be used by AI facial recognition technology to identify individuals from data that they did not even know existed.&nbsp; Is this fair and if so, how should we use this data?</p>
<p>The firm <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/">Clearview AI</a> has developed a facial recognition system that they claim can help law enforcement to identify suspects, witnesses, and victims.&nbsp; They also claim this technology has helped find child predators, rescue victims, and track down the suspects involved in the Capitol Riots.</p>
<p>These are laudable aims but not every country’s data privacy laws support this approach. In 2022, the UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) fined Clearview AI £7.5M for allegedly unlawfully storing facial images.&nbsp; In November 2023, this fine was overturned in a <a href="https://assets.caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2023/819/ukftt_grc_2023_819.pdf">judgement by the First Tier Tribunal</a>.&nbsp; The ICO is now <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/11/information-commissioner-seeks-permission-to-appeal-clearview-ai-inc-ruling/">seeking permission to appeal</a> this judgement.&nbsp; There are <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2023/decision-austrian-sa-against-clearview-ai-infringements-articles-5-6-9-27_en">similar disputes within the EU</a>.</p>
<p>The Light of Other Days, a&nbsp;2000 science fiction novel&nbsp;written by&nbsp;Stephen Baxter, based on a synopsis by&nbsp;Arthur C. Clarke examines the impact on society of a quantum-based technology that allowed anyone to see and hear what was happening anywhere and at any time. This shattered all normal concepts of privacy. When people realized that they can be observed and can observe others without their knowledge it profoundly changed their behavior. While this allowed the perpetrators of crimes to be correctly identified and politicians’ plots to be uncovered, it altered society in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Today, the internet contains a vast amount of publicly available data about everyone as well as a history of everything they wrote and liked on social media – how will this change us?</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — February 21st to March&nbsp;4th <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we dive into Taiwan’s upcoming digital asset regulations, Russia’s FATF assessment, the US’s legislative push on crypto reporting, and the UK’s steps towards regulating stablecoins and staking services. Join us as we navigate these global shifts in the crypto regulatory landscape.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Shifts <p>Around the globe, countries are revisiting their regulatory stances on cryptocurrencies, marking a period of significant adaptation in response to the digital asset market’s expansion.</p><p>In Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is preparing to present new digital asset regulations by September 2024, focusing on investor protection and market integrity. This move is part of Taiwan’s broader effort to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of digital assets into the traditional financial ecosystem.</p><p>Another major development over the last two weeks came from Russia, as its standing with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has shifted due to perceived gaps in crypto oversight. Reportedly, the FATF’s assessment points to the need for clearer guidelines and definitions within Russia’s regulatory framework to monitor and control digital financial transactions effectively.</p><p>In North America, the United States is witnessing legislative efforts aimed at refining the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related services. Recent proposals challenge existing guidance on financial institutions’ reporting of crypto assets and seek to bolster the Secret Service’s capabilities in investigating crypto-related cybercrimes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UK is advancing towards implementing cryptocurrency regulations, with a focus on stablecoins and staking services.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1761086134405255416?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>These developments highlight a global trend towards recalibrating regulatory frameworks to better accommodate the unique aspects of digital assets. As countries grapple with the complexities of crypto regulation, the outcomes of these efforts will likely shape the future of digital&nbsp;finance.</p> Taiwan Sets September Deadline for Comprehensive Crypto Regulation <p>Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission is gearing up to introduce a draft of new digital asset regulations in September 2024, marking a significant step towards regulating the burgeoning digital asset market. The draft, as outlined by FSC Chairman Huang Tien-mu, aims to bolster market regulation and investor safety amidst concerns over the potential for fraud within the digital currency&nbsp;space.</p><p>The proposed legislation, including the Virtual Asset Management Bill introduced in October, seeks to enhance customer protection and industry oversight, imposing stiff penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Speaking of its possible impact on Taiwan’s crypto ecosystem, clearer regulations may attract more institutional investors, fostering a safer and more stable investment environment. On the downside, stringent measures and the potential for heavy fines could dampen innovation, especially among startups and smaller entities struggling with compliance costs.</p> US House Committee Challenges SEC&nbsp;Guidance <p>The US House Financial Services Committee has shown majority support to repeal the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which mandates financial institutions to list customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets. This guidance, criticized for potentially inflating balance sheets and hindering banks from engaging in digital asset custody, faces opposition for its implications on the sector’s operational dynamics.</p><p>Critics argue that SAB 121 limits traditional financial institutions’ participation in the burgeoning crypto market, especially in the context of the SEC’s approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, predominantly custodied by non-bank entities. On the flip side, proponents of the guidance advocate for its role in clarifying custody responsibilities amid the volatile crypto landscape.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">A Guide to Crypto Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Japan</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-philippines">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the Philippines</a></p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>We have all been witnessing the transformative power of generative artificial intelligence (AI), with the promise to reshape all aspects of human society and commerce while companies simultaneously grapple with acute business imperatives. In 2024, companies confront significant disruption, requiring them to redefine labor productivity to prevent unrealized revenue, safeguard the software supply chain from attacks, and embed sustainability into operations to maintain competitiveness.<br><br>AI is at a turning point, driving exponential advancements in an organization’s prosperity and growth. Generative AI (gen AI) introduces transformative innovation to all aspects of a business; from the front to the back office, through ongoing technology modernization, and into new product and service development.<br><br>While many organizations have implemented AI, the need to keep a competitive edge and foster business growth demands new approaches: simultaneously evolving AI strategies, showcasing their value, enhancing risk postures and adopting new engineering capabilities. This requires a holistic enterprise transformation. We refer to this transformation as becoming an AI+ enterprise.</p>



 Become an AI+ enterprise 



<p>An AI+ enterprise innovates with AI as the primary focus, understands that AI is fundamental to the entire business, and recognizes that AI impacts all aspects of the business: product innovation, business operations, technical operations, as well as people and culture.&nbsp;</p>



Figure 1: Transforming into an AI+ enterprise is at the core of what our team at IBM does



<p>An AI+ enterprise integrates AI as a first-class function across the business. They understand that if one area of the business adopts AI while others lag or resist it (due to valid concerns), this exacerbates issues like Shadow AI, making it challenging to implement a holistic strategy.</p>



 Benefits of being an AI+ enterprise 



<p>The vast business opportunity with AI, forecasted by Gartner to bring USD 3 to 4 trillion in economic benefits to the global economy across industries, prompts companies to recognize the investment required to use AI effectively, and are demanding a dramatic return on investment (ROI) before investing in an AI use case.</p>



<p>By becoming an AI+ enterprise, clients can realize the ROI not only for the AI use case but also for improving the related business and technical capabilities required to deliver AI use cases into production at scale.</p>



Figure 2: ROI potential by transforming into an AI+ enterprise



<p>Organizations with high data maturity that embed an AI+ transformation model into the enterprise fabric and culture can generate up to 2.6 times higher ROI.</p>



<p>IBM has developed AI+ Enterprise Transformation to equip clients with the business and technical strategy, architectures, roadmaps and hands-on experience to become an AI+ enterprise.</p>



 AI+ Enterprise Transformation 



<p>With IBM’s depth in AI and hybrid cloud, we have discovered that companies becoming an AI+ enterprise leads to faster realization of business results. What’s exciting is that many clients we work with are already excelling in AI, and by adopting AI+ Enterprise Transformation, they uncover activities that accelerate their business growth through running AI in production at scale.</p>



Figure 3: AI+ enterprise domain overview



<p>Figure 3 summarizes AI+ Enterprise Transformation, highlighting the multiple domains across the organization that an AI+ enterprise needs to address to bring AI to production at scale:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Key use cases that enhance business performance 



 Responsible AI technology to implement these use cases 



 A well-designed data foundation to fuel AI initiatives 



 Application innovation to deliver AI experiences, and application modernization to handle AI requests 



 Hybrid cloud platform, including integrations, to run AI, data and applications as required 



 Building pipelines for continuous updates, enhancements and fixes of apps, data and AI, with deployment protection through scanning and guardrails 



 Day-2 operations using AI to predict (and repair) failures before they happen, fostering a culture where employees embrace AI’s value instead of fearing replacement. 



 Security, governance, risk and compliance mechanisms are essential not only for governing AI but also for managing the IT estate running AI, providing evidence for regulatory compliance. 
 



 Start with the use cases 



<p>The most important step for an AI+ enterprise is identifying transformative use cases. After experimenting with various options, the enterprise selects high-value use cases that show faster ROI. It then delivers them into production across the IT landscape, laying the groundwork for additional use cases and fostering ongoing innovation.</p>



<p>Figure 4 illustrates the AI+ use case funnel that an AI+ enterprise adopts to systematically and rigorously transform use cases into broad-reaching AI enterprise solutions that deliver high ROI, aligned across delivery, operations, security and governance. &nbsp;</p>

 Harness the right AI technology 



<p>After identifying use cases, the next step for an AI+ enterprise is choosing the appropriate AI technology and architecture. Often, this decision is made too quickly. It should be approached thoughtfully to help ensure suitability.</p>



<p>Consider the following:</p>



 
 Do you need a public foundation model? 



 Should you build your own? If so, where will it run? 



 Should you use a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) model by pairing your data with a public foundation model? 



 Do you use gen AI out of the box? How can you master prompt engineering? When should you prompt-tune or fine-tune? 



 Which approach requires on-premises GPUs? 



 Where do you harness gen AI vs. predictive AI vs. AI orchestration? For instance, when automating password change requests, do you need a 175 billion parameter public foundation model, a fine-tuned smaller model, or AI orchestration to call APIs? 
 



<p>As you pinpoint your AI technology, your decision impacts the other domains of AI+ Enterprise Transformation. For more insights, keep reading.</p>



 Deliver a strong data foundation 



<p>AI relies fundamentally on data. An AI+ enterprise ensures that the data used for AI is trustworthy, transparent, and has clear lineage and efficacy. Otherwise, the risks become too significant. We have all seen examples of companies delivering AI built on weak data foundations, leading to undesirable outcomes. These outcomes typically fall into one of three categories, none of which are desirable:</p>



 
 Not useful: Customers remain unimpressed with your results. For example, stale data, hallucinations and more. 



 Embarrassing: Offensive output emerges based on the data used in AI. For example, hate, abuse, profanity and bias. 



 Financial/criminal: Violations of existing and emerging data and AI regulations. For example, copyright laws, the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence act, Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), data sovereignty laws and more. 
 



<p>An AI+ enterprise empowers architects to confidently source, prepare, transform, protect and deliver data to the required locations for AI.&nbsp;</p>



 Innovate and modernize applications 



<p>Innovating with new AI-based applications to deliver outstanding experiences is essential. It’s also crucial to modernize existing applications that interact with AI. if an AI-powered human resources assistant offers to perform actions for employees, it is vital to ensure that the application being called can handle increased traffic. Frequently, these actions involve calling APIs to legacy applications running on architectures unfit for handling the sudden demands of the AI assistant. This often leads to a disappointing experience due to slow response times.</p>



<p>An AI+ enterprise excels in delivering innovative AI applications to its customers and modernizing existing applications to meet the new demands AI presents.</p>



 Hybrid cloud platform 



<p>Once AI, data and applications are understood, the discussion naturally shifts to “Where do we run this solution?” In our experience, the answer depends on many factors, which can change over time, requiring a flexible platform.</p>



<p>Adopting an open technologies-based hybrid cloud platform enables an AI+ enterprise to make informed decisions without limiting its business.</p>



Figure 5: AI+ enterprise hybrid cloud architecture



<p>As shown in figure 5, a hybrid cloud architecture enhances the entire business in various ways:</p>



 
 Flexibility in where to train and tune large models 



 Flexibility in where to train and tune smaller models 



 Where to perform inferencing on-premises, in private clouds or even on edge devices 



 Applications using RAG architectures experience less latency when running close to the models 



 Data sovereignty laws limit data relocation, so having the ability to move AI and applications to the data is essential 



 Creating an AI+ fabric that provides interconnectivity across the IT and business landscape 
 



 Continuously build and enhance apps, data and AI 



<p>When AI, data and applications run across a well-designed hybrid cloud platform, an AI+ enterprise builds pipelines and toolchains to continuously enhance and deliver with full automation. For example:</p>



 
 Platform pipelines provision and update infrastructure and the software running on them using Terraform and Ansible 



 Application pipelines integrate and deliver code updates for both innovative applications delivering AI experiences and modernized applications being acted upon by AI digital workers 



 Data pipelines process incoming data to help ensure that the data sources used by AI are current and valid 



 AI pipelines pull in data, retrain and augment as needed based on metrics such as drift and accuracy 
 



<p>An AI+ enterprise knows how to continually enhance applications, data and AI models throughout their lifecycle, helping to ensure that only trusted and approved AI functions go live.</p>



 Operations 



<p>Incidents occur, even in an AI-first world. However, an AI+ enterprise uses AI not only to delight customers but also to solve IT problems. With the right tools, an AI+ enterprise can significantly increase employee productivity. Examples include:</p>



 
 Detecting and correcting when an application is being constrained and automating capacity increases 



 Providing visibility and insight across the enterprise to enable higher levels of automation and achieve predictive maintenance 



 Reducing security threats by closing security gaps before they arise. For example, by using compliance control scanning of terraform templates to fail provisioning if controls are not met. 
 



<p>An AI+ enterprise also recognizes that alongside the necessary tools, fostering a culture that embraces AI and trains talent is crucial. This culture encourages experimentation and expertise growth. It requires people trained to harness, evaluate, and accelerate AI, rather than fearing it.</p>



 Secure and govern AI on the hybrid cloud platform 



<p>To deploy AI, particularly gen AI, at scale in production, organizations must establish a secure and governed environment. The scale and impact of next-generation AI emphasize the importance of governance and risk controls. An AI+ enterprise mitigates potential harm by implementing robust measures to secure, monitor and explain AI models, as well as monitoring governance, risk and compliance controls across the hybrid cloud environment.</p>



<p>Pairing existing cloud governance with new AI governance controls is essential, requiring continual focus to comply with emerging regulatory changes, such as NIST AI Risk Management Framework, the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence act, ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management, and ISO/IEC 23894 AI Risk Management.</p>

This not only enhances the utility and accessibility of digital identities across different platforms but also significantly contributes to the creation of a more interconnected and interoperable blockchain ecosystem. Through cross-chain capabilities, the vision of a truly decentralized web, where digital identities are portable, secure, and universally accepted, becomes increasingly attainable, marking a crucial step towards achieving a cohesive digital&nbsp;world.</p> Verifiable Credentials Explained <p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are a cornerstone innovation in the realm of digital identity, enabling the secure and privacy-preserving verification of personal credentials. This technology uses cryptographic techniques to provide a tamper-proof layer of security, ensuring that credentials such as academic degrees, professional certifications, and KYC (Know Your Customer) information are authentic and have not been altered. VCs empower individuals by allowing them to prove their qualifications and identity attributes digitally, without the need to reveal excessive personal information. This streamlines various verification processes, making them more efficient and less invasive. For organizations, VCs reduce the risk of fraud, as the credentials can be directly verified against the blockchain, where they are immutably recorded. The adoption of VCs is a significant step forward in creating a more trustworthy and user-friendly digital world, where transactions and interactions are facilitated with ease and confidence.</p> NFTs in Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are revolutionizing the concept of digital identity by offering a unique and secure method to represent and verify online identities and assets. Unlike traditional digital assets, NFTs are unique, with each token having distinct characteristics and ownership records on the blockchain, making them irreplaceable and invaluable for asserting the authenticity and ownership of digital identities and assets. This unique property of NFTs can be harnessed to create digital passports, certificates, or any form of identity verification that requires indisputable proof of authenticity. Furthermore, NFTs can encapsulate user attributes and preferences, enabling personalized and secure interactions in the digital space. By expanding the utility of blockchain technology beyond its conventional applications, NFTs pave the way for innovative approaches to managing digital identities, ensuring a higher level of security, privacy, and control for users in the digital&nbsp;realm.</p> DeFi and Digital Identity Integration <p>The integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) with digital identity systems heralds a significant evolution in how financial transactions and services are conducted. By leveraging verified identity information within DeFi platforms, this integration ensures that financial operations are not only secure but also inherently transparent. It allows for a streamlined approach to accessing financial services, where individuals can utilize their digital identities to prove their credentials, manage assets, and engage in transactions without the traditional barriers imposed by centralized financial institutions. This fusion of DeFi with digital identity not only amplifies the trust and efficiency in financial ecosystems but also opens the door to innovative services tailored to individual needs and histories. Furthermore, it addresses significant concerns such as fraud, identity theft, and privacy, ensuring that individuals have full control over their financial and personal data. As such, the integration of DeFi and digital identity is set to redefine the landscape of financial services, making them more accessible, inclusive, and aligned with the ethos of a decentralized, user-centric digital&nbsp;world.</p> DID and AI: Harnessing Intelligent Identity Management <p>In the emerging AI era, the significance of authenticating human identity becomes paramount. The convergence of Decentralized Identity (DID) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces a future where intelligent identity management systems are essential. This integration not only streamlines identity verification through AI-driven fraud detection and privacy management but also personalizes user interactions via predictive analytics. Such advancements ensure that digital identities are managed with enhanced security and efficiency, marking a pivotal evolution towards safeguarding human identity in the digital domain against sophisticated threats.</p> DID and Real-World Assets: Bridging the Digital-Physical Divide <p>Decentralized Identity (DID) systems are revolutionizing the way we interact with real-world assets through blockchain technology, bridging the gap between digital and physical realms. By enabling the digital representation of physical assets through NFTs or tokenization, DID systems facilitate proof of ownership, provenance tracking, and secure and transparent asset transfers. This digital-physical linkage empowers users with immutable proof of ownership and the ability to seamlessly trade or verify the authenticity of assets ranging from real estate to artwork. As a result, DID systems are not only enhancing the security and efficiency of asset management but also opening up new avenues for investment, trading, and ownership in the digital&nbsp;age.</p> Future Directions in Decentralized Identity <p>The future of decentralized identity (DID) is poised for broad industry adoption, driven by advancements in privacy and cross-chain interoperability, fostering a user-centric and secure ecosystem. This evolution predicts a digital space where users have unparalleled control over their identities, facilitated by seamless, secure data and asset exchanges across blockchain platforms.

<p>If you’re in the technology sector (or really, if you’re involved in any business that relies on digital technology at all), you’ve likely heard the buzz around 5G. The latest high-speed cellular network standard is poised to transform wireless connectivity as we know it and usher in a new age of digital transformation.</p>



<p>Like any new technology, however, it’s wise to take a step back and consider the pros and cons before diving in. In this article, we’re going to look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of 5G networks so you can make an informed decision for your business.</p>



 What is 5G? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/5g">5G (fifth-generation mobile technology)</a> is the new standard for cellular networks. First released by mobile phone companies in 2019, it relies on radio frequencies for data transmission like its predecessors 3G, 4G and 4G LTE networks. However, improvements in latency and bandwidth give 5G certain advantages like lightning-fast download and upload speeds, improved connectivity, and greater reliability. &nbsp;</p>



 Why is 5G important? 



<p>In the four years since it burst onto the market, 5G has been widely touted as a disruptive technology, capable of transformation on a similar scale to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things&nbsp;(IoT)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a>. As mobile broadband technology expands, the amount of data generated every day is increasing exponentially to the point where 3G and 4G network infrastructures simply can’t handle it. Enter 5G, with its speedy download and upload times and wider bandwidths capable of handling much larger volumes of data.</p>



 Advantages of 5G technology 



<p>In addition to faster speeds and upload/download times, there are several other important differences between 5G and 3G/4G networks worth noting:</p>



 Smaller physical footprint 



<p>5G uses smaller transmitters than its predecessors, allowing for them to be placed discretely on buildings, inside trees or in other out-of-the-way places. The cells (or “small cells”) that wireless networks&nbsp;rely on for connectivity are also smaller in 5G networks and require less power to run.</p>



 Reduced error rates 



<p>5G’s adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)—a schematic for sending data from&nbsp;WiFi&nbsp;devices—is better than the MCS used in 4G and 3G. The result is that the Block Error Rate (BER), which is used for measuring the frequencies of errors in a network, is extremely low. On a 5G network, when the BER increases to a certain level, the transmitter lowers the connection speed until the error rate drops. Essentially, 5G networks trade speed for accuracy in&nbsp;real-time so their BER is always near zero. &nbsp;</p>



 Better bandwidth 



<p>5G networks can utilize a much broader range of bandwidths than previous networks. By expanding the spectrum of resources it can utilize from sub-3 GHz to 100 GHz and even higher, 5G’s range can include both lower and higher frequencies. This expands the network’s overall capacity and throughput by allowing it to function across a much wider spectrum of bandwidths, increasing the number of devices it can support at a time.</p>



 Lower latencies 



<p>5G’s low latency (the amount of time it takes data to travel from one point to another on a network) enables the speeds that make activities like downloading a file or interacting with the cloud 10x faster than on a 4G or 3G network. While&nbsp;4G networks deliver latencies of around 200&nbsp;milliseconds,&nbsp;5G networks routinely deliver them as low as a single&nbsp;millisecond.</p>



 Disadvantages of 5G 



<p>Like any emerging technology, there are as many reasons for caution with 5G as for excitement. Let’s take a look at some of the concerns preventing both consumers and enterprises from wholeheartedly embracing it. &nbsp;</p>



 Cybersecurity 



<p>While 5G’s algorithms are even more comprehensive than its predecessors, users are still vulnerable to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attacks">cyberattacks</a>. One area of concern is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">encryption</a>. While apps on 5G networks are encrypted, the 5G NR standard doesn’t have end-to-end encryption, leaving it open to certain kinds of attacks. &nbsp;</p>



 Network slicing 



<p>While network slicing is a popular feature of 5G networks, it’s also an area for vigilance. When creating a virtual network for a specific functionality, 5G software is exposed to hackers, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/malware">malware</a> and other potential breaches. Once a breach has occurred, malware or spyware has the potential to spread throughout a carrier’s infrastructure or networked devices, causing problems across whole enterprises. &nbsp;</p>



 Infrastructure 



<p>To move services and functionality onto a 5G network, businesses must weigh the cost and time needed to upgrade their equipment so it’s 5G compatible. This can be both time-consuming and expensive. Typically, an enterprise that has relied on 3G or 4G networks for some time has already made a large investment in their equipment. Replacing it and upskilling workers so they can deploy and maintain the new infrastructure presents a significant obstacle.</p>



 Gaps in coverage 



<p>With the rollout of 5G technology worldwide, many large urban areas now have 5G coverage. However, it’s important to note that 5G still isn’t everywhere and won’t be for a long time. Many remote areas, for example, don’t have a 5G connection or only offer limited coverage. Before companies upgrade to 5G they should take a look at where they plan on using it—especially if they operate in rural areas—to ensure they will have 5G coverage.</p>



 Penetration 



<p>The high-frequency radio waves that 5G signals travel on are easily blocked by common objects such as buildings and/or trees so ensuring seamless routes for the waves to travel can be a problem. Factories and offices present unique challenges that have caused some businesses to redesign facilities in a way that is more 5G network-friendly.</p>



 How does 5G technology work? 



<p>5G networks are divided into geographical sections known as cells. Within these cells, wireless devices like smartphones, tablets and computers connect to the internet or phone network by sending radio waves between a base station and an antennae. The underlying technology of a 5G network is the same as that of a 3G or 4G network, but its download speeds are much faster. Some 5G networks’ download speeds can reach as high as 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) if only a few devices are on the network.</p>



<p>As 5G technology reaches more and more customers and the number of applications that support it continues to grow, its popularity with telecommunications companies and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is also expected to increase. In North America, for example, the most popular ISPs for home internet—Verizon, Google and AT&amp;T—have already adopted it and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1133823/north-america-5g-subscriptions/">more than 200 million homes subscribe to it</a> (links resides outside ibm.com).</p>



<p>Three key functionalities set 5G technology apart: </p>



 
 Cellular standards 



 Network slicing  



 Private networks 
 



<p>Here’s a closer look at each of those areas, why they are unique to 5G and how they help the technology function.</p>



 New cellular standard 



<p>The 5G NR (New Radio) standard for cellular networks is the new radio access technology (RAT) specification built specifically for 5G mobile networks. In 2018, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3FPP) set out to develop a new global standard for mobile networks to guide the development of devices and applications on 5G networks. Today, cellular networks and manufacturers wishing to power or design 5G devices simply have to follow the 5G NR standard to be in compliance—increasing the ease and likelihood of 5G expansion. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/dataforecasts/network-coverage#:~:text=The%20build%2Dout%20of%205G,around%2085%20percent%20in%202029.">a recent report by&nbsp;Ericsson</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside ibm.com), 45% of networks worldwide were 5G compatible by the end of 2023, with that number forecasted to rise to 85% by the end of the decade.</p>



 Network slicing 



<p>On a 5G network, operators can deploy several independent virtual networks on the same infrastructure, powering numerous <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/telecom-cloud-network-slicing-enterprise-5g-opportunities/">business applications</a> and enabling users to do even more complex tasks remotely than they can today. For example, enterprises that want to divide up wireless functionality by use case or business model can form a “collection” on a 5G network. Collections give users on that network a more reliable, consistent experience on the mobile device of their choice than would have been possible in previous generations of wireless technology.</p>



 Private networks 



<p>5G technology allows users to create a private network with enhanced personalization features, such as secure access, improved quality control and added mobility. Because of these features, private 5G is fast becoming popular with global enterprises who want all the power and features of 5G but with added security layers for their business. Private&nbsp;5G networks&nbsp;let companies manage multiple devices, services and applications in a highly private, secure and efficient environment—more than any public network.&nbsp;</p>



 5G use cases 



<p>Now that we have a fuller picture of the pros and cons to consider when it comes to 5G and how the new technology works, let’s take a look at how it’s being applied in the real world.</p>



 
 Autonomous vehicles: Until 5G came along, fully autonomous cars couldn’t operate independently using the 3G and 4G networks available to them because the speed at which they needed to transmit and receive information wasn’t supported. 5G’s lightning-fast capabilities open up the possibility that in the near future, self-driving cars will be as ubiquitous as taxis and delivery trucks on roads everywhere. 



 Smart factories: With AI and ML, factories everywhere are already becoming smarter and more efficient. 5G will make even more leaps possible in the future, enabling the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> of more tasks, deployment of cameras and drones to do jobs that previously required a person, and the connection of thousands of smart devices to the internet. It’s dizzying to think of all the potential applications of 5G in the factory setting. This is one area where it is most likely to have a highly disruptive and transformative impact, potentially changing everything from the way fuel usage is measured and optimized, to the design of equipment lifecycles, to how goods are delivered to customers. 



 Smart cities: With 5G, urban areas will be able to accomplish everyday tasks like waste and air quality management far more efficiently than ever before. By deploying new <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of T</a>hings (IoT) devices connected to the Internet via 5G networks, cities can manage activities like traffic control, electricity management, waste disposal and even law enforcement with far more control than in the past. 



 Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR): Virtual reality&nbsp;(digital environments that shut out the real world) and&nbsp;augmented reality&nbsp;(digital content that augments the real world) both rely heavily on&nbsp;5G technology to function and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ar-vr-workplace">have numerous business applications</a>. For example, mobile phones&nbsp;and smart glasses using virtual and&nbsp;augmented reality&nbsp;technology that runs on 5G networks are already adding digital overlays, live views and other capabilities to stockroom employees, delivery drivers, maintenance workers and more. 



 Edge computing: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">Edge computing</a> refers to a distributed computing framework that brings enterprise applications closer to data sources. Naturally, any technology that relies on the movement of large volumes of data in a wireless environment is going to be enhanced by 5G. In&nbsp;edge computing, 5G specifically brings computation and data storage closer to where data is generated on the network, enabling greater control, lowering costs, and speeding the delivery of insights. According to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-edge-computing-means-for-infrastructure-and-operations-leaders">Gartner whitepaper</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside ibm.com), by 2025, 75% of enterprise data will be processed through&nbsp;edge computing,&nbsp;compared to only 10% today.

<p>In our digital era, presentation, and injection biometric attacks pose an unprecedented threat to the sanctity of identity verification. As we navigate a landscape increasingly dependent on digital transactions, the looming menace of AI-generated deepfakes demands innovative strategies to combat identity fraud. Gartner Analysts Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja affirm this urgency, stating, “Identity verification leaders must understand this emerging threat and take a proactive approach to secure their solutions*.”</p>
<p>*Emerging Tech: The Impact of AI and Deepfakes on Identity Verification – Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja</p>
<p>Presentation attacks, also known as spoofing or imitation attacks, involve attempts to deceive biometric authentication systems using fake biometric samples, such as photos, videos, or other replicas of the genuine user. With the advent of deepfakes, the methods used to detect presentation attacks have become outdated as many deepfake videos are very well created to be presented as a live video, with great rendering of an attacker superimposing their image on a live video.</p>
<p>One way to identify genuine users and prevent presentation attacks, like deepfakes, is through “liveness detection.” Liveness detection helps distinguish between genuine, live individuals and manipulated synthetic representations. Here’s how liveness detection helps identify users:</p>
 
 Dynamic Movement Recognition: Liveness detection systems analyze the dynamic aspects of facial expressions, eye movements, and other micro-expressions that occur naturally in live subjects. 
 Response to Stimuli: Liveness detection may involve prompting the user to perform specific actions or respond to stimuli during verification. 
 3D Depth Analysis: Liveness detection often utilizes advanced techniques like 3D depth analysis. By assessing the three-dimensional aspects of facial features, the system can verify the spatial relationships between different facial elements, making it harder for static images or videos to pass as authentic. 
 Texture and Reflection Analysis: Liveness detection examines surface characteristics such as texture and reflections on the face. Natural skin has unique textures and reflects light in specific ways that may be hard to emulate. 
 
<p>All these technology components have been embedded across various liveness detection engines and have effectively prevented a “Presentation Attack” often used to game the system. Most deepfake attacks happen when an attacker injects a fraudulent video to game the liveness detection engine. There are usually three types of injection attacks that occur:</p>
 
 Virtual H/W Camera Injections: Utilizing a virtual camera instead of a real camera to submit a photo or video. Software like Manycams is used to do this. 
 JavaScript Injections: Utilizing browser console to inject spooﬁng JavaScript code to be run instead of existing one on the webpage 
 Client Server Protocol Injections: A fraudster breaks the data channel between the browser and server or Classic IT infrastructure “Man in the Middle” type of attack. 
 
 Defeating Presentation Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>1Kosmos responds to this challenge with LiveID and LiveID+. LiveID leverages the front-facing camera on the mobile device (selfie camera) and records a video of the user. Once LiveID has determined the user is genuine, through a liveness check, LiveID will capture a “selfie” of the user and use it as a biometric reference for authentication. LiveID+ is an advanced SDK client-side solution. By actively identifying and thwarting injection attacks in real time, LiveID+ sets a new standard for security, offering robust protection against the deceptive tactics of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Adding additional capabilities to LiveID with LiveID+ allows organizations to prevent this growing attack vector. The new client-side SDK will catch injection attacks and not permit any identity proofing or authentication attempt if an injection attack is detected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The advent of deepfake technology poses a formidable challenge to identity verification processes. As our digital transactions surge and passwordless biometrics become mainstream, the threat from AI-generated deepfakes will become more pronounced. Liveness detection is a good way of combating presentation attacks. However, the evolution of more sophisticated injection attacks, especially those utilizing injection techniques, necessitates innovative security measures like LiveID and LiveID+.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Setting the stage 
<p>On February 29, 2024, the European Union (EU) Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240223IPR18095/meps-back-plans-for-an-eu-wide-digital-wallet">voted </a>in favor of amendments to the eIDAS regulation, marking a significant milestone on the road to a unified standard for European digital identity services. The regulation, which is expected to enter into force by the end of March upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU, will trigger a series of implementation steps. The countdown begins with a six-month period to finalize the technical specifications of the EU Digital ID Wallet, followed by adjustments based on legal file and experiences in large scale pilots. By 2026, all EU member states are mandated to provide digital wallets to every resident, accessible at no cost for acquisition and usage.</p>
<p>Under the new regulation, citizens and businesses could potentially leverage digital wallets to link various personal attributes securely, including driving licenses, diplomas, and national ID cards. Section 5 of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">Architecture Reference Framework</a> lists the current mandatory, optional, and possible additional attributes that are included in the eIDAS framework.</p>
<p>The implementation of eIDAS promises a secure, privacy-friendly means for individuals to prove their identity and electronically sign documents, fostering access to public and private services across the EU. The removal of virtual borders facilitated by eIDAS is anticipated to deepen the Digital Single Market and foster further integration within the EU. However, the true measure of success lies in ensuring that these principles extend beyond the borders of the EU.</p>
 Bridging boundaries 
<p>Achieving interoperability at various levels is essential, including integration with internal organizational systems and compatibility with other verified identity solutions. To gain widespread adoption, the wallet must provide user-friendliness and work seamlessly across international boundaries. Embracing interoperability as a guiding principle is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for organizations aiming to thrive in an increasingly interconnected digital world.</p>
<p>Moreover, digital identity issuance and applicability should not be limited to a single organization or use case. If a user possesses a verified digital identity, they should have the ability to utilize it across various purposes, with diverse service providers spanning different industries, and even with public institutions. Consequently, solutions need to be adaptable and scalable, offering flexibility to accommodate varying levels of assurance for each use case or process, while also being scalable to meet the evolving demands of interoperability and security.</p>
<p>At EIC 2023, several presentations focused on digital identity in the context of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet. These included presentations that considered how digital wallets can be used in the private sector in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eudi-wallet-eic-2023">EUDI Wallet - Critical Success factors for Digital Single Market and Private Sector Use</a>; how organizations can take advantage of the latest developments in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; Digital Identity Wallet Readiness: What Your Organization Needs to Know About Digital Identity Wallets</a>; and the potential challenges and use cases in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; EU Digital Identity Wallet</a>.</p>
 Maximizing business potential 
<p>In my previous blog post, I delved into some of the challenges posed by the eIDAS regulation and the EU Digital ID Wallet. However, in this post, we will shift our focus to explore the potential business advantages. Moving beyond the regulatory landscape, the business implications of digital identities extend far beyond traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) frameworks. These digital identities serve as enablers for cross-organizational use, offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80803/reusable-verified-identity">reusable</a>, decentralized approaches that improve and expand business processes. In addition, as discussed in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti#heading4">Advisory Note</a>, enterprises have already reached a point where centralized identity management is neither desirable nor possible because existing centralized approaches to identity, authentication, interoperability, and security don't fit and won't scale with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>To ensure adoption and integration within enterprises, the following areas will be addressed by the EU Digital Identity Wallet:</p>
 
 Identity Verification (KYC):&nbsp;The EU Wallet will offer robust identity verification capabilities to streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for organizations. By leveraging secure and efficient verification methods, enterprises can enhance the security and reliability of customer identity verification. 
 Strong User Authentication: Enterprises mandated to implement strong user authentication measures will benefit from the EU Wallet's advanced authentication features. 
 Integration with Major Platforms: The EU Wallet will support authentication on major online platforms, including social networks, search engines, and e-commerce marketplaces. By enabling interoperability with these gatekeeper platforms, enterprises can ensure widespread acceptance of the EU Wallet among users. 
 
<p>Therefore, as organizations navigate the implications of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet, it's imperative to recognize not only the challenges but also the vast array of business opportunities presented. The wallet serves as a central repository for proof of identity and other attributes, streamlining numerous business use cases and offering users unparalleled convenience. In addition, integrating digital wallets with existing IAM systems can streamline onboarding processes for remote workers, saving time and money while increasing security. For partner collaboration, digital identity wallets provide secure access to shared resources and data, promoting trust while ensuring privacy and compliance.</p>
<p>Regardless of their size or industry, enterprises can benefit significantly from adopting digital identity wallet solutions. By embracing these technologies and tailoring their implementation strategies to their specific needs and challenges, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and user satisfaction in today's digital economy.</p>
<p>Find out what identity, cloud, and security industry experts, thought leaders, practitioners, and peers are thinking and doing by joining us at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC 2024</a> taking place in Berlin and online from 4-7 June.  We will be discussing the latest developments and the role that digital identities play in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/mtracks/169">enterprise </a>space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global Impact: How will the EU Digital Identity Wallet affect non-EU residents or businesses operating outside the EU?</p>
<br>The European Digital Identity Wallet should apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Security Concerns: What are the key security challenges, and how does the regulation address them to ensure the protection of user data?</p>
<br>Given that the EU Digital Identity Wallet requires the storage of documents, cryptographic keys, and other sensitive information on mobile platforms, it is vulnerable to various risks, including loss, hardware malfunction, and unauthorized access by hackers and thieves. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of digital wallet data is critical and requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure controlled access for authorized users. Nevertheless, its legal backing and the EU's commitment to neutrality, security and user privacy sets the EU Digital Identity Wallet apart from corporate digital wallets.</blockquote>

<p>The Australian parliament is working on the government’s <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=s1404&amp;utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">Digital ID Bill 2023</a>. After passing the lower house, the Bill has been considered by a senate committee <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">inquiry</a>, which included hearing a day’s worth of expert testimony.&nbsp; The committee’s report has now been <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023/Report?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">tabled</a>.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that the senate approve the Bill, but as usual, a number of opposition politicians wrote dissenting reports.</p>
<p>Two sorts of objections are worth correcting because they reflect serious misunderstandings of the Digital ID Bill and of the whole field of digital identity.</p>
 The Digital ID Bill has no new ID 
<p>The Coalition Senators’ Dissenting Report at paragraph 1.16 alleges:</p>
<p>“It seems that [the government] has decided on a more syndicated model that centralises Digital ID in government hands, disregarding the Murray Review’s warnings. By departing from a truly federated approach to Digital ID, Labor is risking the integrity of the entire premise of such a framework.”</p>
<p>I will come back to the Murray Review shortly. For now, I only want to stress that the Digital ID Bill is not a “syndicated” model of digital identities. It is not any sort of model of digital identity.</p>
<p>The Digital ID Bill introduces no new IDs whatsoever. The whole point of the legislation is to conserve existing IDs and make them more reliable in digital form.</p>
 Federated identity has been tried and tried 
<p>The Coalition Senators are much attached to federated identity. They call out the 2014 <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/c2014-fsi-final-report">Murray Inquiry into the Financial System</a> which recommended a public-private federation of trusted digital identities. And they’re obviously proud of the public sector Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) launched in 2018.</p>
<p>Yet the dissenting report doesn’t mention the private sector trust framework effort.</p>
<p>Following Murray, the government worked on TDIF while the Australian Payments Council took on a parallel financial services trust framework called TrustID. After many years work, the TrustID working group was unable to reach consensus on use cases for banking digital identities, and the framework was quietly dropped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my view, more attention should be given to the impasse on TrustID use cases when digital identity is thought to be so urgent. That’s quite a paradox!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact is that federated identity has been tried over and over in Australia, and in comparable economies, and it has <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-will-we-learn-from-the-market-failure-of-digital-identity/">proven to be a market failure</a>. Many commercial Identity Providers have launched in Australia but not one has built a sustainable business. As for TDIF, it’s solitary measure of success is the rush of identity service providers seeking accreditation in anticipation of business expected to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should listen to the market. The idea of free market federated identity provision, reusable across banking and government, has proven plainly not to be viable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me the government has heeded 15 years of experience of a stagnant digital identity market. With its fresh new Bill, the Australian&nbsp;government has progressed beyond the past idealism of reusable “digital identity”. The <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">Digital ID Bill doesn’t use the term anymore</a>, and instead focuses on digitising the many trusted IDs we already have, so they are more reliable online.</p>

   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has evolved since the 1980s and now requires two out of three options: something you have, are, or know. However, phishing poses a significant threat to MFA's security, emphasizing the need for better options. Biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators offer more secure alternatives. FIDO2 stands out as it includes phishing resistance in i

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been used by computer administrators since at least the 1980s. Regular people started using it in the mid-1990s when banking systems began to roll this out. It was pretty clunky; those key fobs were not small! And since I mentioned MFA as one road to greater security in my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">recent post</a> on passwordless technologies, I thought a quick refresher might be in order.</p>



 Today’s MFA 



<p>MFA looks much different than it did thirty years ago. MFA requires at least two out of these three options:</p>



 
 something you have 



 something you are 



 something you know 
 



<p>In practice, that has taken the form of everything from an SMS message to an iris scanner and more. As it turns out, not all MFA options have stood the test of time when it comes to better security. Depending on what you’re protecting, you might need to get more discerning when it comes to what techniques you use for MFA.</p>



 The Phishing Threat to MFA 



<p>Phishing is the biggest threat to MFA’s ability to solve all the world’s authentication problems. One definition of phishing is:</p>



<p>A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a website, in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person. (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/phishing#">U.S. NIST Glossary</a>)</p>



<p>Phishing is when someone tricks you into clicking on a link that either takes you to or is part of a website that looks a LOT like a legit thing. It will likely pass your username and password on to the actual site and put up a page to collect the code received via SMS or email. At that point, the hacker (or, more to the point, their program) usually has 10-15 minutes to use the username, password, and code to get into the site and do things. Most likely, they’ll change your settings so the account has a different recovery email, a new phone number, and a new password.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jerks.</p>



 Better Options 



<p>So, what else is there if there are better ideas than an SMS message or, heavens forbid, an email? The answers fall into three categories: biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators. Which one you choose depends on the criticality assigned to what’s being protected.&nbsp;</p>



 Biometrics 



<p>Biometrics cover the “something you are” option of MFA. These can be anything from fingerprints, facial recognition, iris recognition, and voice recognition. This was a relatively reliable option, though <a href="https://ovic.vic.gov.au/privacy/resources-for-organisations/biometrics-and-privacy-issues-and-challenges/">accessibility issues</a> are a problem. However, with the age of AI and deep fakes dawning, not all biometric options are equally secure. According to <a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/can-deepfakes-beat-biometric-security/">Cybersecurity Magazine</a>, facial recognition is at the most risk, though voice recognition is not far behind. Fingerprints are better off, but not without their own challenges.</p>



<p>There are ways to make biometric recognition more robust. The evolution of attack and response, however, means attack mitigation is always a moving target.</p>



 App-based Authenticators 



<p>Another option that will fill the “something you have” option is an app-based authenticator. There are several out there, like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;pcampaignid=web_share">Google Authenticator</a>. Many of these apps use something called TOTP. This Time-based One Time Password functionality generates a number that changes, as you might guess from the name, over some (short) period of time. Several password managers (you <a href="https://security.georgetown.edu/csam-2020/benefits-of-password-managers/">use a password manager</a>, right?), like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, include a TOTP code, too. (I admit, I’m not sure about storing my password with my second factor, but that’s just me.)</p>



<p>If you are using a TOTP-based authenticator, then you need to be on top of getting that code out of the app and into the authentication screen. I often delay responding to the MFA challenge if it looks like my authenticator app only has under 10 seconds left for that number.</p>



 FIDO2-based MFA 



<p>Now for the <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gold%20standard">gold standard</a> of authenticators: FIDO2! This MFA option puts <a href="https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa/">phishing resistance</a> as part of its core design. Go, team!</p>



<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-overview/">FIDO Alliance</a> is the source of the FIDO2 family of specifications, including WebAuthn. FIDO2-compliant authenticators can use dedicated hardware tokens or mobile devices (like your phone). To use that token or the key stored on your mobile device, though, you need a biometric or a PIN. Combined with a traditional password step, this takes us from two-factor authentication (2FA) to multi-factor authentication.</p>



 Passkeys 



<p>If you read my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">last post</a> about passwordless authentication, you may be thinking that FIDO2-based MFA and passkeys sound similar. And, in fact, you would not be wrong! In many cases, you can just use a passkey and have 2FA, which is enough for many situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys are not perfect; there are <a href="https://youtu.be/mxGczv1-XlE?si=YBrrRvPRcb-bVXM6">new threat models</a> that implementors need to consider before they roll out support for passkeys willy-nilly. However, they are still arguably better than passwords.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>I believe some form of MFA is better than none. That said, I also worry that it lulls people into a false sense of security. How risky is it for you personally if your account is hacked? How risky is it for your organization if your systems are compromised? What data will be exposed? If you don’t have time to understand those gory details, the only real option is to require a stronger form of MFA so you don’t have to worry about that. There are always plenty of other things to worry about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you are an end-user, you may not have a choice of the quality of the MFA you get to use. In that case, something is better than nothing! If you work for a company with an IT department and the need for people to log in remotely (including your customers), then you really need to make MFA a priority. And when you do, make sure you do it properly with a phishing-resistant option.</p>

 Breaking Down Barriers: Integrated Wallets for Tokenized Securities 
 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Navigating the complexities of blockchain wallets has been a significant hurdle for traditional investors. The wallet barrier not only discourages investors from embracing digital securities but also presents compliance constraints, in some jurisdictions, for issuers who provide custodian wallet options.</p>
<p>To achieve critical mass, we must simplify the experience for end users by hiding these complexities. Integrated wallets are specifically designed to do that, especially the non-custodial ones.</p>
<p>What are integrated wallets?</p>
<p>Integrated wallets are digital wallets that are seamlessly embedded into a tokenization platform. It provides multiple benefits as listed below:</p>
 
 Hassle-free experience:&nbsp;Automatic creation of wallets, providing a seamless experience for non-blockchain investors. 
 Easy for traditional investors:&nbsp;Web banking-like transaction confirmation processes using passwords or biometric authentication. 
 All-in-one platform:&nbsp;No external navigation is needed, everything is integrated within the platform. 
 Flexible wallet support:&nbsp;Issuers can seamlessly support integrated custodial or non-custodial wallets, as we expand our integration with all wallet providers. 
 
<p>How does an integrated wallet work?</p>
<p>Onboarded investors effortlessly claim their automatically issued integrated wallet by creating a security key (e.g., biometric authentication) following simple instructions. Confirming operations and transactions becomes seamless through their security key (e.g., Touch ID).</p>

 The Future of Personal AI<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-personal-ai" title="Direct link to The Future of Personal AI">​</a> 
<p>For many years, artificial intelligence primarily piqued the interest of academic researchers and enthusiasts within niche technological sectors such as robotics. Although respected, AI presented little practical application for the average person. That changed in June 2020 with the debut of a Large Language Model (LLM) called GPT-3. GPT-3 inspired organizations and individuals to use AI to accelerate their workflows, from coding and blogging to planning itineraries. Today, the potential of AI is so immense that Simon Westh Henriksen, the CTO of Kin, believes personal AI will be one of the most valuable digital assets we own in the future. Simon and his team built Kin. They describe it as "your personal AI assistant for your private life." The intended persona for Kin is a mix between a life coach and a close friend.</p>
 My First Impressions of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#my-first-impressions-of-kin" title="Direct link to My First Impressions of Kin">​</a> 
<p>For the last three years, I've deemed ChatGPT my bestie, so when I heard about Kin, I immediately downloaded the beta on my phone. My initial impression was that there was a sense of familiarity because the user interface and interaction were reminiscent of other LLM-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini. However, there were some key differences between Kin and traditional chatbots – it focuses on privacy and personalization.</p>
 Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#privacy-first-artificial-intelligence" title="Direct link to Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence">​</a> 
<p>With traditional Generative AI Chatbots, your data lives on the company's servers for telemetry purposes (and more). In contrast, Simon explained that Kin doesn't have backend servers, and users' data stays exclusively with the user. This is possible because of Web5's <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)</a>. DWNs provide users with a local and personal data store. Now, you can ask an AI personal questions without worrying if someone else can also read it.</p>
 Personalized for You<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#personalized-for-you" title="Direct link to Personalized for You">​</a> 
<p>Unlike traditional Generative AI Chatbots, Kin retains the context of your conversations to provide personalized and relevant responses. As users engage with Kin, the platform analyzes these interactions to extract facts about the user, constructing a semantic memory. This process involves graphing and mapping details such as your name, relationships, interests, etc.</p>
<p>Simon explained the technological process behind this functionality: "It takes in this new knowledge that we have recognized from the chat, or what we think is new knowledge. And then we query this graph that already exists, and we kind of take a subgraph, the relevant subgraph, that might be related to that thing. Then we give it to the LLM, to the model, and it outputs graph operations. So that's something like add node, add edge, remove node, remove edge, and then we apply those to the graph. And in that way, the memory evolves as you speak and interact with Kin."</p>
 The Future of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-kin" title="Direct link to The Future of Kin">​</a> 
<p>The team at Kin is working on enhancing the platform's memory beyond facts of the user by introducing episodic memory. Episodic memory tracks events in users' lives and anchors them to a timeline to give AI an idea of how a user's life evolves.</p>
<p>They also plan to implement natural voice interfaces and personalized reminders.</p>
 The True Value of Data Ownership<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-true-value-of-data-ownership" title="Direct link to The True Value of Data Ownership">​</a> 
<p>Simon envisions a future where Kin takes full advantage of Web5's data ownership and cryptographic verification capabilities. He provided a futuristic example: After a year of personalized interaction, Kin could use <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> to serve as a digital assistant with verified authority on the user's behalf. Kin could share preferences with third parties like e-commerce websites with the user's permission.</p>
<p>"This is where owning and controlling your data suddenly becomes extremely valuable," Simon proclaims. Data ownership is not just about keeping your data private but having control over who you share your data with.</p>

<p>Deepfake cyberattacks, phishing, and social engineering have all received a turbo boost in recent months due to the proliferation of easily accessed AI tools. Cybercriminals are some of the most creative individuals in the world. They spend their days conjuring up different ways to bypass security systems, not filling out spreadsheets and reports.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In this article, we discuss how hackers are leveraging AI tools to bypass traditional identity security controls at an unprecedented pace, and just why generative AI attacks are so successful. We also look at how these attacks can be defeated using identity assurance controls that take a deterministic approach to securing identities, rather than relying on probabilistic methods that contain inherent levels of uncertainty. By implementing these modern controls, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of identity fraud for both their workforce as well as customers.&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Generative AI Attacks  
<p>Hackers use out of the box as well as specifically trained large language models (LLMs), often created by nation state hackers (China, Russia, North Korea), to execute cyberattacks with frightening accuracy. Here are some of the attacks that get a significant boost from AI.</p> 
 Phishing  
<p>Prior to AI, we used to frequently delineate between “phishing” and “spear phishing,” where attacks were tailored to a specific individual. By using LLMs, hackers are now able to tailor just about every single phishing message to a specific target to get a much higher success rate. For decades now the industry has trained employees to spot telltale signs of phishing by looking for grammatical and spelling errors. Today, phishing messages created by LLMs are in the local language, contain local context, and are largely indistinguishable from the legitimate messages users get every single day. A <a href="https://slashnext.com/state-of-phishing-2023/">recent study</a> found a 1,265% rise in phishing, largely due to the usage of AI tools.&nbsp;</p> 
 Impersonation (Deepfake Cyberattacks)  
<p>Identity theft is at an all time high due to the ability of AI to impersonate an individual across all communication channels including voice, text and video. In recent weeks, a scammer used a series of<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/05/deepfake-video-conference-call/"> video deepfakes to extract more than $25M from an organization</a>. Hackers can create personas based on individuals in minutes, merely by looking at samples of their writing, publicly available videos, and social media posts. Just a few years ago, creating a deepfake video required significant resources. Today, freely available apps can do the job fairly well, with accuracy improving by leaps and bounds daily.&nbsp;</p> 
 Social Engineering&nbsp;  
<p>Before AI, social engineering attacks were highly manual in nature and oftentimes had low success rates. We’ve all received scam calls and many of us can easily spot them when the caller has no knowledge of our details and speaks with an unfamiliar accent. By using AI, hackers are able to create chatbots and voice conversation systems that mimic the tone, cadence, and contextual nuances of a specific target audience. LLMs also are able to use reinforcement learning so that they get better with every single conversation that occurs. These improved algorithms can then be used to target large numbers of users simultaneously, rather than being bottlenecked by human interactions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Generative AI Attacks Are Successful  
<p>Hackers love AI tools because they make them more efficient than ever. There are a few key reasons why AI-assisted attacks are seeing so much success today:&nbsp;</p> 
 Speed and Scalability  
<p>AI can process and analyze data and conversations at speeds that outpace any human by orders of magnitude. This ability enables these tools to launch widespread attacks in a very short amount of time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Adaptability  
<p>AI systems can adapt their strategies based on the responses from the target’s defenses. If users have been trained to look for specific red flags, these tools can adapt and respond accordingly within seconds. As a result, defense systems that rely on blocking known attack patterns are trivial for an AI attack to bypass quickly.&nbsp;</p> 
 Efficiency in Targeting  
<p>AI can analyze data from various sources to identify the most valuable targets to maximize its success. When AI identifies a series of patterns or signals, it can quickly train itself to focus on targets with the most likelihood for success. Most importantly, it can correlate with other AI systems who “soften the target,” to then outflank victim organizations' security controls. For example, one AI tool can target an organization with a DDOS attack and, when the victim is busy responding, another AI tool can execute a highly contextualized phishing campaign that references the DDOS attack to maximize its success rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Leveraging Big Data  
<p>AI systems are able to integrate with countless data sources both public and private in order to maximize their impact. Attackers leveraging AI can refine strategies within seconds based on real-time events in ways never possible before. Social media, previous breach data available on the dark web, and leaked credentials can all be processed instantaneously to create new and more sophisticated attacks with a high likelihood of success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Probabilistic Identity Security Controls Fail Against an AI Attack  
<p>The vast majority of identity security controls are failing today. To understand why this is the case, we have to understand the probabilistic nature of their implementations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Probabilistic security controls operate on the basis of likelihood. They use various criteria to determine the probability that something is safe or a potential security threat. By contrast, deterministic security controls identify an outcome with a binary level of precision. They can determine with a high degree of certainty if something is true or false, safe or a threat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at some of the primary methods the industry uses today to prove that someone is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 Phishable Authentication Factors  
<p>Passwords, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">one time passwords (OTP) </a>delivered via SMS or app, and push notifications are the primary methods organizations use to verify users today into their systems. AI creates significant accuracy in brute force password spraying attacks by being able to predict passwords. It also strengthens phishing and social engineering to trick users into providing OTP codes or accepting push notifications at a high rate. These controls are probabilistic as they cannot determine with certainty that the entity seeking access is the legitimate credential holder, and can be intercepted, replayed and phished.&nbsp;</p> 
 KBA-Based Identity Verification  
<p>AI systems’ ability to ingest massive amounts of data extremely quickly and in real time enables them to learn about their targets and easily answer questions such as their mother's maiden name and the street they grew up on. By combining this with phishing and social engineering capabilities, these AI-assisted hackers can quickly execute identity theft and gain access to employee and customer accounts. Knowledge-based security methods are also probabilistic by nature and can be easily intercepted, replayed, and phished from users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Human-Verified Documents  
<p>Many businesses have moved from KBA to online or in-person document verification in order to reduce identity fraud. However, attackers can use widely available AI tools to create fake documents such as passports and driver licenses that are able to trick most systems. The image below is a fake passport generated by AI that was able to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-generated-fake-ids-pass-crypto-exchange-kyc-onlyfake">bypass the identity verification system of a cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-underground-site-where-ai-neural-networks-churns-out-fake-ids-onlyfake/">404 Media</a></p> 
<p>Both human and machine-based verification controls of documents are probabilistic in nature because they have to account for differences in documents with regard to image quality and the sheer number of variations of the documents themselves. They can only determine the likelihood that a document is legitimate.</p> 
 Five Identity Controls to Defend Against AI Attacks  
 1. Focus on Deterministic Controls  
<p>In recent years, deterministic controls to secure identities have started to enter the market by way of open standards and innovative technology companies. Unlike most probabilistic controls, deterministic identity technology plays a crucial role in countering AI-assisted cyber attacks because they can provide a binary certainty; a definitive yes or no that eliminates the gaps exploited by AI-assisted attacks.</p> 
 2. Strong Authentication Protocols  
<p>Cryptographic Techniques: FIDO and similar protocols, such as the traditional smartcard, use public-key cryptography for authentication. During the registration process, the user’s device creates a new public-private key pair. The private key is kept secret on the device, while the public key is registered with the online service. Authentication involves proving possession of the private key without it ever leaving the user's device, making it extremely difficult for attackers (AI-assisted or not) to steal or replicate.</p> 
<p>Biometric Verification: FIDO, for example, supports local <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">biometric verification</a> (like fingerprint sensors, facial recognition, etc.), which are difficult for AI to fake because the biometric data is not transmitted over the network. Instead, the device confirms the match and then uses cryptographic keys to authenticate the user to the service.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">Phishing Resistance</a>: FIDO authentication is bound to the original website's URL, making it resistant to phishing attacks. Even if AI is used to create highly convincing phishing sites, the authentication process checks the URL to ensure it matches the registered service’s URL, preventing the credentials from being used to authenticate a fraudulent site.</p> 
<p>Local Storage of Credentials: Since the cryptographic credentials in FIDO are stored locally on the user's device and never shared with the server or across the network, AI-assisted attacks that rely on intercepting or deducing credentials remotely are rendered ineffective.</p> 
 3. Layered IDV to Prevent Deepfake Cyber Attacks  
<p>Deepfakes are getting more sophisticated on a daily basis. While liveness detection is a positive step forward, it’s only a matter of time before it’s defeated by the rapid pace of innovation in AI. Multi-layered identity verification offers a deterministic way to prove people’s identities to defend against deepfake cyber attacks. Instead of relying purely on voice or video feeds, you combine a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification and face recognition so that you can be certain that an identity is genuine.</p> 
 4. AI-Assisted Identity Risk Mitigation  
<p>While deterministic security controls are essential, they cannot fully protect against unknown and emerging threats. Modern probabilistic identity security controls take advantage of the same AI assistance as attackers. Real-time risk assessment and adaptive security controls are a critical tool for organizations to manage evolving identity risks. By ingesting risk signals from a wide variety of sources, you can bring high fidelity to probabilistic controls.</p> 
 5. A Collaborative Identity Security Stack&nbsp;  
<p>It’s no secret that many identity security solutions tackle very specific challenges, operating in isolated spheres. Generative AI attacks find and exploit the gaps between these fragmented identity security processes. Open standards like FIDO and Open Policy Agent (OPA), were developed, in part, to ensure compatibility between security tools and processes. A more unified identity security approach, with solutions that communicate and collaborate across the identity lifecycle, greatly decreases the success rates of generative AI attacks.</p> 
 HYPR’s Anti-AI Strategy  
<p>HYPR was founded to put in place a deterministic way of proving that people are who they say they are. As a result, we were one of the first commercially successful implementations of the FIDO standards. Since then, our platform has expanded to prevent automation and scaling of identity-related attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines strong passwordless authentication, continuous risk mitigation and comprehensive identity verification so that you can be certain that a person is who they claim to be throughout the identity lifecycle.</p> 
<p>HYPR Authenticate is our category-leading <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> solution, which is built on top of the FIDO standards and fully eliminates breachable credentials from your authentication and verification processes.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> is an identity fabric, which integrates&nbsp;real-time risk assessment and mitigation, leveraging high-fidelity risk signals from numerous sources, including external environments, endpoints and other cybersecurity products.</p> 
<p>HYPR Affirm, our comprehensive product for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification</a>, provides a deterministic way to prove that an identity is legitimate and belongs to the person asserting it. HYPR Affirm combines a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification, AI-powered chat, video, facial recognition and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>

 UK Home Secretary Warns of Deepfake Threat to Upcoming General Election 



<p>UK Home Secretary James Cleverley has warned that deepfake videos created using artificial intelligence pose a significant threat to influence the upcoming general election. Cleverley, ahead of a meeting with tech leaders in Silicon Valley, expressed concerns that adversaries from Iran or Russia could flood social media platforms with realistic deepfake videos to sway voters. While Meta is setting up a team to tackle disinformation and AI abuse before the EU elections, there has been little commitment among the major social media players toward detecting and banning deep fake videos.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF78 rewards. DF79 runs Feb 29 — Mar 7,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 78 (DF78) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am February 22, 2024 and ended 12:01 am February 29. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF79 is live today, February 29. It concludes on March 7. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><blockquote>Heads up: for DF81 (starts Mar 14), OCEAN rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF79   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF79 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

Introduction <p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. In previous years, the Ocean core team built a core tech stack with broad applicability in AI x crypto. In 2023, we tested hypotheses towards growing traction. From that, the three brightest spots are Ocean Predictoor, Ocean Compute-to-Data (C2D), and Ocean Enterprise. For 2024, we focus on&nbsp;these.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Sections 2, 3, and 4 elaborate on goals for Predictoor, C2D, and Ocean Enterprise respectively. Section 5 covers ongoing work: Data Challenges, Data Farming, and ecosystem support. Section 6 concludes.</p> 2. Goal: Accelerate Ocean Predictoor  2.1 Predictoor Background <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. The “earn $” part is key, because it fosters&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Predictoor involves two groups of&nbsp;people:</p>  Predictoors: data scientists who use AI models to predict what the price of ETH, BTC, etc will be 5 (or 60) minutes into the future. The scientists run bots that submit these predictions onto the chain every 5 minutes. Predictoors earn $ based on sales of the feeds, including sales from Ocean’s Data Farming incentives program.  Traders: run bots that input predictoors’ aggregated predictions, to use as alpha in trading. It’s another edge for making $ while&nbsp;trading.  <p>Predictoor is built using the Ocean stack. And, it runs on<a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/"> Oasis Sapphire</a>; we’ve <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/success-in-ai-powered-prediction-bots-leads-to-ocean-oasis-partnership-e4e9f697c99a?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">partnered</a> with the Oasis&nbsp;team.</p><p>Predictoor Traction. Predictoor has highly promising traction: starting from zero volume on mainnet launch in October 2023, volume has grown to &gt; $15M / day. [Source: <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor?range-ha=all">DappRadar</a>].</p><p>Predictoor is rocking! So we’re doubling down on it in&nbsp;2024.</p> 2.2 Predictoor Plans&nbsp;2024 <p>With this context in mind, here are Predictoor goals for 2024. We’ll work to get users making serious $, then we’ll scale&nbsp;up.</p><p>Goal 1: Users making serious $. Right now, Predictoor’s growth is based on predictoors making good $. We want both predictoors and traders making serious $. So, the key trick is for traders to make serious $; then they’ll spend $ to buy feeds; which leads to serious $ for predictoors. We’re doing this by dog-fooding: working to make serious $ trading with Predictoor feeds. Everything else&nbsp;follows.</p><p>Here are the sub-steps of goal&nbsp;1:</p>  1.1 Make $ trading: internal. Conduct experiments iteratively until we make $ trading in some combination of {trading venue &amp; pair, prediction strategy, trading strategy, other}. Results are highly promising, and getting better weekly. Simultaneously, build a first-class data pipeline and analytics dapp, to better answer the question “how much $ am I making” and drill-down questions. The dapp will start with predictoor bots, then expand to trading&nbsp;bots.  1.2 Make $ trading: external. Update Predictoor product so that community can follow the make $ strategy from (1). Eg add feeds, change prediction bot, change trading bot. If needed, have new smart contracts. Continually improve data pipeline and analytics dapp.  1.3 Make more $ predicting: external. Each feed is currently priced 1 OCEAN/day, which under-values the feed compared to $ being made by traders, and therefore means lost $ opportunity for predictoors. A better pricing approach will address this. We will explore possible approaches (e.g. auctions), and roll out the best one in the Predictoor product.  <p>At this point, the Predictoor product architecture enables predictoors and traders to make serious $ on any given feed, or combination of&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>Goal 2: Scale up. Here are sub-steps:</p>  2.1 Reduce trading friction via TG bots &amp; more. Coming into this step, both predictoors and traders onboard via READMEs to run Python bots. For predictoors this is generally fine, since they need to change code to improve modeling or trading strategies if they want an edge. However for traders, we can make it easier to run bots with “good default” strategies. This in turn increases sales volume. Therefore the goal of this step is to make it easier for traders to run bots. A key strategy will be to leverage Telegram (TG)&nbsp;bots.  2.2 Grow # feeds in DeFi. Once predictoors and traders are making serious $, we will significantly expand the number of feeds within DeFi: more tokens, more exchanges, more time scales, signals beyond just close price, and more. E.g. from 20 to 20,000 feeds. This will increase the $ made by traders and by predictoors.  2.3 Grow to new verticals. As that starts to hit diminishing returns, we will expand beyond DeFi: weather, climate, energy, real estate, logistics, agriculture, food prices, gas prices, and more. One possible starting point is prediction weather prediction for a couple cities; then expand city by city; then to every square km on&nbsp;earth.  <p>Goal 1 is for “0→1” to get product-market fit, and goal 2 “1→n” for scale-up.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1732321049847456123">Stretch goal</a>: world model on ground-truth physics. We’ll train a single AI model across all feeds. This model will continually ingest the physics of the world to predict its next state. Truly a *world model*. We’ll also give it all the training data that current LLMs take. The net result: a model with vastly more data than current LLMs, and ground-truth physics in all that additional data. <a href="https://www.explainablestartup.com/2017/06/why-prediction-is-the-essence-of-intelligence.html">Prediction is intelligence</a>. This is Predictoor’s endgame.</p><p>It’s a big vision! Goals 1 and 2 alone will occupy us for all of 2024 and much of 2025. The stretch goal will&nbsp;follow.</p> 3. Goal: Launch C2D Springboard  3.1 Core Stack Background <p>At the core of the Ocean tech stack are <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/learn/data-nfts-and-data-tokens/">datatokens</a> and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/learn/compute-to-data/">Compute-to-Data (C2D)</a>. Datatokens enables token-gating of AI models, predictions, and more. They enable data wallets, data exchanges, and data DAOs. C2D is pragmatic and useful privacy approach, complementary to other privacy approaches.</p><p>C2D Details. Let’s drill into C2D&nbsp;further.</p>  Why C2D. Private data is valuable: using private data can improve research and business outcomes. But concerns over privacy and control make it hard to&nbsp;access.  What is C2D. Compute-to-Data (C2D) grants access to run compute against the data, on the same premises of the data. Only the results are visible to the consumer. The data never leaves the premises. Decentralized blockchain technology does the handshaking.  C2D Benefits. Ocean C2D enables people to sell private data while preserving privacy, as an opportunity for companies to monetize their data assets. C2D can also be used for data sharing in science or technology contexts, with lower liability risk, because the data doesn’t&nbsp;move.  Left: C2D Conceptual Flow. Right:&nbsp;C2D2!<p>Internal discussions. In Ocean core team, we’ve long understood the unique selling points of C2D. It’s why we built it in the first place, way back in 2019! Over the years, we’ve had continuous interest in using it, such as our collaboration with <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a> (a part of Daimler). However, we saw that we hadn’t fully leveraged its potential, as we’d invested our time on other features.</p><p>Besides C2D, we’ve see many friction points in using the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Community feedback. Over the past several months, we interviewed community members for feedback, especially to gain insights on how to best enhance the core stack. Some feedback has already translated to completed actions such as improving <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean docs</a>. The two main themes from the community were: (a) clear demand to make C2D great, and (b) developer experience is still high friction.</p> 3.2 C2D &amp; Core Stack Plans&nbsp;2024 <p>The community feedback was consistent with our own discussions, and helped us to confirm what mattered. This in turn informs our plans for 2024. Thus, here are C2D / tech stack goals for 2024, culminating in a C2D springboard.</p><p>Goal 1. Unified backend. From community feedback we learned that deploying and maintaining the various Ocean components (Aquarius, Provider, Subgraph, C2D) is too complex. In 2024, we will simplify this process by merging all of them into a single, more manageable component. This upgrade means easier installation with just one command and a user-friendly admin dashboard, set for release in Q2 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Goal 2. C2D.2. The current C2D, while powerful, has friction in creating and deploying algorithms. So we’re integrating C2D into the newly-unified backend to simplify its use. This means straightforward installation and maintenance, along with easier ways for users to write and deploy algorithms and ML models. This update will be launched in Q3 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Goal 3. Build a “C2D springboard” to further empower our Ocean community. This platform will make it easy to showcase the capabilities of your AI algorithms for specific use cases, reminiscent of Ocean Market, but heavily tuned to C2D workflows. The product is set to launch in Q4 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>As we roll out these updates, we’ll continue to leverage Ocean’s Data Challenges to catalyze development of AI algorithms for&nbsp;each.</p> 4. Goal: Roll Out Ocean Enterprise <p>Ever since the release of Ocean v4 (spring 2022), there has been growing interest in the businesses community about Ocean’s capabilities, especially Data NFTs, datatokens and Compute-to-Data (C2D).</p><p>Traditional businesses operate in highly regulated environments, where strict compliance to industry regulation such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>, <a href="https://www.eu-data-act.com/">EU Data Act</a>, and <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">MiCA</a> have a major impact on operations and product development. Ensuring compliance can hinder innovative solutions from going into production.</p><p>Starting this year, a new endeavor called Ocean Enterprise will launch. It will help businesses take Ocean-powered solutions into production. Ocean Enterprise comprises both a group of collaborators and a tech&nbsp;stack.</p>  The collaborators are a diverse group of organizations spanning eight countries and seven industries. This group has already established the Ocean Enterprise Collective to gather requirements, design and develop a tech&nbsp;stack  The tech stack is an enterprise-ready, compliant version of Ocean. It will be based on the existing Ocean stack. It will incorporate additional new enterprise-specific features to allow businesses to securely collaborate, share and monetise their data in a fully compliant manner. The first release will be later this&nbsp;year.  <p>Work on the new Ocean Enterprise version began quietly several months ago. Stay tuned: more details will be announced in the following months&nbsp;👀.</p> 5. Ongoing <p>In addition to the core initiatives above, we will continue with ongoing efforts in Data Challenges, Data Farming, and ecosystem support. This section elaborates.</p> 5.1 Data Challenges <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges/">Ocean Data Challenges</a> are competitions for data scientists to build predictive models, do analytics, or otherwise.</p><p>We’ve been running them since 2022. We will continue them in 2024, though as mentioned above, now tuned towards&nbsp;C2D.</p> 5.2 Data Farming&nbsp;(DF) <p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF</a> is Ocean’s incentives program. Typical APYs are&nbsp;5–20%.</p><p>DF currently emits 150,000 OCEAN weekly rewards. As the schedule outlines, rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN weekly in mid-March 2024, and double again to 600,000 OCEAN weekly in mid-September 2004.</p>  50% of weekly DF rewards are for Passive DF, i.e. locking&nbsp;OCEAN.  The other 50% for Active DF, where users have to engage more actively for rewards, such as running prediction bots.  <p>As with previous years, for 2024, Passive DF will remain unchanged, and the specific activities within Active DF may&nbsp;evolve.</p> 5.3 Ecosystem support <p>Ocean has a lively<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem"> ecosystem</a> of dapps grown over years, built by enthusiastic developers. The Ocean ecosystem also contains many data scientists and OCEAN holders who do predictions, data challenges, Data Farming, and more. Furthermore, Ocean has an excellent<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/community"> community of ambassadors</a>.</p><p>For 2024, the core team will continue to support the Ocean ecosystem &amp; Ocean Ambassadors.</p>Some <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem/">featured dapps</a> from Ocean’s ecosystem. 6. Conclusion <p>In 2024, we will double down on Predictoor’s exponential growth, launch a “C2D springboard”, and roll out Ocean Enterprise. We will continue to run Ocean Data Challenges, Data Farming, and support our lively ecosystem.</p><p>This product update stands for our roadmap to making Ocean Protocol more accessible, efficient and powerful — all in the name in traction.</p> Notes <p>[1] This step only comes now, because we first needed to establish an architecture where both predictoors and traders can conceptually make serious $. If we did this UX work earlier, we’d have spend time optimizing a UX that any step of goal 1 might have become obsolete.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Fission has been working with the IPFS ecosystem since we started. Content addressing is a fundamentally useful innovation that opens new use cases and approaches that are difficult or impossible without.</p><p>This year, the community and the organizations involved are changing in significant ways. Protocol Labs is nucleating a number of the engineering, open source, and operational teams into separate startups, engineering collectives, and foundations.</p><p>For IPFS projects and tooling, we must re-evaluate how we work together from code to commons.</p> What is IPFS Mainnet? <p>Mainnet is a term used to describe the default or "main" network that default settings connect to. This has mostly been "assumed" for the IPFS network, and not really highlighted for anyone other than protocol experts. The technical name for Mainnet is Amino, and there's a <a href="https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-09-amino-refactoring/">blog post from September 2023</a> that goes into some more details and changes happening.</p><p>Diving deeper into Mainnet, there are a variety of <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/public-utilities/">public utilities that are described in more detail in the IPFS docs</a>. One of the most notable is the IPFS.io public gateway, that serve up content-addressed data through an HTTP gateway that every browser can access.</p><p>This was run by Protocol Labs, and will now be a responsibility of the emerging IPFS Foundation, who in turn are relying on the new <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/">IP Shipyard organization</a> to do the technical work to host and maintain the gateway.</p><p>There are a number of other <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">public IPFS Mainnet gateways</a>, including the gateway we've been running at Fission for many years:</p>While Fission's gateway is listed, we only serve up content that is synched to our servers by published apps and WNFS file systems<p>You'll note from the list that there are a number of commercial providers of IPFS services, like Cloudflare, Pinata, and Web3 Storage. As well as their "public" gateways, many of these organizations also sell services hosting dedicated gateways.</p><p>The way that IPFS works, all the nodes / gateways / desktops etc connect together and store pieces of data, "addressed" by the data itself. Unlike with a single web server being down and no one else having the "authority" to have the data at a location like <code>example.com/somedata.pdf</code>, IPFS nodes ask each other for all of the blocks that make up a content address, and the receiver can then verify that the data is correct.</p><p>IPFS Mainnet is the giant global network that uses the default bootstrap list, the default Distributed Hash Table (DHT) that helps locate content on the network, and all of the public and dedicated gateways that connect to it.</p> Alternate Networks <p>Using a different list of bootstrap nodes and other configuration settings, you can choose to not connect to IPFS Mainnet. Here are two examples of projects that made this choice:</p><p><a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a> uses IPFS to synch and serve data across their ecosystem – we had them on for a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/fission-tech-talks-sourcery-with-decentralized-databases/">Fission Tech Talk</a> a while back – but doesn't connect to Mainnet by default.</p><p><a href="https://tryquiet.org/">Quiet</a> is a chat app that uses IPFS to synch and connect devices, but on a network that is private to the connected devices.</p><p>Performance, privacy, or other considerations are all reasons that you might not want to use Mainnet, while still relying on the same codebases and technology stack.</p> Everywhere Computer and IPFS <p>Fission's primary product is the <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a>. This is the platform we're building on top of the open protocol InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM) that we developed alongside a number of collaborators in the UCAN and IPVM working groups.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer lets you run compute everywhere. This is accomplished by supporting WebAssembly functions that are published to IPFS, and by fetching and storing data that needs to be computed to and from IPFS. Separately, we use libp2p, the peer-to-peer networking layer that IPFS also runs on, to connect all of the compute providers, and to share receipts of results and other data across the network.</p><p>Simplistically, you could say IPVM and the Everywhere Computer add compute to IPFS.</p><p>Note that we didn't say "IPFS Mainnet" there. We heavily use content addressing in the design of the system, so that we can do things like cache functions on compute nodes, cache results across the network to skip computation all together, and many of the other optimizations you can do from edge devices to servers when you're using content addressing rather than location addressing.</p><p>The design of the Everywhere Computer will introduce the concept of Subnets. These will be default settings, permissions, optimized functions, and other configuration options that let anyone compose groups of computers to support different ecosystems and applications.</p><p>However, our default public beta subnet (cool name and logo forthcoming!) will connect to IPFS Mainnet. The public commons that the IPFS Mainnet represents is something that we've always been excited about and supported, and we're excited to add content-addressed compute with the Everywhere Computer.</p>You can watch a demo and overview of the Everywhere Computer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6n2dhjmYes&amp;t=10s">from our late Feb 2024 presentation</a><p>Across both public gateways and commercial providers, developers will be able to fetch data, run it through an IPVM compatible function, and then store the results back on IPFS Mainnet.</p><p><a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Sign up for the Everywhere Computer beta</a> if you'd like to be involved.</p> Gathering the Commons <p>Along with IP Shipyard, we're hosting an event today in Denver to share the news about IPFS Mainnet support, and start gathering the commons of people and organizations that are interested in supporting and improving this public global network.</p><p>Here are some questions to think about IPFS as Commons:</p><p>As an ecosystem, app or project that relies on the IPFS technology stack (whether it connects to Mainnet or you run a private network), what do you need and how do you want to provide support in return?</p><p>As a commercial provider, let's talk about inter-connecting our nodes and jointly running a more efficient network. If you rely on Kubo, go-libp2p, js-libp2p that are maintained by the IP Shipyard team, or other open source code bases, how do you plan on supporting them? What features and functions would you want to prioritize and fund, or contribute engineering resources to help implement?</p><p>As an individual using IPFS from your desktop or through various apps, how do you want such an open network to function, and what should it prioritize?</p><p>There are a number of legal challenges, takedown requests, and content moderation topics that come up across public gateways. Should IPFS Mainnet supporters join forces to decide on how to handle some of these concerns across the commons network?</p><blockquote>This year, the IPFS and extended ecosystem is graduating to a more commons based approached, with many separate companies, foundations, and funding partners.<br><br>At ETH Denver we want to introduce the changes, and invite people to take part in supporting and governing large public commons projects like the <a href="http://ipfs.io/">ipfs.io</a> public gateway, and the Kubo IPFS node codebase.<br>​<br>We will have a presentation by Adin Schmahmann from IP Shipyard, IPFS Core Maintainer, to introduce <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/new-chapter">IP Shipyard’s New Chapter</a> and other existing and upcoming initiatives.<br><br>We will follow with a discussion of IPFS as Commons, welcoming IPFS operators, dapp builders, blockchain ecosystems, and others interested in the future of the IPFS commons. This will be a facilitated discussion and Q&amp;A, hosted by Boris Mann, Founder of Fission.</blockquote><p>If you're in Denver, you've still got time to join us for the <a href="https://lu.ma/6suk3oa5">IPFS Mainnet event today, Wed Feb 28th, 4pm MST</a>, otherwise we'll be sharing presentation slides and other follow up notes <a href="https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/ipfs-mainnet-at-ethdenver/17620">on the IPFS Discussion Forum</a>.</p>

<p>According to the most recent PYMNTS Intelligence report, more than 40% of financial institutions (FIs) are seeing increasing volumes of fraud and financial crime. This puts credit unions between a rock and a hard place: friction vs security.</p>



<p>Quick catch-up: Traditional KYC methods often lead to tedious, friction-filled processes such as:</p>



 
 Manual processing 



 Relying on third parties 



 Physical branch visits 



 Delays in account access 



 The list can go on and on. 
 



<p>But this process is now obsolete thanks to reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Why it matters: With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once. By applying cutting-edge technology, reusable credentials not only take friction out of your operations, but makes every touch point more secure than ever before.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">See how reusable credentials can revolutionize credit union operations in our new eBook, “KYC: A New Age of Less Fraud and Friction”.</a></p>



<p>The big picture: Say goodbye to “What is your mother’s maiden name?” With reusable credentials, credit unions will revolutionize their operations and create an incredible member experience with seamless interactions in every channel.</p>



 Dive deeper 







<p>Beyond credit union KYC: the ongoing friction struggle</p>



<p>Friction is an ongoing challenge for credit unions at every touch point. There can be different login or verification experiences at every channel.</p>



<p>The core issue that causes most of the friction in your operations is the temporary nature of current credit union KYC and identity verification. While the initial KYC process validates a member’s identity for account opening, this verification is a one-time use and cannot be reused. For members to have day-to-day interactions with their credit union they’ll have to repeatedly verify their identity. Not to mention that the current methods can be reproduced by bad actors.</p>



<p>Security questions can be easily guessed through social engineering, tellers may struggle to differentiate between fake and real IDs, and SMS-based verifications are often indistinguishable from phishing.</p>



<p>The current credit union KYC process not only causes delays in member service and satisfaction but also burdens employees in the fight against fraud, potentially leading to financial losses.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Give your members the experience of “pre-check”</p>



<p>Drawing inspiration from the success of TSA Pre-check&nbsp; in travel, Anonyome Labs’ solution introduces credentials that are persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. By applying this concept to credit unions, the result is an elevated member experience where KYC becomes a persistent validation process.</p>



<p>&nbsp;With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once, ensuring seamless and secure interactions from account sign-up to every subsequent touchpoint. This innovative technology eliminates the need for repetitive verifications, reducing friction in member interactions, and enhancing overall security. (All without disrupting existing solutions, processes, or member experiences.)</p>



<p></p>



<p>Tellers can focus on member experience instead of fake IDs</p>



<p>Only <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/PYMNTS-FIs-Revamping-Technologies-to-Fight-Financial-Crimes-December-2023.pdf">30% of financial institutions</a> plan on taking feedback from their employees or their customers’ needs when selecting solutions partners.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials will transform your member and employee experience. Employees, especially those in critical roles such as call centers and tellers, will be empowered to be more effective&nbsp;for the overall security and satisfaction of credit union members.</p>



<p>Tellers and employees often&nbsp; bear the responsibility of verifying member identities, a task full of pressure and potential security risks. With reusable credentials, the burden is significantly lifted, as the need for repetitive verifications.</p>



<p>Call center employees can shift their focus from identity validation to enhancing the member experience, fostering quicker response times and more efficient interactions. Similarly, tellers are no longer in high-stress situations like having to distinguish between genuine and forged IDs.</p>



<p>Providing usable credentials cultivates a positive atmosphere for both employees and credit union members.</p>







<p>Credit union KYC innovation is easy</p>



<p>Credit unions are losing members due to a lack of innovation. A <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/credit-union-innovation-real-time-payments-fintechs/">PYMNTS Intelligence</a> research study found:</p>



 
 27% of credit union members say they would consider changing financial institutions (FIs) to access new products or more innovative solutions. 



 This willingness to switch has increased to 27%, up from 17% since 2018. 



 The share of CU members willing to switch to more innovative solutions is very close to the number of non-CU members willing to do the same, 29%. 
 



<p>Between member’s preferences and the continual increase in fraud, it is vital for credit unions to implement new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partnering with a technology provider, like Anonyome Labs, makes adding cutting-edge technology to your existing operations not only doable, but seamless. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Our technology</a> includes everything you need to build reusable credentials into your existing apps and systems.

 FAQ: Reusable credentials and decentralized identity&nbsp; 



How do reusable credentials work?&nbsp;




<p>1. Initial identity verification: When a member joins a credit union or starts an account, a decentralized identity (DI) system verifies their identity using robust authentication methods.<br></p>







<p>2. Creation of reusable credentials: Once the member’s identity is verified, the DI system generates reusable credentials. These credentials are encrypted – making them tamper-proof and secure.<br></p>







<p>3. Ownership and control: Unlike traditional identity systems where organizations manage and store user data, decentralized identity gives ownership and control to the individual. For credit unions, this means the member owns their credentials and they are stored securely on their device, including the ability to store and present credentials from within your app and interfaces.<br></p>







<p>4. Verification at touchpoints: For every interaction with the credit union, whether it’s logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, the member can present their reusable credentials. These credentials serve as irrefutable proof of their identity without the need for repetitive verification processes.</p>



 




How can reusable credentials help credit unions?




 
 Enhanced security: Reusable credentials enhance security by reducing the reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud. For example, traditional security measures, such as security questions that can be exploited through social engineering or SMS-based verifications that are susceptible to phishing, are replaced by reusable credentials.<br> 
 







 
 Frictionless member experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for credit union members. Once verified, members enjoy a continuous and secure interaction across various touchpoints without the need for repeated identity checks.<br> 
 







 
 Privacy protection: Since members control their reusable credentials, they have the flexibility to share only the necessary information at each interaction. This is a privacy-centered approach that gives individuals greater control over their personal data.  
 



<p>Reusable credentials redefine the way identity is managed, placing control in the hands of members and ensuring a secure, convenient, and privacy-focused experience across various credit union touchpoints.&nbsp;</p>

What is decentralized identity?




<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is a shift in the way identity is managed. It is moving away from centralized systems controlled by organizations to a model where individuals have greater control over their own identity information.</p>



<p>A decentralized identity looks like this:</p>



 
 Reusable credentials: Identity credentials, once verified, can become reusable and portable across various services and applications. Users can present their credentials without the need for repeated identity verification, streamlining interactions and reducing friction.<br> 



 Tamper-proof technology: Decentralized identity uses technology, such as blockchain, to record and verify identity information. This technology ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and resistant to single points of failure.<br> 



 Secure communication: By its very nature, decentralized identity provides perpetual, irrefutable, and secure communication across all channels, with built-in, ultra-secure and immediate authentication and identity validation. <br> 



 Reduced identity fraud: By giving individuals control over their identity and leveraging advanced security technology, DI can drastically reduce the risk of identity fraud.<br> 



 Privacy by design: Privacy is a fundamental principle of DI. Users have control over what information they share. This approach contrasts with centralized systems where users often give over control of their data.<br> 



 User control: Individuals own and control their identity information. Unlike traditional systems where large organizations store and manage user data, decentralized identity empowers individuals to own and manage their digital identities. Protecting both individuals and organizations. 
 



<p>Decentralized identity has the power to reshape how individuals interact with digital services, ensuring greater privacy, security, and user control over their identity. As the technology continues to evolve, DI solutions are becoming increasingly relevant across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and beyond.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpaulashley/">Dr. Paul Ashley,</a> who’s spent over 25 years in the privacy and security space, says this about DI: “There’s been a decade of work before the projects the world is looking at now. I have rarely ever seen a technology that has been so thoughtfully designed as this from a security and privacy point of view.”</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://privacyfiles.com/?p=447">Listen to the Privacy Files podcast episode where Dr. Paul Ashley explains decentralized identity to get the full picture</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 




How can reusable credentials prevent fraud?
 
 Cryptographic security: Reusable credentials use advanced tech (cryptography) to secure information. This makes credentials tamper-proof which reduces the risk of fraudsters attempting to manipulate or replicate identity information.<br> 



 Irrefutable proof of identity: Once a user’s identity is verified and made into a reusable credential, it is irrefutable proof of their identity. Traditional methods, such as security questions or SMS verifications, are more susceptible to social engineering or phishing.&nbsp;<br> 



 Reduced weak security points: Traditional KYC methods often include the exchange of sensitive information, creating potential attack points for fraudsters. Reusable credentials limit the places where fraudulent activities can occur.<br> 



 Decentralized ownership: With decentralized identity, users own and control their reusable credentials. This decentralization minimizes the risk of large-scale data breaches, as there’s no single data center storing a vast amount of sensitive user information. 
 



 




How can reusable credentials decrease friction?
 
 Seamless interactions: Reusable credentials streamline user interactions across various touchpoints, eliminating the need for repetitive identity verification. Once a user’s identity is verified and a reusable credential is established, subsequent interactions, whether online, in-app, or in-person, become seamless. This reduces friction and enhances the overall member experience.<br> 



 Single verification point: With reusable credentials, the need for repeated identity checks is gone. Users can verify their identity once, and the credentials can be used at different touchpoints without the necessity for additional verifications.<br> 



 Privacy and consent control: Users have control over what information is shared with service providers. They can selectively disclose only the necessary information for a particular interaction. This privacy-centric approach minimizes the amount of data exchanged, contributing to a smoother, more privacy-respecting user experience. 
 



 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance. Here are some examples:</p>



 
 Healthcare: In the healthcare sector, reusable credentials can play a vital role in securely managing patient identities, medical records, and access permissions. Patients could have portable credentials for verifying their identity during medical visits, and healthcare providers can access relevant information securely.<br> 



 Government services: Governments are exploring DI and reusable credentials for services such as issuing digital IDs, driver’s licenses, and other official documents. This approach can enhance security, reduce identity fraud, and provide citizens with more control over their personal information.<br> 



 Education: In the education sector, reusable credentials can be used for academic certifications and transcripts. Students could have a secure and portable credential that verifies their education, which they can present to employers or other educational institutions.<br> 



 Farming and mining: Regulated industries, such as farming and mining, require members to comply with established regulations and to perform compliance reporting to government agencies. Reusable credentials can be used in these two industries when submitting reports to government agencies or receiving certifications – even across wildly disparate certifying bodies and reporting organizations.<br> 



 Supply chain and logistics: Reusable credentials can be applied in supply chain and logistics for secure tracking of products and verifying the authenticity of goods. This can help prevent counterfeiting and ensuring the integrity of the supply chain.<br> 



 Travel and hospitality: The travel industry is exploring the use of reusable credentials for seamless and secure identity verification at airports, hotels, car rentals, and other travel-related services. This could simplify the check-in process and enhance the overall travel experience.<br> 



 Retail and e-commerce: Reusable credentials can enhance the security of online transactions in retail and e-commerce by providing users with a secure and portable identity for authentication. This can help reduce fraud in online purchases.<br> 



 Human resources and employment: For employment-related processes, reusable credentials can be used for verifiable employment history, certifications, and qualifications and even background checks. This can streamline the hiring process and provide employers with confidence in the candidate’s credentials. 
 




<p></p>



<p>Reusable credential technology is promising; widespread adoption across industries is still evolving. Various pilot programs, initiatives, and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving identity-related challenges, improving security, and better user experiences across industries.</p>

 Crisis and/of&nbsp;Property <p>The concept of property is deeply embedded in our modern socio-economic systems. So much so, that it is often viewed as sacrosanct, a near-natural law-like means to distribute agency, power, and freedom, breaking away from the dominance of the few and old empires. Yet, property has simultaneously been part of a pathway of dispossession, violence, environmental degradation and the exclusion of vast and growing numbers of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Where property seemed immutable, the ground is shifting, for better or worse. Property has been an information processing and structuring mechanism through which we have governed our world by means of abstraction, simplification, and dominion over. Faced with today’s unprecedented complexity and entanglement of risks, externalities, and value creation, this theory of governance is falling&nbsp;short.</p><p>Indeed, the very paradigms underpinning our property institutions have become unavailable to think with, technically, materially and ethically:</p>  Objectification: The existing paradigm of objectification of land, nature, labor and information has obscured intrinsic interdependence  Extraction: The detachment of property rights from embodied responsibilities of stewardship had caused systemic negative externalities  Centralization: The optimization of abstract, exclusive rights has led to growing concentration of means of production and the benefits derived from&nbsp;them  Control: Top-down regulatory practices have failed to manage complex conceptual systems of value creation and extraction, and their externalities and&nbsp;impacts  <p>Interestingly, the structural failure of existing property systems to respond adequately to many of our critical contemporary challenges — be it the housing crisis, COVID-19, or Generative AI — is opening up windows of opportunity for large-scale transformation. What is emerging is a <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/gg6r1tfm/production/fc2ab4ede8e254491b3160db3fed49d060634671.pdf">new theory of change</a> where increasing and cascading crises of various forms that will have profound and tragic effects, will also create conditions to open up new imaginative and political space for alternative approaches.

Property &amp; Beyond Lab aims to build a diverse and proactive portfolio of alternative forms of property, from collective ownership of land to self-owning houses, land, and&nbsp;cameras.</p>Property &amp; Beyond Lab&nbsp;website<p>Some of the questions we’re exploring:</p>  How might new conceptions of property reflect and embed a more entangled notion of the&nbsp;human?  How might we move beyond control-oriented mechanisms towards ennobling systems, leveraging distributed protocols to recognize complexity and respond to contextual needs and&nbsp;nuance?  How might we move from commoning externalities towards outcome-based governance and long-term guardianship?  How might we move beyond centralization towards distributed and peer-to-peer permissioning, verification and accountability systems?  How might we braid alternative paradigms such as Indigenous governance and rights-of-nature with property institutions?  How might we create the enabling infrastructures that allow for alternative property mechanisms to be financed and adopted at&nbsp;scale?

As of the new <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0">pdr-backend v0.3 release</a>, bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”.

Sections 1 and 2 describe one- and two-sided predictions (the before and after). Section 3 describes simulator upgrades, and section 4 other upgrades for v0.3. Section 5 concludes. Section 6 shows more cool plots from simulation.</p> 1. Before: One-Sided Predictions <p>In a given epoch, a predictoor bot would predict a direction (“up” or “down”), and stake on that prediction (e.g. 10 OCEAN if not confident, 1000 if highly confident). Call it “one-sided predictions”. The image below illustrates.</p>Prior to v0.3, prediction bots would only submit an “up” OR a “down” prediction, i.e. “one-sided prediction”.<p>The problem is: accuracy in up/down predictions is typically 50.5% to 60% max. With such accuracies, a bot is never very confident in its up vs down prediction. It can nonetheless make $ doing these predictions, but is there a better&nbsp;way?</p><p>Furthermore, if a bot gets it wrong, they are slashed the full stake amount. So there is high variance in winnings from epoch to epoch: big win or big loss. High variance hurts profitability.</p><p>Towards a better way, here’s some brief&nbsp;theory.</p>  When a bot makes a prediction, its underlying model is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution">Bernoulli probability distribution</a> [1]. That is, there are exactly two possible outcomes, a single trial, and the bot’s model has estimated the probability of each&nbsp;outcome.  However, in the status quo code, the bot only expresses one side of the model— the most probable side — in the course of submitting a prediction. It’s leaving information on the table, and exposing itself to high variance.   2. New: Two-Sided Predictions <p>The idea of two-sided predictions is to let the bot express both sides of the distribution in the course of submitting a prediction.</p><p>For example, if the predictoor bot calculates a probability of up=60%, and therefore down=40%, and has 1000 OCEAN to stake, then the bot stake 0.60*1000 = 600 OCEAN to “up”, and 100 OCEAN to down. Therefore the bot is always on both the winning side and the losing side, pro-rata to its prediction confidence. The image below illustrates.</p>As of pdr-backend v0.3, prediction bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”.<p>The winning side will be there to catch the slashed stakes of the losing side, which in turn greatly reduces epoch-to-epoch variance.</p><p>Updated AI model. Before, the prediction bots a regression model to predict a next value of BTC etc. Now, it’s explicitly a classifier model, classifying up vs. down. pdr-backend currently has two linear classifiers: LinearLogistic and LinearSVC [2]. The classifiers give probability estimates.</p><p>How it’s implemented. In a given epoch, a predictoor bots does two transactions to the blockchain. It needs two accounts / private keys, because the Predictoor contracts allow only one tx per epoch per&nbsp;account.</p><p>How to run two-sided prediction bots. First, you need to set a second account, with envvar PRIVATE_KEY2.</p> export PRIVATE_KEY=&lt;YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY 1&gt;<br>export PRIVATE_KEY2=&lt;YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY 2&gt; <p>Second, be sure to have ROSE and OCEAN, to pay for gas fees and stake respectively.</p><p>Related minor&nbsp;changes:</p>  The model-based predictoor bot used to be approach 3. Now it’s approach 2. Approach 3 is deprecated.  Approach 1 used to randomly pick an up-vs-down prediction. Now it puts 50% stake into “up” and 50% stake into “down” (50–50). Therefore it needs two keys&nbsp;too.   3. Upgrades to Simulator <p>The prediction/trading simulator pdr sim got upgraded.</p><p>First, the simulator’s bots got upgraded.</p>  Sim prediction bots are now two-sided, behaving just like in the main predictoor bots. Therefore you can do rapid “what-if” experiments in simulation, before proceeding to run a predictoor bot for real&nbsp;$.  Sim trading bots are now confidence-based. Before, the trading bot would always buy OCEAN according to a fixed amount of USD if there was an “up” prediction; and did nothing on a “down” prediction. Now, in an “up” prediction it buys, in a “down” prediction it sells, both proportional to the model’s confidence in up vs&nbsp;down.  <p>Second, the simulator’s plots got a big upgrade. There are now realtime plots of: predictoor profit vs time, trader profit vs time, model accuracy vs time, predictoor profit distribution, trader profit distribution, and a contour plot to show the model’s probability response surface. The appendix shows these in detail. Or, run for yourself with pdr sim my_ppss.yaml. Expect simulator plots to continue to evolve&nbsp;😎.</p>The updated “pdr sim” realtime plot, having many sub-plots. The appendix zooms in on&nbsp;each. 4. Other v0.3 Improvements <p>From <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0">v0.3.0 release notes</a>, here’s a thorough list of&nbsp;changes.</p>  Predictoor bots: Two-sided prediction. Easy deployment of &gt;1 agents via Kubernetes + CLI; pm2 deprecated.  Trader bots: live-mocking ability, enabling “ghost”&nbsp;trades.  Simulator: predictions are two-sided. Trades use model confidence. New plots like predictoor profit vs. time and a visual of model probability response surface. Live trading possible.  Data pipeline: better structure, with DuckDB at the core. Analytics are starting to get built on&nbsp;top.  UX: There is now proper Python-style logging. ppss.yaml tuned. Small CLI utilities added.  Core: The codebase is more robust, including greatly-expanded type-checking and several bug fixes. Predictoor and trader agents are refactored to be simpler. Technical debt is low — no small&nbsp;feat.   5. Conclusion <p>As of <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0">v0.3</a>, predictoor bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”. This reduces epoch-to-epoch variance and increases profitability.</p><p>Also, the simulator got upgraded: predictions are two-sided, the trader bot uses model confidence, and there are new plots like predictoor profit vs. time and a visual of model probability response&nbsp;surface.</p><p>The v0.3 release has many other improvements: in trader bots, data pipeline, UX, and core bug&nbsp;fixes.</p><p>Try for yourself at pdr-backend’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">Predictoor bot&nbsp;README</a>.</p> 6. Appendix: Simulator Plots&nbsp;Details <p>This section gives plots from an example simulation run.</p><p>Settings. It was predicting BTC/USDT on Binance, on 5m epochs. The predictoor bot LinearLogistic model, using the most recent value of BTC and of ETH, staking 100 OCEAN per epoch. The trader used up to 1000 USD per epoch. Simulation ran for about 2000 epochs (1 week). The YAML file given below lists all parameters.</p><p>Below is predictoor profit vs. epoch. After 2000 epochs (1 week), it netted 915&nbsp;OCEAN.</p>Predictoor profit vs.&nbsp;epoch<p>Below is trader profit vs. time. After 2000 epochs (1 week), it netted $2613.19&nbsp;USD.</p>Trader profit vs.&nbsp;epoch<p>Below left is model accuracy vs time, where accuracy is the % time it was correct in predicting up vs. down. Green is the estimated value, and the grey shadow is the 95% [lower bound, upper bound] <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportion_confint.html">confidence intervals according to a Binomial distribution</a>.</p><p>Below middle and right are predictoor and trader profit distributions as 1d scatterplots, respectively.</p>Left: model accuracy vs time. Middle: predictoor profit distribution. Right: trader profit distribution.<p>Below is a contour plot to visualize the model probability response surface. We can have a contour plot because this run has only two input variables: most recent value of ETH (y-axis), and most recent value of BTC (x-axis).</p>  The model predicts a direction of “down” for any (x,y)=(prev ETH, prev BTC) in the red region. The model predicts a direction of “up” for any (x,y) in the blue&nbsp;region.  The decision boundary is white. The contours towards the white are lower confidence; contours moving farther from white are higher confidence.  The red and blue points are training data for “went down” and “went up” respectively. Being encircled by yellow means that the model mis-classified on the training data; this is not surprising because we should not expect these two input variables to fully capture the response.

<p>Happy Birthday, dear Chameleons! 🎂🎉</p><p>A year ago, on February 28, 2023, we launched the Shyft DAO Ambassador Program, and what a journey it has been! To celebrate this milestone, we’re taking a moment to look back at the incredible path we’ve traveled together this first year, filled with achievements, challenges, and&nbsp;growth.</p> Early Beginnings <p>From the get-go, our Ambassador Program was joined by more than 9o active Apprentices, all eager to support our mission.

<p>This month Google and Yahoo introduced crucial changes to their email delivery requirements. For senders targeting individual Gmail accounts, particularly those exceeding 5,000 emails daily, Google mandates authentication measures. While Yahoo does not state a minimum sending requirement, it will align with Google’s criteria.</p>
<p>Requirements that are to be enforced:</p>
 
 Implementation of both SPF + DKIM 
 Sending with an aligned “From” domain in either the SPF or DKIM domains 
 Sending from a domain with a DMARC policy of at least p=none 
 Using a TLS connection for transmitting email 
 Valid forward and reverse DNS (FCrDNS) 
 One-click unsubscribe (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8058">RFC 8058</a>) 
 Low spam reported rate 
 
<p>Full requirements can be found in <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126">Google’s help article</a>.</p>
<p>What are the implications of non-compliance with Google and Yahoo’s email standards?</p>
<p>Failure to adhere to the new email standards set by Google and Yahoo could mean non-delivery to Gmail and Yahoo inboxes, affecting businesses relying on email communication.</p>
<p>These new requirements aim to fortify email security globally, emphasizing industry-acknowledged best practices. Safeguarding business reputation from phishing attacks is one of the top benefits of these changes. DMARC, now a <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/">steadfast requirement</a>, blocks domain impersonation, providing control over email identity. Google emphasizes the validation of sender authenticity for enhanced email security.</p>
<p>Take action now: Reduce email phishing and ensure deliverability</p>
<p>Strong authentication with DMARC and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> is an important milestone for email users.</p>
<p>Entrust has been working with mailbox providers since June 2017 to create Brand Indicators for Message Identification (<a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-bimi">BIMI</a>) with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a>, digital certificates that enable organizations to display their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside outgoing emails in many mailboxes today. BIMI standards aim to make the email ecosystem more secure and engaging with DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) and VMCs.</p>
<p>VMCs help an organization’s emails stand out and get noticed in a crowded inbox while protecting them against fraud through DMARC’s anti-spoofing technology. Entrust also offers DMARC implementation services to help customers in their BIMI journey. Check if your domain is BIMI ready using this free <a href="https://redsift.com/tools/bimi">online tool</a> from our partner Red Sift.</p>
<p>As Google and Yahoo make email authentication mandatory, industry-wide adoption of these practices is crucial. Businesses can ensure compliance for improved email deliverability and overall security.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Over the past few years, digital transformation has been relentless. Businesses of all sizes are at the forefront, continuously adapting to an ever-evolving digital landscape. One of the biggest challenges is managing the surge in cyberattacks, where the number and sophistication of phishing attacks have reached unprecedented levels, especially since the adoption of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/generative-ai-security-challenges-fighting-fire-with-fire/">generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</a> has led to cybercriminals being able to launch more accurate and effective phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>The need to protect your organization from threats has never been greater. The introduction of regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) has also spotlighted the necessity for data security and compliance. On top of it all, with the omnipresence of smart devices and the IoT, we’re living in an era where everything is connected. This interconnectedness, along with the growing reliance on <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/25362/card-not-present-transactions--friend-or-foe--transaction-volumes-are-soaring-but-so-is-fraud">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a> facilitated by digital wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, accentuates the need for secure digital payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Customers demand secure, seamless digital experiences</p>
<p>Along with these challenges, today’s customers have become well-informed, and their demands have never been clearer. They want a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/">mobile-first experience</a>, where their digital journey is seamless on their preferred device. Beyond just accessibility, they expect robust protection against fraud and the looming threats of advanced cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Speed and ease are paramount, with customers seeking frictionless access that doesn’t compromise their security and allows them to switch seamlessly from one device to another to continue their journey. Furthermore, the modern customer isn’t content with a one-size-fits-all approach. They want <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/601818?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=topic&amp;utm_content=upcoming">personalized digital interactions</a>, tailor-made to resonate with their unique preferences.</p>
<p>Customer identity and access management (CIAM)</p>
<p>An effective customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution streamlines the digital onboarding process, making sign-ups both user-friendly and secure. It should support various login methods, including single sign-on (SSO), and integrate with popular social media platforms to streamline registration and login through social login. More than just managing identities, a CIAM solution enhances decision-making through intelligent access and detailed risk assessments, ensuring identity data remains consistent and unified across all platforms.</p>
<p>A CIAM solution’s impact on today’s business landscape is profound. It improves the user experience, which leads to increased sign-ups. This paves the way for building trust, as businesses can cultivate customer confidence with rigorous privacy measures and create personalized interactions. By delivering tailored services and products, the CIAM solution can boost sales and customer loyalty, while prioritizing safety through proactive fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The Entrust difference</p>
<p>At Entrust, our vision of the CIAM lifecycle is holistic. Starting with seamless digital onboarding, our system is designed to efficiently capture and manage customer identity. Robust authentication protocols are then employed to verify user access, ensuring that only genuine and verified users gain entry. Proactive identity management provides comprehensive oversight throughout the entire customer journey, from sign-up to eventual offboarding.</p>
<p>Administration is equally paramount, with policy enforcement mechanisms and measures to ensure continuous compliance. Lastly, in line with modern demands, our CIAM system is equipped to provide tailored engagements, crafting custom experiences that build deeper customer bonds.</p>
<p>Our identity verification (IDV) and digital signing capabilities, together with the ease of social logins, make remote customer onboarding customers easy. This trio of technologies is pivotal in transforming user experiences across a broad spectrum of industries:</p>
 
 In the financial sector, it enables banks and fintech companies to rapidly verify and onboard new customers, streamlining account openings and loan applications 
 Healthcare organizations leverage this technology for secure patient registration and to ensure compliance with privacy regulations 
 Government bodies utilize these tools for efficient citizen onboarding, offering access to services with enhanced security and convenience 
 In the retail e-commerce space, these solutions simplify the shopping experience, making it easier for consumers to authenticate their identities, sign up for services, and complete transactions securely – all from the comfort of their homes or on the go

The reality is that many of our antiquated trust systems have simply broken down as we’ve seen decades of digitization across every industry.</blockquote><blockquote>At GlobaliD, we’re building the tools that will rebuild trust not only for today, but the many challenges of tomorrow — all while keeping the keys of the castle with the person that matters most:&nbsp;You.</blockquote><p>Mitja and the team have been working super hard behind the scenes in the last year and the culmination of that will be a series of feature rollouts in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>The name of the game this year is rapid experimentation. With these new trust frameworks, we’re entering uncharted territory and the only way to figure out what works and what doesn’t is through constant engagement with you, our community.</p><p>Here’s a bit of what we have in store right around the&nbsp;corner:</p>  A smarter, more streamlined onboarding experience — We’re making it easier for both users and partners to get&nbsp;started.  Decentralized, Secure Messaging Platform with WhatsApp Integration — Owning your communications is just as important as owning your identity. We’re starting with WhatsApp but Telegram and Slack are on&nbsp;deck.  Enhanced Non-Custodial Wallet with Fiat Ramps — Users will be able to hold and exchange value that they fully control within GlobaliD’s trusted ecosystem while also being able to view their assets across different custodians.  Introduction of TrustLink — This is our first step toward allowing users to build digital trust without the need to download an&nbsp;app.  Public Badges for Identity Verification and Gamification — Badges will allow for quick assessments of reputation while giving users pathways toward leveling&nbsp;up.  <p>Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="https://about.global.id/">GlobaliD</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalids-next-chapter-58b46cda3495">GlobaliD’s next chapter</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Oasis Sapphire-Powered Ocean Predictoor’s Growth Spurs Ocean Protocol &amp; Oasis Protocol to Formalize Ties  Overview <p>The core teams behind <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Protocol</a> have joined forces via a formal partnership, to deepen the level of collaboration on <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a> and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Ocean Predictoor is a stack and a dapp for accurate AI-powered prediction feeds, running on Oasis Sapphire confidential EVM chain. Ocean Predictoor enables AI experts to earn significant $ by running AI prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feed$. Since launch just 6 months ago, Predictoor has grown to around $20M daily volume, and is the <a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/oasis-sapphire?sort=totalVolumeInFiat&amp;order=desc">#1 dapp on Oasis Sapphire</a> in terms of volume. The success of Ocean Predictoor has spurred the Oasis and Ocean core teams to formalize their relationship into a partnership.</p><p>The first step in the partnership aligns incentives of the respective teams. Specifically, Ocean Protocol and Oasis Network have done a $500K token swap — $250K in OCEAN to Oasis, and $250K in ROSE to Ocean. The partnership is structured to quickly do many more of these going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>The next step reduces friction for people using Ocean Predictoor on Sapphire. Specifically, each team will add $250K of OCEAN and $250K of ROSE to an OCEAN-ROSE DEX pool on Sapphire chain, for a total of $1M liquidity baseline. This enables users to easily swap among OCEAN and ROSE, to further ease onboarding to Predictoor on Oasis Sapphire.</p><p>The partnership gives space for continually deeper collaboration, which we anticipate.</p> Ocean Predictoor Six-Month Snapshot <p>In the six short months since launch, Ocean Predictoor has climbed from zero to an impressive ATH of $20.5M daily volume, with a 30-day aggregate soaring to $174.97M — stats from Feb&nbsp;27.</p><p><a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor?range-ha=30d&amp;range-ds=24h">dappradar.com</a> has further,&nbsp;stats.</p> Roots of Predictoor Success <p>Predictoor’s success so far has a few roots. First was a new hypothesis: that the most valuable data is predictions, because they are the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">final step of the data value supply chain</a> right before action is taken and money is made. As its name implies, Predictoor focuses squarely on predictions.</p><p>Second was a focus on a vertical with high value, where Predictoor could make a difference, which has quick turnaround for users making $. DeFi meets this best. Other verticals will&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Third and final, Predictoor design &amp; rollout has been aggressively crypto-native: create a game, make it easy to play, add incentives, optimize. To elaborate:</p>  We started by creating an on-chain game where people can make $ quickly, where more usage led to higher accuracy, which in turn leads to more usage. Oasis Sapphire’s privacy features made it possible for Predictoor’s game to be fully on-chain.  Then, we made it easy to play, via easy-to-run bots.  We kickstarted usage by incentivizing people to run AI-powered prediction bots, via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">Ocean Data&nbsp;Farming</a>.  And since launch, the Ocean core team has continually optimized by becoming an internal customer to pass on learnings as product improvements.   What Lies Ahead for Predictoor <p>The primary goal of the Ocean Predictoor core team is for both predictoors and traders making serious $. Right now, Predictoor’s growth is based on predictoors making good $. For predictoors to make serious $, traders need to spend serious $ on feeds. For that, traders need to make serious $ trading. Our first goal is to make that happen. We’re doing this by dog-fooding: working to make serious $ trading with Predictoor feeds. Results are highly promising, and getting better&nbsp;weekly.</p><p>Then, once traders are making serious $, we’ll expand the scope of prediction feeds. First within Defi, then other verticals. Imagine 10 thousand AI-powered prediction feeds spanning the globe. Real estate, weather, climate, transportation, agriculture, more. And we’ll keep scaling up, for truly huge&nbsp;data.</p><p>In short: traders serious $ → predictoors serious $ → expand&nbsp;scope.</p><p>As Predictoor traction grows, the Ocean and Oasis core teams expect to continually deepen their partnership.</p> From Team&nbsp;Members <blockquote>“Oasis Sapphire is the world’s first and only confidential EVM chain in production. This functionality was key for Ocean to ship Predictoor and grow its traction. We expect Predictoor to keep growing exponentially, and with that, our collaboration with the Oasis&nbsp;team”</blockquote><blockquote>— Trent McConaghy, co-founder of Ocean Protocol.</blockquote><blockquote>“Our entire team at Oasis is proud to be contributors to the accelerated growth of Ocean Predictoor as an important validation of the integral utility of smart contracts with customizable confidentiality. Predictoor has emerged as one of our industry’s leading privacy-preserving DeFi applications, and we are excited to see our close collaboration result in more of Web3 using this powerful&nbsp;tool.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Matej Janez, Business Development Manager at the Oasis Foundation.</blockquote> Conclusion <p>The data speaks for itself: Ocean Predictoor is enabling users to make money through AI-powered prediction bots and trader&nbsp;bots.</p><p>Ocean Predictoor runs on Oasis Sapphire confidential EVM&nbsp;chain.</p><p>The success of Ocean Predictoor has spurred the Oasis and Ocean core teams to formalize their relationship into a partnership. The first action is a token swap to align incentives of the respective teams. The second action is to create deep liquidity in the <a href="https://illuminex.xyz/swap?inputCurrency=0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520&amp;inputChainId=23294&amp;outputCurrency=0x8Bc2B030b299964eEfb5e1e0b36991352E56D2D3&amp;outputChainId=23294">OCEAN-ROSE DEX pool</a>. We look forward to build on our success with Predictoor, and to continue to deepen relations between Ocean and&nbsp;Oasis.</p><p>👉 To learn more about Predictoor, simply go to <a href="http://predictoor.ai">http://predictoor.ai</a> and see the feeds in action.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>We undoubtedly live in interesting times, at least in terms of technological innovation. And like most things in life, this can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on how we respond to it. Technology certainly provides new opportunities, but these are typically accompanied by a set of challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good example of this is the proliferation of internet-connected devices that have quickly become part of everyday life. These range from smartphones, smartwatches, and fitness trackers in the home that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80423/enabling-the-digital-business-with-identity-for-the-internet-of-things">internet of things</a> (IoT); to automatic and remote climate control, occupancy monitoring, and smart access controls in the office; to sensors and trackers for temperature, pressure, air quality, and noise levels on the factory floor that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity_securing_iiot">industrial internet of things</a> (IIoT); to patient, blood glucose, heart rate, hygiene, and mood monitors that make of the internet of medical things (IoMT).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges associated with internet-connected devices&nbsp; 
<p>While all these devices are aimed at improving efficiency, productivity, and quality of life, they all come with challenges. The rapid adoption of these devices is increasing the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81218/attack-surface-management">attack surface</a>, making it challenging to manage and secure every device; the lack of standardized security protocols and frameworks across these devices leads to inconsistencies in security implementations; the lack of focus on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_fernandez-cuesta">security by design</a> leads to vulnerabilities; these devices often collect and transmit sensitive data, raising privacy concerns; and weak <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/risk-based-case-for-zero-trust-authentication-eic2023">authentication</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc71144/dynamic-authorization-management">authorization</a> mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the challenges do not end there. Inadequate network security measures may expose devices to cyberattacks; vulnerabilities introduced during the manufacturing and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81221/software-supply-chain-security">supply chain</a> process may be exploited by attacker; devices can be tampered with; managing the entire lifecycle of devices, including updates and patches; and decentralized data processing in edge computing introduces additional security vulnerabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity key to addressing IoT challenges&nbsp; 
<p>Identity plays a crucial role in addressing challenges associated with IoT, IIoT, and IoMT devices. Establishing identities for devices and users can ensure that only authorized entities have access to specific resources and functionality, while identity-based access policies enable organizations to define and enforce fine-grained authorization rules to improve security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assigning unique identities to devices enables secure authentication, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized devices can connect to a network, while implementing mutual authentication between devices and the network enhances overall security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can help prevent unauthorized access to internet-connected devices by managing the identity lifecycle proactively by implementing secure provisioning processes and ensuring that devices are decommissioned when no longer in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishing identities for devices (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/standards-framework-non-human-identities-eic2023">non-human identities</a>) and users enables organizations to analyze and monitor behavioral patterns. Anomalies indicating potential security threats can be detected and addressed promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can improve privacy protection in consumer-facing applications by associating user identities with devices to enable personalized services, while respecting consumer privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of standardized identity protocols such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/3083/2">OAuth</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5077">OpenID Connect</a> ensures consistent and security identity management practices for internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking device and user identities helps with regulatory compliance because it enables organizations to demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards through identity-based audit logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 It is all in the approach&nbsp; 
<p>And implementing a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">zero trust</a> approach, where devices are not automatically trusted and must authenticate before accessing resources, will improve security but requires robust identity management during the onboarding process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity-centric approaches, therefore, can contribute significantly to a more controlled, accountable, and secure environment, addressing many of the challenges introduced by the rapid adoption of internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join the international identity community at KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity &amp; Cloud conference</a> #EIC2024&nbsp; in June to discuss every aspect of identity across the wider IT landscape.

<p>Those who have been following Holochain for a while have heard of <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Internet of Energy Network (IOEN)</a>. In short, IOEN’s goal is to support a sustainable energy transition by enabling microgrids of local renewables to collectively account for the energy they produce and to engage in the global financial market.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this, they need a way for the individuals and communities that make up these microgrids to document their energy generation in a verifiable manner.</p><p>Holochain, <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>, <a href="https://gildlab.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">GildLab</a>, and IOEN have teamed up to bring a working demonstration of verifiable energy to ETHDenver 2024. This will show how you can build a verifiable data system on Holochain and connect that system to an EVM, accessing financial opportunities like semi-fungible tokens and renewable energy certificates.</p> The Demo <p>To demonstrate the possibilities of verifiable energy generation at ETHDenver we are scaling down to the human level. With an <a href="https://www.getoffthegrid.ca/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Off the Grid</a> exercise bike set up as a human powered generator, we’re asking event participants to join in and create some energy with us.&nbsp;</p><p>As the bike produces a charge it will be measured with a sensor on its way to charge a battery. This data is then fed into a raspberry pi running a Holochain app that will transmit this data to an auditable <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DHT</a>. To tie that particular instance of energy generation to the person riding the bike, we’ll have them scan a QR code to connect the <a href="https://tokenproof.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">tokenproof app</a> (which they used for their ETHDenver tickets). Along with the profile from their tickets and the measurement of energy generated, an observer will post photographic evidence of the particular person riding the bike at the particular time that energy was generated.</p><p>Then, human power credits (developed for this demo) are minted and sent to the wallet the rider connected. These are then placed into the IOEN marketplace, where they will be aggregated into IOEN renewable energy certificates (IOEN RECs), and bought and retired using IOEN tokens — showing end-to-end value, tracking and transparency of data through the Holochain app, and showcasing opportunities for liquidity in decentralized energy generation and finance.</p> Demonstrating Verifiable Data <p>The exact data fields collected are particular to this demonstration. What is important are the ways we can layer data sources, building up context so that we can verify an event that occurred in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>Having multiple sources of data which authenticate the same event allows for outside observers to verify the generation of that energy, compensating the individuals who generated the energy.&nbsp; Holochain provides a self-validating system where this data can be stored and managed. Because you can audit not just storage but also actions within Holochain it allows data to be updated over time. And because Holochain uses distributed peer-to-peer networks, there aren’t the data limits or transaction costs of blockchains. Plus now with Rainlang, we can <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-a-new-link-in-web3/">connect the data in Holochain to EVM transactions</a>, securely linking the financials with the data.</p><p>This system has been developed to prototype verifiable data, and these same principles can be customized to any particular use case. Different regulators need different types of information depending on the industry. The goal is to show how multiple data sources can be layered in a self-validating environment and used to connect the digital environment to real world assets. From there, systems for automated witnessing and the validation of outputs can be developed.</p> The Use Case <p>So, what is the use case at scale?</p><p>Renewable energy certificates (RECs) offer businesses a way to offset their use of non-renewable energy by supporting renewables. Currently these certificates are measured in MWh (megawatt hours) and often require extensive reporting and expensive auditors in order to be validated. This makes them often inaccessible to small or distributed producers, as only larger generating sources (like windfarms or larger solar arrays) can bear the cost to validate their energy production and receive the right to sell their certificates.</p><p>IOEN has partnered with PV BLOX which is supporting new markets and installations for small scale solar and renewable microgrids in South East Asia. These producers are households as well as companies with solar panels on their roofs. In order to provide proof of the renewable energy that they generate, they need to gather multiple sources of data together that can then be presented to third party auditors to validate before passing that on to government agencies who issue the RECs.</p><p>For this particular use case, the data collected is mimicked in our demo with the bike. First, they need to show how much energy they are producing; this is measured by a reading off their meter. To corroborate that the energy is being generated from a renewable source, they also take a photo of their new panels. Now, all of that data collection is happening locally and is self-reported. To add an additional layer from a third party source, they also include satellite photos of before and after the solar installation. Together, all of this data from PV BLOX is then held in IOEN’s Holochain app, allowing the local producers to directly hold their data, while also having it held by the network and accessible to auditors and others as needed. Because every action within Holochain is validated, the data can’t be replaced or altered without a trail of those changes attached to the original entry. This makes it easy for auditors to verify the data collected from these multiple sources, checking the claim of energy generated against the approximate capacity to generate. This creates a ‘direct line of sight’ from auditors, regulators, and purchasers to the underlying data (amount of energy generated) supporting the asset (the REC, now on-chain).</p><p>IOEN helps PV BLOX aggregate the data from the producers so that the energy they generate can be accounted for collectively. This is then presented to auditors and the relevant agencies, and RECs are granted and then sold either bilaterally or through the IOEN/PV BLOX marketplace. The funds from that sale are then fractionalized and sent across the value chain to reward participants, including the producers based on their individual energy generation.</p><p>With integrations for tokenizing the assets almost finished, the ETHDenver demo is the prototype that shows how this will function embedded with Holochain when complete.&nbsp;</p> The Finances <p>So, what does any of this have to do with blockchains?</p><p>By connecting the sale and consumption of RECs to the financial markets of blockchains, we can open up a few new DeFi-driven opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, global liquidity and investment. For small producers, ease of fractionalization is important to scale up opportunities for finance. When a REC is sold, those profits are automatically dispersed to the producers, without the money being held up, captured opaquely, or lost in bureaucratic channels. And because the transactions are in a secure, public space, producers can check them to ensure fairness — creating upfront, open, and transparent business relations for those in the chain, and a fairer distribution of the profits.</p><p>Secondly, to increase future liquidity and financing options, IOEN is working with the new financial tool of semi-fungible tokens. In their implementation, they have fungible tokens representing units of energy which can be traded on the open market and NFTs representing RECs which can be pre-bought or held as a single MWh to offset carbon emissions. This NFT points to the data held in Holochain, showing all of the details of that particular REC, where and how the energy was produced, who audited it, etc. If that REC is to be retired or sold, the owner must balance the underlying energy value of the REC with the fungible tokens. The uniqueness of each REC will allow for a differentiation between their values, depending on the practices of their production, their level of verifiability, etc. Thus, by keeping a public account of all the relevant details, these financial tools will help encourage investment in more just and sustainable energy.&nbsp;</p> What It Means <p>IOEN is opening access to global financial opportunities and creating an economy of scale by aggregating small producers. This is part of a strategy for transition. By leveraging DeFi to finance a sustainable energy transition, the goal is to eventually move to a truly decentralized physical infrastructure for renewable energy generation. At some point, renewable energy certificates won’t matter because every factory, store, transportation service, and everything else we now see as polluters will be powered by locally produced renewables. Microgrids, with mutual credit currencies to manage and account for the local production and consumption of energy, auditable at the global level, will be the DePIN future for energy. IOEN is developing the tools that will help us make that transition and build the foundations of that future. </p>

  <p>Howdy folks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I'm thrilled to announce support for additional capabilities now available for&nbsp;Conditional Access reauthentication policy scenarios. Reauthentication policy lets you require users to interactively provide their credentials again - typically before accessing critical applications and taking sensitive actions. Combined with Conditional Access session control of Sign-in frequency, you can require reauthentication for users and sign-ins with risk, or for Intune enrollment. With today's public preview, now you can require reauthentication for any resource protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To tell you more about this capability, I’ve invited Inbar Cizer Kobrinsky, Principal Product Manager at Microsoft Entra, to talk about the scenarios and configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m excited to tell you more about the public preview capabilities that we’re adding to the “Sign-in frequency – every time” session control in Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single sign-on (SSO) using modern authentication is like a secret sauce for productivity and security. It improves productivity because users can access applications smoothly without signing in to each one with their credentials. SSO also enhances security because it reduces the risks of credential reuse and gives you a common point for control and logging for your Zero Trust deployments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are situations where you may want the user's input, such as interactive authentication, before accessing a resource. One of these situations is token theft. A token theft attack occurs when threat actors compromise and replay tokens issued to a user, even if that user has satisfied multifactor authentication (MFA). Because authentication requirements are met, the threat actor is granted access to organizational resources by using the stolen token. Risk-based reauthentication policies can help lower the risk that results from a token theft, requiring threat actors to compromise a fresh token to regain system access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let's look at some additional examples of these situations, where you may want to prompt the user for reauthentication:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Accessing high-risk resources, such as connecting to a VPN.&nbsp; 
 Activating a privileged role in Privileged Identity Management (PIM).&nbsp; 
 Performing an action within an application, such as changing personal information in an HR application.&nbsp; 
 Critical actions such as Intune enrollment or updating credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Risky sign-ins, as called out above, help reduce and mitigate the risk of token theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>With the latest update, you now can create policies requiring interactive reauthentication for any application or authentication context protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the example below, we’ve created a reauthentication policy for super sensitive actions, such as wire transfer. We’re using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/developer-guide-conditional-access-authentication-context">authentication context</a>, which the developer has integrated into the application. Before a user can transfer any amount from the application, they must satisfy the Conditional Access policy that targets this authentication context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Create a "sign-in frequency - every time" policy for super sensitive actions using authentication context</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conditional Access policy for this authentication context requires phishing-resistant authentication (using authentication strength) and “Sign-in frequency – every time”. The next time a user attempts to make a wire transfer, they will be required to reauthenticate with a phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 IDnow’s recently released UK Fraud Awareness Report explores the nation’s awareness of the latest fraud terms, the industries most susceptible to fraud, and how commonly Brits use risky channels. 



 



<p>2023 proved to be a monumental year for fraud in the UK. In fact, by the middle of the year, the losses attributed to fraud <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/oct/25/uk-consumer-lose-580m-fraudster-first-half-2023-romance-scam-id-theft-fastest-growing-categories">were already £580 million</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The year was also important for the steps that the UK government pledged to take to address fraud. Chief among these was the release of its fraud strategy, which, the government hopes, will reduce fraud by 10% by 2025. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-fraud-charter-2023">Online Fraud Charter</a> was also launched in 2023, which is a voluntary agreement between the government and technology sector to reduce fraud on their platforms and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these initiatives will hopefully go some way to encourage the public and private sector to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK, they will not necessarily address perhaps the most important challenge: educating the public in a tangible, meaningful way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the aim of investigating the British public’s awareness of fraud and its attitudes toward fraud prevention technology, we created the inaugural IDnow UK Fraud Awareness Report.&nbsp;</p>



 
   
     
                     UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024 
                     Learn more about the British public’s awareness of fraud and their attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


<p>In the first of a three-part blog series, we explore the fraud education levels of the British population, the areas of life most susceptible to fraud, and users’ behavior around insecure digital communication channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Assessing the awareness of fraud. 



<p>If there was one term that appeared to be on everybody’s lips (from the fraud prevention community) last year, it was ‘deepfakes.’ However, despite some widely circulated deepfake videos of famous politicians making headlines in 2023, we discovered that almost half (47%) of Brits said that they do not know what deepfakes are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We define deepfakes as deceptively lifelike, manipulated images, audio or video recordings. The quality of deepfakes is constantly improving as computing power increases and AI advances, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between authentic and artificially created or altered material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social engineering, unlike other forms of cyberattacks, appeals to human vulnerabilities and emotions. For example, in romance fraud, the fraudster uses social engineering to build up a rapport with the victim with the intention of tricking them into registering for a service or transferring funds. Worryingly, we discovered that more than half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we did discover some positives regarding the British public’s awareness of fraud terms. A vast majority (83%) of respondents say they know what ‘phishing’ is (gathering a victim’s personal information, such as credentials or payment information, by getting them to click on a malicious link or attachment).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although many respondents were not aware of the definitions of the latest forms of fraud, an overwhelming number (93%) say they are concerned about fraud in one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Which industry is most susceptible to fraud? 



<p>Despite a majority (73%) of Brits believing their bank is effective in safeguarding their financial assets, three quarters (75%) of respondents said banking was the industry they were most concerned about when it comes to fraud. More than half (55%) of UK adults say they are also concerned about online shopping fraud, followed by a third of the population (37%) citing social media fraud as a worry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respondents were also asked to assess the risk levels of different crimes: 32% think they are most at risk of someone having access to their bank account through identity fraud; another 21% of Brits think they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discover more about the different types of social media fraud, and how one man almost lost a million euros to a pig butchering scam in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">blog, ‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other industries are also perceived as rife with fraud. Around 2 in 10 Brits are concerned about insurance fraud (19%); 14% worry about fraud in cryptocurrency, eGovernment (13%), online dating (13%), travel (12%) and telecoms (11%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Discover the steps that one woman is taking to expose romance scams in our blog,<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/"> ‘What’s love got to do with it? Exposing the romance scammers, with Becky Holmes.’</a>]&nbsp;</p>



 Which channel is considered the riskiest? 



<p>Despite 97% of respondents knowing what identity theft means, and widespread concern about fraud in various areas of life, a third of Brits (33%) have admitted to sharing scans or photos of ID cards, driving licenses or passports via insecure and largely unencrypted channels, such as social media, email or messenger apps.&nbsp;Of these people, almost half (45%) said they were aware that these document scans or photos could land in the hands of fraudsters but&nbsp;proceeded to share these scans or photos anyway. This is a clear indicator that consumers are either unaware of an alternative way of verification (for example, via an identity verification solution) or the service they were trying to access did not offer a secure channel. It also highlights the importance for businesses to provide secure digital channels for customers to share personal information.&nbsp;</p>



 How IDnow helps prevent fraud. 



<p>IDnow offers comprehensive fraud prevention solutions to safeguard against various types of fraud, including social engineering, fake IDs, identity fraud, and much more. Our automated document verification and biometric checks, including selfie and face match, verify users’ identities with precision, while our passive liveness detection feature adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that genuine customers are verified seamlessly. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We also offer an expert-assisted video verification process, where trained professionals who verify users’ documents and ask security and fraud related questions looking for any signs of suspicious behavior or social engineering attempts. Through real-time intervention and questioning, our experts can detect and prevent fraudulent activities effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow also regularly runs education and awareness sessions to help clients and their customers recognize and respond to social engineering threats. By combining advanced technology, expert insights, and proactive strategies, IDnow is committed to helping businesses mitigate the risks associated with rising fraud attempts and protect both their reputation and their customers’ trust.</p>

			 Why Do Asset Managers Embrace Tokenization? 
 
<p>I’m excited to share some exciting news from our side, as we proudly participated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/businesses/digital-assets?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4#tokenization">Citi’s tokenization use case to test the ERC-3643 token standard</a>&nbsp;for enforcing compliance on-chain. This showcased how tokenized securities can thrive in a decentralized infrastructure while maintaining compliance and control.</p>
<p>Another significant news is Blackrock’s recent statement on tokenization, positioning it as the next step after the cryptocurrency spot ETFs. Now, let’s delve into why asset managers are eagerly embracing tokenization. According to PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/library/asset-wealth-management-trends.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">research</a>, the top priorities for asset managers in the next two years include&nbsp;accessing new segments and clients, increasing market share, and mitigating risks through product diversification. Below, I will explain how tokenization helps asset managers to achieve these strategic goals.</p>
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Tokenization opens the door for asset managers to gain new capital sources from untapped segments&nbsp;– new regions, and new types of investors such as High Net Worth (HNW) investors and family offices, to meet market demand and gain market shares. Illuminating this potential, EY’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/financial-services/tokenization-in-asset-management?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;underscores a significant trend: 61% of HNW investors plan to invest in tokenized assets in 2024. Tokenization enables asset managers to tackle the historical challenges rooted in manual, time-consuming processes, and fragmented systems through programmability and shared infrastructure. It empowers them to acquire the capability to efficiently handle a large number of clients and unlock a potential&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/how-tokenization-can-fuel-a-400-billion-opportunity-in-distributing-alternative-investments-to-individuals/?utm_medium=social_advocacy&amp;utm_source=LinkedIn-dysi&amp;utm_content=659945e8-bafb-4474-abae-0cdb8cd50411&amp;utm_term=147236&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">$400 billion revenue opportunity</a>, according to Bain &amp; Company.</p>
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/asset-wealth-management/high-net-worth-investor.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">survey</a>&nbsp;shows that 66% of HNW investors desire increased personalization in their wealth management relationship. This trend towards personalized models is also highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2024/jan/asset-management-trends-for-2024.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;“10 Asset Management Trends for 2024,” suggesting opportunities for asset managers to compete with wealth manager home offices. Tokenized securities embed asset data, enabling such customization.&nbsp;By offering tailored tokenized portfolios based on clients’ risk profiles, asset managers can attract and retain clients.&nbsp;Tokenization can even combine with AI to allow&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/the-new-financial-world-ai-meets-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">AI to analyze, and blockchain to execute</a>, creating another level of personalized experience.</p>
<p>Regarding risk management, thanks to transparency, automation, and availability of asset data, asset managers can&nbsp;automatically rebalance portfolios to migrate risks&nbsp;based on predefined risk conditions. For instance, setting up a smart contract to trigger a sell-off when the risk rating level transitions from AAA to AA.</p>
<p>Lastly, as highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s report, a notable trend in the private market is the&nbsp;surge in Limited Partner (LP) secondaries and the emergence of net asset value (NAV-based) lending.&nbsp;These have gained momentum as the return on capital slows, and investors increasingly seek liquidity.&nbsp;Tokenization emerges as a powerful solution, offering diversified products and cultivating liquidity. Tokenized securities, carrying both compliance rules and asset data, enable instant compliant transferability, support peer-to-peer transactions, and integrate seamlessly with third-party trading applications. This enables global and flat distribution. Furthermore, lending smart contracts can be easily launched to allow LPs to pledge their tokenized securities for borrowing.</p>
<p>This emphasis on liquidity is also our primary focus as&nbsp;we build distribution rails to expand the DINO distribution network for tokenized securities, as discussed by Xavi Aznal, our Head of Product, in&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-2024-products-building-the-distribution-rails-of-the-tokenized-economy/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">the last Product Focus newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>We anticipate witnessing the launch of tokenization projects by at least 5 out of 10 of the largest asset managers this year.</p>
<p>Let’s stay tuned for this exciting moment.</p>

<p>About Making Data Better episode 9, <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">“The Bigger Step: Want a Single Digital ID?”</a></p>
 The presumption of a singular ID&nbsp; 
<p>We’ve been <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">writing about the new Australian Government Digital ID System</a> (AGDIS) and <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14477065-a-big-little-step-australia-shifts-from-digital-identity-to-digital-id">talking about it the Making Data Better podcast</a>. We’re reading press reports, speaking to commentators, and finding some ambiguity about whether this thing is might be a new ID or attribute.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister Katy Gallagher, responsible for the Digital ID Bill, says she is not in the business of producing a new national ID. We believe her.</p>
<p>Yet many still believe AGDIS must be producing some sort of new attribute. It could provide a new way to do KYC checks when opening a bank account, or proving how old we are when we buy alcohol online.</p>
<p>A lot is left to the imagination: Does AGDIS really mean a new sort of attribute, a de facto ID? No, and the spectre of a singular ID distracts from the true potential of Digital ID to fix what’s broken.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">In our latest short conversation</a>, <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/about/george-peabody/">George</a> and I try to clarify what AGDIS could be delivering.</p>
 How do we think about the prospect of new attributes? 
<p>We’ve been celebrating the fact that with the Digital ID Bill,<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/rip-trusted-digital-identity-but-whither-australias-tdif/"> the government is not talking about “digital identity” anymore</a>.</p>
<p>But the term Digital ID in the public mind could be construed as a new identifier or national ID, and many don’t like that idea.</p>
<p>The good people of Australia, the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand — the Common Law system countries — are famously allergic to National ID. So, there are some optics to be concerned about.</p>
<p>But much more important is the question of how relying parties use any ID, be it old or new. It’s the relying parties that actually make use of IDs and take a risk on them. We’ve seen over and over around the world that the success of digital identification is in the hands of relying parties.</p>
<p>The critical problem with a new digital ID is that the relying parties’ existing systems don’t know how to consume it.</p>
<p>They will not have seen it before. They won’t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>Even if lawyers and risk officers gave it the all-clear, a new ID needs to be incorporated into subsystems and business processes that have operated for years around driver’s licenses, birth certificates and Medicare numbers. Subsystems include onboarding routines, user interfaces, databases, risk assessments, and call centre processes. They would all need updating for a new ID.</p>
 The need for flexibility in identification 
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) has a bad reputation and it’s far from perfect, but it works in familiar ways, drawing on sets of well-established IDs which can be put together in different ways to onboard new customers.</p>
<p>Every bank actually does KYC differently. KYC conventions allow for variations. </p>
<p>This is critical. Think of the challenge of “low doc” customers — individuals without the affordances of passports or driver licences who still have the same right to participate in the finance system. To accommodate customers with diverse personal documents, banks can vary their KYC processes.</p>
<p>Banks know their own way business environments and rightly have the discretion to customise their identification processes. </p>
<p>When KYC draws on lists of established IDs, it allows for flexibility, and compensatory controls when identification pathways need to be varied.</p>
<p>But if we throw a new attribute into the ecosystem — especially one that is supposed to be better or preferred — then we force the banks back to square one to work out what to do with it.</p>
<p>We know perfectly well from the <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/fractional-identity-an-alternative-to-nstic-federated-identity-models/">failure of grand Identity Federations</a> that trust isn’t transitive. That is, the work done by one party to manage its risks is not going to satisfy other parties.</p>
<p>Instead of any new IDs or bundles of attributes, we need to make better data available to established identification processes. The Australian Digital ID System can do that simply through verifiable credentials that make it impossible for ID data to be replayed by fraudsters.</p>
<p>Let’s move away from plaintext presentation of IDs and adopt device-bound presentation just like we have with our chip payment cards and digital wallets, where hardware and software work together to make each presentation unique and non-replayable.</p>
<p>The golden opportunity we have now comes from so many people having computers in their hands that can present and release data in a far more secure way than filling out a form.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, we understand why people can suspect that Digital ID going to be a new ID, but it’s not. No new ID is needed.&nbsp;To fix online identification, we can conserve all the IDs we know today and make the move from plaintext to device-bound smart presentation.</p>

<p>Why isn’t the world moving more quickly towards passwordless tech?</p>



<p>Passwords have long been the bedrock of cybersecurity, but let’s face it, they aren’t a great solution, especially when personal and financial data is at risk. If you show me a news article about a high-profile breach, I’m probably going to point to reliance on passwords as one likely cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In 2020, Ticketmaster <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ticketmaster-pays-10-million-criminal-fine-intrusions-competitor-s-computer-systems-0">pleaded guilty</a> to a charge of repeatedly and illegally accessing competitors’ computers. How? They had an employee who used to work for a rival company. That employee was able to the login credentials for multiple corporate accounts at that rival company to steal information.&nbsp; 



 Also in 2021, the New York City Law Department ended up <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cyberattack-on-nyc-law-department/">exposing the personal data</a> of thousands of city employees. This included evidence of police misconduct, medical records for plaintiffs, and more. All because of a single employee’s stolen email account password. 



 23andMe, in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/15/23andme-hack-data-genetic-data-selling-response">exposed data</a> for millions of users, thanks to hackers using all the bad passwords they could find to run what’s called credential stuffing attack that got them into the systems where they could harvest data to their dirty little hearts’ content. 
 



<p>What’s so wildly frustrating about all this is that there are better ways to secure accounts! We just have to get companies to support them.</p>



<p>So, let’s look at a more secure alternative.</p>



 The Case for Going Passwordless&nbsp; 



<p>Older passwordless solutions, like hardware tokens and smart cards, definitely offer enhanced security. You have to physically have a thing in order to access a thing. Combine that with something like biometrics, and suddenly you have two-factor authentication: something you have and something you are. I’ll be the first to admit, though, that diving straight into requiring a physical … something … to log in is not going to be the solution for everyone. It’s an extra step, and it involves someone buying that physical thing. There is always cost associated with security that may outweigh the data you are trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The really good news here is that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">cute little hardware tokens</a> that you are going to lose, or, if you’re like my friend Sarah, will need to put on a pair of earrings so you don’t lose them, are no longer your only option for going passwordless. Enter in, stage left, passkeys!</p>



 About Passkeys 



<p>Passkeys are a technology that feels almost too good to be true, because they can work with your mobile device OR with a hardware token. What you use to store your passkey depends a lot on what security model you’re following: super duper high levels of security, or a casual, please don’t access my New York Times subscription model. If you want the full gory details of how passkeys work, I suggest you go down the rabbit hole at the FIDO Alliance website. They’ve got a great primer at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 No, really, what is a passkey? 



<p>So, what is a passkey? A passkey is a digital credential, like an electronic key in this case, tied to both a user account and a website or application. Users can authenticate without having to enter a username or password, or provide any additional authentication factor, because they have this key, which is entirely under their control and can’t be shared or stolen the way a password can. When a user is asked to sign-in to an app or website (basically unlocking access with the key), the user approves the sign-in with the same biometric or PIN that the user has to unlock the device the passkey is stored on (whether that device is a phone, computer, or hardware key).&nbsp; It’s really just that easy to use. If my cats had phones, they could totally do this.</p>



<p>One of my favorite things about passkeys, when they comply with the FIDO standards that define them, is that they can’t be phished. Anyone spoofing an email, phone call, or SMS asking for your password or the code you received in a text message is out of luck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now we have something that’s actually easier to use than a password because we don’t have to type anything in AND is more secure. So let’s talk about making the business case.&nbsp;</p>



 Crafting Your Business Case 



<p>I’m going to suggest that to advocate for passwordless systems, you need emphasize the benefits: enhanced security, potential cost savings, and a smoother user experience. What organization doesn’t find that attractive? I’m also going to go ahead and recognize that if you are working in a regulated industry like banking, a lot of this is already old news to you. Why? Because if you’re in the US, the Federal Trade Commission has required MFA since 2021 through its <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/09/2021-25736/standards-for-safeguarding-customer-information">Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information</a>. If you’re in the EU, you have similar requirements not to mention the recommendations in <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/what-is-eIDAS-2-how-digital-identity-verification-plays-a-key-role">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS 2 directive</a>.</p>



<p>But, for the rest of us, yay, let’s emphasize the benefits! But who are you emphasizing the benefits to? If you’re in the IT security department, you probably don’t need to be convinced. But there are a variety of other stakeholders in an organization that you can get on your side. If you’re in a big company, your HR, Legal, PR, and Financial departments might have a thing or two to say about protecting the company’s reputation by avoiding being lit on fire in the news because of a cybersecurity breach. They might also be really fond of the idea of having an argument to lower the tech insurance costs. And if you’re in a regulated industry like banking, healthcare, or are handling government contracts, then this is an obvious requirement to pass those audits. So, yep, lots of positive reasons to make these changes.</p>



<p>Whether your company is in the business of IT or not, better security is critical. If you have an Internet presence, if your employees log in to something to do their work, and especially if you have consumers, there are a lot of business cases you can make for moving away from a pure password model into something a bit more technologically sexy and secure.</p>



 Embracing Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Jumping straight to a passwordless world might be a bit too much to expect, and look a little too much like arcane magic to your executives. There are still things you can do to make your reliance on passwords a little less fraught with peril! And that’s requiring multi-factor authentication. MFA, which also encompasses two-factor authentication, requires at least two out of the following three things:</p>



 
 something you know 



 something you have 



 something you are 
 



<p>So, like a password, a physical token, or your biometrics. In some cases, you may want to require all three! It depends on what you’re trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More systems are ready to support MFA than they are to support passkeys. One of your limiting factors in convincing your organization to support passkeys is that the software you use might not support it yet. OK, I get it, but if your software or services doesn’t support MFA yet, you really need to have some stern words with your vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a lot of information out there about best practices when it comes to how to deploy MFA. I want to highlight two articles from the IDPro Body of Knowledge that should be required reading in this space:</p>



 
 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/49/">Designing MFA for Humans</a> – Nishant Kaushik 



 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/92/">Multi-factor Authentication</a> – Khaled Zaky and Dean H. Saxe 
 



<p>When your organization considers rolling out MFA or starts to evaluate MFA as part of their vendor evaluations, these articles will give you some really good things to think about when it comes to balancing what individuals need versus what’s the best shiny object for cybersecurity professionals, and what is best practice all around. Go read them.</p>



 Transition Strategies and Best Practices&nbsp; 



<p>You’ve made the case. You’re going to start with pushing MFA as a little less scary, a little more supported. But there are a few of your vendors or services ready to dive straight into the passwordless universe. That’s brilliant! However, as much as I love MFA and passkeys, and I want you to get there, I’m telling you right now, don’t just throw your user base into this brave new world and think that’s going to work for you.</p>



<p>Start with pilot programs, evaluate feedback, and scale up. You’re going to need to convince some people that the magic of passkeys is really more secure. You’re going to need to get them to understand that yes, their account even though they are just a junior staffer in the PR department, using MFA is important. You’ll need different arguments for different stakeholder groups, and that’s ok.</p>



<p>For your executives, cite successful case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of MFA or passkeys with existing systems. A basic Google search will net you several examples; if you’re using a vendor like Ping or Okta, they almost certainly have more. For your line managers, they might be more compelled if you pointed them to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/how-do-you-train-your-employees-use-multi-factor">thread on LinkedIn</a> about “How do you train your employees to use multi-factor authentication securely and effectively?“ where their peers talk about the benefits of MFA.</p>



<p>There are other organizations that are paving the way. <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys">Google Identity</a> has some great developer documentation about passkeys. Okta has some <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/8-steps-for-effectively-deploying-mfa/">pretty good stuff</a> about MFA.</p>



 The Road Ahead 



<p>it’s going to take time for your organization to actually move, especially if you’re just starting to make the case for this change. This is good, because there is still one rather important kink to work out, and that’s account recovery. If, or more to the point, when, you lose your hardware token, phone, or whatever device you have your passkey on, you have a problem, and it’s not one a helpdesk can easily help you solve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least at the moment, some of the best advice in high-security situations is to make sure you’re protected against losing your hardware tokens, have more than one hardware token. Not the best model ever, to be honest. There are other points to consider as well, and for all of those fine points about account recovery, I’m going to point you right over to the article on <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/64/">Account Recovery</a> by Dean Saxe over in the IDPro Body of Knowledge.</p>



<p>The journey to a passwordless future is ongoing. Stay informed about emerging technologies, educate your team, and be a proactive advocate for advanced security solutions in your organization.</p>



 Wrap Up&nbsp; 



<p>There you have it: my thoughts on how you can and should advance towards a passwordless future while bolstering security with multi-factor authentication. This post is purely a place for you to start; it should inspire you to encourage change both in how you handle your own accounts and how you take action for organizational change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually, Holochain 0.2 has been with us for a long time — since last <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">May</a> — and developers have been actively building hApps on Holochain 0.3 for a while as well. But for developers who are new to Holochain, we’ve still been recommending 0.1 up until this point. That’s because 0.2’s new networking layer introduced a few <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">performance</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-6-maintenance-release/#holochain-02-progress-building-comprehensive-diagnostic-capacities">regressions</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">peer discovery</a> issues, and we wanted to be confident that the user experience was reasonably smooth before recommending it.</p><p>Today is the day we're now recommending Holochain 0.2.6 for all existing and new projects.</p><p>You'll notice that this release has been out for a few weeks, and there have been a number of unannounced releases since 0.2.1. In recent months we’ve adopted a new process for public releases. Here’s how it looks:</p>  The core dev team cuts a release candidate (RC).  The release candidate is ‘smoke tested’ to make sure it works with a few mature apps that exercise a lot of its functionality, particularly <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">Talking Stickies</a> and HoloFuel.  If the smoke test passes, the RC designation is removed and the commit is promoted to a proper release.  The dev tooling (client libs, scaffolding, etc) are updated to the new release.  A ‘soak test’ is performed, in which an app is run for a couple weeks in order to discover long-term performance and discoverability issues.  If the soak test passes with reasonable performance, the commit is promoted to the latest recommended release and we spread the news.  <p>It’s been a long time coming, but Holochain 0.2.6 is finally the first release in the 0.2 series to pass the above checks to our satisfaction. Let’s get into what’s new.</p> Holochain 0.2.6: Recommended for all developers <p>Release date: 6 February 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x</p><p>The changelog from Holochain 0.1.6 is too long to repeat here, but here are the highlights:</p>  New networking layer based on WebRTC, which lets us use off-the-shelf session negotiation and NAT hole-punching techniques. The QUIC protocol, which we built 0.1’s&nbsp; networking layer on, was great, but it forced us to build a lot of network tooling from scratch.  Many performance improvements and fixes for peer discovery, function calls, signals, and gossip; apps feel much faster (and we’re working on making it faster still).  A small number of breaking changes in the conductor APIs and the WASM host API.  A lot of work to clean up the ‘workflows’, the processes that run pretty much everything in the conductor, leading to better testability, better performance, and more correctness.  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main-0.2/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org#20240206184429">full changelog</a> or skim through the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">release notes</a>. If this is your first time using 0.2, make sure you read all the way down! And apologies for the coarseness of the second link — GitHub really needs to add a feature to let you filter by <a href="https://semver.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">semver</a>.</p><p>This release is paired with new libraries, developer tools, and infrastructure:</p>  HDI 0.3.6 and HDK 0.2.6 maintain compatibility with the WASM host API.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases/tag/v0.16.9?ref=blog.holochain.org">JavaScript client 0.16.9</a>&nbsp; and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/releases/tag/v0.4.5?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rust client 0.4.5</a> maintain compatibility with the conductor APIs, along with the usual bug fixes and code/API cleanups.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases/tag/v0.15.2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tryorama 0.15.2</a> has been updated to JavaScript client 0.16 to give it compatibility with Holochain 0.2, and gets a new awaitDhtSync function, bringing back a useful feature Tryorama had back in the Holochain Redux days!  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding/commit/ddb8b5a950e7be81d704000e662564696bef5d6b?ref=blog.holochain.org">hc-scaffold 0.2001.1</a> generates code that uses the latest HDI and HDK to maintain compatibility with 0.2.6.  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/hc-spin?ref=blog.holochain.org">hc spin</a>, a new dev tool, spins up one or more conductors with your hApp running in them, opens up your UI in an <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo-electron?ref=blog.holochain.org">Electron-based container</a> (a sort of mini-Launcher), and runs local network services. You can also configure it to use existing network services, your own UI dev server, and a specific Holochain binary on your machine. We’re moving our UI tools back to Electron, as we’ve found Tauri’s cross-OS compatibility isn’t quite there yet. hc launch, the Tauri equivalent, is still available.  The public bootstrap server bootstrap.holo.host has been updated.  There are two new servers for the new WebRTC networking, signal.holo.host for connection establishment and turn.holo.host for traffic proxying.  There’s a new dev tool command, hc run-local-services, that will run bootstrap and connection establishment services for machines on your local network.

And what about disinformation and misinformation? What role does identity have here? What about data and deepfakes for onboarding and biometrics? What does data access governance meanin 2024? Is data integrity protection the biggest issue within cyber today? How should we handle fine grained and contextual access and how do the CISO and Chief Data Officer relate?</p>

				  Learn why building decentralized identity functionality into your existing solutions has never been simpler with the Indicio mobile SDK.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-new-software-developer-kit-sdk-makes-creating-and-customizing-digital-wallets-for-any-application-quick-and-easy/">recently announced</a> the new <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">Indicio Proven mobile SDK</a> which enables any organization to build digital wallet functionality right into their existing applications. This allows any existing mobile application to hold and share verifiable data and identity, which leads to faster, more secure information sharing and a better experience for the end user.</p>
<p>Recently I sat down with the developers behind the project, Patrick Kenyon (PK) and Kolby Kunz (KK), to learn more about their thought process and how this new piece of technology was created. You can watch the full interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuXNHa07izw">here.</a></p>
<p>The following are a few excerpts from that conversation that have been edited for comprehension:</p>
<p>TS: Could you please break down just what is an SDK quickly for us?</p>
<p>PK: An SDK stands for software development kit, to be more specific, oftentimes if you have a feature that someone wants to implement in an app, an SDK will just be a library or an aid focused on implementing that specific feature in other applications.</p>
<p>TS: So for the proven mobile SDK it implements features of proven and digital wallet functionality specifically correct?</p>
<p>PK and KK: Yes.</p>
<p>TS: What problem were you given to solve that led to the creation of the SDK?</p>
<p>KK: We had resources that were limited just to react native, and we really wanted to be able to target native applications and go from taking native applications and targeting other Frameworks like react native or flutter that can consume native code and get it all in one place and one solid API that everyone can work with.</p>
<p>PK: The alternative would be to use multiple other libraries across multiple different apps, like if they’re trying to use a different platform. So say they’re developing for Android native and iOS native they’ have to get two separate applications or libraries that don’t exactly always line up and so with ours it does line up across all of the platforms we support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TS: What was your approach and how did you get started&nbsp; with the actual build?</p>
<p>KK: That was a lot, and we sat down for a long time with team leads and had a lot of discussion multiple meetings of what are we going to do, and I think originally we set out and we’re like “hey we’re gonna have to develop this in Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS and we’re going to have to try to make sure that they mirror each other” and we ended up finding a solution where we could develop just in one code base and cross compile to another and that really made it a lot simpler for us to be able to have like a unified API or application interface so that everything was the same whether you are on Android or iOS developing and using this SDK.</p>
<p>TS: Are there any features you’re particularly proud of?&nbsp;</p>
<p>PK: One of the features about the SDK that I’m happy about, that we’ve recently done, is the react native rapper, because we were able to take our SDK and prove that it works in both IOS and Android react native. We were also able to create the API so that the SDK stays the same between Android iOS and react native, and so if you’re building a different application or using a different platform you only have to learn the SDK once and it stays the same. It’s really sweet.</p>
<p>KK: I’m particularly proud of the proofs module, proofs as far as a decentralized identity concept is a very difficult concept to develop for, and there are a lot of pitfalls that can come with it, and I feel like our solution to get there is fairly robust. It’s a little verbose on the end consumption, but it gives the user a lot of power for being able to submit proofs and fulfill proof requests, so I was pretty proud of getting that one through the finish line.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule was implemented in the Philippines in February&nbsp;2021.  There is no minimum threshold in the Philippines for the Travel Rule to kick in, as originating and beneficiary VASPs must collect and share names and account numbers/unique reference numbers of their customers for all transactions.  The extent of information that VASPs are required to collect and share increases substantially when the value of crypto transactions exceeds ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).  <p>In 2021, the Philippines joined the Asia-Pacific Group and became a member of FATF-Style Regional Bodies. The same year, Bangko Sentral NG Pilipinas (BSP), the country’s Central Bank, released <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Regulations/Issuances/2021/1108.pdf">Circular 1108</a> to provide guidelines for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which included the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>With that, the FATF Travel Rule went into effect in February 2021 in the Philippines. As a result, crypto exchanges and service providers are now all required to follow the Philippines Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1742507280870822106">Image Source</a>)<p>This year, the Philippines has begun tightening Travel Rule requirements even further to strengthen the country’s AML and CFT measures against any illicit crypto transactions.</p> What is a VASP in the Philippines? <p>A VASP, according to BSP, is any entity that offers services facilitating the transfer or exchange of virtual assets and is involved in the following activities:</p>  Exchange between fiat currencies and virtual&nbsp;assets;  Exchange between different types of virtual&nbsp;assets;  Crypto transfer, and  Administration and/or safekeeping of crypto or instruments enabling control over&nbsp;crypto   Complying With the FATF Travel Rule in the Philippines <p>According to the country’s Central Bank, VASPs must share the following information with their corresponding VASPs for all crypto transactions, irrespective of the&nbsp;amount:</p>  Name  Account number or Unique reference number, if that is not available  <p>However, the extent of personally identifiable information that VASPs have to collect and share with their corresponding VASPs increases substantially when the amount of crypto transaction exceeds ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).</p><p>In such cases, VASPs are required to collect and share the following information:</p>  Name  Physical address  Date &amp; place of&nbsp;birth.  Account number  <p>Additionally, originating and beneficiary VASPs must establish and actively adhere to strict sanction screening procedures. They must also screen all transacting parties against terrorist financing lists and adverse media&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Moreover, VASPs must perform necessary due diligence on the transfer of virtual assets to and from countries that haven’t implemented the FATF Travel Rule yet. They also have to exercise caution and perform enhanced due diligence when dealing with crypto transfers using unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>The Travel Rule is part of a broader set of recommendations by the global anti-money laundering watchdog, the FATF, which included the Philippines in its ‘grey list.’ As a result of this, Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines have increased monitoring in order to maintain their trade relations and gain access to international finance.</p><p>Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, have already taken similar action and have tightened up regulations on the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Meanwhile, several countries such as Singapore, Switzerland, Estonia, South Korea, Canada, Japan, the US, and the UK have also adopted the Crypto Travel Rule and require digital asset service providers to maintain customer information and establish procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT measures.</p><p>The Philippines’ Travel Rule threshold is in line with the FATF’s $1,000 limit and more or less in conformity with other countries. In Singapore, the threshold for collecting and recording sender and receiver information is SGD 1,500 (about $1,115), while in the United States, it’s $3,000. However, in Estonia and Malaysia, there’s no minimum amount requirement for gathering this information.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>While the Philippines has taken significant steps to align with international standards by implementing the FATF Travel Rule for cryptocurrency transactions, these regulations have sparked a debate about their&nbsp;impact.</p><p>By setting requirements for VASPs to collect and share detailed information on transactions, the country aims to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. However, the increasing regulatory measures, including the latest tightening of the Travel Rule, highlight the ongoing tension between ensuring financial security and maintaining the open, decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency.</p><p>This delicate balance continues to shape the landscape of crypto regulation both in the Philippines and around the world. Amid this, it’s crucial for both regulators and industry representatives to remember that user security and experience should always be a priority.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What Are VASPs Required to Do Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>They must collect and exchange personal information for transactions exceeding ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).</p> Q2: Who Qualifies as a VASP in the Philippines? <p>Entities that facilitate the transfer or exchange of virtual assets, including exchanges between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.</p> Q3: What Happens if VASPs Fail to Follow the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>They may face regulatory penalties, including fines and revocation of their operating license, for non-compliance with the BSP’s guidelines.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>Like any other service, Microsoft Entra ID is not immune to human errors, accidental deletions, or malicious attacks that could result in the loss of important data. Therefore, it is essential to have a Microsoft Entra ID recovery strategy, especially for the objects that are hard deleted when removed from the service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard deletion means the object is permanently erased and cannot be restored by any means. The good news is that many objects support soft deletion, which means the object is marked as deleted in the service and moved to the recycle bin but not actually removed. The advantage of soft deletion is that the object can be recovered with its original configuration and dependencies, such as membership, assignments, and permissions, within 30 days. Therefore, it’s important to monitor and manage the soft-deleted objects in Microsoft Entra ID and decide whether to restore or permanently delete them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Users, Microsoft 365 Groups, (not security or distribution groups), and application registrations support soft deletion and can be restored using both the Microsoft Entra admin center and Microsoft Graph API. &nbsp; 
 Service principals and administrative units can also be restored from the recycle bin but only via the Microsoft Graph API.  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while synchronized user objects also support soft deletion, they should be backed up and restored at the source (Active Directory). Re-synchronization will automatically trigger the restoration of soft-deleted objects from the recycle bin. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Tracking deletions using Entra ID audit logs &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Every object deletion will trigger an event depending on the deletion type. For example, a soft-deleted user will trigger an event with the activity “Delete user” and a hard deletion will generate a “Hard Delete user” for a group that would be “Delete group” and “Hard Delete group” and so on, as shown in figure one below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra ID audit logs view</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the table below, delete, hard delete, and restore activities are listed for objects that support soft deletion, as they are seen in the audit log.  &nbsp;</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also be mindful of the following when working with events in the audit log: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Notice minor differences in activity naming, as Kusto Query Language (KQL) is case sensitive. You might have unexpected results when using strict “==” equality operators. &nbsp; 
 For any object type that does not support soft deletion, only "Delete objectType" events will be logged, meaning a hard deletion. For example, Delete conditional access policy. &nbsp; 
 For some object types, there’s an option to perform operations in bulk, providing a .csv file as input. For such bulk operations, there are additional events logged for start and finish, but there are still individual events for every object on the list. For example, (started (bulk) / Bulk restore deleted users - finished (bulk)). &nbsp; 
 When a synchronized object is moved out of sync or deleted in Active Directory, then it will be soft deleted in Microsoft Entra ID with a corresponding event.   &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Examples of queries for monitoring deletions with Microsoft Sentinel &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID works well with Microsoft Sentinel, our cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM), platform that is built on cloud technology and offers extensive threat detection and response features. If you use Microsoft Sentinel or Log Analytics to collect and analyze Microsoft Entra ID logs, here are some KQL query examples that can help you with investigating and alerting object deletion events from Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users that were soft deleted more than 25 days ago, will automatically be hard deleted soon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where OperationName in ("Delete group", "Delete user", "Delete application", "Delete administrative unit",  "Remove service principal")  
| where TimeGenerated between (ago(29d) .. ago(25d))  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 50 objects hard deleted in the past 10 minutes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(10m)  
| where OperationName in ("Hard Delete group", "Hard Delete user", "Hard Delete application", "Hard delete service principal")  
| summarize count()  
| where count_ &gt; 50  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User deletion is followed by hard deletion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let queryfrequency = 1h;  
let queryperiod = 2h;  
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(queryfrequency)  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| project-rename HardDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
| join kind=inner (  
    AuditLogs  
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)  
    | where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
    | extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
    | project-rename SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
) on UserId  
| extend TimeDelta = HardDeletion_TimeGenerated - SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated  
| where  TimeDelta between (time(0s) .. queryperiod)  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The queries above are provided as examples, and real detection logic and thresholds will be different for each organization. One approach could be building a Sentinel workbook to visualize data and establish deletion/restoration/hard deletion baselines that will eventually help with the creation of detections. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reviewing deleted objects &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with monitoring, it’s recommended to perform reviews of deleted objects. Reviews can be done regularly or prompted by some of the detection events discussed above. This can be done using the Microsoft Entra admin center, audit log-based queries, or Microsoft Graph API.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra admin center / Azure Portal&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to examine “recycle bins” for deleted users, groups, or applications is by administering Microsoft Entra ID in the Microsoft Entra <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#home">admin center</a> or Azure portal. However, this method has limitations, as the interface varies slightly depending on the object type, and for administrative units and service principals, there is no graphical experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Deleted objects experience for users, groups, and applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs</p>
<p>Audit logs can also be used to generate a soft deleted items report that shows all the deleted objects for the last 30 days, excluding those that have already been restored or hard deleted.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a sample query for User objects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let Users = AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(30d)  
| where Category == "UserManagement";  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Restore user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While audit logs is not a completely reliable method, they might be useful while building workbooks or reports. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph API</p>
<p>By calling the Microsoft Graph API using PowerShell and the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Identity.DirectoryManagement/?view=graph-powershell-beta">Microsoft.Graph module, </a>you can get a list of all the objects currently in the recycle bin. The sample code below will generate a single report for all the object types, and when needed, it can be easily adjusted to perform restores using the Restore-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItem cmdlet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph  
Connect-MgGraph   

$deletedUsers = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsUser  
$deletedServicePrincipals = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsServicePrincipal  
$deletedGroups = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsGroup  
$deletedApplications = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsApplication  
$deletedAUs = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsAdministrativeUnit 

$deletedItems = @()  

$deletedItems += $deletedGroups  
$deletedItems += $deletedApplications  
$deletedItems += $deletedUsers  
$deletedItems += $deletedServicePrincipals  
$deletedItems += $deletedAUs  

if ($deletedItems.Count -eq 0) {  
    Write-Host "No soft deleted objects found." -ForegroundColor Green  
}  
else {  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Users: $($deletedUsers.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Service Principals: $($deletedServicePrincipals.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted M365 Groups: $($deletedGroups.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Applications: $($deletedApplications.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Administrative Units: $($deletedAUs.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  

    $report = foreach ($item in $deletedItems) {  
        $deletedDate = Get-Date($item.DeletedDateTime)  
        $now = Get-Date  
        $hardDeletedInDays = 30 - ($now - $deletedDate).Days  

        [PSCustomObject]@{  
            Id                  = $item.Id  
            UserPrincipalName   = $item.UserPrincipalName  
            DisplayName         = $item.DisplayName  
            Deleted             = $deletedDate  
            HardDeletionIn      = $hardDeletedInDays  
        }  
    }  
    $report | Sort-Object 'Display Name' | Select-Object Id, DisplayName, Deleted, HardDeletionIn | Format-Table   
    $report | Export-Csv -Path "C:\temp\softDeletedObjects.csv" -Encoding UTF8 -NoTypeInformation  
}

<p>This script will generate a .csv file and provide a summary output:</p>

 Conclusion &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking deletions in Microsoft Entra ID can be useful for several reasons. These include identifying and recovering any objects that were accidentally or maliciously deleted, to monitoring and auditing changes in the directory and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations, and to optimizing license usage by removing any unnecessary or obsolete objects. Make sure to enable monitoring of deletions using queries above as a starting point and perform regular reviews of deleted items to be able to catch any potentially unwanted deletions while objects are still available for restoration.</p>

 Further Testing &amp; Enhancement Underway in Collaboration with VRS Provider Community <p>NEWTOWN, PA — February 22, 2024 — <a href="https://ledgerdomain.com/">LedgerDomain</a> and Spherity, leading providers in digital credentialing services, today announced results from their latest performance testing, exceeding the current<a href="https://www.oc-i.org/"> Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a> requirements for the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Enacted in 2013, DSCSA requires end-to-end traceability for the vast majority of prescription drug products, preventing counterfeit or illegitimate products from reaching patients.</p><p>With OCI-compliant credentials, DSCSA stakeholders can digitally interact with each other, even if they have no prior business relationship and use different solution providers. These stakeholders include Authorized Trading Partners (ATPs) as defined by the statute (i.e. manufacturers, repackagers, wholesalers, 3PLs, and dispensers) alongside federal and state authorities and ATP Equivalents.</p><p>With 4.9 billion prescriptions filled in the U.S. each year, high performance is essential to ensuring supply chain resilience and security. In rigorous testing scenarios, both LedgerDomain and Spherity demonstrated performance speeds for their VP Generate and VP Verify API endpoints at least twice as fast as the baseline established by the OCI Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria. Under the OCI specification, both calls should average no more than 1500 milliseconds.</p><p>OCI-compliant credentials integrate with the Verification Router Service (VRS), a network designed to pass drug package verification requests between trading partners. As the recognized digital method for secure electronic message interoperability, OCI-compliant credentials also integrate with other channels, such as email and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for&nbsp;tracing.</p><p>Both LedgerDomain and Spherity continue to work closely with VRS partners to further enhance performance times to ensure real-time security and reliability. This broader effort in collaboration with VRS providers encompasses end-to-end performance.</p><p>“During the course of the current FDA Stabilization Period, solution providers are tuning up their systems to deliver the speed and reliability that the supply chain demands. We’re collaborating closely with our partners to resolve variations in end-to-end verification performance metrics as the VRS scales up through the spring.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexcolgan?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAYPCFwBxAVNlVQWIPRuC5SrU4qYiYIRJEQ&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BWkzq0kbvQEeBllraqJpiyA%3D%3D">Alex Colgan</a>, head of marketing and partnerships, LedgerDomain</p><p>“Interoperable networks like the VRS are only possible when all stakeholders pull together. We’re working hard to further scale our infrastructure with minimal latency and maximum throughput.” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswirrig/">Chris Wirrig</a>, customer success manager,&nbsp;Spherity</p><p>“Bringing enhanced drug distribution security under the DSCSA to life has been a decade-long effort, and the VRS is a cornerstone of this interoperable ‘system of systems.’ OCI-compliant credentialing adds a digital layer of secure authentication to the VRS, so that trading partners can exchange data with confidence.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethwaldorf?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAACVUfMBzqFzp5bfWQydohbDTd2khyK2kLs&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BhLO9w2ecSbCTnQPjw44S6w%3D%3D">Elizabeth Waldorf</a>, Director, Global Traceability and Standards, TraceLink</p><p>This progress comes ahead of the upcoming Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA) Distribution Management Conference (DMC) in March, where both LedgerDomain and Spherity will be present. For more information on the OCI DSCSA Interoperability Specification and its role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, visit <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">oc-i.org</a>.</p><p>About LedgerDomain</p><p>LedgerDomain is a decentralized solutions provider focused on healthcare supply chain assurance and visibility. Their XATP solution enables trading partners including global enterprises, health centers, and independent pharmacists to comply with DSCSA requirements for authentication, enhanced verification, tracing, and saleable returns documentation — helping prescription drugs remain safe and effective for patients.</p><p>About Spherity</p><p>Spherity is a pioneer in decentralized identity and data sovereignty solutions. Their innovative technology focuses on solutions for industry use cases, that automate processes by digitizing company or product certificates and the exchange of sensitive industry data. Spherity is offering solutions for the US Pharma Industry, the global automotive industry, and has a special focus on Digital Product Passport Solutions for all ESPR-regulated product categories.</p><p>About OCI</p><p>The Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI) is a collaborative non-profit industry collaboration formed in April 2021 by a group of trading partners, solution providers, and standards organizations to support the pharmaceutical industry in adopting credentialing and digital wallet technologies to enhance supply chain security, and thus the protection of consumers.</p><p>Building on the DSCSA statute and FDA guidances, the Partnership for DSCSA Governance (PDG), GS1 US, Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA), and OCI are the organizations that have developed and published the business requirements, standards, and specifications that collectively define the DSCSA Enhanced Drug Distribution Security (EDDS) system. OCI provides open-source specifications built on interoperable standards defined by GS1, W3C, and NIST in close collaboration with industry stakeholders.</p><p>The OCI ecosystem is open to trading partners, solution providers, associations, standards bodies and others interested in contributing to future enhancements of the architecture and use&nbsp;cases.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/spherity/ledgerdomain-and-spherity-surpass-oci-performance-standards-in-latest-api-tests-4cf6fcd9ac23">Spherity and LedgerDomain Surpass OCI Performance Standards in Latest API Tests</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">Spherity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF78 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  We’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Your data, such as your posts, likes, and follows, needs to be stored somewhere. With traditional social media, your data is stored by the social media company whose services you've signed up for. If you ever want to stop using that company's services, you can do that—but you would have to leave that social network and lose your existing connections.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way! An alternative model is how the internet itself works. Anyone can put up a website on the internet. You can choose from one of many companies to host your site (or even host it yourself), and you can always change your mind about this later. If you move to another hosting provider, your visitors won't even notice. No matter where your site's data is managed and stored, your visitors can find your site simply by typing the name of the website or by clicking a link.</p>
<p>We think social media should work the same way. When you register on Bluesky, by default we'll suggest that Bluesky will store your data. But if you'd like to let another company store it, or even store it yourself, you can do that. You'll also be able to change your mind at any point, moving your data to another provider without losing any of your existing posts, likes, or follows. From your followers' perspective, your profile is always available at your handle—no matter where your information is actually stored, or how many times it has been moved.</p>
<p>Federation lets services be interconnected, so there are a variety of apps and experiences that users can move between as fluidly as they do on the open web. The version of federation that we’re releasing today is intended for self-hosters. There are some guardrails in place to ensure we can keep the network running smoothly for everyone in the ecosystem. After this initial phase, we’ll open up federation to people looking to run larger servers with many users. For a more technical overview of what we’re releasing today and how to participate, check out the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>.</p>
<p>Some of our existing features already follow the federated philosophy, including <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">usernames</a> and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds">feeds</a>. Today, we’re opening up federation for data hosting. Below, we wanted to answer some common questions about what federated hosting is, what it means for your experience using Bluesky, and why we’re so excited about it.</p>
 How does this affect my experience on Bluesky? 
<p>The short answer is: it doesn’t! If you don’t run your own server, Bluesky will stay the same. Even if you do run your own server, you may be surprised by how little things change. In fact, it should feel so similar that you might have to double check that you’ve logged into the right server.</p>
<p>This is all intentional: we've made self-hosting your own data both easy and affordable, so when you do so, you should be able to get just as good (or better) of an experience than letting Bluesky host your data.</p>
 If my experience doesn’t change, why federate? 
<p>We set out to build a protocol for the future of social media that returns control to users. From the apps you use, the feeds you browse, or the moderation preferences you prefer, your experience on Bluesky is yours to customize. But the abundance of choice and innovation here will be short-lived if it’s dependent on one company. We think that the future of social media needs to be a public good, mutually owned by the people and companies that participate in it. Social media should be as open and reliable as the internet itself.</p>
<p>The ability to host your own data, just as you might run your own website, provides the fundamental guarantee that social media will never again be controlled by only one company. Even if Bluesky were to disappear, if the data is hosted across different sites, the network can be rebuilt. The fact that it requires no permission to set up a new website is what has made the open web such a dynamic and creative force. Larger services, like search engines, have come and gone (anyone remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.com">Ask Jeeves</a>?). But the underlying foundation of independently hosted sites continues to let the web evolve. Making social open in the same way will create a foundation for better public conversations.</p>
<p>Today, we’re taking another step towards the vision of a self-sustaining social web — social media that isn’t controlled by any single company and is free to evolve on its own terms.</p>
 Does this mean Bluesky is going to be like Mastodon? 
<p>Mastodon is another federated social network built on a protocol called ActivityPub. While Bluesky — built on a protocol called the AT Protocol (atproto) — shares the term “federation” with other networks, the way it works is very different.</p>
<p>On Bluesky, server choice doesn’t affect what content you see. Servers are only one piece of the protocol — when you browse Bluesky, you see posts that are pulled together from many different servers. This is why you can change your server after signing up without losing your username, friends, or posts.</p>
<p>A summary of some ways Bluesky differs from Mastodon:</p>
 
 A focus on the global conversation: On Mastodon, your “instance”, or server, determines your community, so your experience depends on which server you join. An instance can send and receive posts from other instances, but it doesn’t try to offer a global view of the network. Your Mastodon server is part of your username, and becomes part of your identity. On Bluesky, your experience is based on what feeds and accounts you follow, and you can always participate in the global conversation (e.g. breaking news, viral posts, and algorithmic feeds). You can use your own domain name as your username, and continue participating from anywhere your account is hosted. 
 Composable moderation: Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. We’ve already integrated block and mute lists, and the tooling for independent moderation services is coming soon. 
 Composable feeds: We designed your timeline on Bluesky so that it’s not tied to your server. Anyone can build a feed, and there are currently over 40,000 algorithmic feeds to choose from. Your Mastodon timeline is only made up of posts from accounts you follow, and does not pull together posts from the whole network like Bluesky’s custom feeds. 
 Account portability: We designed federated hosting on Bluesky so that you can move servers easily. Moving hosting services should be like changing your cell phone provider —&nbsp;you should be able to keep your identity and data. Changing servers on Bluesky doesn’t disrupt your username, friends, or posts. 
 
 So how can I self-host and join the network? 
<p>It will become easier to host your own server over time, but at the moment you’ll need a bit of technical know-how to get up and running. If you’re excited to jump in, checkout the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds">PDS repo</a> on our Github, and the <a href="https://discord.gg/UWS6FFdhMe">PDS Administrators Discord</a>.</p>

<p>January was a whirlwind month for SpruceID, as we dove headfirst into a series of impactful events, each shedding light on the evolving landscape of digital identity and its implications for society.<br><br>Let's take a moment to recap the highlights from our events throughout January.</p> January 17th: Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day <p>The start of our year kicked off with Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day in DC, an event organized by Okta Ventures that explored the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and government service delivery.<br><br>Our CEO, Wayne Chang, was at the forefront, participating in a CEO panel discussion about restoring citizen trust in government institutions. Alongside Karine Mellata of Intrinsic AI and Matt Chiodi of Cerby, Wayne articulated SpruceID's commitment to empowering users to control their data on the web, a mission deeply intertwined with rebuilding faith in governmental processes. <br><br>SpruceID also had a booth at the conference where we had the opportunity to engage one-on-one with staffers interested in learning more about verifiable digital credentials.<br><br>We were honored to have kicked off our year with this exciting event, where we were able to help educate congressional staffers on digital identity, the risks of AI related to identity, and network with others in the space.</p> January 19th: New York State Digital Identity Roundtable <p>Next on our agenda was the New York State Digital Identity Roundtable, a thought-provoking forum delving into the landscape of digital identity in New York. The event was organized by Assemblywoman Solages, who sponsored Bill A01018 which paves the way for mobile driver's licenses in New York.<br><br>SpruceID CEO Wayne Chang opened the event with an overview of digital credentials, the risks and privacy concerns that should be considered, and the importance of verifiable digital identity with the increased sophistication of AI impersonations.<br><br>Round table participants, including members of the New York government, leading tech companies, and multiple privacy-oriented and civil liberties organizations, posed crucial questions surrounding privacy, security, and inclusivity in the digital identity landscape.<br><br>From concerns about bias and exclusion to discussions about democratic oversight, the conversations during this roundtable underscored the need for robust, transparent frameworks to guide the deployment of digital identity solutions. We were honored to participate in this roundtable and look forward to continuing the conversation on many of these important issues.</p> January 25th: Milan Digital Identity Observatory Workshop <p>Rounding out our month was the Digital Identity Observatory Workshop, a collaborative event to help chart the course for the future of digital identity. CIOs and digital transformation executives from leading European multinational corporations converged in Milan to explore emerging trends, opportunities, and challenges with verifiable digital identity. Through discussions and interactive sessions, participants charted a path forward grounded in privacy, security, and user empowerment principles.<br><br>SpruceID joined virtually with a brief presentation from Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO, recapping our digital identity tech, national and global trends, and emerging best practices and use cases for verifying digital credentials in business workflows.<br><br>As we look ahead, SpruceID remains committed to driving the conversation around digital identity, advocating for solutions that prioritize the rights and well-being of individuals in an increasingly digital world.</p> Stay Tuned for What’s Next! <p>January was a busy month of community engagement and thought leadership for SpruceID. As we reflect on the insights gained and connections made during last month’s events, we remain eager in our mission to build a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions. Stay tuned for more updates as we join in on more exciting events in the coming months.<br></p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p></p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce this partnership between Holochain and <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>. While we have been interwoven efforts for some time, making it official before heading to <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a> feels like an important step forwards in our collaboration.</p><p>What is Rainlang? Rainlang is a framework that aims to simplify smart contracts and make them more accessible to a wider audience. The aim of making smart contracts accessible to everyone comes from the belief that accessibility is the difference between theoretical and practical decentralization.</p><p>By combining Holochain’s framework for building peer-to-peer apps with Rainlang’s easy to use smart contracts, new groundbreaking solutions in the Web3 space are possible, unleashing opportunities and possibilities for developers, enterprises, and users alike.</p> Fullstack DeFi <p>DeFi has exploded in recent years, but it is still a challenging space, accessible to the few, not the many. Rainlang’s work to make smart contracts more legible is an important step to democratizing this space. But there are still hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p>When we interact with smart contracts, we usually do so through a website. This is a point of centralization that introduces several risks, from phishing to DNS hacks. Plus, nothing stops a website from being taken down, either by the company running it or by a government, DDOS attack, or otherwise. The solution? Truly distributed applications, running on your device, interacting as a network of peers. This is what Holochain provides to DeFi, the opportunity for the infrastructure supporting the EVM to also be decentralized, secure, and verifiable.&nbsp;</p> Orderbook <p><a href="https://docs.rainlang.xyz/orderbook/introduction/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Rain Orderbook</a> is an on-chain orderbook contract that enables users to deploy complex strategies for managing token trades. Using Holochain, the Rainlang team is building a decentralized platform where Orderbook users can share draft trading strategies, simulations, tests of strategies, and even raw financial data. This will make the trading tools of Orderbook more accessible as a community grows around them.&nbsp;</p><p>Building this platform on Holochain enables a collaborative platform that runs directly on user’s devices without data sitting on a third party server. This is a truly decentralized stack that maintains options for privacy where trading groups can make private spaces to share their trading strategies etc. With this user centric design that provides security from many common hacks in the crypto space, we can start to see new potential for Web3.</p> Holochain Apps Using Rainlang <p>For the last several months we have been experimenting with integrating Rainlang contracts into the stack of Holochain applications. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a> demonstrated a Rainlang contract on the Polygon EVM, connected to a Holochain application where users played a collaborative art game. Holo was used to provide read-only access to the game, both for <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fractal-tribute-nov-2?ref=blog.holochain.org">OpenSea</a> to access the art and for a website that allowed for public viewership of the game. </p><p>This is just one demonstration of how Rainlang can be used to connect Holochain apps to the blockchain. We are excited to see what others develop — pairing the financial markets and global consensus of EVMs with the agent-centric networks of Holochain. </p><p>We have more in the works. In the meantime, <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">read about more of the solutions we envision</a>, and maybe we’ll see you at <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a>?</p>

  <p>Over 800,000 organizations rely on Microsoft Entra to navigate the ever-changing threat landscape, ensuring their security while enhancing the productivity of their end users. Customers have frequently expressed their desire for greater transparency into their Entra usage, with licensing being a particularly popular request. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of Microsoft Entra license utilization portal, a new feature that enables customers to optimize their Entra ID Premium licenses by providing insights into the current usage of premium features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll provide an overview of Entra ID license utilization, including what it is, how it works, and how you can optimize your license to get the most out of your Entra ID Premium Licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Entra ID License utilization portal allows you to see how many Entra ID P1 and P2 licenses you have and the usage of the key features corresponding to the license type. We're thrilled that Conditional Access and risk-based Conditional Access usage are available as part of the public preview, but this would be expanded to include usage of other SKUs and corresponding features at general availability. This perspective is an initial stride towards empowering you to comprehend your license count and the value you extract from your Entra license. It also aids in addressing any over-usage issues that might emerge in your tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Try the public preview 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The license utilization &amp; insights portal is available under the “Usage &amp; Insights” blade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1. License utilization insights portal under Usage &amp; Insights blade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This portal would provide you with insights into the top features you’re using that correspond with your Entra ID Premium P1 and P2 licenses (as applicable). You can leverage these insights to secure and govern your users along with ensuring you comply with the licensing terms and conditions. Here is a screenshot of feature usage view you can see in the Entra portal:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3. Entra ID Premium P2 feature usage on License utilization portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to extend this transparency into Entra usage and would love to hear your feedback on this new capability, as well as what would be most useful to you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In this episode we talk with Phil Windley, Sr. Software Development Manager at AWS, Cofounder of IIW, former Chair of Sovrin Foundation. We talked about his experience building and leading the Sovrin Foundation, which at one point was almost synonymous with the term self-sovereign identity. It was set up to be an identity metasystem that would reinvent how identity was done online… and we talk about why it didn’t end up becoming that.</p><p>Phil shares lessons from identity systems that got adopted, like the social login metasystem, as well as from things that didn’t get a lot of adoption, like certain identity blockchains and information cards a decade prior. We hope this an interesting episode. We’re glad we got to tell a small part of the Sovrin story as we think a lot of today’s reusable ID projects have their roots in the movement Sovrin started—including Trinsic.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about Phil you can visit his personal website <a href="https://windley.com/">https://windley.com/</a> where you'll find ways to contact him, and buy his new book.</p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p>Remember the wise words of Charles Darwin? "It's not the strongest of the species that survives," he declared, "nor the most intelligent [...] – it is the one that is most adaptable to change." This rings especially true in today's financial services landscape, where digital disruption is no longer a whisper on the wind, but a full-blown hurricane tearing through legacy systems and traditional business models. Digital-first providers, including challenger banks, neobanks, fintechs, insurtechs and most recently, techfins, have morphed into formidable competitors, delivering seamless, personalized experiences that leave many incumbents gasping for air. And it comes as no surprise that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/ebooks/3952-unlock-power-digital-identity-financial-services.html">digital identity in financial services</a> underpins this very paradigm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as the rapid evolution of the financial services industry has shown throughout history, the most adaptable inherit the future. While the rise of digital-first providers across the industry presents undeniable challenges, so too it creates extensive opportunities for incumbent providers to raise their game, gain access to cutting-edge fintech/techfin innovation, and most importantly of all: deliver new streamlined, secure, and scalable experiences to their customers, while having them coming back for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This explains why the most progressive (and successful) financial institutions continue to increase their investments in converged identity and access management (IAM) to drive hyper-personalization, adaptive security, and business model expansion at scale.</p>

 From romance fraud to investment scams, there are a multitude of ways that fraudsters use social media to target victims. Here, we explore some of the most common and speak to one man who almost lost it all. 



 



<p>In 2024, it’s safe to say that if you use the internet, you’re more than likely to also use social media. In fact, of the 5.35 billion active global internet users, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">5 billion are regular social media users.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you want to look at photos of somebody you haven’t spoken to in 15 years, swipe on photos of somebody you’d like to speak to for the next 15 years, read about the latest conspiracy theory, or apply for a job, there’s a specific social media platform to connect with old and new friends alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beauty of social media is how easily you can connect with people. Unfortunately, the danger of social media is also how easily you can, without any substantial identity verification check, create an account and claim to be whoever you want to be. Simply choose a name, select a photo and hey presto – you have an account. With just a few clicks, you’re free to contact with anyone on the internet. Free to share cat photos, argue why the moon is made of cheese, send your CV, or steal money from a complete stranger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 It starts with a click. 



<p>In the first six months of 2023, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers#1">$2.7 billion was lost through social media fraud</a>. Massive numbers compared to the next most common fraud channel: website and apps, which claimed $2 billion, or emails, which were responsible for the comparatively low figure of just $900 million. Little wonder, then, that for one in four people who’ve been defrauded since 2021, the initial communication began on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, it’s likely that you have already been contacted via a scammer, and you may not even know it. Here are the top three types of social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 Romance scam. 



<p>Romance fraud is a type of scam initiated through social engineering, where emotional relationships are created to obtain financial gain or services. Romance scammers often use dating apps, but reports show that social media platforms are becoming even more common. While some dating apps, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/20/tinder-is-expanding-id-verification-to-the-us-uk-brazil-and-mexico/">Tinder are beginning to introduce identity verification</a> steps into onboarding, many do not.&nbsp;</p>

 Social media account takeover fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>37% of UK adults worry about social media fraud, according to our recently released <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024</a>. This fear is well founded, as someone who has access to your social media account can gather valuable information and photos about you and your family and friends for future fraud attacks. They can also post phishing attacks and links to investment scams from your account, lending the scam a convincing air of credibility and authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



 Investment scam / pig butchering scam.&nbsp; 



<p>One of the most common forms of social media fraud. Investment scams are typically ‘long con’ techniques that take place over a series of weeks or months, with the fraudster slowly establishing trust before presenting the victim with an investment opportunity. Although the website and payment portals shared may look genuine, any money that the victim sends is being transferred directly to the scammer. A variation of the investment scam is the pig butchering scam, which combines elements from romance scams, investment schemes, and crypto fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 “We just clicked.”&nbsp; 



<p>Anyone can be targeted by social media fraud. Young or old. Blue or white collar. After reading our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">‘Welcome to the fraud factory: Home of the pig butchering scam.’</a> IDnow was contacted by a German entrepreneur who realized that he had been defrauded. Below, we share his story:&nbsp;</p>



 Background. 



<p>I am an executive of a tech startup based in Europe, and 2023 marked a significant turning point for our company as it transitioned into a stock corporation. As the CEO, my primary responsibilities included securing financing, managing investor relationships, and selling shares to fuel the growth of the company. The second quarter of 2023 was particularly challenging, filled with numerous investor meetings and a determined push to promote our investment opportunities through Google Ads. It was during this period that I was contacted by a seemingly enthusiastic investor over LinkedIn, setting off a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the company and my personal life.&nbsp;</p>



 The encounter.&nbsp; 



<p>In early May 2023, I received a message on LinkedIn from a young lady expressing her interest in investing in our stock corporation. Intrigued by her enthusiasm and apparent financial success, I engaged in a conversation with her. We quickly transitioned from LinkedIn to Telegram, and eventually she asked to switch to WhatsApp, and we exchanged phone numbers. She presented herself as a 37-year-old, successful investor in the art industry, with numerous investments in art galleries, including one in Hamburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As our conversations continued, she began sharing details about her immense wealth and philanthropic endeavors, especially her interest in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nft-non-fungible-tokens-new-art-money-laundering/">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs</a>). She frequently flaunted her account balance, boasting of having millions of USDT (cryptocurrency with a value that mirrors the US dollar) at her disposal. She assured me that investing in digital artwork would be a profitable venture for our struggling company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under her influence, I started investing in digital artwork on a platform called [removed], which frequently changed its domain. As she gained my trust, she probed for information about my net worth and assets, believing she was dealing with a financially stable partner. In reality, though, our company was facing dire financial straits, and I was desperate to secure the necessary financing to prevent bankruptcy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The ‘golden opportunity.’ 



<p>Then came the golden opportunity. She suggested purchasing a highly valuable piece of digital artwork, similar to the popular ‘bored ape’ NFTs, with the intention of putting it up for auction. I agreed to the purchase, spending $850,000, with the expectation that it would be sold for a substantial profit. A week later, it was indeed sold for $8,129,000, bringing immense relief as it seemed like a way to recover our company’s financial troubles and my personal investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the moment I attempted to withdraw the funds, my joy turned to despair. I was asked to transfer 20% of the auction price, amounting to over $1.6 million, to a different wallet. Subsequently, they demanded an “advanced certification audit,” requiring me to provide extensive personal information, including bank statements, the source of my funds (my house and other assets), and a copy of my passport. A few days later, I received the shocking news that my account had been frozen due to suspicion of money laundering. To regain access, I was told to pay an additional $547,000 fee with a promise of a refund upon a positive outcome of the audit. Late September marked the realization that I had fallen victim to a complex and devastating scam known as pig butchering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The aftermath. 



<p>Despair took hold, and I sought help from white hat hackers in a desperate attempt to uncover the truth and recover my investments. Unfortunately, I encountered fraudulent individuals who claimed to be white hat hackers and extorted thousands of dollars from me under the pretence of uncovering the fraud. Today, the company faces imminent administrative shutdown, forcing the dismissal of all employees, and I am left with no choice but to file for insolvency.&nbsp;</p>



 What happened next? 



<p>The anonymous reader lost €900,000 in total. In the months since discovering the deception, he has contacted lawyers, forensic hackers and the police, all to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The lawyer offered to trace and try to find the responsible company, but as you know, they are typically not registered and change their domains every three months.”</p>



<p>Although the forensic hackers did manage to locate the Wallet that contained the funds, they were unable to crack it, due to its Advanced Information Management Security Computer System (AIM), which was installed by a cyber security group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is therefore looking unlikely that he will ever be able to recover the funds, so for the time being, he is focusing on recovering and staying positive.</p>

 What’s so social about social media fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>With <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWiv_-gKiEAxUDUUEAHatSAXcQFnoECCUQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F04%2F12%2Flinkedin-rolls-out-ways-to-verify-your-identity-and-employment-without-a-price-tag%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OOaCHGFxTZi5nUbm6kAb_&amp;opi=89978449">recent steps by LinkedIn</a> to introduce an identity verification step, could the era of social media anonymity, which inarguably leads to the proliferation of social media fraud, be coming to an end? Considering LinkedIn’s step is only encouraged and not mandatory, the answer is probably “no, not yet…”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flaws and loopholes also exist in X (formally Twitter) and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj2osmUgaiEAxUgV0EAHR9SAcUQFnoECCcQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hootsuite.com%2Fmeta-verified%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Vp0omcgNlBwL9v3MzxTnu&amp;opi=89978449">Meta’s verification strategies</a>, with only paid subscribers able to become verified. Identity verification only works if everybody participates; if it is not mandatory then it’s largely pointless. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">Becky Holmes, the ‘romance fraud vigilante-turned-author’</a>, the decision to offer verification for a fee is a fraudster’s dream. “Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, what’s stopping a fraudster just paying for the premium service and benefiting from the associated prestige?&nbsp;</p>



 How to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of this year. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are staggering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most industries, including financial services, gambling, mobility, travel, and telecommunications have all embraced the potential of digital identity verification. Some industries, like financial services remain at the forefront of digital identity verification adoption, as they are required by regulations to have certain <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> and identity checks in place. While identity verification can help businesses meet compliance challenges and protect their business and customers from fraud, other industries are motivated more by its ability to optimize processes and scale their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, until social media platforms adopt meaningful and comprehensive identity verification, users should connect with caution. Here are three top tips to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



  Stay aware.  



<p>From the latest terms, like social engineering or deepfakes, it’s important to have a rudimentary understanding of what they include, so that you can remain vigilant, and know what steps to take if you are suspicious of a new contact.</p>



  Don’t just click.  



<p>Never click on links from your social media contacts, especially if they are new ‘friends.’ Only move to encrypted channels when you are totally sure that they are who they say there are, and of their intentions. If you suspect that your friend’s account has been hacked, contact them via a secure platform to make sure it’s them.&nbsp;</p>



  Don’t send.  



<p>Never send money to a social media contact. Regardless of how many times you’ve messaged, how well they know you, or how good the opportunity is. Beware of investment platforms, and crypto payment portals, as criminals are incredibly skilled in creating fake websites.</p>

 IDnow fraud survey reveals: 33% of Brits share sensitive ID documents unprotected online, with youth most at risk. 



 



  33% of Brits have shared scans or photos of an ID card, driving licence or passport via digital channels, such as social media or email, despite knowing that these ID documents could land in the wrong hands  The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about banking fraud  Over half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is, or the role it plays in fraud, with almost half not knowing what deepfakes are  



 



<p>London, February 20, 2024 – A major survey into attitudes and knowledge around fraud in the UK has been unveiled, with findings indicating a lack of knowledge around key tactics used by fraudsters, leaving Brits vulnerable to this crime, which is seeing exponential growth.</p>



<p>Commissioned by IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider, the YouGov survey of 2,264 people has uncovered that almost half (45%) of UK adults were aware that scans or photos of their ID documents could be obtained by criminals to be used to commit fraud – yet sent the documents via digital channels, such as email, social media and messenger apps anyway.</p>



<p>Such activity could lead to identity theft, which IDnow believes should be a concern to the UK public, especially given the rise in deepfake technology. Developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) mean deepfake technology can now be used to create hyper-realistic fake documents, as well as videos. However, the survey found that less than a third (31%) of Britons know what deepfake documents are and are aware of the potential risks posed by digitally generated images of physical documents.</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow, commented: “Many of us have seen the uncanny deepfake videos of celebrities that spread like wildfire across the internet, showing how easy it is to emulate the likeness of someone using AI. But worryingly, this research suggests that the UK public is not as concerned, or aware as they should be, of the risks associated with such digitally generated images or videos.</p>



<p>“The extraordinary leaps in AI technology mean it’s now almost too easy for a fraudster to carry out financial crimes. Consumers shouldn’t make it even easier for fraudsters though. Our advice is always to think twice before sending a scan or photo of your driving licence or passport into the digital ether via unencrypted channels, such as social media or email.”</p>



<p>Interestingly, 48% of 18- to 24-year-olds surveyed have shared ID documents via such risky channels, compared with just 21% of over-55s, highlighting the potential need to better educate the younger generation on digital fraud threats.</p>



 Is fraud front of mind? 



<p>The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking fraud</a>, when asked about the different areas of life where fraud could occur. An additional 37% of Brits are most concerned about fraud via social media channels.</p>



<p>With 54% of Brits unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>, encompassing deceptive tactics such as phishing or smishing, the majority of the population remains vulnerable to potential fraud attempts. Social engineering, one of the most prevalent and hard to catch fraud typologies, sees fraudsters manipulating trust or fear, putting consumers at risk of divulging sensitive information or falling prey to malicious links disguised as trustworthy messages.</p>



<p>In terms of the likelihood of being a victim of crime, a fifth (21%) of Brits believe they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile. In fact, social media was the primary security concern for those aged 18- to 24-years-old, with each remaining age group citing their main worry as someone accessing their bank account through identity fraud.</p>



<p>Hence, for accounts connected to larger sums or investments, three quarters of Brits (75%) would be willing to go through a lengthier online onboarding process, if this made it safer. Doug Pollock, Vice President Customer Success at IDnow, explained: “Our findings show that banks in the UK do not always go far enough to make their customers feel safe and secure. They need to go further in terms of fraud prevention technology to meet their customers’ risk appetite, especially when their money is at stake. Because, and our research confirms this, if banks get it wrong, the majority of people (54%) would consider moving banks were they to become a victim of fraud. </p>



<p>“We hope these findings highlight the massive impact online fraud continues to have on British people. Because fraudsters work across industries, regions and use cases, it’s vital we all work together – financial services, technology providers, government, law enforcement and the public – to identify and stop fraudsters before it’s too late.”</p>



 



<p>About this study</p>



<p>This release is based on data from an online survey conducted by YouGov Germany, in which 2,264 people in the UK took part between 6 and 7 December 2023. The results were weighted and are representative of the UK population aged 18 and over.</p>

  In the realm of customer onboarding, the prevailing challenges are manifold. Traditional methods entail redundant data collection and authentication hurdles, contributing to inefficiencies and frustrations for both customers and businesses. Moreover, siloed systems exacerbate the issue, leading to fragmented user experiences that impede smooth onboarding processes and hinder operational agility.

Traditional methods entail redundant data collection and authentication hurdles, contributing to inefficiencies and frustrations for both customers and businesses. Moreover, siloed systems exacerbate the issue, leading to fragmented user experiences that impede smooth onboarding processes and hinder operational agility.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The Era of Generative AI is upon us – there is no doubt about that. After over 50 years of academic research in artificial intelligence culminating in the development of neural networks and machine learning algorithms, and then another decade of building cybersecurity products based on those methods and trying to persuade customers to finally put their trust into them… The seemingly out-of-nowhere emergence of ChatGPT has managed to achieve that overnight.</p>
<p>Instead of a grumpy, suspicious crowd not willing to let AI automate their jobs, we now see a public craze that makes the Tulip Mania of the 17th century pale in comparison. Businesses are rushing to implement GenAI capabilities into all their processes and workflows. Vendors are struggling to come up with even more potential use cases to add generative capabilities to their products. But most importantly, literally everyone is happy to consume those capabilities again and again, disregarding potential risks and challenges (including being automated out of their jobs completely).</p>
<p>Even I couldn't resist asking DALL-E to create an illustration for the previous paragraph, and the result is quite impressive...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discussing those risks for business applications of GenAI is a huge topic on its own. We already hear experts talking about lack of transparency, potential biases in training, compliance issues with leaking sensitive information to third parties, to say nothing about the massive costs of running LLM infrastructures. Still, the attempts of some organizations to outright ban ChatGPT usage on their premises have already been proven futile. Just like BYOD, this usage should be controlled by a combination of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/ai-regulation-challenges-and-opportunities">government-level regulation</a> and organizations’ own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-you-need-ai-acceptable-use-policy-aup-declan-van-esbeck-q9q6e/">acceptable use policies</a>.</p>
 Generative AI for cybersecurity practitioners 
<p>Still, today we want to focus on a more specific question: does the introduction of GenAI capabilities fundamentally change cybersecurity? What practical new functionality do they offer to security experts? And what are the challenges of developing and using security tools that rely on modern GenAI models?</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the most obvious use case doesn’t even require any additional interfaces between you and ChatGPT: it’s continuous education, an absolute must for every cybersecurity practitioner. Having a virtual assistant that can instantly answer any question and free you from doing your own research is a very alluring prospect indeed. You just have to remember that ChatGPT is not smarter than you. In fact, it works much more like a room full of hyperactive monkeys with typewriters, and not everything they produce is necessarily on par with Shakespeare. When an LLM does not know something, it will happily make up a completely wrong but still plausibly-looking answer, and it is entirely your responsibility to check its validity. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Trust but verify</a>!</p>
<p>Another related area is using LLMs for creating various materials for safe simulations of cybersecurity incidents. The idea itself is, of course, not at all new – tabletop exercises, incident response bootcamps and other kinds of training are a big part of every business continuity program, but using Generative AI does not just reduce the cost of such exercises but dramatically increases the degree of their realism – after all, real threat actors are already using very similar tools for their nefarious purposes. Again, just keep in mind that the cost of an error in this business is not at your advantage – a poorly crafted spear phishing mail will only leave a hacker with a bit of lost revenue, yet a poorly designed phishing awareness exercise might leave your entire company unprotected against multiple future attacks.</p>
<p>With the tremendous improvements LLMs are now making in generating not just natural language, but application source code as well, the idea of making new software “secure by design” by replacing human developers (that make so many coding mistakes and are impossible to teach to follow security practices!) with code generated directly by an AI model is getting more and more traction. In a similar way, LLMs can be used to create more sophisticated authorization policies, generate synthetic data for security testing, etc. In a slightly less radical approach, LLMs would not outright replace humans but serve as an additional filter in an existing CI/CD pipeline to improve its coverage and efficiency.</p>
<p>To be honest, looking at the results produced by current-generation tools, I’m somewhat skeptical about AI completely replacing human developers anytime soon, but the situation might change quickly. In any case, however, there is absolutely no reason to treat the code generated by AI as inherently error-free. You’ll still need to keep unit tests, static and dynamic code analysis solutions, and a lot of other security tools included in your development pipeline. Can you delegate all these activities to LLMs? Perhaps, but should you? In the end, it is still someone’s liability, and you cannot put than on AI…</p>
<p>But wait, someone reading this might say, what about arguably the most interesting application of Generative AI – specialized security-trained LLMs built into solutions like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>? Aren’t they the real future of cybersecurity?</p>
<p>Well, I cannot argue with that… to a degree. SIEMs, XDRs, and other security analytics solutions have been relying on various AI technologies for years, and the addition of GenAI does make them better in many ways. Providing better insights by cutting through the noise, helping to make critical incident response decisions faster, improving security analysts’ productivity – all these capabilities are great improvements, but they are not what makes a security tool reliable and scalable. Microsoft’s Copilot would never be so useful without the company’s existing vast telemetry network and threat intelligence database or their own cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Even Charles Babbage, the inventor of the first programmable computer, already understood the principle that later became known as “Garbage in, garbage out” – not even the most sophisticated machine can make right decisions based on incomplete, flawed, or biased input data. For Generative AI, this applies to a much larger extent than anywhere else in IT. Perhaps, when you’re choosing the next best cybersecurity tool for your organization, looking at its GenAI-powered bells and whistles should not be on the top of your list of priorities.</p>
 Tapping into the Wisdom of the Crowd 
<p>In the end, we cannot deny the fact that Generative AI is indeed a game-changer in almost every industry, including cybersecurity. And yet it is critical for everyone to understand that GenAI does not do magic. It is just a tool - an extremely sophisticated, sometimes quite delicate, and very expensive one. A crucial part of integrating these tools into your security strategy is to clearly understand their capabilities and limitations (which tend to change literally on a weekly basis). Even more important is to be aware of how both the trailblazers and ordinary peers within your industry are using them to capitalize on their experience and avoid their mistakes.</p>
<p>And of course, there is no better platform to meet those people than the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">upcoming EIC 2024</a>, Europe’s prime conference on Digital ID, Security, Privacy and Governance in an AI-driven world, which will take place this June in Berlin, Germany. I hope to see you there as well!</p>

<p>Last Friday, we <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-step-by-step-guide-on-verifying-bitcoin-non-custodial-wallet-ownership-through-user-signing">published a blog post</a> that explained the user signing process on the Bitcoin network using Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets. Today, we’re going to delve into the user signing process on the Ethereum network with the Trezor and Ledger hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p> User Signing on the Ethereum Network With&nbsp;Ledger  Step 1: Select the type of address you want to&nbsp;sign <p>First, we have to choose the type of cryptocurrency address to sign with, which is the Ethereum network in our&nbsp;case.</p> Step 2: Connect Your&nbsp;Wallet <p>Next, choose one of the four wallet options: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and&nbsp;Trezor.</p><p>If you don’t have a wallet account, tap on the “I don’t have a wallet” option on the left side of the screen. This will take you to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet#main-content">the Ethereum Foundations’ list of supported wallets</a>.</p><p>For this section, we chose&nbsp;Ledger.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Ledger&nbsp;Live <p>Now, you have to connect with Ledger Live, which you can do either through Ledger Live Mobile or the Ledger Live&nbsp;Desktop.</p><p>For this guide, we will do it through the&nbsp;desktop.</p> Step 4: Connect to User&nbsp;Signing <p>You’ll then be prompted to connect to User Signing (dev.usersigning.shyft.network). Right click on both Ethereum and Polygon “Test on User Signing” options and click on the “Connect” button.</p> Step 5: Sign&nbsp;Address‍ <p>On this page, you will also see your selected Ethereum wallet address. Click on the “Sign Address” button, which will take you to a pop-up screen asking for your public key to continue the User Signing&nbsp;process.</p><p>Next, you have to open the Ethereum app on your Ledger&nbsp;device.</p> Step 6: Open Your Ledger Device and Complete the Sign up&nbsp;Process <p>Now open the Ethereum app on your Ledger&nbsp;device.</p><p>Next, on your Ledger device, you will be asked to confirm that you are the trust anchor of this public key and you own the given&nbsp;address.</p><p>That’s it. You have now finished signing the&nbsp;message.</p> Step 7: The Verification is&nbsp;Complete <p>After you sign the message, you’ll get a signature proof. This confirms that you own your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>We will now see a similar process on&nbsp;Trezor.</p> User Signing on the Ethereum Network With&nbsp;Trezor  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>First, select the Ethereum Network from the two available options — Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet‍ <p>Next, select from the four available wallet options: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and Trezor. For this segment, we will choose&nbsp;Trezor.</p> Step 3: Scan&nbsp;Accounts <p>Now, click on the “Scan Accounts” button to get a list of your Ethereum wallet addresses. Doing so will take you to the next screen, where Trezor will request permission to export your public key to the signing&nbsp;service.</p><p>On this page, you have to click on the “Export” button. This helps you verify the address you own without exposing your private&nbsp;key.</p> Step 4: Choose an Ethereum Wallet&nbsp;Address <p>Now, you will see a list of all your Ethereum addresses. From this list, choose the one address that you want to use for the User Signing process and click on the “Connect” button.</p><p>Once you do that, your Trezor wallet will be connected to Shyft User&nbsp;Signing.</p> Step 5: Signing the&nbsp;Message <p>Here, you have to click on the “Sign Address” button, which will take you to the pop-up screen asking you to allow signing with your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>To sign the Ethereum message, click on the “Allow Once for This Session”&nbsp;button.</p> Step 6: Open Your Trezor Device and Complete the Sign up&nbsp;Process <p>Follow the instructions on your Trezor device and confirm that you are the trust anchor and own the given Ethereum wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>Next, your Trezor device will prompt you to confirm ownership of the address and verify you as the trust anchor for the public&nbsp;key.</p> Step 7: The Verification is&nbsp;Complete <p>The verification is now complete, generating a signature proof. This confirms your Ethereum address ownership.</p><p>📽️ If you want to watch a video of the entire process, you can find it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEXgOWSz0c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEXgOWSz0c</a></p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>For Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), ensuring the legitimacy of transactions to comply with regulatory standards such as the FATF Travel Rule while maintaining user privacy is crucial. However, this was easier said than done until <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/user-signing-now-available-on-shyft-veriscope">Shyft launched User Signing</a> in late December last&nbsp;year.</p><p>With Shyft User Signing, VASPs now have a user-friendly and secure way for users to prove ownership of their non-custodial wallets.</p><p>In this guide, we outline the user signing process on the Bitcoin network with the Trezor and Ledger hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p> User Signing on the Bitcoin Network With&nbsp;Trezor  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>The first step in the user signing process is to select the type of cryptocurrency address you wish to sign. In this case, we are focusing on the Bitcoin&nbsp;network.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet <p>After selecting Bitcoin, the next step is to choose the hardware device that you will use to connect to your Bitcoin wallet. For this section, we will proceed with&nbsp;Trezor.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Trezor&nbsp;Wallet <p>Connecting your Trezor device is straightforward. Once you’ve selected Trezor as your hardware wallet, you’ll be prompted to connect the device to your computer and enter your&nbsp;PIN.</p><p>The service will then communicate with your Trezor to prepare it for&nbsp;signing.</p> Step 4: Export the Public&nbsp;Key <p>Trezor will request permission to export your public key to the signing service. This is a crucial step as it allows the service to identify which address you’re proving ownership of without compromising your private&nbsp;key.</p> Step 5: Signing the&nbsp;Message <p>With your public key exported, the next step is to sign a message. This is done through the Trezor interface, where you will see a prompt to sign a Bitcoin message. Follow the instructions on your Trezor device’s screen to complete this&nbsp;step.</p> Step 6: Verification and&nbsp;Proof <p>Upon successful signing, you will receive a signature proof. This is a cryptographic string that proves you have signed a message with the private key corresponding to your public Bitcoin&nbsp;address.</p><p>Now, we will see a similar process with Ledger, another popular hardware crypto&nbsp;wallet.</p> User Signing on the Bitcoin Network With&nbsp;Ledger  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>First, select the type of cryptocurrency address you wish to sign. We selected the Bitcoin&nbsp;network.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet <p>After selecting Bitcoin, the next step involves selecting your hardware device, which was Ledger in our&nbsp;case.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Ledger&nbsp;Wallet <p>Connect your Ledger device to your computer, enter your PIN, and open the Bitcoin application on the device. The interface will then establish a connection with your Ledger and prepare it for the user signing&nbsp;process.</p> Step 4: Export the Public&nbsp;Key <p>Your Ledger will now ask permission to export your public key to the user signing service. This step is essential for the service to verify your address ownership securely.</p> Step 5: Sign the&nbsp;Message <p>Once your public key is exported, sign the message using your Ledger. Here, you will see the details of the message to sign. Now, confirm the message on your Ledger device to complete the signing&nbsp;process.</p> Step 6: Verification and&nbsp;Proof <p>After signing the message, you’ll receive a signature proof — a cryptographic verification that you have used your private key to sign the message without exposing it. This proof is used to confirm ownership of your Bitcoin address securely.</p> Conclusion <p>User signing is a must-have for VASPs to keep transactions secure and compliant. With this guide, VASPs can help their users confidently verify their non-custodial Bitcoin wallets, making sure everyone’s on the same page with clear and secure processes.</p><p>If you wish to check the video of this entire process, you can head over here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE6_IafxOs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE6_IafxOs</a></p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 As mobile transaction volumes rise, location intelligence is increasingly becoming a critical tool that enables companies to better authenticate customers and detect fraud. The increase in location-sensitive transactions, such as payments, content streaming, and online sports betting, necessitates verifying users’ physical locations at the point of transaction. Location intelligence vendors respond by offering solutions that authenticate legitimate users and escalate high-risk ones to traditional authentication methods. According to Meticulous Research, the Location Intelligence market is projected to reach $67.5 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2023 to 2030. 



<p>Location intelligence, or geolocation, involves collecting, analyzing, and applying spatial data to derive insights and make strategic decisions. This enables businesses to understand patterns and trends, improve operations, target audiences effectively, and enhance security. As the need for secure, seamless user experiences increases, geolocation is essential for various applications, including account security, customer authentication, and identity verification. To stay competitive, some vendors in this market seek to integrate with larger platforms or broaden their product offerings in response to the trend toward Integrated Identity Platforms (IIPs).</p>

Here are some key takeaways from a recent Outside-in Report: Location Intelligence: Applications and Insights in an Evolving Market.</p>



 6 Key takeaways: 



 
 The growing sophistication of fraud threats and rising consumer expectations for low-friction user experience will drive future demand for location intelligence, with limited threats posed by consumer privacy and regulatory concerns. 
 



 
 Customer experience is crucial in authentication, with over 60% of consumers abandoning purchases due to forgotten passwords in the last six months. Frictionless, location-based authentication enables platforms to let low-risk users skip password steps entirely. 
 



 
 Businesses seek solutions with low-friction and cross-lifecycle capabilities, growing geofencing mandates for regulated industries, and continuing mobile transaction growth. 
 



 
 Nearly 75% of consumers are willing to share location data to enhance mobile app functionality. While hesitancy to share data may affect the use of location intelligence for authentication, it doesn’t significantly hinder the market’s growth. 
 



 
 Regulatory constraints are consent-based, with stricter privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA posing limited threats to location intelligence platforms since regulations emphasize consumer consent and don’t prohibit geolocation data collection. 
 



 
 The global legalization of regulated online gaming is expanding, with over 32 countries and 34 US states plus the District of Columbia now allowing online betting. Geofencing is crucial in adhering to local regulations, fueling the worldwide demand for location intelligence. 
 



 How It Works: Location Intelligence for User Authentication 



<p>For authentication use cases, geolocation providers combine multiple location intelligence signals with device-level data to risk score a login attempt and allow friction-free access or escalate to challenging a user with alternate authentication methods. For a detailed workflow, <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6550f2ec5f47e70a690acdf3?utm_campaign=Liminal%20Articles&amp;utm_source=location-intelligence-blog&amp;utm_medium=article-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=hyperlink-link-sign-in">log into Link and download</a> the full Outside-In Report, Location Intelligence: Applications and Insights in an Evolving Market.</p>



 







 



 Use Cases 



<p>Geolocation has many use cases, including account opening and fraud prevention, account takeover protection, passwordless authentication, and geofencing.</p>



<p>Account Opening and Fraud Prevention: A common use case aims to prevent account creation by fraudsters using false identities, driven by the post-COVID-19 increase in online account creation across various sectors.</p>



<p>Account Takeover Protection: This targets the need for protection against cybercrimes and expressly unauthorized access to online accounts or systems, driven by the rise in sophisticated fraud techniques and the demand for advanced security technologies.</p>



<p>Passwordless Authentication: This method enables password-free account or system access, reducing user friction. Location intelligence facilitates user authentication with minimal added friction, acting as a primary or secondary authentication factor.</p>



<p>Geofencing: This method uses geolocation data to control access to online platforms based on geographic constraints. It is crucial for regulated online gambling to meet regulatory location verification requirements in the growing number of countries and US states legalizing it.</p>



 



 Why Now?&nbsp; 



<p>Demand for location intelligence data and analytics is rising due to enterprises seeking low-friction, cross-lifecycle solutions, increasing geofencing regulations in regulated industries, and the growth of mobile transactions. Enterprises aim for high user experience across the identity lifecycle, noting that location intelligence can reduce transaction abandonment in 42% of consumers facing high friction. These solutions, especially with other authentication methods, position location intelligence vendors as crucial players in Integrated Identity Platforms (IIPs).</p>



<p>Regulatory concerns are minimal, with privacy regulations like GDPR focusing on consent-based data collection and specific laws like the Massachusetts Location Shield Act allowing for authentication and fraud detection uses. Geofencing requirements in states with legal online sports betting create additional opportunities for these vendors.</p>



<p>Additionally, the rise in smartphone transactions, now expected to constitute over 40% of online transactions, and the increasing use of online-to-offline platforms like Uber, DoorDash, and Instacart highlight new use cases for location intelligence. This trend expands the technology’s application and supports the market’s growth, providing a positive outlook for location intelligence solutions in enhancing authentication strategies and meeting regulatory compliance while opening new market opportunities.</p>

			  Fabio Espinosa is Back-End Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>Hello! I’m Fabio, originally from Colombia and currently living in Madrid. I work as a back-end software engineer at Tokeny. I’ve had a lifelong fascination with technology and how it has the potential to change people’s lives. Now, I think it is really cool to be able to work on technology myself.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked as a tech lead at another startup and occasionally freelanced through Toptal.</p>
<p>I recognized a point in my career where my knowledge growth in programming had stagnated. Despite my experience in back-end, front-end, and dev ops, the work became repetitive, offering limited space for new things, and consequently, it was not so interesting anymore. Moreover, I was managing people, which was not giving me much joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was this realization that made me curious to explore something new, particularly related to blockchain. Tokeny presented itself as an exciting opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Also, it’s widely recognized that tokenization is positioned for substantial growth—something that will take off. Such advancements hold significant potential, particularly for early entrants who typically experience disproportionate gains. This trend appears to be unfolding, as we are beginning to see growing interest from new investors wanting to join the market.</p>
<p>As Elon Musk says, “I could either watch it happen, or be part of it”. I chose the latter. </p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>I’d describe it as responsible freedom. The flexible work-from-home policy allows me to work from many locations, provided that expectations are met. This flexibility offers a great work-life balance.</p>
<p>Also, there’s a shared sense among the team that the industry is on the verge of taking off. While the exact timing remains uncertain, we are confident that it will inevitably happen.</p>
<p>Regarding Tokeny, a company is always about its people. In that regard, everyone at Tokeny is super awesome. We know how to have fun, connect, enjoy, share, learn, be there for one another, and share a good meme on the #random channel.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>It’s hard to find the thing I’m most passionate about. I can think of traveling, exploring cultures, writing, skiing, hiking, horse riding, creating things through code, enjoying food, music, spending time with family, and being there for my sisters, trips with friends.</p>
<p>But if I were to choose one, I’d say I’m most passionate about connecting with people. I live for interesting, deep conversations. When someone shares with me a bit of themselves they’d usually keep hidden or a strange, unique way to think about something, I honor it and feel connected.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream has always fluctuated over time. At some point, it used to be about money. I wanted to be as rich as not to have to work anymore and do whatever I want.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I see it differently. I mean, money will always be important, but my ultimate dream is to be constantly at peace with myself and aware enough to be in alignment with what is true to me the most I can.</p>
<p>On my deathbed, I want to look back and know that it wasn’t the external things that moved me, but the internal things, the really important ones.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>I’d say working from home is always a challenge. I’d advise creating an environment where you can both focus, and disconnect to take breaks. It’s funny how sometimes the most productive moments come after a long, nice break when you can look at the code with different eyes.</p>
<p>Let yourself be taken through the ride and try to develop consistency in your pace of work. Everyone is there to help you, so count on anyone; they all want to see you succeed.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>It excites me to work on something different from the usual corporate environment, within a small team, with significant upside potential, and contributing to beneficial technological progress for people.</p>
<p>I’m also super excited about the next team building event; they somehow keep getting better.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Graham Williamson</a></p>Efficient, effective management of access controls from infrastructure to applications remains an aspiration for enterprises. The main drivers of this goal include the need for strengthening the cybersecurity posture, efficiency gains in managing access controls, the need for consistency in access controls across multiple solutions and layers, and regulatory compliance. Most organizations today struggle with a mixture of point solutions for managing access controls, many of these relying on static entitlements causing massive work and tending to become inaccurate. A consistent, policy-based solution for managing access controls ensures that the right people have the right access, at the right time, from the right place.

This Leadership Compass features vendors offering policy-based access control solutions and provides guidance on aligning a vendor’s solution to common corporate access control requirements.

  The regulation on electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) is designed to increase trust and security in electronic transactions within the EU's internal market. One of eIDAS’ aims is to make it possible for individuals and businesses to use their own national e-Identification systems to access public services in other EU countries. EIDAS 2.o focuses on expanding the availability and usage of digital wallets, whereby member states provide citizens with secure and privacy-preserving digital wallets to manage digital credentials, aiming for 80% EU resident adoption by 2030.

				 <p>The Biden administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a change to drop overdraft fees to as low as $3. The average fee for overdrafts is over $26.</p>



<p>Why this matters: Financial institution’s bottom lines will be greatly affected. We are talking about the nation’s largest banks losing roughly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/overdraft-junk-fees-banking-biden-jpmorgan-cb8b19687264c0eed757d84911b44303">$8 billion.</a></p>



<p>Who does this affect: Only “very large” banks, savings associations, and credit unions with assets of $10 billion or more will be affected.</p>



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">CFPB</a>) found that applying these rules to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more covers:</p>



 
 80% of consumer deposits 



 68% of overdraft charges 
 



<p>While smaller FIs won’t be directly affected by this rule, it is crucial to stay vigilant to changes in the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reactions:</p>



 
 The banking industry is gearing up to fight back with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/banking-overdraft-junk-fees-cfpb-jpmorgan-3842af05c0197cba396a9552eb4b099c">multimillion-dollar marketing</a> and lobbying campaign. 



 Banks will need to start implementing new products or campaigns to make up for the revenue loss such as <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/cyber-safety/">cyber safety</a>, secure ID verification, safe browsing, and other privacy tools. (We’ll cover more on that below 👀) 
 



 Dive Deeper 



<p>The financial landscape is on the brink of change. The new rules will reshape revenue streams for banks and credit unions.</p>



<p>Overdraft lending: “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule”</p>



<p>The “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule” is part of an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">executive order</a> that “Established a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy.” This order’s initiatives create change across multiple industries, including health care, finance, technology, and more.</p>



<p>The Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule:</p>



 
 Was presented by The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 



 Wants FIs to use overdraft fees to break even by either:  FIs calculate their own costs and losses using standards outlined in the proposal.  
 
 Using the benchmark overdraft fees of $3, $6, $7, or $14. 
 
 



 Only applies to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more. 



 Change Regulation Z to expand on the definition of open-end credit: “plan” and “finance charge.” 
 



<p><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">👀 You can read the full document from the CFPB here.</a></p>



<p>Other changes for the financial space from the executive order have included:</p>



 
 <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Assessing-the-Impact-of-New-Entrant-Nonbank-Firms.pdf">The U.S. Department of the Treasury submitted a report</a> to the White House Council to show that fintech needs more regulations.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/">The CFPB proposed a new rule to lower credit card late fees.</a> 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/why-were-modernizing-how-we-collect-credit-card-data/">The CFPB is making credit card comparison more accessible.</a> 
 



<p>For all banks and credit unions, these new rules can have significant impact. The CFPB is setting new standards in the FI industry, which consumers will come to expect from all FIs, no matter the size.</p>



 The Overdraft Fee Changes: Making New Revenue Streams 



<p>The proposed regulations can significantly reduce overdraft fee revenue, prompting banks and credit unions to seek alternative revenue sources. While this presents a challenge, it also creates opportunities for proactive innovation and the maintenance of financial well-being.</p>

  The Crypto Travel Rule threshold in Japan is&nbsp;US$3000.  It has been in effect in the country since June&nbsp;2023.  During its evaluation, the FATF praised Japan’s anti-money laundering efforts and called them effective while also noting areas for potential improvement.  <p>Japan was among the first countries to recognize the potential of the decentralized crypto ecosystem and took significant measures to position itself as the world’s crypto hub. One of the measures Japan took included the introduction of various crypto-related regulations, such as the FATF Travel Rule, aimed at preventing malicious entities from exploiting digital assets for illicit activities, including terrorist financing and money laundering.</p> Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Japan <p>Japan legally recognized cryptocurrencies in 2016 and further solidified their status by amending the Payment Services Act in 2019 to treat crypto assets as legal property. It led to the establishment of clear guidelines for crypto exchanges, including the need for strict anti-money laundering measures.</p><p>The country later introduced the Crypto Travel Rule in 2022, requiring exchanges to share transaction data to combat money laundering. FATF Travel Rule, however, did not become active in 2022 and instead <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">came into force in June&nbsp;2023</a>.</p><p>The current threshold at which the Crypto Travel Rule applies to a crypto transaction in Japan is $3000. This means VASPS must transmit the required information only if the amount exceeds this&nbsp;limit.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Japan — Compliance Requirements <p>In line with FATF’s Recommendations, beneficiary and originator VASPs in Japan must obtain, hold, and make available on request to appropriate authorities the following information:</p><p>- Name and account number of the originator</p><p>- Place and date of birth of originator as well as address or national identity number, customer identification number</p><p>- Name and account number of the beneficiary</p><p>The information makes it possible for authorities to track the transaction routes of crypto assets and stablecoins.</p><p>Virtual Asset Service Providers, according to Japan’s financial regulation PSA, are those that are involved&nbsp;in:</p><p>- Purchase, sale, and exchange of crypto&nbsp;assets</p><p>- Intermediating, brokering, or acting as an agent for the above-mentioned activities</p><p>- Managing customer’s money in connection with all the above-mentioned activities</p><p>- Managing crypto assets for the benefit of another&nbsp;person</p><p>Now, a recent development seeks to refine this regulatory framework further, with <a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/newsletter/weekly2024/573.html">the FSA proposing</a> to simplify the Crypto Travel Rule on January 26th this year. The new draft requires VASPs to report restricted crypto-assets to a certified payment service association and publicly disclose this information. The agency is currently receiving public comments on the proposal until February 26th,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Japan’s self-regulated crypto organization, JVCEA, also noted in its “2024 New Year’s Thoughts” <a href="https://jvcea.or.jp/news/main-info/20240101-001/">notice</a> that by revising the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds (APTCP) to implement the FATF Travel Rule, it has become the “first major developed country to do&nbsp;so.”</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Japan, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are required to register with the FSA, which is responsible for overseeing banking, securities, and exchange sectors. Meanwhile, the Payment Services Act has been applied to all crypto exchanges operating in Japan since April&nbsp;2017.</p><p>Moreover, through amendments to its Payment Services Act, Japan already requires exchanges to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-money Laundering (ML) measures. Under this, crypto exchanges need to provide customer due diligence procedures, maintain records, ensure customer assets are secure, and improve their security.</p><p>Now, with the Crypto Travel Rule in place, it further tightens these regulations for crypto exchanges in Japan, as they now have to assess the money laundering and financial terrorism risks for self-hosted wallets as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The APTCP also plans to update its rules, requiring VASPs to collect sender and receiver information for transactions involving self-hosted wallets or unregistered VASPs, including when these transactions occur in jurisdictions where the Travel Rule is not yet enforced.</p><p>Although Japan does not mandate covering transactions with counterparties in locations that haven’t yet implemented the Travel Rule regulations, VASPs must still evaluate the risks and gather necessary information. To aid this process, the FSA regularly updates its list of countries that meet Japan’s Travel Rule standards.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Japan — Global Context and Comparisons <p>Japan’s Travel Rule sets a US$3,000 threshold for cryptocurrency transactions, higher than Singapore’s SGD 1,500 and Canada’s CAD 1,000, and unlike many countries that have no threshold. This stringent threshold is part of Japan’s broader anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing strategy, which <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/countries/detail/Japan.html">the FATF has deemed effective</a> while also highlighting areas that could benefit from further improvements.</p><p>Moreover, according to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/new-ventures/cryptocurrency-assets/pwc-global-crypto-regulation-report-2023.pdf">PWC’s report</a>, Japan is among the only 23 countries that were engaged in advancing crypto-focused regulations and legislation in 2023 across all four key focus areas: Travel Rule compliance, stablecoin regulation, licensing and listing guidance, and crypto framework development.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>In conclusion, Japan’s adherence to clear guidelines for crypto companies and global anti-money laundering standards, exemplified by initiatives like the Crypto Travel Rule, reinforces its standing in the crypto industry amid heightened global regulatory scrutiny.</p> Relevant Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the United&nbsp;States</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Hong&nbsp;Kong</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Comprehensive Guide to Crypto Regulations and FATF Travel Rule in Singapore</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the&nbsp;UAE</a></p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Back in March of 1950, the FBI added Willie “The Actor” Sutton to their list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. During his tenure as an American bank robber, Sutton stole an estimated $2 million ($25 million in today’s dollars) and was known for using disguises. Police officer, maintenance worker, postal carrier, and telegraph messenger were a few of the roles the fraudster assumed to execute his heists.</p>
<p>When asked why he robbed banks, he replied, “because that’s where the money is.”</p>
<p>For a modern Willie Sutton, real estate seller impersonation might be considered the latest fraud method of choice. Fraudsters are focusing on compromising the identity of property owners to sell real estate they do not own. Their goal is to collect the funds a buyer intends to use for purchasing the property before other transaction participants realize the fraudster is not the legal owner.</p>
<p>Imagine owning a piece of land where you haven’t built anything yet, and one day as you drive past it you discover that there is a construction site on it. As you finally get to speak with the person in charge of the construction, you hear them claiming they rightfully own the land, with a perfectly valid deed of sale as proof.</p>
<p>How is this even possible in 2024, you may wonder? It’s simple: With the explosion of online business transactions over the last five years, technology has made it easy to buy and sell remotely – but not necessarily easy to do it securely.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for a bad actor to find leaked data online, and to spot weak identity verification methods in a remote real estate sales process. Personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to real estate owners, loan applicants, sellers, and real estate agents is valuable to bad actors looking to commit seller impersonation fraud.</p>
<p>Seller impersonation fraud follows a specific methodology, and understanding the nuances is critical in safeguarding your organization. Our latest white paper provides more details about how it happens, the challenges it creates, and best practices you can put in place to prevent these risks without negatively impacting your sales processes.</p>

<p>Biometric spoofing, also known as biometric spoof attacks or biometric presentation attacks, refers to the manipulation or falsification of biometric data to deceive a biometric authentication system.</p>
 What Is Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Biometric spoofing refers to deceptive <a>biometric authentication</a> attempts by presenting fake samples related to fingerprints, facial scans, or iris scans–a “presentation attack.” While <a>biometric identification</a> methods are significantly stronger than password-based systems, this does not make them invulnerable. Modern threats are evolving to bypass such protections. As such, many strong authentication requirements in compliance and regulatory standards require some form of liveness detection that can determine if the credentials presented are real.</p>
<p>In general, liveness detection methods can be classified as active or passive:</p>
 
 Active methods require user interaction, such as performing a specific action. For example, an active detection method might require the user to undertake some action, like smiling or speaking. 
 Passive methods work in the background without the user’s awareness. This method requires no direct interaction with the user. 
 
<p>Broadly speaking, active methods are typically harder to spoof but require more engagement with the user, which can impact usability. Passive methods are smoother and seamless but present more opportunities for fraud.</p>
 What Are Some Types of Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Because different forms of biometric spoofing align with various forms of authentication, each attempt to address the specific weaknesses and opportunities of those methods.<br>
As such, presentation attacks can target various biometric modalities, including:</p>
 Facial Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>Attackers may use different techniques to deceive facial recognition systems. Some of the common methods include:</p>
 
 Print Attack: The attack uses a printed photograph of the target person’s face to trick the <a>facial recognition system</a>. This is one of the simplest methods and can be effective against less sophisticated systems (most of which need to be deployed in a context where they would protect important information). 
 Replay Attack: Hackers record a video of the target person’s face and play it back in front of the camera. This approach is often more successful than a print attack since it incorporates motion, which some facial recognition systems may require. 
 3D Mask Attack: The attacker creates a realistic 3D mask of the target person’s face and wears it during authentication. This method can be more challenging to detect, but it’s equally challenging to do effectively without specific skills and equipment. 
 Deep Fake Attack: An attack uses a machine learning/AI program to create a video of the target’s face. Deepfake technology can create convincing facial movements and expressions, making it difficult for some facial recognition systems to differentiate between real and fake. 
 
<p>Facial recognition liveness detection techniques can include analyzing facial movements like blinking or verifying 3D depth information. Additionally, while there isn’t a consensus on how accurate deep fakes are, new technology from Intel can look for artifacts that signal that a video is artificial–rendering deep fakes relatively niche.</p>
 Fingerprint Spoofing Recognition Attacks 
<p><a>Fingerprint verification</a> systems, while generally secure, can still be vulnerable to spoofing if appropriate countermeasures are not in place. Some of the common fingerprint spoofing methods include:</p>
 
 Fake Fingerprints: Hackers create artificial fingerprints using materials like gelatin that replicate the target user’s fingerprint pattern, often taken directly from a fingerprint. The fake fingerprint can then be placed over the attacker’s finger or a dummy finger to deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 Latent Fingerprints: An attacker lifts a target user’s latent fingerprint from a surface using adhesive tape or other methods and then transfers it onto a material that can deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 3D-Printed Fingerprints: A sophisticated attack that involves someone creating a 3D model of the target user’s fingerprint using digital techniques and then 3D printing it with materials that mimic human skin properties. This method can create realistic replicas that can deceive some fingerprint scanners. 
 
<p>Countermeasures against these attacks include measuring finger skin temperature, moisture, or electrical properties to ensure the presented fingerprint comes from a live person.</p>
 Iris Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>While iris recognition is generally considered to be a highly secure biometric modality, it can still be vulnerable to spoofing attacks if appropriate countermeasures are not in place.<br>
Some of the common iris presentation attacks include:</p>
 
 Digital Iris Images: Displaying a digital image or video of the target user’s iris on a device screen, such as a smartphone or tablet, and presenting it to the iris scanner. This method can use different lighting and sharpness settings on devices to fool some biometric scanners. 
 Artificial Eyes or Contact Lenses: Creating an artificial eye or a custom contact lens with the target user’s iris pattern imprinted. These can be harder to detect if the contacts are created well. 
 Physical Eyes: Although a rare and extreme method, using a preserved cadaver eye with the target user’s iris pattern can also deceive the iris recognition system. It would require someone to steal the eye of a dead subject and use it relatively quickly to be effective, which may be its form of deterrence. 
 
<p>To defend against iris presentation attacks, defenders may use techniques like examining the natural movement and contraction of the iris, verifying light reflection patterns, or analyzing the unique texture of the iris surface.</p>
 How Is Liveness Detection Used in Identity Assurance Level (IAL) Verification? 
<p>Identity Assurance Level (IAL) is a classification system used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/verification/">Special Publication 800-63-3</a>, “Digital Identity Guidelines” to categorize the level of confidence in an individual’s asserted identity. These standards are often used to add layers of identity verification to processes involving sensitive government systems or classified data.</p>
<p>IAL2 is an intermediate level of assurance, the second of three levels. At IAL2, an individual’s identity must be verified through remote or in-person proofing processes, which involve validating and verifying identity information against trusted records and sources. Liveness detection plays a role in IAL2 by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of biometric data collected during the identity-proofing process.</p>
 Combating Biometric Spoofing with 1Kosmos 
<p>Biometrics can improve security by replacing passwords, but they can be subject to theft, spoofing, and decision bias. As discussed, bad actors are implementing approaches to bypass biometric assurances with increasing success.</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos platform performs a series of checks to prevent biometric-based attacks. For instance, 1Kosmos LiveID can perform both “active” liveness (requiring the user to perform randomized expressions) and “passive” liveness, one without the user’s involvement. Additionally, 1Kosmos utilizes true-depth camera functionality to prevent presentation attacks and offers an SDK to protect against camera manipulation to prevent an injection attack. Alongside these advances, 1Kosmos BlockID also offers the following features:</p>
 
 Anti-Spoofing Algorithms:&nbsp;1Kosmos anti-spoofing algorithms detect and differentiate between genuine biometric data and spoofed data. Our algorithms analyze factors like texture, temperature, color, and movement to determine the authenticity of the biometric sample, catching virtual/hardware camera and JavaScript injections and ensuring the validity of the transmitted identity. 
 Data Encryption:&nbsp;1Kosmos ensures that biometric data is encrypted both during transmission and storage to prevent unauthorized access. Implementing strict access controls and encryption protocols prevents man-in-the-middle and protocol injections, ensuring the validity of the transmitted identity. 
 Regular Audits and Penetration Testing:&nbsp;1Kosmos conducts regular audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities, including access to a user’s biometric data. This helps ensure that security measures are effective and up to date. 
 Regulatory Compliance: 1Kosmos complies with regulations and standards related to biometric data protection and security, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 800-63-3), iBeta DEA EPCS, UK DIATF, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Know Your Customer/Employee (KYC/KYE). For a list of certifications, click <a>here.</a>

<p>Ontology’s innovative approach to tokenomics within the realm of cryptocurrency economics is epitomized through its dual-token system. This system, leveraging the foundational blockchain technology, distinguishes between utility tokens vs. security tokens, with ONT orchestrating governance and ONG driving utility. This separation allows for enhanced token liquidity and a balanced token distribution strategy.</p> Just want the basics — TLDR right&nbsp;here. <p>Dual-Token System: Ontology features a dual-token model for enhanced governance and utility within its ecosystem. ONT, the governance token, allows for staking and network decision-making, while ONG serves as the utility token, facilitating transactions and smart contracts.</p><p>ONT Utility: ONT is pivotal for securing the network and participating in its governance, offering stakeholders rewards in ONG for their contributions. For the current supply of ONT, visit CoinMarketCap.</p><p>ONG Utility: ONG, required for executing transactions and deploying smart contracts, incentivizes the active use of the network. Check the current supply of ONG at CoinMarketCap.</p><p>EVM Tokens: The integration into the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enables ONT and ONG to function as ORC-20 tokens, broadening their applicability across Ethereum’s dApp ecosystem and enhancing Ontology’s interoperability within the blockchain landscape.</p><p>Want to know more — read&nbsp;on!</p> Introduction to Ontology’s Dual-Token Model <p>Ontology’s innovative blockchain technology introduces a dual-token system, enhancing both governance and utility within its ecosystem. ONT, the governance token, enables stakeholders to participate in network decision-making and secure the network through staking, epitomizing the concept of tokenomics in action. ONG, serving as the utility token, facilitates transactions and smart contracts, essential for the active use of the network. This division between utility tokens vs. security tokens ensures that participants can maintain their governance power without sacrificing their ability to engage in daily operations, creating a balanced economic model that fosters a stable and participatory ecosystem.</p> The Role of ONT in&nbsp;Ontology <p>ONT’s pivotal role in securing the network and providing governance underscores the importance of token supply and token allocation in cryptocurrency economics. With a total fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, ONT’s distribution strategy is a key aspect of Ontology’s tokenomics, ensuring a democratized and secure blockchain environment. This approach not only empowers ONT holders with significant influence over the network’s future direction but also aligns with the principles of blockchain staking, incentivizing long-term holding and active participation.</p> The Purpose of ONG in&nbsp;Ontology <p>As the ‘gas’ of the Ontology network, ONG exemplifies the utility token’s role in facilitating blockchain operations, from smart contracts to transactions. This dynamic incentive structure is central to Ontology’s tokenomics, ensuring that the network remains active and secure. The strategic cap on ONG’s total supply aligns with the network’s scalability requirements, showcasing the nuanced approach to cryptocurrency economics that Ontology employs to foster a healthy ecosystem.</p> Acquiring and Managing ONT and&nbsp;ONG <p>Accessible through various cryptocurrency exchanges, ONT and ONG offer flexibility and ease of entry for users looking to engage with the Ontology ecosystem. The ONTO Wallet simplifies the management of these tokens, enhancing token liquidity and streamlining the staking process. This ease of management is crucial for encouraging participation and governance within the network, reflecting the core principles of DeFi economics.</p> Staking with ONT: Benefits and Processes <p>Staking ONT not only contributes to the network’s security but also offers staking rewards, a compelling aspect of DeFi economics. This process is integral to the tokenomics model, incentivizing users to contribute to network stability and governance, and reflecting the broader trend towards yield farming and participation in liquidity pools.</p> Ontology’s Expansion to Ethereum Virtual Machine&nbsp;(EVM) <p>The integration of ONT and ONG as ORC-20 tokens into the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) marks a significant step towards enhancing Ontology’s interoperability and utility across the blockchain landscape. This move taps into the rich ecosystem of Ethereum’s dApps, broadening the applicability and reach of Ontology’s tokens, and underlining the importance of cross-chain collaboration in the evolving world of blockchain technology.</p> Conclusion: The Future of Ontology’s Tokens <p>ONT and ONG stand at the forefront of Ontology’s evolution, embodying the principles of tokenomics and cryptocurrency economics.

 Stakers can claim DF76 rewards. DF77 runs Feb 15— Feb 22, 2024. Bug fix in reward calculation  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 76 (DF76) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Feb 8, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 15. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF77 is live today, Feb 15. It concludes on Feb 22. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF77  <p>And, for this post we have a special section 5, about a bug fix in DF reward calculation. The summary is: some Data Farmers were underpaid in the last few rounds. We have fixed the issue. Data Farmers can claim their reimbursement in the usual way to claim, via the DF&nbsp;dapp.</p> 2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.

To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF77 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Bug fix in reward calculation  5.1 Overview <p>Some Data Farmers were underpaid in the last few rounds. They’ve now been compensated the difference. The rest of this section elaborates.</p> 5.2 The&nbsp;Issue <p>In early February 2024, we identified an issue affecting DF reward calculation. The part of code that limits reward based on DCV (data consume volume) was supposed to limit in units of OCEAN. However it limited in units of USD. This led to Volume DF rewards being lower than intended, starting in DF63 (start of Predictoor DF). There were 69 wallets affected, with a total of 64,501 OCEAN less than it should have&nbsp;been.</p> 5.3 Solution in&nbsp;Code <p>As soon as we discovered the issue, we fixed it by limiting using the correct units (OCEAN, not USD). Then we took steps to reimburse; see next&nbsp;section.</p> 5.4 Reimbursement <p>We always strive to do the right thing. Trust is of utmost importance to us.In this case, that means: ensuring that every DF participant receives the DF rewards they&nbsp;earned.</p><p>We carefully calculated the missed amounts for each affected wallet. Section 5.5 lists each affected wallet, and the amount of OCEAN that was&nbsp;missing.</p><p>We are pleased to announce that these reimbursements have been processed and are now available for claiming. Participants affected by this issue can claim their reimbursement in the same manner as they would typically claim their DF rewards via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>.</p> 5.5 OCEAN Reimbursed, per&nbsp;Wallet  +--------------------------------------------+-----------------+<br>| Address

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In Blogs 1–3 of this series we have been exploring the conceptual aspects of an alternative monetary system. In this final blog, we would like to shift gear and channel our thinking into a series of practical next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;four:</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? (B<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">log&nbsp;2</a>)  What could a desirable future scenario actually look like? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-951ca09dd76d">Blog&nbsp;3</a>)  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel&nbsp;system?  <p>Whilst writing this post, we began to feel a niggling sense of doubt. Something about it felt quite anticlimactic. In this initiative we started with a bold vision underpinned by some detailed research of the problem space. Now, as is so often the case we are grappling with the details of how to make things happen on the ground. In the messy reality of managing relationships, roles, time constraints and funding pressures, our suggestions for a way forward seem insubstantial. Rather than trying to pad them out or use technical language to shield the lack of clarity, we have decided to go ahead and share where we actually are, both in our thinking and in our aspiration for this&nbsp;work.</p> Questions we need to begin working&nbsp;on <p>We are publishing this Blog at an early stage of our thinking. At this point our ambitions far outweigh our intellectual ability and team capacity. This is overwhelming, exciting and humbling! To break through this paralysis we are sharing some open questions based on our initial internal brainstorming sessions and responses to the previous blogs (credited below). If you have reflections or questions of your own then then we would really welcome comments:</p>  What would a low tech, minimum viable proof of possibility look&nbsp;like?  How can we use existing technology meaningfully in different contexts (for example a rural area in the Global&nbsp;South)?¹  How can we account for different closed loop systems in their own rights without going down the data rabbit&nbsp;hole?  Can we build on the energy and intelligence of the Geospatial Community to leverage data in a richly contextual yet feasible&nbsp;format?²  How can we ensure that the idea of a Bioregion doesn’t perpetuate a fractured worldview?  How do we decide which cycles or measurements are the most important for a&nbsp;region?  What are we pegging a system’s health against? How can we estimate what the optimal regenerative potential might&nbsp;be?  What can people do with the individual tokens that they receive? Why would anyone want to take part in a&nbsp;project?  How will the main RegenCoins be exchanged both within and outside of the&nbsp;region?  What can we learn from previous attempts to implement local currencies such as those pioneered by the Transition Town Network?³  How can we make sure that the ability for different people to earn tokens is fair? For example, if somebody lives close to a river it might be easier to demonstrate acts of care than for somebody who lives further&nbsp;away.   Existing technology, tools and research that we can build&nbsp;on <p>We are both sure (and hugely relieved) that we are far from the first people to explore this subject. Many of the ideas outlined in the previous blogs have been inspired by the work of others, and we will continue to learn and incorporate as many diverse perspectives as possible. As we move towards our first prototype we have identified a number of initiatives that we think will provide invaluable insights:</p>  Using market based credit platforms as a basis for quantifying living systems: the level of data being collected is already significant. For example the<a href="https://seed-index.com/"> Seed Biocomplexity Index</a> has been developed to link geospatial satellite data with scientific literature. Another example is the <a href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen Network</a> which describes itself as ‘a platform to originate and invest in high-integrity carbon and biodiversity credits from ecological regeneration projects’. Although we are categorically not looking to price elements of the bioregion, the research underpinning some of the Network’s projects (e.g. pollinator health) could be a powerful learning framework. We are also interested to learn from less established initiatives such as land trust tokens being linked to river basin resilience programmes in South&nbsp;Africa¹.  Taxes pegged to positive activities: we hope to learn from proposals for tax incentive schemes that are specifically designed to encourage stewardship activities. An example is the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4524897">Malta Atlantica Restoration Currency</a> that is being proposed in&nbsp;Brazil.  Universal basic income / services pilots: there are a number of live and closed UBI/S pilots that we are intrigued to learn from. Of particular interest is to try to understand how people’s behaviour and perception of value is affected, when the link between monetary transactions and daily activities is less&nbsp;linear.³  Statistical forecasting models used in decision making: there is an exciting body of research emerging in the context of applying <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1128055/full">Bayesian forecasting techniques to environmental modelling</a>. We are imagining that this might link closely to crypto economic research currently being conducted at hubs such as WU Vienna and ETH Zurich⁴. Partnering with an academic centre to bring their research into our prototype will be a priority.  Relational, flow based technology: the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/">Holochain Community</a> has developed a number of different peer-to-peer tools and resources that have strong value alignment with this proposal. In particular, the <a href="https://hrea.io/">hREA value flows specification</a> could provide a scaffold to connect the different activities that we would like to&nbsp;explore.  Currency and token design: community experts such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artbrock/">Arthur Brock</a> and <a href="https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/">Grace Rachmany</a> have deep knowledge and experience with alternative currency design. We would aim to consult and build on this expertise rather than trying to reinvent the&nbsp;wheel.  Thrutopia storytelling: the novelist and podcast host Manda Scott describes <a href="https://thrutopia.life/">Thrutopias</a> as ‘clear, engaging routes through to a world we’d all be proud to bequeath to future generations’. As we strive to test pathways in the present, we do not want to lose touch with the imaginative potential that we started to engage with in Blog 3. Prominent authors such as Kim Stanley Robinson⁵ and Yanis Varoufakis⁶ have explored ideas such as a carbon coin and free PerCap accounts within sci-fi narratives, and we will seek to engage with emerging writing in this&nbsp;field.⁷   A prototype proposition <p>As an initial call to action, we would like to partner with a community (or a number of communities) to build the foundations for the world’s first decentralised, bioregional bank. To make the project realistic we imagine that the areas involved will need to be small enough to make the data capture manageable. However they will also need to represent a number of different biophysical and social cycles to ensure a meaningful entangled value interaction is captured. It will also be important to engage with a supportive governance and legal environment for some stages of the work, to ground the prototype in the reality of the existing&nbsp;system.</p><p>We would invite interested communities and collaborators to self-select as high levels of trust and value alignment will be fundamental pillars of success. We will therefore be circulating these blogs and having conversations with a number of potential demonstrator locations. It feels important to clearly state that we do not have the financial resources at this point to pay people for their help. This is difficult and at times feels uncomfortable; the fear is that we may unwittingly perpetuate extractive behaviour in the pursuit of a regenerative goal. We are trying to balance our commitment to push this thinking forward, with a deep sense of respect for our ecosystem and will continually review the relationship between the two for signs of&nbsp;stress.</p>Credit: Eunji Kang, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs<p>The prototype will be designed as 7 interlinked stages:</p>  Value mapping: here we will select a number of elements to visualise. The mix will depend on the location but could include a combination of air and water quality, soil health, biodiversity resilience, equity, care and trust. The mapping is likely to combine geospatial data with interviews, surveys and participatory workshops.  Real time sensory data gathering: based on the value mapping we will investigate the best ways of capturing the relational flows that define our selected elements. For some flows, sensors will already be in place whilst for others the process will be participatory.  Multivalent currency design and use: once we have an understanding of how value is being both created and eroded in our ecosystem, we will attempt to design self-regulating currencies to represent these multivalent flows.  Building a probabilistic model based on data inputs: this stage will combine the data and knowledge gained to simulate how the different elements are impacting on each other. The model will be interactive and infer each forecast from an updated understanding of the underlying systems.  Linking the model to governance decisions: this phase will focus on the interaction between the living agents and the value simulation. It will involve using the model to process multiple data inputs to inform a number of decisions. The outputs will be tested with the community to assess how accurately their views and values are being represented.  Creating a feedback loop between decisions and currency levels: as the system becomes more refined, the collective decisions can be used to adjust the currency levels of the base elements.  Grounding the results in regulatory or policy instruments: we will strive to link the multi-sensory decision making capabilities that have been co-developed with the community, to real world impacts. We hope that this might be achieved by testing a cross boundary tax payable in one (or a blend) of the new currencies. Another idea is to link the currencies to specific policy issues to elevate the agency and collective voice of the community. This second point has a strong link to the work that we have been prototyping in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16vmzzaTFMUUyiwkwqVedZRA1QxChJ2UD/view?usp=sharing">Sweden</a>, Scotland and Canada to create multi-sensory, living indicators.  <p>We don’t know the exact details of how the above will be achieved but we are confident that the collective knowledge and tools are already available. The steps need not be taken consecutively and we imagine that different elements can be worked on across multiple contexts and time frames. A big part of this journey will be connecting people, ideas and technologies to work towards this common goal.

<p>The new year is always a time for reflection, and after a year shaped by AI, biometrics, and nation-state attacks there’s a lot to think about. So where are we headed from here? A utopian episode of Star Trek or a more dystopian Terminator 10 movie? The future as they say is up to us and that means reshaping trust and security for the realities of our brave new world.</p>
<p>The intensifying geopolitical landscape characterized by nation-sponsored attacks has made cyber the new battleground. Employing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework">Zero Trust</a> principles is a best practice, but not a cybersecurity guarantee in an era of AI-enhanced phishing, zero-day brokers, and malware-as-a-service. Adopting a term from U.S. Cold War simulations, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/what-is-red-teaming.html">red teaming</a> is back in vogue. The red team is a pretend enemy that attempts to mount a cyberattack acting under the direction of the target organization. One such example comes from the <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/european-central-bank-to-put-banks-through-cyber-stress-test-a-24012?rf=2024-01-03_ENEWS_SUB_BIS__Slot1_ART24012&amp;mkt_tok=MDUxLVpYSS0yMzcAAAGQbvkmv4W-kSt1bPEzX98HJHUg04qWbpdOLJZTWjt_FPgrLy6XKsAky0jtvHG2DOrkVD9V66UM28zIenSQA8_0Smm1P_k2nVRNxCR3ykteB8xV6BBlHQ">European Central Bank</a>, which has started to conduct vulnerability assessments and incident response tests on banks to assess their cyber resilience. Whether simulated or real, all organizations should seek to turn cyber breaches into a blueprint for future security with actionable strategies to strengthen their cyber posture.</p>
<p>One particular area of cyber exposure is <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140/">critical infrastructure</a>, from the power grid to water treatment plants to public service providers and beyond. We live in an “everything is connected to everything” world, making critical infrastructure a vulnerable and attractive target to bad actors. In 2024, it’s long past time to get serious about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/iot-security">IoT</a> and Industrial IoT (IIoT) security. As well, AI-enabled biometric identity verification of employees, partners, and customers is increasingly essential to flushing out <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1251094/deepfakes-emerge-as-a-top-security-threat-ahead-of-the-2024-us-election.html">deepfakes</a> and keeping organizations and people safe.</p>
<p>There are also some encouraging signs that regulators around the globe are stepping up to the challenges ahead. Similar to data privacy, consumer protection, and digital identity legislation, Europe is on the vanguard once again with the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>. The White House has also issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> and the bipartisan <a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-kennedy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-provide-more-transparency-on-ai-generated-content">Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act</a> has been tabled. However, being that it’s an election year in the U.S., it’s likely that big tech will be left largely to self-regulate over the next 12 months. That said, the tech sector is stepping up, with seven technology behemoths including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft agreeing to adopt <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">AI safeguards</a> with the Biden administration. As well, ChatGPT maker and close Microsoft collaborator OpenAI has released its <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/openai-formulates-framework-to-mitigate-catastrophic-risks-a-23930">framework to mitigate catastrophic risks</a> like using generative AI to build biological weapons, spread malware, or carry out social engineering attacks. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been busy building out the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework </a> (AI RMF) in close collaboration with the private and public sector to continue to leverage the power of AI while mitigating the risk.</p>
<p>So, at the outset of 2024, I remain cautiously optimistic that the forces of good will prevail and it will be a utopian technology-fueled future.</p>

				  Save your organization valuable development time while building digital wallet functionality right into your existing applications.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>An organization’s digital app is often one of the most effective ways it engages customers. For example, the American Bankers Association found that <a href="https://www.aba.com/about-us/press-room/press-releases/consumer-survey-banking-methods-2023#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20Generation,prefer%20to%20visit%20a%20branch.">48% of bank customers</a> prefer mobile apps as their method of choice for managing their finances.</p>
<p>Given this, you want to make sure of two things: One, that it offers easy-to-use features, and two,&nbsp; that your customers stay on your app spending their time and money with you rather than going elsewhere.</p>
<p>Indicio designed the Proven Mobile SDK specifically to help you do both of these things.</p>
<p>Faster App Feature Deployment</p>
<p>App design and construction is not a simple process: for applications with multiple features, most sources say the average development time is <a href="https://spdload.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-develop-an-app/">nine months or longer.</a> With this much time and money at stake, adding new features that require complex code changes is daunting, and it can be tempting to simply add on a third party application to achieve the required functionality.</p>
<p>But relying on a third party to handle features means sending your customers to that third party, reducing their time spent on your platform, and — crucially — losing control of their customer experience. For example, if you run a business and the only way to purchase something on your website is a third-party payment platform that is constantly buggy, the experience will be tied to using your website and risk losing you customers. People do not reward complexity and hassle online.</p>
<p>This is where the Proven Mobile SDK comes in. It helps you build digital wallet functionality directly into your existing application without your team having to reinvent the wheel. Built with packages for Swift, Kotlin, and React Native, your developers can add decentralized identity to your applications without the time commitment of learning new programming languages or practices.</p>
<p>But what functionality and features does the SDK add to your application that will enhance the customer experience?</p>
<p>Faster interactions through pre-verified data</p>
<p>Full digital wallet functionality allows you to hold and share verifiable data and identity information inside a digital credential —&nbsp;a “verifiable” credential. With verifiable credentials you can be cryptographically confident in who you’re interacting with online. Unlike passwords, verifiable credentials automatically share who issued them and who is presenting them in a provable way, as well as whether any information has been altered since being created, making them impossible to copy or steal.</p>
<p>Because these credentials can prove who you are on their own, they remove the need for the customer to jump through hoops when accessing their account, such as passwords, MFA, security keys, and more, letting customers move right on to what they came for.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven Mobile SDK in action:</p>
<p>One powerful use case for verifiable credentials is Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. A financial institution can do its full customer vetting for account creation, a business loan, or mortgage and issue them a credential containing the relevant information. This means that the customer can share that information in a way that is provable,&nbsp; removing the need to repeat the expensive KYC process.</p>
<p>Schools can <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-revolutionizes-adoption-of-open-badges/">issue credential-based diplomas</a> that allow students to share them without the need to reach back out to the school for verification; businesses can use them for both <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven-works-verifiable-credentials-for-frictionless-secure-employee-identification/">employee access management</a> and customer loyalty programs; countries can allow their citizens to share their resident status for all kinds of things from <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">travel</a> to paying bills to <a href="https://indicio.tech/digital-identity-and-the-public-sector-using-verifiable-credentials-to-manage-social-security/">proving residency</a>.</p>
<p>In short, once you’ve met your initial identity assurance requirements, verifiable credentials can eliminate redundant paperwork and data input, and provide a simpler, streamlined, better customer experience.</p>
<p>And the Proven Mobile SDK provides all the pieces you need. In a fraction of the time. On any application. In whatever language your team is familiar with.</p>

 What is Customer Authentication? 



<p>Customer authentication is a critical security process that identifies and verifies users before allowing them access to digital accounts. It’s built on login credentials established during user onboarding, utilizing a blend of knowledge-based (passwords), possession-based (security tokens), and inherence-based (biometrics) authenticators. The adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) has become standard practice, requiring users to provide multiple identity proofs to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.</p>



<p>This security measure is essential for protecting against common threats like account takeover attacks by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. Despite the prevalence of password-based systems, their effectiveness is compromised by common security pitfalls, such as the reuse of passwords. Therefore, more advanced authentication methods, including MFA and adaptive authentication, are increasingly important. These methods assess risk levels and adjust security measures dynamically, improving the security posture without compromising user experience. New technologies like FIDO2 passkeys and biometric authentication pave the way toward more secure, passwordless authentication methods, emphasizing ease of use and improved security.</p>



<p>Customer authentication is a crucial building block gatekeeper for user data and access in digital security. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, customer authentication methods have also undergone significant advancements, aiming to strike a balance between robust security and user-friendliness. This balance helps to ensure that authorized users can easily access the digital world while maintaining the highest level of security measures to protect sensitive information.</p>

 System to achieve full compliance of Crypto Asset Service Providers and self-hosted wallets with AML regulations and the Transfer of Funds Regulation&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, February 13, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, joins a consortium of five partners including the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>, <a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="https://spyce5.com/">SPYCE.5</a>, and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the goal of making Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets compliant with the European Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new TFR regulation in the EU mandates that all cryptocurrency transactions will need to carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver. According to the new rule, compliance with TFR is mandatory for all CASPs. Additionally, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0420">new AML Regulation</a> will require all CASPs to comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. For example, when a user opens an account and registers a wallet with a CASP, an identification process is required to comply with the new AML Regulation and TFR.</p>



<p>One challenge for CASPs to adhere to the new rules lies in GDPR compliance, as personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). However, to comply with the new regulations, CASPs need to know with whom they are doing business and continuously verify this information.</p>



<p>Raising trust and transparency in crypto asset transactions</p>



<p>To address this challenge, the partners have formed a consortium to propose a system where a trusted party tokenizes an identification process it has witnessed, allowing CASPs to have confidence in this process, without revealing any PII. The resulting soul-bound token (SBT) can be used for blockchain processes, enabling web3 native interactions. Furthermore, the trusted party can reveal the identity information, if requested by an authorized party, such as law enforcement, as well as revoke the SBT, if needed.</p>



<p>Within the consortium, the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit foundation supporting the development of the IOTA protocol, will provide the underlying network as the proposed solution will be implemented on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. walt.id, a leading open source vendor of decentralized identity and wallet infrastructure, will develop, provide, and maintain the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs like identity proofs, while IDnow will deliver the identity verification solution to onboard users into the wallet solution. Bloom, an all-in-one wallet for the IOTA, Shimmer and EVM ecosystem, will provide the capabilities for users to store, present and prove ownership of the SBT. SPYCE.5, specializing in the integration of hybrid blockchain technologies, will provide the essential infrastructure for seamless interchain communication and transaction validation, ensuring the system’s overall efficiency and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Statements</p>



<p>“We are excited to be part of this forward-thinking consortium alongside highly esteemed crypto asset industry players to address a pressing need for crypto wallet solutions that comply with the latest EU regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto companies</a> are facing a race against the clock to implement new requirements, which is why we wish to submit this proposed solution to the EU for consideration to address the technological and regulatory challenges around AML, KYC and TFR in crypto,” says Rayissa Armata, Director Global Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be working with such incredible partners to create a truly seamless user experience and to provide the underlying distributed ledger technology. Identity verification in Web3 environments should be simple and straightforward, without sacrificing privacy or security. As regulatory requirements grow, we need innovative solutions that are easy to use for both businesses and everyday users,” says Dominik Schiener, Chairman of the Board of the IOTA Foundation.</p>



<p>“We have been building decentralized identity and wallet solutions for many clients across various industries, but this project is particularly interesting as it shows new ways of onboarding and verifying users for crypto and DeFi use cases that have traditionally been struggling with regulatory compliance,” says Dominik Beron, Founder of walt.id.</p>



<p>“Bloom is excited to be collaborating with the partners in this consortium. This project will ensure our users and the crypto ecosystem can benefit from a self-hosted wallet that complies with EU regulations,” says Nicole O’Brien, Co-founder of Bloom Labs.</p>



<p>“We’re proud to be part of this groundbreaking consortium, leveraging SPYCE.5’s hybrid chain architecture to navigate the complex landscape of EU regulations. Our innovative approach ensures not only compliance but also maintains the integrity and efficiency vital in the crypto space,” says Holger Köther, Managing Director of SPYCE.5.</p>

 We sit down with the romance fraud vigilante-turned-author to discuss the responsibility she feels for victims, why social media platforms need to be held more accountable, and why she put a photo of Keanu Reeves on the cover of her book. 



 



<p>Despite having a popular Twitter account (114,000 followers and growing), with the sole purpose of exposing romance scammers, Becky Holmes says she still gets contacted by hopeful, hapless fraudsters. In fact, she was contacted just 15 minutes before our interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fortunately, a lot of them are not very observant, so I get to do what I do without too much recourse,” said Becky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Becky does is two-fold: She exposes the often-hilarious exchanges with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scammers</a>, some of whom claim to be celebrities, and, more recently, provides a forum in which people can share their experiences and learn more about this increasingly common form of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation is clearly needed. Romance scams rose by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/data-released-on-rise-in-romance-scams-as-valentines-day-looms">19% globally in 2023</a>. Considering only 58% of victims ever report the crime to law enforcement, that figure is likely to be much higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Becky has just released her debut book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Keanu-Reeves-Not-Love-You/dp/1789651638">‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’</a>, featuring first-hand accounts of victims, examples of scripts used by fraudsters, and a look into the psychology of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the book itself only took nine months to write, the aim of helping people and raising awareness of the dangers of social media fraud began when Becky first joined Twitter (now X) in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost immediately I got a flurry of messages from all these fabulously handsome men, and they were all immediately in love with me. They all said the same thing and were all from very similar looking men. Some were in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/army-romance-scam">army</a>, and some were in pilots’ uniforms, and it was very clear that there was a pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At first, I was blocking and deleting them and having a bit of fun by seeing how nonsensical I could be before they picked up on what I was saying. I began posting the exchanges on Twitter a few months later, and people found them funny and were laughing and we were all having a good time. Then, in 2021, quite a few victims of romance fraud got in touch with me and said that they’d been a victim and had lost a large amount of money. That’s when it all changed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss the different ways in which romance scammers tend to target men and women, the delicate balance in presenting information in a relatable, digestible format that does not undermine the danger and impact, and much more.</p>



 What were the main reasons behind becoming a ‘romance scam vigilante’? Did you ever become a victim yourself [i.e. transfer funds, or ‘fall in love’]? 



<p>So, I’m fortunate enough to have never been the victim of romance fraud. However, I was in a very coercively controlled relationship at one point, and the parallels between what victims of romance fraud go through and victims of coercive control are very similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I ended up speaking on the phone with many victims and they said they hadn’t told anybody, and they didn’t know what to do. I hated the idea of people feeling lonely because I’ve been in that situation myself. So, I became kind of a sounding board for a few people and felt a responsibility.</p>



<p>Most had reported to Action Fraud but not heard anything back, so were in a very isolated place.&nbsp;I started realizing what a huge subject it was and how underreported it was, and it became like a passion project.</p>



<p>[Read more about the steps that the UK government is taking to address fraud, in our blog <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">‘UK declares war on fraud, calls on tech giants to join the fight.’</a>]</p>



 I see that many of the messages you share on Twitter are actual Twitter exchanges, in your personal experience, is this where romance fraud is most common? 



<p>No, I get messages on Instagram, on Twitter, and dating sites are, of course, rife with them. I’ve also heard about people receiving messages on TikTok, and bizarrely, if you play online games, romance fraudsters are lurking there too. Whatever platform it is, the one thing they immediately want to do is to take you to WhatsApp or Google Chat. I have a separate Google Chat account where I have these exchanges.</p>



 Romance scams target both men and women. Are there any differences in approaches? 



<p>Although I never view stats as&nbsp;wholly reliable, statistically, romance fraud targets men and women equally. I want to stress that not all women are approached with the promise of romance and men with the promise of sex, but more men do tend to be victims of sextortion. Sextortion is when you have exchanged intimate images with somebody, and that person then blackmails you. For example, a married man with kids or a high position at work will send images to someone [who is almost certainly not a Russian model], and the recipient will then reply and say that they’ve hacked into your Facebook and can now see your children’s Facebook accounts, and your colleagues’ accounts, and that’s when the requests for money start.</p>



 It’s the old adage, isn’t it, and, of course, there’s a danger of generalizing, but men are more led by what they see, and women by what they hear. 



<p>That’s right, although the example that I use in the book is of a lady who believed she was in a relationship with somebody, but very quickly realized it was a scam. When she ended the relationship, he said, “Yes, you’ve caught me. I’m not this person, but I’ve got your images. I know who your children are on Facebook.” He extorted about £14,000 from her. With that case, she never tried to get the money back, or go to the police as she had grown up children and grandchildren, and even though I assured her that the police would keep such investigations confidential, she was terrified her family would find out.</p>



 I once <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy-limitations-police/">interviewed an ex-police officer</a> who believed the danger of romance scams/ pig butchering is how it often leads to more serious forms of deception, and often spoke about the biggest hurdle being the perception of fraud, with many people not taking it as serious as, say, burglary. What is your opinion on how fraud is perceived in the UK? 



<p>So, as you’ll know, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> originate from Southeast Asia and this is an area where human trafficking is rife, because during COVID people with good computer skills were offered jobs and taken to scam compounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in some cases, it’s very cruel for both sides – even the name, ‘pig butchering’ and likening it to fattening up a pig for slaughter is just so repulsive.</p>



<p>However, it’s hard for me to think of the majority of romance fraudsters as victims. I’ve spoken to a couple of scammers and most of them are definitely not being trafficked. Sometimes it even becomes a racial issue. One scammer from Ghana told me it’s a way of getting back at the West for everything that’s happened to them over the centuries, which is a ridiculous excuse because he’s not putting the money into rebuilding parts of his home, he’s spending it on trainers and luxury goods.</p>



 Are there any anecdotes that have stuck with you and that you would like to share? 



<p>I’ve heard of people taking their own life, which you can understand if they’ve lost absolutely everything and are in the depths of depression. Some of the pig butchering scams, which leverage fake investment platforms are technologically very impressive. Regarding stories that have stuck with me, there was a lady who contacted me after seeing my Twitter and we spoke on the phone quickly after. She told me she had stage 4 cancer and had lost a fortune to this one guy. She knew that he was a fraudster; he’d admitted it, but she was still sending him money because she felt this bond with him. </p>



<blockquote><p>I remember her telling me that the only time her son will know what’s happened is when she dies, and he sees that he’s got no inheritance.</p> Becky Holmes, author of ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ </blockquote>



<p>I interviewed her, and then a few months later, as I was getting closer to submitting the book to the editors, I messaged her and asked if we could we meet up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She replied and told me she was in a hospice, but that she really wanted to stay strong for the book launch, and I told her don’t worry, we can talk about this another time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days later, I received a message from her Twitter account, and it was from her son saying his mum had passed away, but that he had seen our exchanges, and knew she had lost money. He wanted to know what on Earth had happened. I remember calling him at about 9pm one Friday night and explaining what had happened to his mum and where this money had gone. The saddest thing for me was how lovely her son was. He said how he wasn’t angry with his mum; he was just devastated that she hadn’t confided in him. It’s heartbreaking to think how many people don’t confide in family and friends when they will probably get the same understanding reaction. There is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about.</p>



 



 
 
 It’s a delicate balance to strike, between presenting this information in a relatable, digestible format, and in a way that undermines the danger and impact of romance fraud.  



 How did you decide the best way to set the tone in raising awareness of the scourge of romance fraud? 



<p>So, the feedback to the book has been exactly what I’d hoped it would be. People have said they’ve been able to digest it because it’s readable and funny, but I’ve also shared the victim stories, and explained what happens in some of the countries.</p>



<p>Humor to me is a really good way of bringing to life what can be quite a dry subject. Often when people talk about fraud, everyone in the room switches off, and so I think as long as it’s never seen as humor at the expense of the victims [which I’ve never been accused of], then it’s fine.</p>
 



 
  Becky Holmes, romance fraud vigilante  
 
 



<p></p>



 One thing that surprised me from researching for this interview you was the sheer number of ‘celebrity’ scams. This has never happened to me [yet!]. How common is it? 



<p>Well, I never received a message from a celebrity on a dating site, but Twitter and Instagram are crammed full of them. My book is called ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ because Keanu Reeves is not on any form of social media, and yet he is the most impersonated celebrity. Particularly on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something I always get asked is why anybody would send money to an apparent multi-millionaire. The fraudsters have come up with new ways of getting money from people under the guise of being a celebrity. One of the most common is that they will say they really want to meet the person, but their manager is a bit of a tyrant, and when the celebrity next comes to the UK, the manager wants to set up a series of meet and greets, all, of course, at a cost. Another effective approach is when they say that they are raising money for a charity. Then, even if you just send £10, you’re considered a viable target.</p>



 People exposing scams sometimes face repercussions. Do you ever fear for your safety? 



<p>I’ve had some death threats. Once, when a scammer asked me for money, I agreed and asked for him to send me his bank account details. Noticing it was registered in the United States, and obviously not his account, I contacted the bank and told them what it was being used for, and it was shut down. Obviously, as only a day had passed between him sharing his details with me and the account being closed, he knew it was my doing. So I received some horrific abuse and threats then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as I’ve spent so long researching this topic, I’m aware that a lot of these fraudsters are outside of the UK so have never been too concerned. Having said that, a lot of people will have links to the UK, so I never take my safety for granted.</p>



 How much do you hold these platforms accountable? Do you pass on the scammers’ details to relevant authorities, and how involved are you in the prosecution etc? Do you think enough is being done to crack down on this type of fraud? 



<p>Well, I mean certainly more could be done. It’s difficult, Jody, because a lot of the fraudsters are very technologically advanced and always seem to be one step ahead. I also hold the social media platforms accountable. In Nigeria, romance scammers are called the Yahoo Boys, and they even have their own Facebook group with almost 13,000 active members. Now I’ve reported the page, as have many other people, to Facebook, but it’s never been taken down. When the key word of the group is categorically associated with fraud, how is that allowed to stay up?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook should be 100% be held accountable. I think it’s outrageous. Twitter and Instagram are slightly better because they’re quite good at taking accounts down when they’re reported.&nbsp;However, all you need is for somebody to set up a new email address, and they’re straight back on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elon Musk removing the blue tick from Twitter is a fraudster’s dream. Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore. I obviously hold the fraudsters most accountable, but I do think the platforms have a duty to be looking at this more carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s pointless me pointing out Twitter profiles of people because they’ve been kicked off the platform before, and they don’t use their real names either. I’ve also been told by UK police that if a WhatsApp number, for example, is out of UK jurisdiction, there is pretty much nothing they can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>40% of all crime in this country is fraud, and yet police dedicate just 1% of resources to combat it,&nbsp;so, they’re not going to use that 1% trying to find somebody overseas.</p>



 Certain platforms, such as LinkedIn are experimenting with an identity verification step, although it is not yet a mandatory requirement. Perhaps because they do not want to alienate their customer base? 



<p>Yes, some dating platforms also require an identity verification step, where you have to wave your hand to show you’re a living person; however, what’s to stop a fraudster just doing that? So, more can be done, absolutely. I know the CEO of the <a href="https://theodda.org/">Online Dating &amp; Discovery Association</a>, and I do know that they take it very seriously, and steps are being taken. For example, if a fraudster is swiping right on every single woman’s profile in the hope that somebody connects, the ODDA will pick that up.</p>



 How much do you keep in contact with victims after they’ve messaged you? 



<p>I count three or four of them as friends now. A lot of these women that I speak to are people that I would naturally gravitate to. They are intelligent, interesting women, and people that I would like to be friends with, and they’re kind as well, and we could all do with some kind friends, couldn’t we?</p>



 Technology offers great opportunities to flag problematic behavior and identity users, thereby creating safer online environments, but it is also a double-edged sword. With the advent of AI-generated content like deepfakes, how optimistic are you regarding the future of romance fraud? 



<p>I fear for the future. A lot of romance fraudsters will pretend to be in the army or on an oil rig or a doctor or a surgeon working abroad, which they’ll use as an excuse for not being able to speak to somebody. This reluctance to video call can be a major red flag. But now, fraudsters will be able to transpose someone’s face over their own face and talk naturally. It’s terrifying.</p>

<p>But although MFA makes organizations – and their users – feel safe, cybercriminals are constantly evolving their technologies and practices to get around this additional layer of security. Some of these methods rely on driving <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/mfa-bombing-dismantled.html">MFA fatigue</a>, but others are more insidious and seek to bypass the protection offered by MFA altogether.

<p>While breaches targeting identity as the initial attack vector are on the rise, with increasing success and significant financial and reputational damage inflicted, IdPs are quickly becoming the attack vector of choice. Attackers maximize the payload by infiltrating the most critical system in your organization designed to secure access to all your company and customer data.</p>
<p>The Threat in Context</p>
<p>Once a user with access to the organization’s IdP is compromised through an account takeover (ATO) attack, detection becomes increasingly difficult. The attacker gains persistence within the network, infiltrating multiple critical systems and applications. This enables them to cause damage over long periods of time.</p>
<p>One such <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/657106/what-you-need-to-know-about-oktas-security-breach.html">attack recently compromised an IdP vendor</a> through their customer support systems. The attack supposedly took place when a customer support user was logged in to their personal Google account and stored their username and password for their service account within Chrome. The attacker had compromised the employee’s Google account, thus gaining access to the credentials to the customer support system. Once access to the support system was gained, the attacker then used session tokens and cookies stored in the HTTP Archive (HAR) files (which were used to troubleshoot issues with the IdP) to access the customer’s network and deploy ransomware and/or exfiltrate data.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mgm-resorts-hackers-broke-tricking-111102542.html">attack took place at a large entertainment and hospitality chain</a> when an attacker used social engineering to gain access to information about a high-value target (user with privileged access to critical systems including their IdP). The attacker then contacted the IT support helpdesk requesting a reset of the high-value user’s MFA credentials. They provided all the required verification information obtained through the social engineering attack, enabling them to install their own MFA authenticator. The attacker was able to establish persistence within the organization’s network, gaining access to critical systems.</p>
<p>Securing Access to IdPs and Taking a Layered Approach</p>
<p>These examples showcase the need to secure access to IdPs with high assurance authentication. Privileged and high-value users with access to critical systems must use a high assurance passwordless authentication mechanism such as X.509 certificate-based authentication (CBA) when authenticating themselves. Enforcing CBA for users as well as devices ensures that the user is not logging in to critical systems on an unmanaged device. By enforcing CBA and eliminating passwords, organizations can defend against common identity-based attacks such as phishing and MFA bypass targeted at their privileged users. In addition, taking a layered approach to security is recommended, with risk-based adaptive access that can evaluate contextual information to dynamically grant or block access based on risk levels when authenticating to an application or service.</p>
<p>As we saw with the attack on the large entertainment and hospitality chain, protecting against these attacks during authentication is not enough; the processes of user registration or password/MFA reset requests must also be secure. By implementing identity proofing through identity verification of physical credentials such as passports and driver’s licenses, organizations enhance their security protocols. This is particularly valuable in processes such as resetting MFA credentials, registering or onboarding new users, or implementing step-up authentication for out-of-policy users or high-value transactions. By adopting these measures, organizations can further protect their critical systems and their existing IdP.</p>
<p>In addition to the above steps, organizations with on-premises environments can also secure their IdP with the use of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/use-case/why-use-an-hsm">hardware security modules (HSM)</a> that provide enhanced security for securely storing keys, secrets, and tokens.</p>

<p>Modern card issuance operations have embraced advanced technology, replacing outdated manual methods like clipboard monitoring. Today, operators and managers no longer jot down notes as they walk the floor; instead, they use digital platforms. Alerts, achievements, and operational details are instantly communicated across locations, giving operations executives real-time data to monitor machine performance and critical issues without leaving their offices. The shift to automated data analysis allows operators and technicians to access information from tablets anytime, anywhere, ending the need for manual charting. Additionally, aggregated machine intelligence provides a comprehensive view of plant productivity and cost-effectiveness in real time across multiple sites for an entire corporation.</p>
<p>These advancements are commonplace today, as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/industry-4-0/what-is-industry-4-0.html">Industry 4.0</a> cements itself in manufacturing history. It’s no surprise that digital intelligence brings increased efficiency and ROI opportunities to the forefront of smart card manufacturing. The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/adaptive-issuance-production-analytics-solution">Entrust Adaptive Issuance™ Production Analytics Solution</a> is a software and technical consulting platform built on delivering this value proposition to card personalization operations through a customizable, real-time, aggregated architecture. It continues to drive next-generation smart manufacturing, bringing positive Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and enhanced value to operations. OEE is expressed as a percentage sum of three key production indicators: availability, performance, and quality. Let us take a closer look at each and how they bring a deeper understanding to issuance environments, focusing on net losses:</p>
 
 Availability 
 
 Availability is the percentage of planned production time the operation is available to run. It is the ratio of Run Time to Planned Production Time and considers loss, which includes events that stop planned production. Run Time is defined as the total time when machines are used for production in a running state, excluding idle and pause. Planned Production Time is defined as the total calendar time for the measurement period minus planned downtime, such as maintenance tasks, changeover, holidays, and shift breaks. Availability Loss includes any unplanned stops such as idle time, equipment failure or material shortage, and planned stops as noted above. 
 
 Performance 
 
 Performance percentage is the actual total production output compared to theoretical perfect production output, which is calculated using the machine’s maximum cycle speed. A perfect performance score would mean machines are always running at maximum speed when active. Total Production is defined as the total number of cards processed, which includes both good and rejected cards. Maximum Machine Throughput is defined as the maximum machine speed in cards per hour, also considering that throughput could be reduced based on the total number of modules used. Performance Loss includes anything that causes the manufacturing process to run at less than the maximum possible speed when it is running. Examples of things that create Performance Loss include machine wear, inferior materials, line misfeeds, and jams. 
 
 Quality 
 
 Quality is the number of good units produced as a percentage of the total units started. A perfect quality score indicates that all products are good: successfully manufactured the first time, and no rejects were produced. Simply and more realistically, total production equals good production + rejected production. Quality Loss accounts for manufactured parts that do not meet quality standards as defined by the operation. Examples of Quality Loss include scrap and rework. 
<p>Net Losses</p>
<p>Net Losses for all three production indicators can be explored further here from <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-factors/">Vorne</a> as variations in issuance type, facilities, and machines contribute to loss variability. <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-six-big-losses/">The Six Big Losses</a> are also common in issuance operations and include: unplanned and planned stops, small stops, slow cycles, production rejects, and startup rejects.</p>

<p>The Future of Digital Intelligence and Production Analytics</p>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are expected to revolutionize the industry further. These technologies will be integral in production planning, inventory management, resource planning, and cost analysis. Next-generation Industry 4.0 subject matter experts will take the output from these technologies and use it to make improvements across operational architectures, building more efficiency into the process. Digital intelligence can be used to mitigate operational bottlenecks, quality gaps, and overall line inefficiencies by focusing on the three key production indicators.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Note: This episode isn’t an introduction to DIDs; for those new to the concept, we recommend revisiting <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/decentralized-identifiers-did-methods-did-documents-did-resolution/">Episode 52</a> of the SSI Orbit Podcast for a foundational understanding.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode, we dive deeper into the world of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), moving beyond the basics to explore the critical aspects that will influence their trust and adoption.</p>
<p>Today, joined by Marcus, we embark on a detailed discussion framed around a SWOT analysis of DIDs, examining their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive conversation that not only highlights the significant advantages of DIDs but also addresses the challenges and potential pathways to their widespread acceptance. We delve into the nuances of DIDs, aiming to contribute to the broader goal of promoting their adoption.</p>
<p>We aimed to follow the SWOT model, though it proved challenging at times due to the nuanced nature of many topics. Interestingly, what some may perceive as a strength could also be seen as a weakness, leading to a blend of perspectives. This complexity added depth to our discussion, making it particularly engaging!</p>

 Terminology 
<p>Digital Identity: An amorphous concept attempting the impossible job of capturing all that a human is in digital form, leading to many years of disappointing national projects and draft bills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID: A single attribute or fact about an entity, represented digitally, that is relevant in one or more specific contexts.</p>
 A big little shift in terminology&nbsp; 
<p>The draft Australian federal <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say/2023-digital-id-bill-and-rules-submissions">Digital ID Bill</a> no longer uses the phrase “digital identity”. The same shift in language has been made by the <a href="https://nab.com.au">National Australia Bank</a> (NAB) in its year-long <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/digital-id-trust-who-you-choose-and-choose-who-you-trust/">multi-sector design collaboration</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the NAB and the Australian government now refer to Digital ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change is much more than semantics. I hope it reflects a recognition by government that identification is different from identity, and there is no universal way of identifying people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAB has highlighted that businesses and agencies are usually less interested in verifying “identity” than a particular attribute or eligibility. The bank’s <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NAB-Digital-Identity-Roundtable.pdf">roundtable report</a> states “it is very rare that individuals need to prove who they are” and instead suggests a reframing of digital identity around “what do we need to know about an individual for a particular purpose”; that is, the process of identification in all its local variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what does Digital ID mean? Well, it’s just shorthand for a credential in a certain context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reckon everyone knows what it means to be asked to “show some ID”.&nbsp; We effortlessly interpret “ID” in context, whether it’s proof of age at a bar, a student card when sitting an exam, or an employee ID when entering the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also familiar with the formal identification process carried out when opening a bank account or starting a new job. In these cases, we are generally asked to provide a number of IDs, from a pretty universal set of options including driver licence, birth certificate, Medicare card, passport and so on. And there are alternative forms of ID for people who need them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Fresh thinking; new precision 
<p>None of these IDs constitute our identity. And that’s how we like it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a rule, we should ask for and reveal as little personal information as possible, within the requirements of the transaction we’re doing. As the Canadian digital identity leader <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/less-identity-65f65d87f56b">Tim Bouma once said</a>, “I want my identity to be less than the real me”.</p>
<p>Digital ID is concrete, specific and familiar. But “digital identity” is abstract and open-ended. It means different things to different people. Invariably, digital identity is interpreted as a new universal means of proving who we are. But there is no such thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So instead of imposing new identification standards and novel “digital identity” on Australians, the Digital ID Bill simply creates a governance regime to improve the quality and reliability of existing IDs when converted to digital form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) will conserve the meaning of existing IDs and leave businesses and agencies free to conduct identification as they see fit. The Digital ID regulator is being tasked to create rules and technology standards, with a view to fostering a marketplace of vastly improved digitised IDs.&nbsp;</p>
 Best in class 
<p>I believe the AGDIS represents world’s best practice in digital identification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AGDIS rules (to be developed after the Bill is enacted) will almost certainly embrace mobile phone digital wallets as carriers of Digital IDs. A large and fast-growing proportion of Australians are now familiar with using their payment cards in mobile wallets to “tap and pay” and “click to pay” (the Reserve Bank reports that <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2023/the-evolving-retail-payments-landscape.html">35% of card payments are now made via mobile wallets</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The equivalent user experience of click-to-present any digital ID in context will be intuitive, widely available and vastly more secure than today’s plaintext handling of personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be able to prove relevant facts about ourselves with the same security, safety and privacy as we prove our credit card details.&nbsp;</p>
 We’ve done this before 
<p>Smart payment cards (EMV chip cards) were introduced to replace magnetic stripe cards as they became vulnerable to skimming and counterfeiting. Chip-assisted presentation of cardholder IDs replaced the plaintext of a mag stripe and, as a result, essentially eradicated physical card fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the speed with which smart credit card IDs cut payment fraud, we can expect mobile technology Digital IDs to dramatically reduce identity crime via stolen personal data and, as a result, neutralise the personal data black market. </p>

 The modern work environment creates situations unthinkable a decade ago. Today, many employees will never step foot in an office or have face-to-face interactions with colleagues. While this flexible work model offers advantages for businesses as well as employees, it also presents significant security challenges, especially when it comes to reliable identity verification.

<p>The modern work environment creates situations unthinkable a decade ago. Today, many employees will never step foot in an office or have face-to-face interactions with colleagues. While this flexible work model offers advantages for businesses as well as employees, it also presents significant security challenges, especially when it comes to reliable <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-verification">identity verification</a>.</p>  
<p>Employee identity risk and fraud have skyrocketed in recent years. The <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI recently warned</a> that fraudulent job applicants are using deepfakes and stolen PII to obtain remote work positions. “Bait-and-switch” schemes are also on the rise, where the person interviewed by a company is not the person who is actually hired. In the best case, companies end up hiring someone completely unsuitable for the position. In the worst case, they onboard and provide access to cybercriminals who can install malware, steal confidential and privileged information, and more.</p> 
<p>The risks go far beyond hiring and onboarding. Just this week, a multinational finance firm revealed that an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">employee was tricked into making a $25 million wire transfer</a> by deepfake video and audio. The thieves used AI-generated likenesses&nbsp; of the company’s CFO and other known colleagues in a live video conference with the finance worker.</p> 
<p>Know Your Employee (KYE) ensures that your employees are who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is Know Your Employee (KYE)?  
<p>Know Your Employee, commonly abbreviated as KYE, is the process of verifying the identities and backgrounds of an organization’s current workforce and prospective new employees. KYE aims to ensure that employees are who they claim to be, and do not have a criminal background that poses an undue risk.</p> 
<p>The KYE - Know Your Employee process continues past initial hiring and onboarding. Effective KYE involves continuous monitoring and regularly updating and reviewing employee information to identify any potential risks that may arise.</p> 
 KYE vs. KYC  
<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Employee (KYE) are two essential processes in the realm of compliance and risk management. KYC verifies customer identities to determine if they are who they claim to be and discover any potential risks, ensuring adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulations. In contrast, KYE involves verification of employee identities and thorough background checks to reduce the risk of employee fraud and theft, and address internal compliance needs.</p> 
<p>Both KYC and KYE share the common goal of mitigating risks, upholding legal standards and preventing fraud. The main distinction is in their focus: KYC is customer-oriented, while KYE centers on internal workforce dynamics. KYC is a point in time process, while KYE should be a continuous process, throughout an employee’s tenure. Integrating both processes is crucial for a comprehensive risk management framework in business.</p> 
 The Growing Importance of Know Your Employee (KYE)  
<p>Identity verification poses an ongoing challenge for organizations. In fact, 40% of IT security experts named it a top identity security challenge in the <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-workplace-identity-security-trends-2024">2024 Workplace Identity Security Trends report</a>. This is likely to climb as new attack and fraud tactics make accurate <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">identity proofing</a> and verification increasingly difficult. A recent report by Onfido found a 3000% increase in deepfake attempts in 2023, thanks to face-swapping apps, generative AI and other readily available fraud tools.</p> 
<p>The risks go far beyond non-compliance. Employee fraud tactics such as interview fraud, bait-and-switch scenarios, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/employee-fraud-how-companies-can-spot-employees-outsourcing-their-jobs-2022-8">unauthorized outsourcing</a>, mean that the person doing the work may not be the person you interviewed or hired. This creates massive security risks for organizations.</p> 
<p>Moreover, identity risks persist throughout the employee lifecycle – not just at hiring and onboarding. The recent breach of MGM resorts succeeded because attackers were able to impersonate an employee and convince the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. Robust, continuous KYE processes could have prevented the attack. In this evolving landscape, a comprehensive KYE strategy is crucial for organizations to stay ahead of emerging threats, ensuring the integrity of their workforce and safeguarding against potential malicious activities.</p> 
 Tips for Implementing Know Your Employee (KYE)  
<p>While every organization will approach KYE differently depending on their specific needs and structure, there are basic principles that hold across all workplaces.</p> 
 Employ Multiple KYE Verification Methods  
<p>A thorough KYE approach requires layering multiple verification methods — which ones, and when to invoke them, will depend on the risk level of the employee verification scenario as well as organizational and environmental risks at play. Verification methods include document verification, facial biometric verification, live video, chat verification, as well as passive signals such as device/endpoint and location detection.</p> 
<p>As we’ve seen, identity fraud techniques evolve rapidly — it’s critical that your KYE methods keep up. A robust KYE strategy should incorporate advanced technologies such as liveness detection to detect deepfakes and other AI-aided fraud.</p> 
 Make It Easy for Your Admins and Employees  
<p>It’s human nature to circumvent processes that add an unreasonable burden. When done well, KYE - Know Your Employee processes should be fast and easy for both employees and administrators alike. This means automating processes as much as possible, requiring the right level of identity verification for the scenario, and using technologies that people are familiar with, like their smartphones. Of course security cannot be sacrificed for usability.</p> 
 Continuously Monitor for Risk  
<p>Employee identity risks do not end with secure onboarding. Higher risk scenarios arise throughout an employee’s career. Resetting credentials, getting a new phone, logging in from unknown locations, gaining increased access privileges, personal financial problems, active cyberattacks — all can be situations of elevated risk. Your KYE controls should be ready to address these, taking specific measures according to risk level.&nbsp;</p> 
 Don’t Operate in a Silo  
<p>It’s critical that your KYE processes and tools are connected and synchronized to your <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">workforce identity security</a> systems and HR system of record. The users accessing digital services may differ from the identities that IT believes they have. In other words, the digital identity may not match the real world identity. Your employee onboarding and identity verification procedures should be directly tied to your authentication processes, ideally using phishing-resistant, passwordless methods. As mentioned, it’s also important to invoke re-verification at certain times of increased risk. This means connecting your identity risk monitoring to your Know Your Employee (KYE) systems.</p> 
 Keep Up With Current Regulations and Compliance  
<p>In the current regulatory landscape, it's not just ethical but imperative for businesses across various industries to comply with applicable statutes and standards. The incorporation of a robust "Know Your Employee" (KYE) process is a key aspect of this compliance. These checks are vital for verifying credentials, ensuring workforce integrity, and meeting legal obligations.</p> 
<p>The consequences of non-compliance are severe, underlining the indispensability of KYE in any organization's overall compliance strategy. For example, a comprehensive KYE process is vital for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance, helping identify potential risks and preventing misuse of the financial system.</p>

 FAQs  
<p>Q: What is Know Your Employee (KYE)?</p> 
<p>A: Know Your Employee is the process of verifying the identities of an organization’s workforce to make sure that they are who they say they are, and that they do not pose a risk to the company.</p> 
<p>Q: Why is KYE important?</p> 
<p>A: KYE ensures that you do not hire a fraudulent candidate and that only legitimate employees can access company data and resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Q: What are examples of real situations where it’s important to apply KYE processes?</p> 
<p>A: KYE should be applied through the employee lifecycle, beginning with their first interactions with your company. This includes interviewing, at onboarding, at times of high-risk transactions, and other moments that bring an increased risk of fraud or attack.</p> 
<p>Q: What is HYPR Affirm, and how does it facilitate know your employee (KYE)?</p> 
<p>A: HYPR Affirm is tailored toward workforce identity verification requirements. It utilizes multiple identity proofing and verification methods, such as advanced biometrics and liveness detection, to guarantee that only authorized individuals can access corporate systems and data.</p>

<p>Holochain provides blockchains with auditable applications that can be tied to on-chain transactions, opening new possibilities for NFTs, DAO communities, and more.</p> Binding Wallets to Holochain Apps <p>We’ve developed a proof of concept for binding together Holochain agent keys with public keys on blockchains. Holochain uses a system of source chain validation to ensure that any action taken in an application is auditable, creating a secure environment for most application needs. By binding a Holochain agent with a public key in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), data created by the Holochain agent can be associated with the EVM key. This setup allows for unforgeable and bidirectional verifiability, facilitating provenance confirmation on both Ethereum and Holochain.</p> Validated Content for NFTs  <p>Rather than storing NFT payloads in unvalidated and/or centralized storage, with Holochain you can create and validate the payload and the reference for an NFT fully within a distributed context. The demo below shows that you can also manage the minting and transfer of the NFT from a Holochain app precisely because you can first bind your wallet to your Holochain agent. By storing payloads for NFTs in Holochain, you can circumnavigate the storage limits of blockchain, providing a more validated and ultimately more dynamic solution than other current implementations like IPFS. </p> Notaries and Oracles <p>Combining patterns from oracles and notaries with agent binding on Holochain opens up new ways to move between peer-to-peer systems via “cross-chain” proofs. </p><p>Smart contracts pre-authorize the public keys of agents from whom they will accept proofs. The proofs are signed verifications that reference actions or decisions taken in Holochain, all of which are also transparent and verifiable by any member of the application. This enables scalable but still verifiable sensemaking. </p><p>An example of how this could be used is with DAOs. Large scale voting on-chain is costly, both in gas fees and network traffic. But a voting app on Holochain can provide the trust and transparency of blockchain without the gas fees, and then the fully verifiable decision can be notarized creating a proof which is used to make a single on-chain transaction. The cost savings to both individual DAO members and the organization as a whole are potentially immense. This also provides greater flexibility as DAO’s can now afford to conduct all of their business in validated environments.</p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">Explore other benefits Holochain brings to DAOs. </a></p> Data Storage  <p>Given the two examples above, you can see that what Holochain provides to blockchains is validated data storage. While the examples given talk about two major concerns for current blockchain development, you can store or interact with any data you choose to program into an application. Holochain is an incredibly flexible framework — the validation rules of each application can be customized based on the security and design needs of a particular use case. The combination of energy and cost efficiency, auditability, and flexibility makes Holochain a perfect choice for applications that need to interface with blockchain.</p><p>Plus, it’s all coded in Rust — with UIs using your favorite JavaScript framework — making it even easier for Ethereum devs to use and build with.</p> Learn More and Connect <p>Learn how Holochain can <a href="https://bit.ly/holochain-web3?ref=blog.holochain.org">extend Web3</a>, and get involved by introducing yourself to our team and community on <a href="https://bit.ly/A-New-Link-in-Web3-DEV-HC?ref=blog.holochain.org">Discord</a> or by joining one of our <a href="https://bit.ly/holochain-events?ref=blog.holochain.org">upcoming events</a>.</p>

<p>New technology is tough to explain sometimes. But Holochain isn’t reinventing the wheel. Rather, we are inventing the bicycle when all you have ever seen or used are wagons. </p><p>Holochain is built from familiar technical components and best practices, just as a bicycle is built from wheels, gears, frames, and steering mechanisms which all previously existed as basic forms or principles in other contexts. </p>Sum&gt;Parts: The key components of Holochain already existed, but we put them on a new frame<p>Our back wheel is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table?ref=blog.holochain.org">Distributed Hash Table</a>, similar to the ones used by <a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">BitTorrent</a> or <a href="https://ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">IPFS</a> to revolutionize peer-to-peer file sharing. This is the database structure that allows data to be transferred in the context of a distributed app.</p><p>Our front wheel is built on a lot of the same principles as <a href="https://git-scm.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Git</a> which pioneered <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/?ref=blog.holochain.org">local-first</a> version control as we know it today. While our local-first tools are built out of slightly different materials, the principle remains: Agents can always make local changes which then update the network when connected online. Not dissimilar to how the front wheel determines the direction of the bike. </p><p>These wheels are powered by a familiar device, the bike chain. Holochain’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/?ref=blog.holochain.org">source chain</a> uses an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain?ref=blog.holochain.org">hashchains</a>, which were popularized by blockchains, to connect one action to the next, every action containing the hash of the last. Each agent has their own bike and so they each update their own source chain, independent of the actions of other cyclists. This provides mobility compared to the wide wagon of a single central chain. The beauty of bikes is their independence, the ability to act without everyone needing to be in the same wagon. </p><p>The handlebars that steer this contraption are also familiar. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography?ref=blog.holochain.org">Public/private key cryptography</a> used for cryptographic signatures is a staple of most processes on the web, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS?ref=blog.holochain.org">HTTPS</a>, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol?ref=blog.holochain.org">Signal Protocol</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell?ref=blog.holochain.org">SSH</a> which is used by devs everywhere to access remote machines. Alongside encryption, these keys <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate?ref=blog.holochain.org">act as the identity tools</a> which connect the user, the human riding the bike, to their actions on the digital road. Every action they take is signed, controlled through those handlebars, and only the rider is able to steer. </p><p>Holochain pulls together all of these time tested tools and reconfigures them to do something none of them can do alone. </p><p>We’ve been talking about Holochain from the perspective of the agent — the rider and their bike. But Holochain is an application framework. In this analogy, every application is a unique path that controls where a rider can go, what actions can be taken, and how data is formatted. We talk about this from the perspective of the rider because they get to determine which paths they ride. Riders bridge between paths, connecting them into personalized neighborhoods. Each new app increases the area that the rider can travel and grows an ecosystem of potential routes. Different paths take you to different places, but Holochain lets you move between them seamlessly. </p><p>The affordances of each road dictate what can be done on it. Wide roads let many ride together, small curvy paths mean you slow down, etc. In the same way, the application rules are baked in. Changing them would be the same as changing roads. </p><p>As a framework for peer-to-peer applications, Holochain is taking on some of the toughest challenges of distributed computing. Ensuring data is validated and secure without central servers, allowing for asynchronous action across a network, and keeping agents honest, are all hard tasks. But each individual piece of this puzzle already exists, we are just recombining them to offer new possibilities. </p><p>Holochain is built to allow any group to come together, develop a bike path, and each with their own bike traveling at their own pace, ride the path together. Many different bike paths can overlap and intersect, and riders get to choose their route through them — traveling freely and at their own will.</p>

  ESMA’s latest guidelines clarify that non-EU crypto firms can only serve EU residents when they request it&nbsp;first.  It prohibits crypto firms from providing any additional services unrelated to the initial request from their EU&nbsp;clients.  The draft guidelines seek to thwart any attempts by third-country firms to bypass the rules while also encouraging stakeholders to provide feedback to improve ESMA’s approach.  <p>Recently, the European Securities and Markets Authority <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA35-1872330276-1619_Consultation_Paper_on_the_draft_guidelines_on_reverse_solicitation_under_MiCA.pdf">published a consultation paper</a> discussing the draft guidelines on reverse solicitation <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">under MiCA</a>. Here, reverse solicitation refers to a situation where third-country firms solicit clients in the European Union, directly or indirectly.</p><p>The ESMA’s main purpose with these guidelines is to specify when third-country firms can offer crypto services to EU clients and to prevent firms from circumventing the reverse solicitation rule.</p><p>The agency also aims for these guidelines to be consistent, efficient, and effective when rolled out for implementation. For that, ESMA has urged all stakeholders, including crypto-asset service providers (including from third countries) and financial entities dealing with crypto-assets, to respond to this consultation paper.</p><p>Responses should address the questions asked, provide explanations, and suggest alternative options for the ESMA to consider.</p> When are Non-EU Crypto Firms Allowed to Offer Services to EU Residents? <p>The latest ESMA guidelines say that non-EU crypto firms can provide their services to EU residents only when they request it. However, after the initial contact, the firm can’t offer more cryptocurrencies or related services unless they are related to what the client asked for in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Instructions for Relevant National Regulators <p>To ensure an interaction is genuinely initiated by the EU-based client, the guideline suggests regulators look at how and when the client approached the firm. Was it truly on their own, without any nudges from ads or&nbsp;emails?</p><p>The draft guidelines also provide instructions to national agencies on how to decide if a third-country firm is marketing a new kind of crypto asset or service. They suggest that national authorities look at two&nbsp;things:</p>  The type of crypto asset or service being&nbsp;offered.  The risks involved with the new crypto asset or&nbsp;service.  <p>It also notes that MiCA only mentions three crypto asset types (asset-referenced tokens, electronic money tokens, and tokens that don’t fall into these categories), and such broad categories might enable third-country firms to <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/navigating-regulatory-challenges-mica-and-the-defi-landscape">circumvent the rules</a>. So, ESMA urges relevant national authorities through these guidelines to:</p>  Monitor the marketing efforts that third-country firms deploy in targeting EU-based&nbsp;clients.  Conduct relevant consumer&nbsp;surveys.  Keep a tab on clients’ complaints and whistleblowing.  Cooperate with authorities, including law enforcement, as and when required.   Concluding Thoughts <p>Overall, the draft guidelines offer insights and guidance on when third-country firms can approach clients in the EU and provide strategies for detecting any attempts to bypass these rules. And since it’s a consultation paper, stakeholders are invited to share their feedback on ESMA’s approach, identifying any potential gaps or effectiveness concerns. Responses are accepted until April 29,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>One way to understand governance as a component of decentralized identity is to look at identity verification and data sharing as an “ecosystem.”</p>
<p>An ecosystem is any use case where you have:</p>
 
 One or more parties issuing verifiable credentials for digital identity to people, organizations, or devices. 
 People, organizations, or devices who then hold the credentials to prove their identity and share data within the credential to other parties. 
 People, organizations, or devices, that need to prove the identity of those presenting verifiable credentials, and the data within their credentials to accomplish some goal. 
 
<p>In an ecosystem, participants are interested in the same kind of data to solve the same kind of problems. This could be who is allowed to access a facility, an operational system, a software application.</p>
<p>Governance makes this happen.</p>
<p>The governance authority establishes who can issue credentials. If there is only one issuer, say in the case of a company issuing employee credentials, the company is the governance authority.</p>
<p>The authority establishes:</p>
 
 who can be issued a credential. 
 who else can issue credentials 
 What information is going to be issued in a credential. 
 How that information is to be interpreted — if x, then y 
 How that information can be shared in ways to comply with data privacy regulations. 
 
<p>While there are other technical aspects to governance (choosing credential formats, DID methods, protocols, cryptographic key management etc), the key governance actions can be reduced to two workflows:</p>
 
 Which credentials can I trust? 
 What data needs to be presented and authenticated and how does it need to be presented? 
 
<p>These questions are solved by machine-readable governance. The governance authority publishes a file in a format that can be read by the software required and held by each participant in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Once you have an ecosystem for a specific use case, you can extend the governance to other use cases, depending on how robustly you have authenticated the person, organization or device that you issued the credential to.</p>
<p>Governance would enable a credential issued to an employee to access a hospital to also access a specific database or device. Governance could allow this credential to be used as a proof of identity for specific organizations that provide employee benefits. So you’ve gone, just through a simple addition of code, from opening a door to opening an insurance policy.</p>
<p>Two different hospital systems could agree and use machine readable governance to authorize doctors in one system to work in another.</p>
<p>The fact that these rules can be rendered in a machine-readable format makes implementation and updating fast and simple. You can rapidly reconfigure your ecosystem to manage new data and requirements.</p>
<p>And once you are able to use verifiable identity and data, the permutations are limitless. Governance makes all these permutations work and enables expansion and scale.</p>
<p>It turns trust into an actionable, valuable commodity.</p>

<p>Everywhere you turn, it seems there’s a new process, a new technology, and a new consumer preference that is “going digital.” More and more cardholders around the globe are preferring, and expecting, a digital-first payment experience. Because of the technology behind it all, IT professionals are at the center of this digital transformation. The pandemic accelerated an awareness of and migration to contactless and digital payments, and the payments ecosystem is now one of the fastest movers when it comes to digitization.</p>
<p><a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic?_ga=2.95126300.1605869982.1705256759-491805133.1665679376&amp;_gl=1*hc75j8*_ga*NDkxODA1MTMzLjE2NjU2NzkzNzY.*_ga_6QRW66BW5T*MTcwNTI1NjM1MS42MzQuMS4xNzA1MjU2Nzc0LjQ0LjAuMA..">51% of U.S. cardholders</a> state that their mobile banking app is their preferred method to engage with their financial institution. This data shows us that customers are looking for seamless, digital-first payment and card management experiences. With that data guiding us, it’s clear an elevated and enriched issuance and payment enablement process is now the gold standard to meet the demand of cardholders.</p>
<p>Bridging Physical and Digital Experiences for Cardholders</p>
<p>That gold standard experience – providing a compelling, seamless digital card and payment experience – can help a bank to achieve <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/maintain-your-top-of-wallet-status-with-advanced-card-controls/">top-of-wallet status</a>. We learned in a <a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic?_ga=2.95126300.1605869982.1705256759-491805133.1665679376&amp;_gl=1*hc75j8*_ga*NDkxODA1MTMzLjE2NjU2NzkzNzY.*_ga_6QRW66BW5T*MTcwNTI1NjM1MS42MzQuMS4xNzA1MjU2Nzc0LjQ0LjAuMA..">recent survey</a> among 1,000 U.S. cardholders that digital card controls in the banking app make the cardholder more likely to use the card as a default payment method. This has led to some banks going all-in with fully featured, integrated digital card solutions. Others, especially small to midsize banks, have asked their IT teams to implement some fundamental digital features as building blocks to their digital card platform – a foundation that can be enhanced and expanded by partnering with a digital card solution provider to offer cardholders a truly digital-first payment experience.</p>
<p>But financial institutions have different challenges when it comes to enabling intuitive yet secure digital payment options for their cardholders. The building blocks themselves, like choosing the right digital features, knowing which features are most requested by cardholders, and meeting the demands of different demographic groups, can be challenging to organize and understand. Similarly, it’s important to consider a solution that is scalable and future-proof to ensure the biggest ROI. Most IT teams have heavy resource constraints with a multitude of existing projects. Smaller financial institutions may find it difficult to build out their own digital card solution, while bigger institutions will think closely about the existing infrastructure in place. For example, by leveraging what they’ve already put in place and partnering with Entrust, a financial institutions’ IT team can answer the need for an even more digital and seamless customer experience.</p>
<p>Simplifying Digital Card Implementation</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/entrust-digital-card-solution">The Entrust Digital Card Solution</a> is a single mobile software development kit (SDK) that’s easy to implement and opens a world of possibilities. The entire menu of capabilities becomes immediately available, but with the flexibility and scalability to pick and choose the right configuration for your customers at that point in time, adding more capabilities seamlessly as the organization’s payments enablement strategy evolves.</p>
<p>This innovative strategy shifts an IT team’s highly complex digital-first strategy to a unified and simplified integration for digital payments enablement. Our SDK or web service integration aims to create faster time to value with minimal intervention on behalf of IT. Our implementation helps IT teams overcome common challenges like internal resources among small departments, total cost of ownership across multiple features, and time to market.</p>
<p>Choosing a solution developed by experts focused on the digital card makes adding new integrations for the cardholder a much smoother, less time-intensive process. Ultimately, these specific capabilities enable IT teams to focus on mission-critical initiatives while promoting a fully integrated digital card solution.</p>

<p>As digital transformation accelerates across industries, technology thought leader Philip Sheldrake brings an urgent yet nuanced perspective on constructing digital identity systems centered on human needs.</p><p>With a perspective spanning engineering, computer science, and involvement in decentralized projects, Sheldrake understands the intricacies of designing digital ecosystems.</p><p>However, through his interdisciplinary lens, he sees profound gaps in how identity gets formulated in computational realms versus lived human experience.</p><p>In the same way that the internet has brought a series of helpful technological advancements, it’s also brought unintended consequences.</p><p>For Sheldrake, identity may be the premier challenge to align digital progress with human flourishing rather than harm.</p><p>By drawing out insights from his expertise in bridging social and computer sciences, this article explores the past, present, and most hopeful future pathways for digital identity.</p> Understanding and Describing Identity <p>Even defining digital identity proves slippery, as technologist Philip Sheldrake explains:</p><p></p><blockquote>“It’s so difficult to actually even describe the space we're about to talk about. It's astonishing how few words have real meaning in this space.”</blockquote><p></p><p>Identity intersects technology, business, government, philosophy, culture, and our personal lives. Thus, no singular perspective captures its complexity.</p><p>Sheldrake notes, “There are just a few throwaway phrases that just mislead people because they're so ubiquitous, they hardly mean anything anymore.”&nbsp;</p><p>Concepts like innovation, transformation, and disruption get used to the point of losing meaning. Making progress requires bridging disconnected outlooks. For example, social scientists and computer programmers use distinctive language and assumptions, often talking past each other. Successful digital systems blend these varied perspectives and provide enough interdisciplinary expertise to clarify complexity.</p><p>Sheldrake brings decades of experience working across domains, from helping launch open source browser Firefox to involvement with Ethereum and decentralized technology projects. He sees identity as the crux where technology and humanity meet — for better or worse:</p><p></p><blockquote>“I am obsessed with the potential for digital technologies to lend a hand in human flourishing. Except that, so far, the experiment of the digital has thrown up as many negative externalities… as positive. Little things, you know, like undermining democracy.”</blockquote><p></p><p>The alluring promise of technology remains unfulfilled until we construct frameworks elevating both computer science innovations and social scientific understandings of identity.</p> Technology Changes Identity Dynamics Over Time <p>While databases and algorithms remain constant, the societal outcomes and experiences with digital systems transform remarkably across months and years. Sheldrake explains how innovations go through a “series of phases” regarding consequences as usage patterns and cultural incorporation structurally mature.</p><p>In the early days of social media, few guard rails for behavior existed, enabling exploratory identity play. Yet, as digital engagement became mobile and pervasive, external constraints tightened. Structures accreted, along with probabilities of harm.</p><p>Sheldrake gives the example of shifting sentiment around decentralized technology projects like blockchain. Initial optimism about democratization gave way to backlash concerning crypto’s environmental impacts. This reveals less about the fundamentals of blockchain itself changing and more about the emergence of unintended externalities at scale.</p> Contrasting Views on Identity <p>There are fundamentally different perspectives on identity in computer science and social science. Sheldrake points out, “In computer science...nothing is addressable in internetworking until it has an entity and identifier.”&nbsp;</p><p>Rigid constructs like legal identities and cryptographic claims of personhood dominate programming approaches.</p><p>Meanwhile, in sociology and psychology, “identity is a sense-making capacity...a process, it’s a verb.” Human identity lives between people and contexts, ever-negotiated through information exchange. Instead of static entities, constantly co-created meaning flows.</p><p>Sheldrake argues the clash stems from differing historical customers driving innovation, noting “the first customers of IT were large corporations and governments...IT served the bureaucracy, it was the definition of bureaucracy.”</p><p>Thus, digitization elevated standardized legal identities for taxation and service provision — not the nuanced, fluid identities enlivening human relationships outside institutional walls. Much gets lost in translation.</p> The Path Forward Requires New Perspectives <p>Progress on digital identity relies on transcending entrenched disciplinary silos to enable genuine dialogue and collective innovation. While compromising on decentralized principles proves difficult, rigidly decentralized systems similarly risk harm without weighing human needs.</p><p>Sheldrake argues identity resides in “getting social science and computer science and the humanities, kind of riffing off each other's best strengths, rather than allowing computer science to riff off its worst weaknesses.” No single expertise holds the answers alone.</p><p>He continues: “One of my mentors mentioned to me, the beginning of the 90s, the 20th century was all about disciplinary excellence, the 21st century will all be about the interdisciplinary or even the transdisciplinary, trying to fill in the gaps between the disciplinary knowledge.”</p><p>To sufficiently fill those gaps, technologies like <a href="https://www.holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> aim to bring individual sovereignty and collective capacity. While there isn’t a perfect formula for identity, the next wave of innovators can learn from how it’s translated digitally.&nbsp;</p>

   Zero Trust security models call for the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized users may access protected IT resources. Many organizations are adopting MFA to add a layer of security for remote workers. Customer-facing organizations are also implementing MFA to mitigate identity-based attacks, such as phishing, and to help quash the rise in account takeover fraud.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been compromised credentials — in other words, the use of stolen passwords. MFA renders the use of stolen credentials futile, as attackers are highly unlikely to have access to a user's other authentication factors, such as a mobile phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks">Microsoft</a> has stated that using MFA may stop 99% of password-related attacks within an enterprise, so an increasing number of enterprises have begun to require MFA before granting account access. That's the good news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bad news is that attackers are now evolving their tactics for bypassing MFA - and are finding some success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many organizations encourage using MFA for threat protection, but relying on users to approve authentication requests manually is now riskier than ever due to tactics such as MFA Bombing. </p>

<p>Considering a decentralized identity (DI) solution? Is this your wish list:<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to deploy DI capabilities in the simplest way possible.<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to focus on your core business while leaving others to do the detailed technical work of deploying your DI solution.<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to deploy your DI solution faster and at a much lower total cost of ownership (TOC) than other deployment models offer.<br></p>



<p>To have those wishes granted, you need a cloud-based, SaaS deployment model—a complete and managed solution that includes the deployment, management, maintenance, and support of DI services. In short, you need the Anonyome Platform.</p>



<p>Read our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/12/delivering-decentralized-identity-service-offerings/">whitepaper</a> or continue here for the highlights.</p>



 More companies are turning to a SaaS solution for DI &nbsp; 



<p>For software providers and integrators, adding a DI infrastructure to their product lines presents many of the same choices they faced when integrating other system elements: for example, will we host our web servers in own own local data center using our own hardware? Or should we opt for the simplicity of leasing server space from a cloud hosting provider?</p>



<p>Both methods have benefits. Some companies enjoy the peace of mind that comes with controlling their own hardware and software stacks. Others—an increasing majority—find peace of mind comes from knowing that the hardware and software stacks are delivered and maintained through a contract model.</p>



<p>The contract model is often referred to as cloud hosting or the more formal Software as a Service (SaaS) model because the vendor provider deploys, manages, maintains, and provides support for the software.</p>



<p>Calculating the total cost of ownership (TOC) usually determines whether to use a SaaS or on-site deployment model. The key cost drivers for any software implementation are the costs of:<br></p>



 
 software application 



 hardware/hosting 



 staff required to deploy, manage, maintain, and support the application. 
 



<p><br>Any of those cost drivers that a company can successfully outsource become line items in a budget without the operational complexities imposed by on-site deployments.<br></p>



 The Anonyome Platform embraces the SaaS model 



<p>Many companies have calculated the inefficiency, complexity, and additional expenses of the traditional on-site software model and have opted for the simplicity of the SaaS model. In fact, the SaaS model has become the de facto standard for delivering software solutions and the Anonyome Platform was built to embrace this model.</p>



 <br>Here are 7 reasons why: 



<p></p>



 1. No upfront capital costs 







<p>With the SaaS model, the customer doesn’t have to bear the upfront capital costs of deploying a software solution or even contracting their own cloud provider. Instead, the SaaS vendor incurs these costs (e.g., hardware/hosting, software application, and IT staff hiring and training). This simplifies startup and operating costs for the customer, the customer only pays a monthly or annual subscription cost, and deployment is immediate.</p>



<p></p>



 2. Fast deployment 







<p>SaaS delivers an almost instant solution to the customer, which is far more attractive than waiting the many months typically required for deploying and testing in-house solutions. Anonyome provides a fully automated approach to deploying new environments for customers.</p>



<p></p>



 3. Vendor-provided maintenance and upgrades 







<p>In the on-site solution, a customer is on the hook for updating and applying security patches to the software and operating systems, and for performing compatibility tests with every change. On the other hand, in the SaaS model, the software vendor maintains and upgrades the software, which includes delivering new versions and security patching the hosted system to protect against security vulnerabilities.</p>



<p></p>



 4. No staffing requirements 







<p>Paying staff to research, design, integrate, test, finetune, and launch any system is a significant cost with in-house solutions—up to 75% of the overall costs, in fact. The SaaS model eliminates the staffing concerns for contracted services.</p>



<p>In new emerging areas such as DI, it may be extremely difficult to find new hires with the right skills. The Anonyome Labs’ team, on the other hand, is highly experienced and highly trained in DI technologies. Beyond the Anonyome Platform, we support the ongoing development of DI by:</p>



 
 helping to run three DI-focused blockchains 



 being an active contributor to the DI standards organizations 



 contributing source code back to the DI open source community. 
 



<p></p>



 5. No-fuss application scalability 







<p>With in-house solutions, the customer must think about infrastructure issues such as network bandwidth, database and server sizing before deciding whether to ramp up their solution. But customers using the SaaS model don’t have to think about the technical how of scalability, because it’s already done for them. This leaves them free to focus on their business strategy and when to scale for maximum revenue.</p>



<p></p>



 6. 24-hour software support 







<p>The service level agreement (SLA) is key to a SaaS solution because it outlines the reliable actions and response times a customer can expect should an issue arise. With Anonyome’s global workforce across multiple time zones, staff are always on hand to respond to priority issues, even after hours at the customer’s site.</p>



<p></p>



 7. High level security and privacy 







<p>Under the SaaS model, the software vendor hires and trains people to maintain top security and privacy capabilities on the customer’s behalf, which is a significant resource saving.<br></p>



<p>DI is exploding as the new identity management solution</p>



<p>As you’d know, DI is the technology and standards that allow a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is more trustworthy, and respects privacy. DI puts the user in sole control of the personal information that forms their identity. It’s decentralized because there’s no central authority or single issuing agent.</p>



<p>According to June 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">figures, </a>more than&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">62 per cent</a>&nbsp;of US companies plan to incorporate a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">DI </a>solution into their operations, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">74 per cent</a>&nbsp;likely to do so within a year.</p>

<p>Centralized identity models are no longer sufficient to safeguard against exploitations from either rogue internal operators or external bad actors. DI has stepped into the breach, because:<br></p>



 
 DI is safer: Without central storage of credentials, DI presents much less risk of credential theft or other operational issues for the customer as custodians of sensitive data. 



 DI streamlines process:Organizations no longer have to repeatedly collect and distribute data, and sign-up and sign-in processes are faster because there’s no need to duplicate efforts and approvals. 



 DI gives individuals control over data:The customer controls their own data, which reduces risk, unifies user experience, and boosts their satisfaction. 



 DI reduces the compliance burden: The system eliminates manual error and inconsistent and redundant data distribution and validation. 
 



 The Anonyome Platform specializes in DI (and much more) 







<p>The Anonyome Platform does three things we know enterprise customers want:<br></p>



 
 Very quickly deploys DI capabilities in their application environment 



 Handles the deployment, management, maintenance and support of the DI solution 



 Allows the customer focus on high-level strategy instead of the technical intricacies. 
 



<p>Within the DI offering, the Anonyome Platform has five licensable products:</p>



 
 White label mobile DI wallet: A standalone mobile application for iOS and Android, a user can use the mobile DI wallet for DI interactions and storage: creating storing cryptographic keys; and creating connections for receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. It interacts with verifiable credential issuers and verifiers, and supports both AnonCreds and W3C Credential formats. 
 



 
 Mobile native DI wallet SDK: For customers who want to add the DI wallet functionality to their own mobile application, this native mobile SDK provides the capability for storage; creating cryptographic keys; establishing connections; and receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. 
 



 
 Verifiable credentials service/SDK/sample apps: This service establishes connections with DI wallets, issues verifiable credentials, and requests and verifies presentation proofs from DI wallets. It supports both AnonCreds and W3C Credential formats. 
 



 
 Relay service/SDK: This service introduces an always-on capability for a mobile DI wallet. Implemented as a cloud service, the relay service provides mediator capability for incoming/outgoing verifiable credential and other messages, so that sending and receiving is not limited to when the client implementations of the mobile DI wallet and SDK are online. 
 



 
 Governance framework:This framework empowers DI network participants to enforce rules while staying true to the tenants of DI. Organizations can define and enforce governance rules associated with their ecosystem, including which wallets, issuers, and verifiers are trusted and which credentials can be used and requested. 
 



<p>In addition to the current Anonyome Platform DI products, we are also developing:</p>



 
 Enterprise DI wallet: A combination mobile wallet application and cloud wallet, the enterprise DI wallet manages credentials associated with the enterprise. Differing from a personal DI wallet, the enterprise DI wallet is intended for one or more users to use simultaneously and to be inheritable by a future occupant of a particular job or position within an enterprise. 
 



<p>The Anonyome Platform is a SaaS-based, API-first developer platform of individualized services<br></p>



<p>Also known as the <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, the Anonyome Platform offers a set of DI, privacy, and cybersecurity services and SDKs that developers can add as capabilities to their existing or new applications.</p>



<p>When a customer has licensed one or more of the Sudo Platform services, we create a new Sudo Platform deployment instance for that customer, which contains their specific licensed services. One of Sudo Platform’s unique features is it doesn’t use a shared deployment model (common for SaaS environments). Rather, Sudo Platform deploys environments individually for each customer. This means the customer can customize the environment for their needs, and that customer’s data and processing are completely separate from those of other customers.</p>



<p>Once we have deployed and configured an environment for a customer, we maintain and support it, which includes updating and patching it, and monitoring it 24/7.<br><br><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/12/delivering-decentralized-identity-service-offerings/">Now, head to our whitepaper for specifics on how the Anonyome Platform operates</a></p>



<p>Ready to start building?</p>



<p>Remember, we built&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;so you don’t have to, and we make it easy for you to make it your own. It’s a modular, turnkey collection of services including:</p>



 
 DI 



 Safe and private browsing 



 Password management 



 Virtual private network 



 Compartmentalization 



 Virtual cards 



 Open and encrypted telephony and email communications. 
 



<p><br>You can use one, some, or the entire stack to augment your established offerings with adjacent capabilities that dramatically increase value for your customers.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> includes everything you need to quickly bring new products to market or augment existing products with value-add privacy and identity protection capabilities. It includes:</p>



 
 Developer-focused documentation 



 APIs 



 SDK source code via GitHub 



 Sample applications for test-to-deploy of various capabilities 



 Brandable white-label apps for quick go-to-market deployments.

<p>Recent reports from the FBI have shed light on the escalating cyber espionage activities orchestrated by state-sponsored actors, particularly those emanating from China. Case in point — the emergence of the Volt Typhoon botnet, as highlighted in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/01/china-hacking-threat-us-volt-typhoon-botnet-fbi-warning">The Guardian</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fbi-china-espionage-hacking-db23dd96cfd825e4988852a34a99d4ea">AP News</a>, underscoring the critical need to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity of digital identities, now more than ever.</p>
 Understanding the Threat Landscape 
<p>The FBI’s warnings regarding the Volt Typhoon botnet and China’s espionage activities serve as a stark reminder of the sophisticated tactics employed by cyber adversaries. Coincidently, my last <a>blog</a> covered Midnight Blizzard – Russian nation state attackers on Microsoft. These threats pose significant challenges to national security and underscore the vulnerabilities inherent in identity verification and data protection. This also means the threat landscape is expanding.</p>
 Luckily, the Threat was Prevented 
<p>In this instance, the threat was thwarted before an incident occurred. In the case of the Midnight Blizzard attack on Microsoft, we were not so lucky. The warnings come as a shot across the collective bow for all organizations and serve as a reminder that this will not be the last time a foreign entity or any other hacker will target the vulnerable.</p>
<p>So, what are organizations to do to keep themselves out of the headlines? Not a huge surprise, but first we must all keep up with applying security patches and up-to-date versions of the OS and application layers. To restate the obvious, good system management hygiene is a must.</p>
<p>But the uncomfortable truth is that bad actors log in as frequently or even more often than using some sophisticated hack to gain access. Many organizations are minimizing dependence on passwords, but they are finding that the big challenge is addressing the many authentication use cases.</p>
<p>Windows Hello for Business conveniently supports passwordless access within the Microsoft platform, but try getting this to work with Mac OS, Linux or even your VPN. Domain controllers and virtual machines, for example, also continue to depend on passwords. To the delight of hackers, the resulting “passwordless strategy” resembles Swiss Cheese more so than it does a Swiss Army knife supporting the broad range of needs enterprise wide.</p>
<p>So, on the path to eliminating passwords it’s the diversity of information technology that needs to be managed, and for good reason. Most enterprise IT environments evolved over decades as did security standards. There should be little to no expectation that somehow magically all ways of authenticating into this morass would happen with some type of hand waving let alone a black box that effortlessly solves all unanticipated authentication use cases.</p>
<p>Identity, it turns out, isn’t sufficiently managed with a password, an SMS code or the knowledge of mother’s maiden name. This is not new … a long list of three letter acronyms including IGA, SSO, PAM, and IAM all recognize identity as a corporate asset that needs to be managed and governed. None, however, seem able to keep up with the unrelenting attacks using social engineering and pirated account credentials. You just need to read the headlines to know this.</p>
 Closing the Open Door 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we’ve always approached passwordless MFA as a feature, but we’ve viewed the root cause authentication issue as a business challenge revolving around identity. We solved that by performing identity verification and then generating as an artifact a non-phishable passwordless MFA credential with liveness detection.</p>
<p>But as our passwordless journey continued, something interesting happened. We found that placing identity outside of the application platforms and providing for various levels of identity assurance tuned to the risk of the digital interaction helped us rapidly evolve our identity and authentication platform to address the constant stream of use cases that surfaced in just about every customer deployment.</p>
<p>It turns out that not everybody wants an app, not everybody owns a mobile device, and some work environments outright prohibit the use of mobile handsets. By offering identity verification and authentication in a single privacy-by-design platform we’ve provided ourselves and our customers an elegant way to systematically accommodate the unexpected, and in a sense, hardest-to-solve authentication use cases.</p>
<p>This approach to identity modernization quickly augments core identity and access management to mitigate risk, reduce technical debt, and enhance access controls, effectively closing the open door that many hackers walk through unchallenged. By way of example, it’s why we’ve been able to rapidly release app-less authentication, browser-based identity verification journeys and most recently BlockID 1Key, a biometric security key.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe that by integrating identity proofing, credential verification, and strong authentication, we equip organizations with the tools and insights needed to combat identity-based attacks effectively – and in ways not possible before.</p>
<p>Through a collaborative and identity-centric approach to security, we help organizations bolster their resilience and navigate through this digital storm unleashed by sophisticated attackers like those behind Volt Typhoon.</p>
 Prepare Now for What May Come 
<p>Given the advanced warnings from the FBI regarding the Volt Typhoon botnet and China’s espionage, we were lucky this time. But this sequence of events telegraphs the dangers that live among us and should serve as a battle cry for heightened security measures, starting with identity verification at first and every login … for customers, workers, and citizens.</p>
<p>Embracing innovative technologies that in turn enable rapid business innovation … it’s the path forward to reduce risk and deliver order-of-magnitude business improvement. It’s the logical path forward for organizations that thrive on the speed of innovation and want to de-risk their business plan by modernizing and simplifying identity and access management. It’s this bright future we at 1Kosmos envision for all organizations navigating digital transformation and the delivery of digital services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Multifactor authentication for admins accessing Microsoft admin portals 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admin accounts with elevated privileges are more likely to be attacked, so enforcing MFA for these roles protects these privileged administrative functions. This policy covers 14 admin roles that we consider to be highly privileged, requiring administrators to perform multifactor authentication when signing into Microsoft admin portals. This policy targets Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled.</p>

<p>Per-user MFA is when users are enabled individually and are required to perform multifactor authentication each time they sign in (with some exceptions, such as when they sign in from trusted IP addresses or when the remember MFA on trusted devices feature is turned on). For customers who are licensed for Entra ID P1, Conditional Access offers a better admin experience with many additional features, including <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups">user group</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps">application</a> targeting, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions">more conditions</a> such as risk- and device-based, integration with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">authentication strengths</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session">session controls</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-report-only">report-only mode</a>. This can help you be more targeted in requiring MFA, lowering end user friction while maintaining security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers users with per-user MFA. These users are targeted by Conditional Access and are now required to perform multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It aids organizations’ transition to Conditional Access seamlessly, ensuring no disruption to end user experiences while maintaining a high level of security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy targets licensed users with Entra ID P1 and P2, where the security defaults policy isn't enabled and there are less than 500 per-user MFA enabled enabled/enforced users. There will be no change to the end user experience due to this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication and reauthentication for risky sign-ins 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy will help your organization achieve the Optimal level for Risk Assessments in the NIST <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> because it provides a key layer of added security assurance that triggers only when we detect high-risk sign-ins. “High-risk sign-in” means there is a very high probability that a given authentication request isn't the authorized identity owner and could indicate brute force, password spray, or token replay attacks. By dynamically responding to sign-in risk, this policy disrupts active attacks in real-time while remaining invisible to most users, particularly those who don’t have high sign-in risk. When Identity Protection detects an attack, your users will be prompted to self-remediate with MFA and reauthenticate to Entra ID, which will reset the compromised session.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers all users in Entra ID P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled, all active users are already registered for MFA, and there are enough licenses for each user. As with all policies, ensure you exclude any break-glass or service accounts to avoid locking yourself out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies have been created in all eligible tenants in Report-only mode. These policies are suggestions from Microsoft that organizations can adapt and use for their own environment. Administrators can view and review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>. To enhance the policies, administrators are encouraged to add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>. Once ready, the policies can be moved to the ON state. For additional customization needs, administrators have the flexibility to clone the policies and make further adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Call to Action 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't wait – take action now. Enable the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies now and/or customize the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies according to your organizational needs.

<p>In an era where data security and privacy are paramount, the use of Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) in distributed ID and payment card printers is not just a recommendation but a necessity. These small hardware-based security modules serve as the sentinels guarding sensitive information in a digital age.</p>
<p>Security Significance of Trusted Platform Modules</p>
<p>At its core, a Trusted Platform Module is a dedicated microcontroller chip integrated into a device’s motherboard or system-on-a-chip. Its primary function is to secure and safeguard critical data, cryptographic keys, and system integrity. TPMs adhere to established industry standards and offer a range of cryptographic operations. They generate, store, and protect cryptographic keys and execute operations like digital signatures and card issuance. One of the most critical aspects of a TPM is its ability to provide <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/5254641">Secure Boot processes</a>, ensuring that the device’s firmware and operating system remain unaltered and authentic. This fundamental feature prevents attackers from compromising the system at its root, thereby establishing trust from the ground up.</p>
<p>Government institutions worldwide recognize the necessity of Trusted Platform Modules in safeguarding sensitive data and critical infrastructure. In the U.S., <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final">all devices connecting to government networks are mandated to incorporate TPMs</a> as part of their security standards. These modules play a crucial role in protecting classified information, securing communications, and mitigating potential breaches. Government systems equipped with TPMs are not only more secure but also enable remote attestation, meaning that their status can be verified and authenticated by trusted entities. This is essential for ensuring that the device’s software and firmware have not been tampered with, guaranteeing the utmost security.</p>
<p>Imperative for ID and Payment Card Printers</p>
<p>Without a TPM, devices such as ID and payment card printers become susceptible to rising security threats. Hackers, malicious software, and unauthorized users can exploit vulnerabilities in these systems, potentially leading to devastating consequences:</p>
 
 Data Breaches: Sensitive personal and financial information, including ID and payment card data, can be compromised, resulting in identity theft and financial fraud. 
 Counterfeit Cards: Fraudsters may take advantage of unsecured printers to produce counterfeit identification and payment cards, posing a severe risk to both individuals and institutions. 
 System Tampering: The absence of Secure Boot processes leaves systems open to firmware attacks, making them more susceptible to malware and unauthorized access. 
 
<p>The inclusion of Trusted Platform Modules in distributed ID and payment card printers is a necessity. Government institutions understand the imperative need for TPMs in safeguarding sensitive information, and the same principle applies to banks, universities, and enterprises. The absence of TPMs leaves these entities exposed to security vulnerabilities that could have severe consequences.</p>
<p>By integrating TPMs into their systems, organizations can fortify their defenses against data breaches, counterfeiting, and system tampering. These modules, with their technical prowess and cryptographic capabilities, offer a solid foundation for robust security in the digital age, ensuring the trustworthiness of the devices that shape our lives. Entrust is the only provider globally using Trusted Platform Modules across our latest line of issuance systems. Learn how you can lay the foundation for seamless, secure <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/instant/financial-card">payment card</a> and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/instant/id-card-issuance">ID card</a> experiences for your end-users and staff.</p>

<p>In recent months, ransomware attacks have gained attention and become a top concern across multiple industries. The threat has affected many well-known brands, ranging from cable providers and aircraft manufacturers to mortgage servicers and title insurance companies. Ransomware is a type of malware used to infect computers and encrypt data. Once infected, the ransomware attempts to spread to connected systems. This can include computers accessible on the network, shared drives, and backups. The goal of the attack is to render data and applications unusable for the victim until a ransom is paid.</p>
<p>According to Corvus Insurance, ransomware leak site victims reached a <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ransomware-victims-record-november/">record-high in November</a>: a 39% increase from the prior month and a 110% increase year-over-year. The report suggests the uptick was largely due to LockBit and the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4966">CVE 2023-4966 Citrix Bleed vulnerability</a>. The exploit allows threat actors to circumvent password requirements and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to hijack legitimate user sessions for harvesting credentials and accessing data. On November 21, 2023, the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also issued this <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-325a">advisory</a>.</p>
<p>For financial services organizations, ransomware attacks can be particularly damaging. In August 2023, real estate brokers and agents in the U.S. suffered from an <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/commentary/mls-cyberattack-a-wake-up-call-for-all-leaders">attack</a> that took 23 multiple listing service (MLS) systems offline. MLS systems are private databases created, maintained, and funded by real estate professionals to help clients buy and sell properties. In November, one of the largest <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/mr-cooper-data-breach-impacts-14-7-million-individuals/">mortgage servicers</a> in the U.S. experienced an outage impacting millions and homeowners were unable to submit mortgage payments. Weeks later, two large title insurance providers in the U.S. and UK were attacked and closing transactions were delayed. In early January, one of the largest non-bank lenders was also <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/loandepot-ransomware-exposes-17M-people/705169/">attacked</a>.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of a ransomware attack? Depending on the industry, the answer will vary. To understand the scope of impact, consider these two sample customer transactions: An iced latte beverage versus a residential piece of real estate. While the first is likely the smallest purchase a customer may make in a single day, the other may be the largest single purchase they make in their lifetime. If the ice cubes used for making the latte represent data, a real estate financing transaction is an iceberg. The volume of personally identifiable information (PII) involved with buying and selling a home and making monthly loan payments make real estate, mortgage, and title firms highly sought-after targets for would-be attackers.</p>
<p>The Ice Cube</p>
<p>When a national coffee chain is subjected to a ransomware attack, customers are likely to face temporary inconveniences. Systems may go offline. Point-of-sale systems for credit cards may be unavailable until the recovery process is complete. Perhaps loyalty rewards information or some confidential data is exfiltrated. If it is determined that a material breach occurred, the compliance team will act in accordance with state and federal breach notification laws. The impacted organization will notify, within a required timeframe upon discovery of the incident, the attorney general for each state in which affected customers reside. Impacted customers will subsequently receive a notification. If PII is stolen or lost for certain customers, those individuals may be offered free credit monitoring for a designated period.</p>
<p>The Iceberg</p>
<p>For a mortgage lender or title agency experiencing a ransomware attack, the incident response process is similar. However, the downstream impact can have significantly greater consequences. For those in the process of buying or selling a home, closings may be delayed. Outages may prevent appraisers from uploading reports. Title companies may be unable to disburse funds from escrow. Seller proceeds, mortgage payoff amounts, real estate agent commissions, and other payments will be delayed until systems are fully restored. The homeowner may be unable to make their monthly loan payment online. A mortgage servicer may be unable to receive borrower payments.</p>
<p>For most borrowers in the U.S., the mortgage servicer also facilitates the property tax and insurance payments on behalf of the homeowner. For these escrowed loans, the impact of a ransomware incident could disrupt real estate tax payments to counties and payments toward homeowner insurance policy premiums. The extent to which stolen data is used for other purposes beyond extortion, such as identity theft or credit card fraud, may also remain largely undetermined for an extended period.</p>
<p>The real estate mortgage and financing ecosystem depends on moving large sums of money in a timely manner between multiple transaction participants. Whether delayed mortgage payments or delayed real estate agent commissions, the immediate impact of a ransomware incident on a financial services organization can be substantial. A sustained outage could affect loan amortization schedules, interest calculations, and principal balances. To facilitate funding new mortgages, lenders regularly sell loans to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In turn, these GSEs offer mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which consist of a group of mortgages organized to pay interest like a mortgage bond. The mission for these entities is to help provide liquidity and stability to the U.S. housing market. Listed as one of 16 critical infrastructure <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/financial-services-sector">sectors</a> by CISA, financial services firms play an integral role in ensuring economic stability.</p>
<p>From making their smallest purchase in a single day to the largest single purchase of their lifetime, a customer’s expectations regarding data protection will vary. Leaking a customer’s latte purchase history is not a desired outcome; however, the theft of data containing a borrower’s credit history, income, bank account number, and transcripts of past tax returns is exponentially less preferred. A substandard approach to securing transactions for this segment of the industry can create dangerously high levels of risk. The real estate financing industry plays a vital role in helping individuals achieve home ownership, and customer data protection efforts should be considered accordingly.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Preparation, Prevention, and Mitigation</p>
<p>CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide">#StopRansomware Guide</a> provides ransomware and data extortion preparation, prevention, and mitigation best practices. Preparation best practices focus on backups, incident response plans, and implementing a Zero Trust architecture. For prevention and mitigation best practices, CISA groups by initial access vectors, such as phishing and compromised credentials. Highlights from CISA’s recommendations include:</p>
 
 Maintain Frequent Backups: Encrypt backups of critical data and store them on separate devices inaccessible from a network. 
 Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): Organizations should consider implementing a Zero Trust architecture to prevent unauthorized access to data and services. 
 Update and Patch Systems: Ensure applications and operating systems have the latest patches and updates. Updates should be obtained directly from vendor sites rather than clicking on email links. Enable automatic software updates and do not use end-of-life software. 
 Email: If you are unsure whether an email is legitimate, CISA recommends verifying the email’s legitimacy by contacting the sender directly.

 How are connected the digital Identity and Digital Signature in Web 3.0? 



<p>Explores how digital and electronic signatures are fundamental in the age of digital identity, with a special focus on decentralized technologies, advanced cryptography and Self-Sovereign Identity within the Web 3.0 world.</p>



 Disclaimer: 



<p>In this article, we will use the terms “decentralized identity” and “SSI” (Self-Sovereign Identity) interchangeably. It should be noted that the views and opinions expressed are based on our experience in the field of digital identity, but should not be interpreted as legal definitions.<br>What is an electronic signature?</p>



<p>An electronic signature, in essence, is your consent in the digital world. It can be an image of your signature, a PIN code, or even a click of a button. It is vital in managing digital identities and preventing cyber-attacks.</p>



 Digital signature: a specialization of electronic signature 



<p>The digital signature, a specific subset of the electronic signature, relies on asymmetric cryptography technologies. This technology uniquely links each signature to the signer and the document, providing reliable verification of authenticity. A clear example is the Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>



 Digital signature and legal entities in different countries 



 Let’s see two examples on this subject: 



 
 In Argentina: Digital signatures are restricted to individuals, which presents unique challenges for digital identities. 



 In Mexico: Legal entities can use digital signatures, advancing in the management of digital identities. 
 



 Private key management and security 



<p>The security of a digital signature is based on proper management of private keys. The responsibility for protecting these keys varies by country and type of entity, being crucial for online security.</p>



<p>Following the previous example, in countries where the digital signature is personal, as in Argentina, the responsibility for protecting the private key falls on the individual, which is fundamental for the prevention of cyber-attacks. In Mexico, on the other hand, the entity is responsible for its protection.<br>Identity in the legal and commercial sphere</p>



<p>Identity, both for individuals and entities, is built through actions, reputation and other attributes accumulated over time. For legal entities, this includes their track record, credentials and legal compliance. This identity is crucial in business and legal interactions and operations, and is at the core of what defines Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in the Web 3.0 era.</p>



 Digital signature in Web3 



<p>Web3, with its focus on decentralized identity, proposes a new paradigm in the management of digital signatures. This decentralized approach, exemplified by protocols such as QuarkID, significantly improves interoperability between different systems and entities, allowing greater flexibility and control by users over their digital identities.</p>



<p>In turn, these technologies enable selective disclosure, which allows users to share only the information that is essential for a specific transaction, protecting their privacy.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, the concept of non-repudiation ensures that users’ actions, backed by the immutability of the blockchain and advanced digital signatures, are indisputable, increasing the security and reliability of digital interactions.<br></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Digital and electronic signatures are essential in the era of Web 3.0 and digital identity. Understanding these concepts is crucial for their effective implementation. To learn more about how Extrimian integrates digital identity and cybersecurity solutions, visit Extrimian.</p>

<p>Bluesky is building an open social network where anyone can contribute, while still providing an easy-to-use experience for users. For the past year, we used invite codes to help us manage growth while we built features like moderation tooling, custom feeds, and more. Now, we’re ready for anyone to join.</p>
 
    <a href="https://bsky.app/">Sign up for Bluesky</a>
 
<p>Join more than three million people discussing news, sharing art, and just posting.</p>
 What is Bluesky? 
<p>To mark the occasion, we teamed up with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davis.social">Davis Bickford</a>, an artist on the network, to share why we’re excited about Bluesky.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>To learn more about Bluesky and how to get started, read our <a>user FAQ here</a>.</p>
<p>And if deep dives are more your style, we worked with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/martin.kleppmann.com">Martin Kleppman</a>, author of Designing Data-Intensive Applications and technical advisor to Bluesky, to write <a href="https://bsky.social/about/bluesky-and-the-at-protocol-usable-decentralized-social-media-martin-kleppmann.pdf">a paper that goes into more detail</a> about the technical underpinnings of Bluesky.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>We’ve been working on more features that put you in control of your social media experience. Here’s what you can expect to see soon:</p>
 Stackable Moderation Services 
<p>Safety is core to social media. Bluesky moderates the app according to our community guidelines, and our vision for <a>composable moderation</a> allows users to stack more moderation services together, such as subscribable moderation lists.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we’re excited to release the labeling services which will allow users to stack more options on top of their existing moderation preferences. This will allow other organizations and people to run their own moderation services that can account for industry-specific knowledge or specific cultural norms, among other preferences.</p>
<p>One potential use case for labeling is fact-checking. For example, a fact-checking organization can run a labeling service and mark posts as “partially false,” “misleading,” or other categories. Then, users who trust this organization can subscribe to their labels. As the user scrolls through posts in the app, any labels that the fact-checking organization publishes will be visible on the post itself. This helps in the effective distribution of the fact-check and keeps users better informed.</p>
<p>We’ll be sharing more in the coming weeks. In the meantime, if you’re interested in partnering with Bluesky and setting up a labeling service, contact us at <a href="mailto:partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz">partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz</a>.</p>
 An Open Social Network 
<p>When you log in to Bluesky, it might look and feel familiar — the user experience should be straightforward. But under the hood, we’ve designed the app in a way that puts control back in your hands. Here, your experience online isn’t controlled by a single company. Whether it's your timeline or content filters, on Bluesky, you can easily customize your social experience.</p>
<p>This month, we’ll be rolling out an experimental early version of “federation,” or the feature that makes the network so open and customizable. On Bluesky, you’ll have the freedom to choose (and the right to leave) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships can go with you.</p>
<p>For developers: We’ve already federated the network among multiple servers internally, and later this month, you’ll be able to self-host a server that connects to the main production network. You’ll be part of the first batch of servers that federate with the network, so expect to experiment alongside us! We’ll share more information on how to join the production network with your own server soon. In the meantime, you can test out your server set up via our developer sandbox. <a href="https://www.docs.bsky.app/blog/federation-sandbox">Find instructions here</a>.</p>

				  The first 2024<a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/"> Indicio Identity Community Meetup</a> saw Michael Zuriek of SITA and Heather Dahl of Indicio analyze the rapid digital transformation in travel and hospitality driven by the deployment of digital travel credentials. 
 Watch the recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duaNhMAvFhA">here.</a>  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The Indicio Identity Community Meetup kicked off its first discussion of 2024 with Michael Zuriek, Head of Innovation for Digital Travel at SITA, and Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio, diving into the ways verifiable credential technology will transform the experience of travel for everyone — passengers, airlines, airports, and governments.</p>
<p>First, some context. Indicio and SITA are partners who <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">successfully developed and deployed a Digital Travel Credential (DTC)</a> following International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.</p>
<p>Why is this a revolutionary technology for travel?</p>
<p>A paradigm shift is coming: Seamless travel</p>
<p>For years, countries have been storing traveler data in centralized databases and using complex agreements and policies to share that information to make travel possible. It’s why there are so many hoops travelers have to jump through when crossing borders.</p>
<p>Now, with a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) that follows ICAO’s global standard for storing identity data on personal mobile devices, there is no need for this complex, cumbersome system to facilitate border crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the DTC allows security to simply scan the traveler’s digital information, in a fraction of the time of using a manual, paper-based system. And it provides a way to pre-authorize travel and check in before the traveler leaves home.</p>
<p>We have been conditioned to wait; but automation can severely reduce the bottlenecks in airports.</p>
<p>Dahl described using a DTC to pass through Aruba’s immigration as “almost magical.”: The system was so efficient and seamless that the border guard had waved her through before she was even aware of what was happening. The DTC allowed her paperwork and identity to be verified ahead of time and a biometric scan at the airport checked that she was the correct individual tied to that travel information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every traveler to Aruba will soon be able to have the same experience as the island implements DTC-enabled technology.</p>
<p>By using a DTC for all the touchpoints at an airport where identity needs to be checked, passengers get a much quicker experience, while airports, airlines, and governments benefit from the verified data, simplified privacy compliance, and enhanced security that comes from decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Airports have already invested significantly into biometrics when Covid hit, we could see rapid adoption of the DTC as some of the hardware is already in place.</p>
<p>The EU, US, IATA, and other governments and industry organizations are all currently working on bringing biometrics and digital travel together. Because Indicio and SITA’s DTC works on any airport system, deployment of the DTC will be rapid. The DTC makes biometric technology work much more efficiently and effectively, while simplifying data privacy compliance. And, on a practical level, as airports are an industry of fragmented IT systems, ease of adoption and integration is a critical value proposition. As many airports have biometric investments, the DTC is an easy way to capitalize on these investments and improve processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just a few of takeaways from the conversation; if you have time, I highly recommend you watch the full recording which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duaNhMAvFhA">here</a>. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Get in touch</a> with <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> today to get the DTC for your business.</p>
<p>Join us for the next meeting of the Indicio Identity Community Meetup, where we’ll be speaking with Klaeri Schelhowe, Executive Director of Trust Alliance New Zealand and their Digital Farm Wallet Pilot Project a tool that enables farmers, farm enterprises, and industry organizations to manage critical farm data in an efficient and secure way.</p>

  The European Securities and Markets Authority has urged member states to decide whether to opt into MiCA’s grandfathering scheme or not by June 30th,&nbsp;2024.  The first part of South Korea’s planned two-part crypto regulation draft will come into force in July this&nbsp;year.  2024 is going to be a regulatory intense year for the crypto space in the US, with the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act setting the stage for stablecoin regulations in the&nbsp;country.  <p>Just weeks into 2024, the crypto world is already seeing major regulatory changes, with the most notable one being the US SEC’s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. That was just the tip of the iceberg, though, as a lot more is to come this year in areas like issuance, services, stablecoins, and oversight, with a strong focus on AML and KYC measures.</p><p>Emerging technologies such as DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs will also be under the regulatory lens, especially in Europe, Japan, and parts of Africa this year. So, what major crypto regulatory changes are we to expect from these areas in&nbsp;2024?</p> Europe <p>2024 will bring a wave of sweeping changes across the crypto landscape. The rollout of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">the Markets in Crypto Asset Regulation (MiCA)</a> in EU states is reshaping the scene, even influencing economic partners like Switzerland. As this unfolds, European regulators are joining forces, aiming to streamline how they categorize, monitor, and handle the tech side of crypto assets, creating a unified approach across the continent, with different types of crypto assets getting their own unique set of&nbsp;rules.</p> European Union <p>As a part of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation rollout, the European Securities and Market Authority is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">set to issue guidelines</a> on crypto asset categorization, market monitoring, and technological infrastructure standards. <a href="https://www.regulationtomorrow.com/eu/esma-encourages-smooth-transition-to-mica/">By June 30th, 2024</a>, EU states must decide on opting into the grandfathering scheme under MiCA, which permits crypto asset service providers to operate under national laws until MiCA authorization is obtained or&nbsp;denied.</p><p>This scenario could lead to varied regulatory approaches across Europe, which ESMA aims to harmonize. Furthermore, the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA24-229244789-4595_SMSG_Advice_on_MiCA_package__1.pdf">advising ESMA</a> to ensure MiCA’s alignment with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by the end of&nbsp;2024.</p> The United&nbsp;Kingdom <p><a href="https://decrypt.co/200289/uk-wont-be-copying-mica-crypto-parliamentary-group-chair">Instead of creating</a> a standalone regulatory framework like the EU’s MiCA, the UK plans to incorporate crypto activities into its existing financial services framework, necessitating crypto firms to comply with traditional banking regulations. The Financial Conduct Authority will offer guidance for crypto businesses <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/01/uk-crypto-firms-to-get-broad-laws-may-need-new-authorization/">requiring authorization</a> under this&nbsp;regime.</p><p>Different types of crypto assets, such as unique NFTs and already-regulated assets like security tokens, will also be distinctly regulated this year. Moreover, legislation to formalize this framework is anticipated in 2024, with transitional arrangements for businesses. As for stablecoins, the UK’s immediate regulatory emphasis is on fiat-backed ones used in payment systems, with legislation targeted for early 2024. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.taxjournal.com/articles/-it-would-be-premature-ineffective-for-the-uk-to-regulate-defi-activities-currently-says-treasury-#:~:text=the%20UK%20government%20does%20not,to%20regulate%20DeFi%20activities%20currently.">regulation of Decentralized Finance</a> remains under consideration.</p> Switzerland <p>Switzerland is implementing the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/crypto-asset-reporting-framework-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.pdf">Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF)</a> this year, bringing digital assets under tax transparency regulations and necessitating due diligence on users by crypto service providers. Moreover, the Federal Department of Finance also plans to prepare a <a href="https://www.efd.admin.ch/efd/en/home/the-fdf/nsb-news_list.msg-id-98545.html">consultation draft for implementing these rules</a>, targeting completion by the end of June&nbsp;2024.</p> Asia Pacific&nbsp;(APAC) <p>Across the Asia Pacific region, governments and regulatory authorities are placing a heightened focus on strengthening the regulatory frameworks to ensure the security of digital assets and protect consumers. This includes the implementation of clear taxation policies for crypto assets, where profits from transactions are subject to taxation, and strict reporting requirements are imposed on crypto investors.</p><p>Governments are also emphasizing the importance of security and compliance, with regulations targeting anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, and robust cybersecurity standards. Additionally, emerging technologies like DeFi, NFTs, and stablecoins are receiving regulatory attention, leading to the development of comprehensive policies and guidelines.</p> Japan <p>In 2024, Japan will continue its detailed approach to cryptocurrency regulation, focusing on consumer protection. This is in response to past breaches at Japanese exchanges, emphasizing the need for stringent security measures. We can also expect Japan to initiate <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/269200/japan-seeks-to-exempt-companies-from-tax-on-unrealized-crypto-gains-reports#:~:text=The%20Japanese%20government%20has%20approved,according%20to%20local%20media%20reports.">its much-anticipated tax policy reforms</a> to support the growth of crypto startups this&nbsp;year.</p> India <p>India is yet to finalize its approach to cryptocurrencies, with the anticipated cryptocurrency bill still pending since 2021. However, the Reserve Bank of India <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/crypto-made-easy/rbi-ranks-crypto-near-the-bottom-of-systematic-risks-despite-harsh-criticism/77763/1">remains skeptical of cryptocurrencies</a> and instead favors CBDCs over other digital currencies, indicating no major regulatory changes in 2024. So, we are unlikely to see any major changes in terms of crypto regulations in India in&nbsp;2024.</p> South Korea <p>South Korea is working on a two-part crypto regulation framework for 2024. The first part, focusing on structuring the crypto market, will take effect in July 2024, whereas the second part, which is still under development, will establish rules for the issuance, listing, and delisting of cryptocurrencies. The country has also decided <a href="https://www.khan.co.kr/economy/finance/article/202401111541001">not to support crypto ETFs</a> and is considering <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/01/04/south-korea-regulator-seeks-ban-on-crypto-purchases-with-credit-cards/amp/">banning credit card purchases</a> of cryptocurrencies. Adding to this, <a href="https://crypto.news/south-korea-to-mandate-crypto-disclosure-for-5800-officials-in-2024/">both officials and companies</a> will need to start revealing their crypto holdings from next&nbsp;year.</p> Singapore <p>In 2024, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is set to focus on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-23/singapore-plans-more-rules-to-curb-retail-crypto-speculation">reducing speculative trading</a> in cryptocurrencies, including the ban on cryptocurrency platforms offering incentives for trading. Moreover, starting in mid-2024, the use of Singapore credit cards to purchase digital payment tokens will <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cryptocurrencies-digital-payment-token-credit-card-mas-2311461">no longer be&nbsp;allowed</a>.</p> Hong Kong <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC67">are considering applications</a> for spot crypto ETFs and other virtual asset funds this year. It is expected to make significant progress in stablecoin regulation, too, with <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/insight/2023/12/20231227/">a consultation paper</a> already published seeking public feedback. The regulator also has plans to unveil <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/press-releases/2023/12/20231227-4/">a “sandbox” framework</a>, enabling market participants to engage directly with the regulatory environment in&nbsp;2024.</p> China <p>The People’s Bank of China recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-pboc-crypto-defi-stability-report">emphasized the need</a> for global crypto rules, maintaining its tough stance on cryptocurrencies. However, the country is pushing for <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/273492/china-forms-metaverse-working-group-with-huawei-tencent-ant-group-and-others#:~:text=China%20has%20formed%20a%20working,growth%20of%20the%20nascent%20industry.">standardization in the metaverse sector</a>, collaborating with tech giants and government representatives, and has <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/chinese-regulators-aim-to-disconnect-gaming-tokens-from-real-world-currency/#:~:text=Chinese%20authorities%20have%20proposed%20a,regulations%20for%20the%20gaming%20industry.">proposed a ban</a> on converting virtual gaming tokens to real-world assets this&nbsp;year.</p> Australia <p>Australia plans to advance its <a href="https://paymentexpert.com/2023/10/16/australia-new-crypto-regulations-2024/">crypto licensing framework in 2024</a>, introducing a regulatory framework covering licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers. This legislation, once approved, will include a 12-month transitional period. The Treasury and Reserve Bank of Australia will also <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/central-bank-digital-currency/pdf/australian-cbdc-pilot-for-digital-finance-innovation-project-report.pdf">publish a joint report</a> on CBDC research this year, setting a roadmap for future&nbsp;work.</p> The Americas <p>Governments throughout the Americas are actively enhancing cryptocurrency regulations to address common concerns. They’re taking steps to combat issues like money laundering and fraud and safeguard investors.</p><p>A prominent focus is on regulating stablecoins, with measures to ensure that issuers maintain sufficient reserves and adhere to financial rules gaining traction.</p><p>Additionally, tax regulations concerning cryptocurrencies are being clarified, encompassing reporting requirements, capital gains taxes, and income tax obligations for crypto-related activities.</p> The United&nbsp;States <p>2024 in the US kicked off with the launch of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023">the country’s first Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>. Yet, the SEC is maintaining its firm stance, not relenting in its rigorous crypto scrutiny. Laws for stablecoin issuers are also likely to emerge in 2024 following the House Financial Services Committee’s passage of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4766/text">the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act</a>, which is currently awaiting consideration in the House of Representatives.</p><p>Another key focus for this year is <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12223">the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act</a>, which could shift the crypto world from securities to commodities, with the CFTC taking the lead. Similarly, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4356/all-info">the bipartisan Responsible Financial Innovation Act</a> aims to classify most cryptos as commodities, shifting more responsibility to the CFTC and establishing stablecoin regulations.</p><p>Moreover, from January 2024, <a href="https://www.bdo.com/insights/tax/infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-contains-new-cryptocurrency-reporting-requirements">the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> has been in effect, making it mandatory for entities to report crypto transactions over $10,000 to the IRS or face serious consequences. Lastly, the outcome of the US elections in November 2024 could significantly impact the crypto industry, as a crypto-friendly administration could bring much-needed clarity and legitimacy to the&nbsp;sector.</p> Canada <p>The Canadian Securities Administrator announced <a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/news/canadian-securities-regulators-seek-feedback-on-rules-for-public-investment-funds-holding-crypto-assets/">new regulations for public investment funds</a> in crypto assets in January this year, which is open for public feedback until April 17th, 2024. The new rule will permit only the non-redeemable and alternative investment funds to handle crypto transactions directly, requiring other mutual funds to invest through these entities. It also underlines that the crypto assets must also be fungible, insured, stored offline, and listed on a recognized Canadian exchange with an annual custodian review.</p> Brazil <p>In Brazil, policymakers are working to tighten crypto regulation and bring brokerages under stricter supervision in 2024. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-government-tax-income-financial-investments-obtained-abroad-2023-05-01/">newly enacted income tax regulations</a>, effective January 1st, 2024, impose up to 15% tax on individuals earning over $1,200 from foreign-based exchanges, aiming to generate $4 billion in tax revenue. Also, the Brazilian central bank’s digital currency, DREX, is in its testing phase until February 14th, 2024, with a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-central-bank-names-digital-193619347.html">public launch</a> planned by year-end.</p> Colombia <p>Colombian lawmakers are drafting a <a href="https://bacsociety.com/en/new-bill-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies-in-colombia/">bill for comprehensive crypto regulation</a>, with collaboration between the crypto ecosystem and government bodies like the Central Bank and the Financial Superintendency. The bill, expected to be presented publicly this year, will undergo analysis by the Executive and then Congressional approval.</p> Argentina <p>This year, Argentinian President Javier Milei, a pro-Bitcoin advocate, aims to introduce crypto regulation aligned with the IMF’s anti-money laundering approach.</p><p>Milei’s draft bill, <a href="https://www.ambito.com/adjuntos/239/documentos/041/223/0041223294.pdf">the Law of Bases and Starting Points for the Freedom of Argentines</a> proposes favorable tax rates for declared domestic and foreign crypto holdings and legalizes their use. Tax rates start at 5% until March 2024, then increase to 10% through June, and 15% thereafter until September 2024.‍</p> Middle East &amp;&nbsp;Africa <p>In the Middle East and Africa, governments are attempting to strike a balance between nurturing the growth of digital finance and addressing regulatory challenges. This trend involves a focus on developing structured frameworks for cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, reflecting an awareness of their growing economic impact. However, there’s also an emphasis on enhancing anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism measures within the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p> The United Arab&nbsp;Emirates <p>​​This year, the UAE is on the brink of finalizing its stablecoin laws, with Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority leading the charge. VARA, the first of its kind in crypto supervision, <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/dubais-move-oversee-stablecoins-bring-certainty-regulatory-grey-area">has revamped its virtual asset rulebook</a> to integrate regulations for fiat-referenced virtual assets (FRVAs), or stablecoins. These rules categorize cryptocurrencies, placing FRVAs in ‘category 1’. For stablecoin issuers, this means getting authorization and a license from VARA and adhering to its stringent regulations and the newly minted FRVA&nbsp;Rules.</p><p>The UAE’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority has also recently <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">tweaked its AML and sanctions rules</a> in line with the FATF Travel Rule, specifically targeting provisions related to wire transfers in the digital asset&nbsp;realm.</p> Saudi Arabia <p>As of yet, Saudi Arabia does not have a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The country has also banned banks from processing transactions related to crypto, while the Saudi Central Bank governor has <a href="https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/636735/SAUDI-ARABIA/SAMA-chief-warns-against-dangers-of-crypto-currencies">underscored the need</a> for adequate supervision, regulation, and coordination in virtual currency activities. Amidst this, SAMA has been experimenting through the launch of <a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/media/cbshgsmf/aber-report-2020-en.pdf">Project Aber</a>, a joint collaboration between SAMA and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (“CBUAE”), which explores CBDC for cross-border payments. Besides these developments that will continue this year, there’s not much happening on the regulatory front in&nbsp;Saudi.</p> South Africa <p>Last year, on October 22nd, South Africa began <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/News%20Documents/FSCA%20Press%20Release_Declaration%20of%20Crypto%20Assets%20As%20A%20Financial%20Product_20%20October%202022.pdf">recognizing cryptocurrencies as a financial product</a> and made it <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/25/south-africas-crypto-firms-will-soon-need-to-apply-for-registration-or-face-a-heavy-fine/?_gl=1*1cr5fq9*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTE1NjY2NzkxLjE3MDU4MjY0MDI.*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTcwNTgyNjQwMS4xLjAuMTcwNTgyNjQwMS4wLjAuMA..">mandatory for all crypto exchanges</a> to secure operating licenses before the year ends. While the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act currently governs them, crypto-related services will <a href="https://www.treasury.gov.za/public%20comments/2020%2010%2008%20CoFI%20Bill%20(version%20published%20for%20comment)%20(slightly%20updated).pdf">soon fall under the Conduct of Financial Institutions bill</a>, set to become law in the coming years. Additionally, with the Financial Action Task Force closely monitoring South Africa, 2024 will bring more robust anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures to the crypto sector, aiming to help the country exit the greylist by&nbsp;2025.</p> Nigeria <p>Nigeria, after lifting its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-central-bank-lifts-ban-crypto-trading-2023-12-23/">2021 crypto ban</a>, has set out <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2024/FPRD/GUIDELINES%20ON%20OPERATIONS%20OF%20BANK%20ACCOUNTS%20FOR%20VIRTUAL%20Asset%20Providers.pdf">new rules for VASPs</a>, focusing on strong KYC and AML checks. However, Nigerian banks still can’t <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2024/FPRD/GUIDELINES%20ON%20OPERATIONS%20OF%20BANK%20ACCOUNTS%20FOR%20VIRTUAL%20Asset%20Providers.pdf">trade or hold cryptocurrencies</a> themselves. At the same time, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission is starting to handle license applications from crypto custodians and exchanges, showing a careful move towards more involvement in cryptocurrencies.</p> Kenya <p>After passing the <a href="https://kra.go.ke/images/publications/The-Finance-Act--2023.pdf">Finance Bill 2023</a> and signing it into law, Kenya is ready for a comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework covering tax integration and revenue guidelines. The local industry lobby group, the Blockchain Association of Kenya (BAK), is tasked with <a href="https://www.mariblock.com/kenyan-lawmakers-blockchain-association-draft-crypto-bill/">preparing the first draft</a> of a VASP bill referred to as the Crypto Bill by the National Assembly’s Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning. With that, Kenya might become the first country where the industry’s representatives <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainKenya/status/1748641509069435244">develop</a> the regulatory framework for&nbsp;crypto.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>In 2024, we’re at a crossroads as far as global crypto regulations are concerned. Across the globe, from the European Union to the United States, governments are crafting new rules, influencing how the world perceives and uses cryptocurrencies in everyday&nbsp;life.</p><p>While each country’s approach varies, it’s crucial to ensure that the underlying intent remains consistent: safeguarding user experience and security. The decisions made this year will not only shape the immediate future of cryptocurrencies but will also lay the groundwork for their integration into the mainstream global financial ecosystem. So, this year will go down in history as a defining moment for the crypto industry, one that could determine its trajectory for the years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 22nd January to 4th&nbsp;February <p>Welcome to the latest edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! In today’s issue, we will cover the latest regulatory updates from all over the world from the last two weeks as we enter into the second month of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>As crypto adoption grows, regulatory developments, too, are getting ramped up with the US and Europe aiming for more clear guidelines. Meanwhile, in another part of the world, China remains unfriendly towards crypto while its special administrative region, Hong Kong, continues to provide regulatory guidelines in an attempt to become a crypto&nbsp;hub.</p><p>So, let’s take a deeper look into these regulatory advances being made around the globe and their impact on the crypto&nbsp;world.</p> The Global Landscape of Crypto Regulations <p>One of the major developments on the crypto regulatory front comes from the US, as American lawmakers are trying to delete the controversial accounting bulletin that imposes restrictions on companies for holding their customer’s crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In Asia, Hong Kong is making major crypto regulatory moves, as it is planning to consult on the regulatory framework for over-the-counter crypto venues “very soon.” China, meanwhile, is amending its <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering regulations</a> for the first time since 2007 to cover crypto-related transactions.</p><p>Similarly, in Europe, the European Securities and Markets Authorities, the securities regulatory authority of the 27-member union, is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA75-453128700-52_MiCA_Consultation_Paper_-_Guidelines_on_the_qualification_of_crypto-assets_as_financial_instruments.pdf">seeking public feedback until April-end</a> to assess the criteria for classifying crypto as financial instruments.</p><p>With the proposed guidelines, the financial regulator aims to provide authorities and market participants with flexible conditions to determine whether a crypto asset can be categorized as a financial instrument, avoid having a one-size-fits-all approach, and ensure consistency across the&nbsp;region.</p> US Lawmakers Challenge the SEC on Crypto Custody&nbsp;Rule <p>Members of Congress, including Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and Reps. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.) has introduced resolutions to repeal the Securities and Exchange Commission’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121">2022 staff accounting bulletin&nbsp;№121</a>.</p><p>The custody rule requires a company holding a client’s crypto assets to do so on its own balance sheet. This requires custodians holding crypto to maintain capital reserves to offset the risk, which could deter institutions and regulated banks from offering crypto custody&nbsp;options.</p><p>According to lawmakers behind the resolution, the legally binding directive was issued by the SEC without the required process of notice-and-comment, and hence, it must be repealed.</p> China to Introduce Revised Crypto AML&nbsp;Rules <p>Amid calls for more scrutiny, China is set to update its AML rules to cover cryptocurrency transactions. The revised rules are expected to go into effect in&nbsp;2025.</p><p>Late last month, Prime Minister Li Qiang conducted an executive meeting of the State Council to discuss the new draft of its AML regulations, including crypto provisions.</p><p>While the AML rule aims to curb illicit financial flows, it also acknowledges the ongoing engagement with cryptocurrencies despite official&nbsp;bans.</p><p>Speaking of crypto-focused AML regulations, China won’t be the first to implement the rule, as it has been adopted by other countries as well in the form of the FATF Travel Rule. For example, recently, the EU also <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/new-european-crypto-transfer-rules-in-2024">expanded its AML laws to cryptocurrencies</a>, requiring obliged entities to report on crypto transactions exceeding €1,000.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-global-crypto-regulatory-outlook-2024">The Shyft Perspective: Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/ebas-amended-money-laundering-terrorist-financing-guidelines-explained">EBA’s Amended Money Laundering &amp; Terrorist Financing Guidelines Explained</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In this third blog of a 4-part series we are sharing a speculative future scenario based around a network of distributed bioregional banks. The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;three.</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (Please see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? (Please see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">Blog&nbsp;2</a>)  What could a desirable future scenario actually look&nbsp;like?  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel system? (Please see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">Blog&nbsp;4</a>)   Part 3 (of 4): Imagining the distributed, bioregional banks of the&nbsp;future <p>In the previous two blogs we have been exploring monetary challenges and proposing some design principles that could underpin a response. In this post we are shifting to a more creative and imaginative space. The future is unlikely to unfold in a form that we can cognitively envision. If we accept that position then it might feel pointless to engage with imaginative scenarios or foresight exercises. On the other hand, it can be interesting to form a series of working hypotheses (or perhaps stories of change) that we can use as testing grounds for our current thinking. From there, we hope to move to a space of creative vulnerability where we dare to bring some of those thought experiments to life. It is highly likely that some of the ideas presented below won’t work. It is also likely that we will learn something important from each iteration, as we continually loop between what we can understand now and the edges of our potential.</p><p>This speculative proposition is centred on the idea of a series of distributed, bioregional banks. However, these next generation institutions will bear little resemblance to our current conception of a bank. In essence they will be stewardship interfaces that exist in service of the regenerative potential of their base region. When linked together via contextually respectful exchange rates they will realign our economic systems in service of planetary vitality. Ultimately the aspiration would be to create a new global reserve currency which itself is regenerative and decolonised by&nbsp;design.</p><p>What if a distributed bioregional bank actually&nbsp;existed?</p><p>It’s easy to find fault with our current banking system but what would we propose as an alternative? What would these distributed institutions actually do? Who would be involved and in what capacity? As a starting point to open this conversation up, we have been thinking about three stewardship functions that could be part of the remit of these next generation banks. We are framing these ideas as a story that is unfolding to try and illustrate how it might feel to interact with these future&nbsp;banks.</p>Image: Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs¹<blockquote>1. Multivalent currencies</blockquote><p>The future banks will be part of a vibrant ecosystem of decentralised multivalent currencies. The issuance and use of these diverse, infinite and resource-backed tokens will build a dynamic understanding of the integrity of the ecosystem as a whole. The key functions of the tokens will be fourfold:</p>  To demonstrate invisible or overlooked value&nbsp;flows;  To gather sensory inputs from different elements of the ecosystem;  To account for individual and collective contributions to the ecosystem’s health;  To form the basis for the overall RegenCoin for the bioregion.  <p>To illustrate how this might work we can use the example of a river printing its own solidarity tokens. People will receive river tokens in recognition of acts of care provided to the river. This might take the form of collecting rubbish from the river banks, introducing children to the joy of wild swimming or reducing the level of pesticides flowing into the water. Initially the system might be overseen by human guardians who vouch for such actions and communicate them to the Bank. As technologies are refined for this new way of living, a time will come where the river will be able to issue and destroy its own tokens via multi-sensory inputs.</p><p>The motivations for people to value the river tokens will be diverse. In the early days, it might be linked to respect and peer approval. Later, the tokens might become part of a blended measure of contribution that forms the overall currency for the&nbsp;region.</p><blockquote>2. Contextually respectful exchange</blockquote><p>The bank will provide a monetary stewardship function that will restrict the conversion of base assets into convertible tokens so that they align with the regenerative rhythms of the bioregion. For&nbsp;example:</p>  The Bank could regulate the sales of finite elements both within and outside of the bioregion.  The Bank could restrict the issuance of new debt to align with the underlying regenerative health of the region. Different types of debt could be issued that could only be used to buy or invest into specific classes of living agents (‘assets’ in today’s terminology). For example, on aggregate the bank would only issue debt for lumber processing activities that were forecast to be at a regenerative level for the region’s forests over the term of the&nbsp;loan.  The bank could designate taxes to be paid in a mix of specified tokens. This mix could be rebalanced periodically to incentivise the behaviours which are optimal for the fluid health of the ecosystem.  <blockquote>3. Probabilistic, participatory governance models</blockquote><p>The Bank’s governance systems will be based on Bayesian inference models. This is a form of dynamic statistical modelling that allows an initial set of assumptions to continually update depending on the information it receives. Critically, the output will be a blended result combining automatic sensory data inputs with the emotional values of the living community. For example, if a community upregulates the importance of river health then the overall value of the RegenCoin would fall if other activities were negatively impacting it.</p><p>These future bank activities can feel a bit flat and detached without a contextual grounding. One idea to bring them to life is to imagine how they could play out under different scenarios. We are suggesting two examples below and would be very curious to hear other ideas or interpretations:</p>  A house owner gifts their property back to nature: in this example a resident of the Bioregion decides that the area where their house has been built should be re-wilded in the interests of the bioregion’s health. When the resident nullifies their previous ownership rights, it will trigger a series of sensory credits to their RegenWallet. The regenerative generosity of the act will be upregulated by human and more-than-human voices. The result will be an amount of newly created RegenCoin being available to build a house in a more sensitive location.  A company tries to game the system to create rights over carbon credits: in this more negative example, we can imagine that a profit seeking company might want to manipulate the system for private gains. Their strategy might be to plant a dense area of trees to maximise their carbon credibility. However, as the sensory inputs are invisible, they would not know how their choice of tree species or location would be valued by the soil, pollinators or the trees themselves. In seeking to generate profits rather than regenerative potential they might in fact generate a negative&nbsp;return.  <p>Sitting in front of a computer in 2024, the scenario that we have outlined above might seem far fetched. If you take a deep breath, soften your gaze and meditate for a second on the extraordinary, complex beauty of life, perhaps it feels a little less fanciful. So much of the living world is beyond our cognitive understanding but entirely open to our sensory perception. To us this feels like both an invitation and a call to action. We already have the technological power of gods and we can choose to direct it in service of life. Grounding this aspiration in a practical context is the next important step in this journey. In our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">final blog</a> we will therefore begin exploring tangible elements of the scenario that we can start to build and test&nbsp;now.</p><p>We are incredibly heartened and grateful for all the messages that we have received so far in response to these blogs. We are still reading through some of the material and will aim to incorporate (and credit) these generous contributions wherever possible. One suggestion is to convene some online studios where we can begin sharing and exploring ideas — we are fully open to&nbsp;others.</p><p>This blog was written by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>).

<p></p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Hi, I am Rob MacDonald, vice president of product marketing here at 1Kosmos, and today I’m joined by Huzefa, co-founder and COO of 1Kosmos. How are you doing today Huzefa?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>I am doing great, Rob. It’s a Friday, so never better.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>It’s Friday, you’re in New Jersey, I heard it snowed a little bit this week, I hope you’re keeping warm.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>When you talk about snow, you’re in Canada, so I cannot talk to you about snow. We got a little bit of a sprinkling, that’s it.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Fair enough. All right, well listen, today, thanks for joining us, or joining me. We just made a recent announcement of a new integration partner, Amazon Cognito. So, before we talk about all the goodness of what we’re doing with Cognito, why don’t you tell me a little bit about what it is? What is Cognito?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, Cognito is a single sign-on platform, an IdP provider that Amazon Web Services provides, especially if you are building your applications on the AWS platform, this is the native integration that the AWS provides out of the box. So, Cognito is widely used across applications, individual applications that may be developed and have their own ecosystems within the AWS network.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Cool. So, interesting. Where is AWS deployed within an organization? So, you said it’s an IdP, I think everybody that’s probably listening to these understands what an IdP is, but where do you typically find it? Because, when we think workforce in particular, there’s Okta and Microsoft and ForgeRock and Ping. Where’s Cognito, where do you find that?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>They primarily operate in the customer identity and access management or CIAM space today. So, they have not published essentially their numbers of their deployment, but it’s pretty vastly adopted. So, any kind of a public facing application which is hosted on AWS application, and if they would not have a custom integration to be done on Okta or Microsoft, Amazon says, here you go, you can use AWS Cognito.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, the primary use case for this would be a CIAM type of initiative, somebody’s put some application on AWS, and then this is the identity management portion of that application, is that what I understood?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Makes sense. So, what motivated either 1Kosmos to partner with AWS or AWS to partner with 1Kosmos? How did that come to be?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, identity is our motivation. We’ve made some significant deployments in the CIAM space recently. 2023 has been a great year for us in that particular sense. And our customers were essentially looking for, hey, do you have these integrations with AWS Cognito that you provide out of box? Their footprint is pretty vast, which I got to know. And that has led to us building this integration with them and providing a more out of box solution with them as well.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, that’s amazing. Everybody knows AWS, everybody knows Amazon, and it’s cool to know that they’re doing this part of their business as well. So, we are now considered an AWS advanced technology partner. So, what specifically does that mean?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, our integration today with AWS is around us being a strong authentication for them. Meaning, if you need to do either multifactor authentication, if you want to do passwordless, if you want to have passkeys that you can deploy on your application that is supported by AWS Cognito, here you go. We are the partner of choice that you can go to. So, it’s pretty significant because most of the applications are now being mandated from a compliance standpoint that, hey, you need to have either Strong MFA or support passwordless passkeys in your application deployment stack, and that’s where our integration with AWS Cognito becomes extremely important. I just wanted to add that we want to continue this particular integration and develop further stories, more on the other sides of pieces that we have, identity proofing and better public mentions, but that is more in the future for us.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, based on what I’ve read on the Amazon Cognito site, they have more of these advanced technology partners. It looks like organizations that are aligned to that have gone through some sort of testing, is that correct? By Amazon?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Yeah, integration as well as testing. So, while anything that we’ve done with AWS, it goes through significant scrutiny and review. So, even this particular integration that we put together, we had to document it. The entire GitHub of this particular technical integration is available. It is referenced in a blog that is published by the AWS community that goes out to anybody, the AWS customer. You can essentially go back and look at it. There are references to the GitHub link as well and what that integration is. But, anyway, all of this was not put together by us. We provided the integration story, but it was reviewed through multiple different channels and reviews. I cannot even recall how many by AWS and published by them.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Well, that’s amazing. So, somebody looking at adding our technology into that stack can be pretty much rest assured that it’s been tested by Amazon to make sure that it works with their technology, and that the integration and implementation of us with Cognito would be seamless.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely. So, if you’re a developer, if you’re watching this, if you have AWS Cognito, feel free to look at the blog. Maybe we can reference it into the link as well when we post this. But, it’s pretty simple, straightforward. You would essentially put a custom auth plugin with 1Kosmos, and there you go. You’ll be able to provide strong MFA or passwordless authentication to your end customers.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Awesome. We take user experience pretty seriously here at 1Kosmos. I guess, I’m sure you would agree with me on that. Everything we do revolves around that and basically privacy. But, it’s commonly known that users will go elsewhere if it’s too hard, if what they came to do wasn’t easy. How does 1Kosmos help Cognito users provide a better experience when they’re dealing with their end users?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely. So, when the experience is, and I always want to highlight that there are two experiences. One is the strong MFA, because we believe in the story of you don’t have to completely take your organization from password to passwordless from day one to day two. You may have a transition period, so strong MFA becomes important. So, we have factored that experience in the entire channel where you can authenticate in Cognito, and then there’s a dialogue box that opens up, which essentially factors in what 1Kosmos provides to you, as any of the strong MFA options that you may have, push notifications, OTP, TOTP, et cetera. For our passwordless and passkeys, we provide an SDK, which again, from an end user standpoint, it seems seamless for them, where all they’re doing is entering their username, their backend API calls that we’re available, that contact 1Kosmos console or gateway that we have, and then we provide, we essentially see if this particular authentication is valid and give the signals back to AWS.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Listen, I think it’s amazing. So, when we look at Amazon Cognito customers, we touched on it earlier, but how easy, or a developer, how easy is it for developers to deploy 1Kosmos into a Cognito instance?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, like I said, you can sign up for a 1Kosmos instance by going to a developer environment. If you have a Cognito instance, you can sign up for a free account for Cognito as well. That is available on the AWS site. There are instructions to develop a custom auth plugin. And on that particular blog we also highlight, and the GitHub repository, what are the steps that you need to essentially use to integrate AWS Cognito with 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, then as a follow on to that question, that obviously sounds relatively easy. How would customers acquire an instance of BlockID? So, it’s like, I like it, I installed it at work, and the testing developer did all the great work. How do I then pay for the instance that I chose?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>We want to make the entire experience easy. So, if you’re a customer in the AWS ecosystem, we are listed on the AWS Marketplace. We have three distinct product lines that are available. So, you can choose any one of them. Most likely it will be around BlockID customer or verify. And you can sign up for the product through AWS Marketplace. You would get your instance, your license keys, et cetera, through that particular portal and you’ll be ready to go.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>That’s cool. Listen, Huzefa, I know that you’re super busy as always, and I wanted to thank you for taking the time today to sit down and tell us about this exciting announcement that we made this week. And I wish you the best, and I hope you come back and talk to me again on a vlog soon.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Look forward to it, Robert. Thank you.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, listen, if you want to find out more about this integration, you can check out our website. We’ve got a data sheet and a press release there that you can go take a read and learn more about this Cognito integration. And then, plus, as Huzefa mentioned earlier, there’s a Amazon Cognito blog that you can read as well. We’ll put the links to all of those down below. Thanks again everybody. We’ll see you again shortly.</p>

<p>In 2024, our product vision is to continue delivering solutions that empower not only issuers, but all ecosystem participants in the tokenization journey to&nbsp;cultivate liquidity and accumulate more users.&nbsp;In our view, to achieve the liquidity endgame, we have to build it up through a few phases: standardization, digitalization, collateralization, distribution, and then reach the liquid secondary market.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Below, I’ll explain how we are turning our product vision into actionable steps to address your technical and operational pain points, smoothly transitioning to new phases, and adding value and services, all while improving liquidity for your investors.</p>
<p>Accelerating standardization phase:&nbsp;The industry now embraces the official token standard ERC-3643 for compliant tokenization. We’re working closely with the ERC3643 Association to swiftly advance standardization. Our focus includes developing key tools like the ERC-3643 DApp, streamlining the effortless deployment and management of ERC3643 tokens, and setting a new benchmark for simplicity in compliant tokenization.</p>
<p>Digitizing real-world assets and securities en masse:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Speeding up time to market:&nbsp;While our contributions to standardization are open-source, the value of Tokeny’s solutions extends beyond smart contract deployment (<a href="https://tokeny.com/what-should-you-expect-from-a-tokenization-platform-in-2024/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RUs4gACQdk6BbN54jHVqFm74aEPuPDEGCyaq_EE5yfATnaaA2o47yqsavBstKBZv9NvI7">more details here</a>). We are committed to enhancing our APIs and white-label SaaS solutions. Tailored products for diverse segments, ranging from asset managers to Web3 RWA projects, are in development to catalyze the RWA wave and advance the asset digitization phase.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Delivering immediate benefits:&nbsp;Accelerating towards liquidity begins with addressing immediate pain points for institutions. Why tokenize now? It’s all about enhancing operational efficiency and streamlining processes with 3rd parties applications, to slash costs. By solving these points, we can set the stage for bringing enormous high-quality assets on-chain, laying the foundation for the critical mass needed for advanced services, and emphasizing transferability, reach, and liquidity.</p>
 
 Improved operational efficiency:&nbsp;Manual, human-based processes are not just time-consuming but also costly. And it is a common challenge across the entire private market. To tackle this, we’re developing features and smart contracts for various business cases, automating workflows from onboarding, and corporate actions, to secondary tradings. Automation increases operational capability, empowering institutions to reach a larger investor base. 
 Bridging 3rd party digital applications:&nbsp;Another notable challenge arises from the fragmented collaboration between various applications, each operated by different third parties. The multitude of digital applications involved in operations can create gaps when assets are brought on-chain. To address this, our products will continue to connect these disparate solutions, ensuring a cohesive operational workflow between tokenized assets and the involved providers. 
 
<p>3.&nbsp;The powerhouse for major corporations:&nbsp;Our strategy revolves around seamless integration into legacy systems and forming partnerships with tech providers, such as custody solutions, integrators, and financial platforms. Through strategic ecosystem integrations, we empower partners to seamlessly utilize our engine, allowing them to concentrate on their core business and sales while we manage all technical aspects.</p>
<p>Enabling DeFi by building a common data set for private markets:&nbsp;Initiated by accelerating permissioned DeFi, this month, we co-developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/erc-3643-association-members-developed-open-source-ui-components-to-bridge-defi-and-regulated-rwa?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RUs4gACQdk6BbN54jHVqFm74aEPuPDEGCyaq_EE5yfATnaaA2o47yqsavBstKBZv9NvI7">an open-source UI component</a>&nbsp;with Dev.Pro. With this tool, DeFi is now equipped for regulated assets through ERC-3643, enabling any decentralized exchanges (DEX), automated market makers (AMMs), or lending protocol to provide compliant liquidity or collateralization for tokenized securities and RWA. Regulated entities can even launch their lending smart contracts. Our next move involves building a universal data set for tokenized securities through a product named AssetID, facilitating easy access to verifiable asset data for DeFi applications.</p>
<p>Building the distribution rails: DINO is an interoperable distribution network for digital securities that leverages the ERC-3643 standard. Our commitment to growth extends to integrating additional distribution channels into the DINO ecosystem. Compatibility with centralized exchanges (CEX) and AMMs is seamlessly established on our platform. As we eagerly await more DeFi protocols, the open-source UI component stands ready to welcome them. Think of us as a connector, ensuring a seamless convergence of all distribution rails on our platform.</p>
<p>Secondary market innovation:&nbsp;We will unveil an upgraded version of the Billboard, serving as a license-exempted P2P secondary market solution, enabling investors to seamlessly publish buy or sell intentions, just like placing an ad. Taking it a step further, we will introduce a fully decentralized version of the Billboard, entirely powered by smart contracts. This will allow counterparts to accept an offer directly on-chain, facilitating a peer-to-peer transaction. The offer can circulate across the entire distribution network, visible to all, but only eligible investors for the concerned tokens can accept it.</p>
<p>Exciting times lie ahead, and we look forward to embarking on this journey with you. Stay tuned for more developments throughout the year.</p>

 Facial biometrics technology is shaping the future of identity verification, access control, and public safety. As this market grows, poised to reach a staggering $42.1 billion by 2028, it’s essential to understand the drivers, challenges, and opportunities in this dynamic field. Key insights reveal a technology in flux – widely adopted across various sectors yet contending with regulatory hurdles and the rise of AI-generated deepfake fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>The growth of facial biometrics is driven by its effectiveness in streamlining and securing processes across finance, healthcare, and government sectors. This growth is primarily attributed to its ability to improve user experience and security across various domains. 75% of US consumers aged 18-34 reported adopting facial biometrics in 2022. However, this growth has its challenges. Heightened regulatory scrutiny poses significant compliance burdens, particularly from BIPA and the EU. <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/illinois-biometric-privacy-cases-jump-65-after-seminal-ruling">Lawsuits under BIPA</a> have surged, with substantial settlements highlighting the legal risks of non-compliance. Additionally, the rapid advancement of AI technologies, notably deepfake capabilities, presents a new frontier of threats, demanding continuous innovation and investment in defensive strategies.</p>



<p>This backdrop raises a critical question: How can facial biometrics vendors navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and technological threats while capitalizing on the growing market demand?</p>



<p>The answer lies in a dual strategy focusing on compliance and innovation. Vendors must adapt swiftly to regulatory changes, ensuring their solutions align with laws like the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act. Those who quickly achieve compliance can avoid costly legal pitfalls and carve a niche in this competitive market.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, vendors must invest in differentiating their offerings. As the market matures, the emphasis shifts towards advanced features like liveness detection, anti-spoofing, and protection against deepfake attacks. These capabilities will not only offer a competitive edge but also address the burgeoning security concerns associated with AI technologies.</p>



<p>Despite the regulatory and technological challenges, the facial biometrics market is ripe with opportunities. The increasing demand for seamless, secure user experiences drives market growth, especially in public-facing industries like transportation and healthcare. Moreover, public sector adoption, particularly in border control and law enforcement, underlines the technology’s indispensability.</p>



<p>Vendors positioned to navigate the regulatory and technological landscape are set to thrive. The future of facial biometrics hinges on balancing innovation with compliance, ensuring security without sacrificing user convenience. As we look towards this future, one thing is clear: facial biometrics will continue to be a pivotal technology in shaping our digital identities and security paradigms.</p>
