<p>In the Spring of 2021, my manager at the time, Jerry Cuomo, suggested that I start my own podcast. He had—and still has—a podcast called “<a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/The-Art-of-Automation-7315085b/e3917dea">The Art of Automation</a>,” and he suggested that it was a great experience I should have, too.</p>



<p>The topic? “How about hybrid cloud?” he suggested. And that is how the idea and the name were born. Up to that point, I had spent my life trying to express and articulate designs, solutions and experiences in pictures, slide decks, text or, well, code. But a format that is strictly limited to audio was a new and intriguing challenge, and I have enjoyed tackling it from the start.</p>







 A rotating cast of IBM Fellows 



<p>Initially, I thought of putting together a list of relevant topics and then find guests who could join me on episodes to dive deeper into each one. However, I quickly found that it was much easier to make a list of guests to invite and let each of them bring their own perspective on the topic. And I decided to exclusively invite IBM Fellows to be my guests. </p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Fellow">IBM Fellow</a> is the highest accolade given for the technical population at IBM, and there are very few of them. To be exact, there are 89 Fellows at IBM right now. As of this writing, I have had nearly half of them on my podcast, and they have shared an amazing blend of stories, experiences and deep insights with me. Many of the guests touched on various aspects of hybrid cloud—that is the title of the podcast, after all—but quite a few of the episodes are also about the person, their careers and their perspectives on technology, overall.</p>



 Three themes of the podcast 



<p>This journey has brought me to write a brief series of blog posts about these conversations, summarizing what I have learned from this illustrious group. I grouped the episodes into three groups/themes:</p>



 
 Research: What does a researcher do at IBM? What are their characteristics? What are areas of interest being pursued in research for hybrid cloud? 



 The journey to cloud: These episodes basically adhere to the title of the podcast by looking at aspects of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> from an application-developer perspective, from a CIO’s perspective or from a hardware perspective. 



 Life journeys: It goes without saying that every one of my podcast guests has a unique story to tell about their careers (and often their life), and some of them are worth sharing again. 
 



<p>I’ll start with the Research theme here and will create two more posts for the other two.</p>



 Research 



<p>Quite a few of my episodes are with a researcher. Maybe that’s because <a href="https://research.ibm.com/">IBM Research</a> has a significant number of IBM Fellows, or maybe it is because they all work on very interesting things. Regardless, it’s very interesting for me (and hopefully for the podcast listeners) to learn about the various areas of research these people are involved in.</p>



<p>One question I often ask them is the balancing act between wanting to explore and investigate the world—which ultimately drives every researcher I have ever met—with the need to commercialize and monetize the outcomes. &nbsp; </p>



<p>Moreover, I heard some insights about how you prioritize your areas of interest and expertise, when you give up on what looks like a lost cause, and what characteristics they are looking for in young and aspiring researchers to follow in their footsteps.</p>



<p>As far as the topics of research go, it showed me the broad spectrum of technologies in which IBM is engaged. It covers hardware and software, of course, but a significant part is research into topics related to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>. Specifically, <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> (that is, AI using large language models or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">foundation models</a>) has been a center of attention in IBM Research, lately. That also includes related work on <a href="http://ibm.com/analytics/common/smartpapers/ai-governance-smartpaper/">AI governance</a>. Besides that, there are many other forward-looking efforts, and I’ll mention climate change as one example.</p>



 Episode highlights 



<p>Let me also add some personal highlights among all the interesting topics we talked about:</p>



 
 How <a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/The-Hybrid-Cloud-Forecast-Series-28aa3796/1423e0d4">Tamar Eilam</a> arrived at the realization that climate change was a problem she wanted to tackle after having spent years in research related to cloud. Still one of my favorite episodes; we also chatted about what it takes to be a researcher. 



 <a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/The-Hybrid-Cloud-Forecast-Series-28aa3796/5be4c10a">Francesca Rossi</a> shared some insights on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-ethics">AI ethics</a>. While she is organizationally affiliated with our Research division, her work goes way beyond that. AI is not new at all—the related technologies have been used by IBM (and many others) in product for a long time, and doing so in a socially and ethically responsible way is key to what Francesca and her team are doing every day. I cannot stress enough how important this is. 



 <a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/The-Hybrid-Cloud-Forecast-Series-28aa3796/64971010">Gosia Steinder</a> has worked on cloud computing since before it was even called cloud computing. The conversation basically took us from the beginnings of cloud to today, where it is about creating a computing platform that seamlessly spans location and type of cloud provider. 



 A real highlight was the episode with <a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/The-Hybrid-Cloud-Forecast-Series-28aa3796/dfa14d92">Alessandro Curioni</a>. He heads the IBM Research lab in Zurich, which is proud to be home of two teams winning the Nobel Prize for Physics. But that was some time ago; today the focus is on using IT, quantum computing and AI to make “discoveries that matter” to address things like climate change, energy storage or personalized medicine. 
 



<p>You may ask where <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">quantum computing</a> is in all this. Adding at least one episode about quantum has been on my list for a long time. Unfortunately, it hasn’t happened yet. But it’s not for the lack of trying, and I’ll stay on it. Who knows, by the time you read this there may be an episode about it out there.</p>

 Key business challenges facing life insurers 



<p>For several years now, life insurers have been struggling to manage profitability as they face a combination of increasing costs (due to a variety of factors that include inflation, policyholder longevity leading to longer healthcare and annuity payout streams, and the cost of maintaining legacy systems), the need to comply with an increasing regulatory burden, and earning low or negative returns on investments. Although interest rates have increased at an unprecedented rate over the past year due to efforts by central banks to curb inflation, insurers are locked into low-yielding investments, and it will take several years for their investment yields to improve.</p>



<p>Insurers are also struggling with high, mostly fixed costs and the complexities of maintaining legacy systems, which makes current variable cost-based alternatives more attractive. Insurers want to shift from fixed to variable, “pay-as-you-go” operating costs. Core modernization (processes and technology) is a top priority for every insurer.</p>



<p>To accelerate speed-to-market, grow the business with new innovative products and services, gain new and deeper risk insights, and improve customer experience, most companies are also emphasizing digital transformation.</p>



<p>Life insurance companies that have been in business for a long time typically have a significant part of their “book of business” that consists of insurance policies that were issued several years ago, with products they no longer sell. However, they must continue to administer these policies—including premium collections, customer service and benefit payments—until the policies “run-off” the books due to the death of the policyholder or policyholder actions that lead to the termination of the policy.</p>



<p>As the number of “closed-book” policies decreases over time, the insurer has to absorb the fixed cost of their systems and IT infrastructure investment over fewer and fewer policies, resulting in ever-increasing administrative costs per policy. It also often means that the insurer must continue maintaining legacy operational and IT systems that are used for the management of the closed book.</p>



 How is the insurance industry addressing these challenges? 



<p>There are three recurring themes that we see most often:</p>



 1. Core modernization 



<p>Most major insurance companies have determined that their mid-to-long-term strategy is to migrate as much of their application portfolio as possible to the cloud. There are many considerations leading to this strategy—all equally applicable to other industries as well. The six key “game-changing” enablers of cloud are as follows:</p>



 
 Cost flexibility: The ability to shift cost from CapEx to OpEx and from fixed to variable pay-as-you-go models. 



 Business scalability: The ability to allocate and release resources based on demand and gain savings from economies of scale. 



 Market adaptability: The use of cloud speeds time to market for products and services and supports rapid prototyping and innovation. 



 Masked complexity: Cloud enables more sophisticated products to be added to the portfolio while facilitating a simpler user interface for customer interactions. 



 Content-driven variability: The user experience is customized based on the context of the user interaction and knowledge of user preferences, movements and behaviors. 



 Ecosystem connectivity: The use of cloud enables industry-specific platforms that connect to new value nets of partners, customers and other external players. 
 



<p>Depending on the size of the application portfolio (which, for the medium- to large-sized insurers, typically is between 1,000 and 5,000 applications) and the geographical dispersion of their business units, companies have created 5- to 10-year roadmaps for completing their “application modernization” and “mainframe modernization” initiatives.</p>



<p>Many Insurance companies that embarked on this journey two or three years ago have come to the realization that they require a hybrid multicloud approach, with some of the very old and complex policy administration, claims, underwriting and actuarial systems continuing to run on an IBM mainframe (possibly utilizing a “Mainframe as a Service” contract with an IT Service Provider). They may need to either do a “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/lift-and-shift">lift and shift</a>” (e.g., operating under <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vmware">IBM Cloud&nbsp;for VMware Solutions</a>) or actually modernize, refactor and containerize the other legacy systems and operate them in a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> mode.</p>



<p>IBM’s hybrid multicloud approach—when combined with the best-in-class security and compliance control features enabled for IBM Industry Cloud Platforms workloads and our deep industry expertise in mission-critical processes—offers a compelling value proposition to large insurers in all geographies. We are assisting several prominent companies in every geography on their core modernization journey.</p>



 2. Digital transformation 



<p>Insurance companies are reducing cost and providing better customer experience by using automation, digitizing the business, and encouraging customers to use self-service channels. It used to be that insurance companies used a combination of automated workflow, a business rules engine and content management software. With the advent of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, however, companies are now implementing cognitive process automation that enables self-service options for customers and agents self-service and assists in automating many other functions, such as the IT Help Desk and employee HR capabilities.</p>



<p>The introduction of ChatGPT capabilities has generated a lot of interest in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">generative AI foundation models</a> (these are pre-trained on unlabeled datasets and leverage self-supervised learning with the help of Large Language Models using a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-vs-neural-networks">neural network</a>). Foundation models are becoming an essential ingredient of new AI-based workflows, and IBM Watson products have been using foundation models since 2020.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supervised-learning">supervised learning</a> that is used to train AI requires a lot of human effort, is difficult, requires intensive labeling and takes months of effort. On the other hand, self-supervised learning is computer powered, requires little labeling and is quick, automated and efficient. IBM’s experience with foundation models indicates that there is between 10x and 100x decrease in labeling requirements and a 6x decrease in training time.</p>



<p>IBM has integrated foundation models with several Watson products, including software like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-discovery">IBM Watson Discovery</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-private/3.2.0?topic=paks-watson-explorer">IBM Watson Explorer</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant">IBM Watson Assistant</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-text-to-speech">IBM Text to Speech</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text">IBM Watson Speech to Text</a>. IBM foundation models are pre-trained on curated data. A user can train, validate, fine-tune/prompt-tune and deploy pre-trained foundation models incorporating domain data with ease to drive better conversational experiences and result in faster trusted responses. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">Watsonx</a> is a new AI and data platform that includes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a>—a studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning.&nbsp;The following chart shows the approximate number of model parameters used, by domain, to scale up the AI foundation models:</p>







 3. Addressing the “closed-book” challenge 



<p>New players like consolidators (including private equity firms), have entered the insurance market and shown that investments in closed-book insurance portfolios can still create value. In the top five European insurance markets, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/running-up-on-runoff-strategic-options-for-life-closed-books">McKinsey analysis</a> indicates investment yields in the 2018 to 2020 period varied by country, ranging from 2-5%. The ROE ranges also varied by country, from &nbsp;–5% to +13% [1].</p>



 
 Several insurers have created separate entities to manage their closed-book insurance portfolios. They focus on keeping their closed-book administrative costs under control and seek opportunities to cross-sell newer insurance products to closed-book customers. They often use third-party administrators (TPAs) to manage the closed book, with costs agreed on contractually in multi-year deals. IBM has multi-year TPA contracts with some large insurers for administering their closed-book life insurance business. 



 External closed-book consolidators acquire closed books and seek scale, operational efficiencies, and superior asset and investment management to drive profitability. Private equity has entered this market and set up consolidator subsidiaries. Some well-known consolidators are Phoenix, Athora, Catalina Re, Monument Re, Compre and Fortitude Re. 



 Some external closed-book consolidators have found it difficult to grow sufficiently through acquisitions of closed books alone, so they are also acquiring new open-book policies in order to scale their operations and generate better business margins. 
 



<p>Although tightly controlling costs is the primary driver and the market for administering closed-book life insurance portfolios is very competitive, there are very few companies with a modern, cloud-based insurance platform that offers the game-changing capabilities summarized above. IBM has deep experience in architecting and deploying such an insurance platform solution on IBM Cloud.</p>



 How is IBM helping insurance companies prepare for the future? 



<p>IBM is one of the very few companies globally that can bring together the range of capabilities needed to completely transform the manner in which insurance is marketed, sold, underwritten, serviced and paid.</p>



<p>Companies need to get a good understanding of data (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/structured-vs-unstructured-data">structured and unstructured</a>), organize it, manage it in a secure manner (while complying with industry regulations) and enable instant access to the “right” data. This capability is fundamental to providing superior customer experience, attracting new customers, retaining existing customers and getting the deep insights which can lead to developing new innovative products (e.g., as required for a “Gig Economy”). It also helps improve underwriting decisions, reduce fraud and control costs. IBM’s Data Architectures and automation software operating on cloud are being implemented by leading insurers in all geographies.</p>



 Application and mainframe modernization 



<p>Many companies make <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">application </a>modernization decisions without having a holistic view of their application portfolio and the underlying technologies being used. They also do not have a well-defined target state and make decisions such as “we want to move claims to cloud” without a clear view of all the cloud services they may need to consume, potentially in a hybrid cloud target environment.</p>



<p>IBM’s approach to modernization begins with understanding the company’s business and technology environment/workloads and assessing modernization needs, driven by both business and technology priorities. We then align value propositions with problem statements. A well-defined target architecture (including the technology stack and the application services/microservices) is key to successful application and mainframe modernization efforts. This chart shows our approach to modernization.</p>



 IBM’s solution for administering closed-book portfolios 



<p>IBM has a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/industries/insurance">well-architected, secure core insurance platform</a> for life and group insurance operating on the cloud. This enables insurance companies using the insurance platform to reduce their operating costs as their book of business declines and policies “run off.” Companies that plan to issue new policies using this platform will benefit from the flexibility and business scalability that is offered by operating on a cloud-native solution. We leverage technology to promote automated processing for the majority of insurance transactions, we and use AI- and analytics-assisted decisioning by underwriters, claims adjusters and medical professionals for the more complex transactions.</p>

<p>Nitish Deshpande, Research Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts will examine the concept of Policy Based Access Control (PBAC), looking at what that entails, as well as the security and business advantages of adopting this approach to identity management.</p>
<p>Kurt Berghs, Product Manager at TrustBuilder will explain how using PBAC with personas consolidates multiple accounts across disparate systems into one user profile for each identity, enables the management of user lifecycles, secures complex environments, and allows organizations to delegate rights enabled with self-service.</p>

<p>This Dev Pulse brings a new release for the 0.1.x branch of Holochain. We’re still recommending that you stick with this branch for now, as we’re still troubleshooting performance issues in the 0.2.x branch.</p><p>Meanwhile, a goodly number of our team and community are en route or at DWeb Camp, where we’ll be involved in all sorts of ways — including being a sponsor!</p> Holochain 0.1.5: Backwards compatibility fixes <p>As you may have <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-01x-series-skip-014-wait-for-015">read</a> in the last Dev Pulse, I recommended that you not upgrade your hApp and userbase to Holochain 0.1.4, and instead wait for 0.1.5. Well here’s 0.1.5, with a bugfix for the broken dev environment (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2252?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2252</a>) as well as:</p>  There’s a compatibility path for a change to the database schema introduced in 0.1.4, so you can use 0.1.5 on databases created by older conductors (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2253?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2253</a>).  Some housekeeping tasks backported from 0.2: removal of the testing framework from the default build of the conductor (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2312?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2312</a>), and repair of a remote signals test (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2318?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2318</a>).  Breaking (sort of): 0.1.4 fixed a bug whereby a DNA’s name was mistakenly included when hashing the DNA. This broke some apps in the wild, so it’s been reverted (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2312?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2312</a>) and the correct functionality will appear in 0.2 onwards. This is not a breaking change if you’re updating your hApp from Holochain 0.1.3 to 0.1.5; it’s only breaking if you’re updating from 0.1.4.  <p>Additionally, you may want to read all the changes in 0.1.4 (with the exception that the last bullet point above reverts a change introduced in 0.1.4). Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/compare/holochain-0.1.3...holochain-0.1.5?ref=blog.holochain.org#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed">full changelog since 0.1.3</a>.</p> Known issues   In large-scale stress tests (around 200+ highly active nodes per conductor) we’re noticing some performance issues. These show up as zome call timeouts, high virtual memory usage, and dropped WebSocket connections — in short, the conductor gradually becomes unresponsive and needs to be restarted. We’re all-hands-on-deck troubleshooting this issue right now, and we believe it might also be present in 0.2.x and 0.3.x.  An out-of-bounds memory error is occasionally happening; depending on the circumstances, this can cause subsequent zome calls to fail. We’re putting in more tracing throughout the codebase to diagnose issues like this.  There’s a rounding error in the sharding algorithm that causes mismatches in the region of data being synced. (You can find out about regions in this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/quantised-gossip-optional-countersigners/#holochain-00147-quantised-gossip">Dev Pulse</a> from last year.) As we’re nearing the end of the six-month support promise for 0.1, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2332?ref=blog.holochain.org">fix for that</a> will land in 0.2.1.   Launcher release notes  0.9.4: UX improvements, bugfixes <p>This version has a few fixes, including better App Library download feedback, improved German translation, better error handling, and a bugfix for web forms on Linux.</p> 0.10.0: Holochain 0.1.5 support, more UX improvements <p>This version comes with Holochain 0.1.5. And it continues to get UX polish thanks to our friend Tibet Sprague from <a href="https://terran.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Terran Collective</a>. He’s been redesigning various parts of the UI to make things more accessible for everyone.</p><p>The most important UX change is mostly invisible — the hApp store no longer requires you to be part of the DevHub DNA and sync all the data. Instead, your node will look for a DevHub host and request the download from them. This means you don’t have to wait until you’re a full peer in the DevHub network before you can download hApp packages, which speeds up the first-run experience.</p>A screenshot of the new settings pane in the Launcher UI, showing the amount of resources each Holochain version is using, along with settings for each hApp, which used to be on the main pane.&nbsp;<p>There are a lot of changes; too many to list here. Just <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.10.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">download the Launcher</a> and see for yourself. And this is just a start — you’ll see more UX work in future releases!</p><p>This version is a breaking change, in that hApps that you installed in previous versions of the Launcher won’t show up in this version.</p> Known issues <p>Launcher is built on a Rust library called <a href="https://tauri.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tauri</a>, which is similar to Electron but of course Rust-based. It uses the operating system’s default web view library to display UIs. As such, we inherit any bugs that exist upstream in Tauri. Here are the ones we know about:</p>  Downloading files from a hApp that supports it is not supported on macOS.  App windows don’t have their own menu on macOS.  Trying to open a hApp UI that’s already open but minimised will not bring it to the front on some Linux distros.  Because of the dependency on the system web view, your hApp UI should target the built-in browser of the oldest desktop OS that your userbase is using.  As an example of this from the Launcher UI itself, on macOS Monterey the toggle switch for the new ‘developer mode’ (which allows you to become a DevHub host and upload packages to the hApp store) doesn’t toggle on.  hApp UIs that use WebRTC aren’t supported on Linux.  Launcher can freeze on macOS when an app is opened in full-screen view.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.10.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">Download Launcher 0.9.5</a>.</p> Quick update on Holochain 0.2.1 progress <p>We were planning to release a new version quick on the heels of Holochain 0.2.0 to repair both a peer discovery issue and some network performance issues. The peer discovery issue is fixed, but we’re still troubleshooting the performance issues where there is less to no gossip between peers until one of them publishes a new piece of data. In doing so, we're also building more robust testing tooling to get finer-grained insight into them. We expect to release 0.2.1 soon given what we've recently learned.</p><p>At this point, we recommend that you stick with 0.1.5. You’re still welcome to try out the 0.2.x series releases (and dev candidates in the 0.3.x series — in fact <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a> is in the process of upgrading to 0.3 already); just be prepared for the aforementioned bottlenecks. We’re also planning to roll some of the work already done on 0.3 into 0.2.1, giving it features we didn’t expect the 0.2.x series to have. Stay tuned!</p> Getting ready for DWeb Camp <p>We’re really looking forward to <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> in Navarro, CA, USA, which started on Wednesday, 21 June. A good number of us from the Holochain community and team from across the world are attending, volunteering, giving talks, hosting discussions, and taking care of meeting spaces. Not only that, but we’ll be a camp sponsor for the first time this year.</p><p>DWeb Camp will be a time for connecting, making new relationships with devs who don’t yet know that Holochain is the thing they’re looking for, and of course showing the DWeb community what Holochain can do. The theme this year is ‘Discovering Flows’, which is a lovely description of what happens there. I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">really enjoyed</a> last year. We’ll be sharing how this year went when we get back!</p>Art and Eric lead a conversation on DAOs at DWeb Camp 2022, with a few others from the Holochain community also among the participants.&nbsp;<p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@promemouse?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Dian Yu</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ZV7CO7hpZdA?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

  WTR II applies to EU-based Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and also comes into play when these EU-based CASPs send crypto transactions to a non-EU-based party.  CASPs must collect and retain sender and receiver information for crypto transfers exceeding 1,000&nbsp;Euros.  Through WTR II, the EU is actively seeking to enhance transparency and accountability in crypto transactions.  <p>In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies, regulatory frameworks are constantly playing catch-up.</p><p>The European Union (EU), known for being a forerunner in policy changes, has once again taken a bold leap forward with the introduction of Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II), sometimes called Transfer of Funds regulation. And as these regulations tighten, the crypto sector must step up to the challenge of ensuring compliance while preserving user privacy and security.</p><p>WTR II, in line with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule, aims to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terror financing. It mandates the exchange of sender and receiver information during crypto transactions.</p><p>With this requirement, the EU aims to usher in a paradigm shift, significantly affecting anonymity, which many would rate as the most prized feature of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The key to navigating these new regulatory waters lies in finding a solution that can reconcile the need for compliance with the equally important need to safeguard user data. One such promising solution is <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Veriscope</a>, Shyft Network’s very own Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>With Shyft Veriscope, we not only allow for the seamless exchange of user data amongst VASPs, but we also manage to do so without storing data on third-party servers or our own, keeping data privacy&nbsp;intact.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope’s peer-to-peer model also helps VASPs comply with the FATF Travel Rule frictionlessly. Moreover, it offers an automated process that minimizes any negative impact on user experience, a major concern for many crypto businesses.</p><p>Although the EU isn’t likely to endorse a specific method for user data exchange, the onus is on VASPs to find a way to conform to the new regulations with minimal disruption. This means adopting a solution like Shyft Veriscope that can offer the necessary balance between compliance and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As the crypto industry grapples with these challenges, solutions like Shyft Veriscope represent a beacon of hope. It demonstrates the potential for harmonious coexistence between regulatory compliance and user privacy, thereby shaping the future of cryptocurrencies in a progressively regulated environment.</p> When Does WTR II&nbsp;Apply? <p>The Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II) primarily applies under two key circumstances.</p><p>The first is when a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP), such as a cryptocurrency exchange, is involved in facilitating a crypto transaction. This facilitation includes activities such as executing, managing, or advising on the transaction.</p><p>The second circumstance is geographic in nature. If the CASP operates or has its registered office within the European Union (EU), the WTR II comes into effect. This geographic condition makes the WTR II relevant not just within the EU but also when an EU-based CASP engages in crypto transactions with entities outside the&nbsp;EU.</p> Information Obligations <p>For crypto-asset transfers, WTR II places obligations on the CASPs to gather and retain specific information about the transaction’s sender (originator) and the recipient (beneficiary). The aim is to ensure traceability of transactions, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability.</p><p>In case of missing or incomplete information about a transaction, it could be flagged as potentially risky. This necessitates the CASP to assess whether the transaction might be suspicious, possibly warranting reporting to the relevant financial intelligence unit under the EU’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing legislative framework.</p><p>As such, WTR II, in its essence, functions as a comprehensive guideline, not merely a regulatory rule. It fosters transparency, safeguards users, and combats illicit activities in the dynamic world of crypto-assets. And hence, for businesses, comprehending the nuances of its scope is crucial to navigating the compliance landscape where the stakes are high, and adherence to rules is paramount.</p> Exceptions to the&nbsp;Rule <p>EU’s Wire Transfer Regulation (WTR II) has a broad reach, yet it’s not an all-encompassing rule for every crypto transaction. There are certain scenarios where WTR II doesn’t&nbsp;apply.</p><p>For instance, when both the originator and the beneficiary of a transaction are Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) acting independently, WTR II provisions do not apply. Why is it so? WTR II assumes that both parties involved are aware of their actions and responsibilities.</p><p>The same goes for person-to-person crypto transfers without a CASP’s involvement. In such cases, the transaction happens directly between individuals, not unlike a cash handover, and thus, WTR II doesn’t apply in such a circumstance.</p> Self-Hosted Nuances <p>Now, let’s navigate the complex world of self-hosted wallets. These are personal crypto wallets that users manage independently, unlike wallets provided by a crypto exchange.</p><p>If a CASP’s client sends or receives funds to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must collect information about both parties. However, they typically aren’t required to verify the self-hosted wallet user’s identity.</p><p>But here’s the twist: when a transaction involves more than 1000 Euros and is facilitated by a CASP to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP has to ensure that the client indeed controls the self-hosted wallet.</p><p>Picture this as a safety check to verify the identity of the individual involved in a high-value transaction, similar to the protocols banks&nbsp;follow.</p><p>However, for transfers that occur between accounts managed entirely within the framework of the CASPs — like those on a cryptocurrency exchange — this 1000 Euro threshold for additional verification doesn’t&nbsp;apply.</p><p>So, while WTR II applies to most crypto transactions, it still leaves room to provide enough flexibility.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What is the Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR&nbsp;II)? <p>The Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II) is an initiative of the European Union intended to curb the purported use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering and terrorism financing.</p> Q2: Who does WTR II apply&nbsp;to? <p>WTR II applies to all EU-based CASPs and cases where an EU-based CASP sends crypto transactions to a non-EU-based party.</p> Q3: What information obligations does WTR II place on&nbsp;CASPs? <p>WTR II imposes specific obligations on CASPs with regard to crypto-asset transfers. CASPs are required to collect and hold detailed information about both the sender (originator) and the recipient (beneficiary) involved in a transaction. And if the necessary information is incomplete or missing, the transaction could be flagged as potentially risky.</p> Q4: Are there exceptions to WTR&nbsp;II? <p>Yes, exceptions to WTR II exist. For instance, the regulation does not apply when both the originator and the beneficiary of a transaction are CASPs acting independently. Similarly, it does not govern person-to-person crypto transfers conducted without a CASP’s involvement.</p> Q5: How does WTR II affect self-hosted wallets? <p>WTR II has a specific impact on self-hosted wallets. When a client of a CASP transfers funds to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must gather information about both parties. However, when a transaction exceeds 1000 Euros and involves a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must confirm that the client truly controls the self-hosted wallet.</p> Final Note <p>As the crypto industry continues to expand and mature, regulatory frameworks like WTR II are playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of crypto transactions. The key challenge lies in balancing the need for robust AML and CTF measures while preserving the privacy and security that make cryptocurrencies attractive.</p><p>Amid this shifting landscape, solutions like Shyft Veriscope are proving instrumental. By enabling CASPs to comply with WTR II and FATF’s Travel Rule in a manner that respects user privacy, Shyft Veriscope demonstrates the potential for harmonious coexistence of regulatory compliance and data protection. This is a significant step forward in navigating the compliance challenges and the fast-paced evolution of the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>Indeed, the introduction of WTR II serves as a stern reminder that regulations are as much a part of the crypto industry as innovation and disruption. By understanding and adapting to these changes, the crypto sector can continue its upward trajectory while ensuring a safer and more transparent environment for all participants.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>With the explosion of Software as a service applications, organizations are juggling a lot – from rollout out hybrid/remote work policies; supporting employee, contractor and vendor hiring and off-boarding; managing various identities, and ensuring only authorized users have access to what their job requires. This work has become critical to ensuring smooth processes, preventing account take over (ATO) attacks and reducing costs.</p>
<p>System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is transforming Identity and Access Management in SaaS platforms, workflow, and Identity lifecycle management. SCIM is an open standard protocol designed to simplify the management of identities in cloud-based applications and services. SCIM provides predefined schema for users and groups, and a RESTful API, for automatic user provisioning and deprovisioning, making it easier for systems and applications to communicate identity-related data.</p>
<p>The key benefits for using SCIM based provisioning are preventing account takeover, mitigate the risk of dormant accounts, and achieve cost savings through permission rightsizing and streamlined onboarding &amp; offboarding processes.</p>
<p>User Provisioning &amp; De-provisioning</p>
<p>For an organization that uses multiple SaaS applications like O365, Salesforce, Slack, WorkDay, Webex, and Dropbox amongst others, manually creating and managing user access for these applications is time consuming and carries high security risks. For example when a new employee joins the organization, an IT administrator would have to individually create access across all these applications, a process that can take hours, if not days. Similarly, when an employee leaves or changes roles within the organization, it is critical to swiftly revoke all access to prevent potential misuse. Implementing SCIM can streamline and automate this process. For instance, when integrated with an Identity Provider (IdP) like Entrust IDaaS, any change in the user status gets automatically updated across all the SaaS applications connected with IDaaS. So, a new user added to Entrust IDaaS gets automatically provisioned in Salesforce, Slack, Workday, Webex, and Dropbox, while an employee leaving the organization gets deactivated immediately, thus preventing unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Streamlining Workflow Management</p>
<p>Each application has it’s own user management, making it challenging to maintain data consistency. For example, if an employee moves from one department to another, their access rights need to be updated in each application – which can lead to inconsistencies if done manually. However, with SCIM, changes made in the central identity management system like Entrust IDaaS is automatically propagated through all connected applications, ensuring up-to-date and consistent access privileges, which enhances workflow management and overall efficiency.</p>
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management</p>
<p>For a rapidly growing tech startup, frequent identity lifecycle events include onboarding new employees, assigning them to projects, updating their roles, and offboarding them when leaving the organization. Each ‘identity lifecycle event’ must be accurately reflected in the organization’s systems and applications to prevent dormant or under / over privileged accounts that could cause potential security threats.</p>
<p>Automating user provisioning and deprovisioning process across different platforms through SCIM will ensure that the update is mirrored across all integrated systems and applications. Direct integration with HR Systems like Workday can kickstart the entire Identity Lifecycle Management of the new, moving or departing employee. Such automated governance with least privilege access helps organizations deploy zero trust framework / architecture (ZTA) that leads to sustained high levels of security.</p>
<p>Cost-Saving</p>
<p>In addition to strengthening security and lifecycle management, deploying SCIM can also yield cost savings through automation, reducing the manual effort involved in identity management. For example, if an IT administrator typically spends 20 minutes managing each user’s access rights across five different applications, then an organization with 1000 employees will need to invest more than 330 hours just for a single round of access updates. With SCIM, this effort can be cut down, saving substantial labor costs while also minimizing the possibility of human errors that could lead to even more costly security incidents.</p>
<p>SCIM is not only a protocol for managing digital identities; it is an essential tool that can enhance an organization’s security posture through a Zero Trust framework, streamlined workflows, and yield cost savings. By automating and standardizing identity management, SCIM alleviates the risks associated with account takeover, reduces the potential security threats posed by dormant and over privileged accounts, and introduces significant efficiency into identity lifecycle management processes.</p>
<p>Entrust IDaaS provides out of box SCIM capabilities to organizations of all sizes.</p>

<p>In a recent survey that spanned six countries, Entrust found that while progress is being made in the way that governments and citizens interact, there is definitely room for improvement.</p>
<p>The vast majority of respondents (84%) interact with governments between one and five times each year, pursuing typical outcomes – a driver’s license, paying taxes, and traveling. It’s no surprise that almost four out of ten respondents (39%) prefer the convenience of web portals over more traditional interaction methods such as mail (5%) and in-person (15%). And while preferences favor digital interactions, governments still must deliver the services and the credentials that citizens require − offering both digital and physical to ensure equal access to services and meet the preferences of its citizens and service providers alike.</p>
<p>Citizen interaction preferences</p>
<p></p>
<p>To meet the evolving needs of its citizens, governments are working with the private sector to deliver the outcomes citizens require. We’re heading toward a simple, smooth, and secure user experience from entry into the system, through the issuance of credentials and completing the required transactions – all relying on a single chain of trust that ensures the privacy and security of personal information and government systems.</p>
 Only half rated their digital interactions as positive 
<p>Overall, respondents rated their last government interaction at 7.1 on a 10-point scale. But when it comes to their last digital interaction, barely half (54%) rated those interactions as positive. While a 7.1 overall rating isn’t terrible by any means, there’s room for improvement. And it’s telling that only half of citizens, who are moving to faster and more convenient methods of interaction, were left with a positive impression. There’s clearly work to be done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Citizens’ pain points with government interactions</p>
<p></p>
 Governments are paying attention…and taking action 
<p>In the countries we surveyed, citizens improving customer service is important to respondents. And many governments know it’s time to step up and simplify end-user experiences, as well as drive operational efficiencies and greater security. In the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2023/entrust-wins-uk-home-office-tender-to-expand-digitization-of-immigration-processes">a new solution</a> enables a streamlined, more seamless way for travelers coming to the UK to be identified via biometrics, bringing more secure border control and speeding up identity and border checks. In the United States, “Delivering Excellent, Equitable, and Secure Federal Services and Customer Experience” is the number two priority on the <a href="https://www.performance.gov/pma/cx/">President’s management agenda</a>. The administration has gone so far as to designate 14 agencies as “High Impact Service Providers” and put the following strategies in place:</p>
 
 Improve the service design, digital products, and customer-experience management of Federal <a href="https://www.performance.gov/cx/assets/files/HISP-listing-2021.pdf">High Impact Service Providers</a> by reducing customer burden, addressing inequities, and streamlining processes. 
 Design, build, and manage government service delivery for key life experiences that cut across Federal agencies. 
 Identify and prioritize the development of Federal shared products, services, and standards that enable simple, seamless, and secure customer experiences across the Federal Government1. 
 
 Digital interactions are important and preferred, but phone, mail, and in-person remain important 
<p>Undoubtedly, phone calls, mail, and in-person interactions will remain among peoples preferences, and governments have the responsibility to make these services equally available to all. Citizens must have digital, physical, and hybrid credentials to fulfill the outcomes they’re after and the Entrust survey responses bear that out. People are asking for quick, convenient services at their fingertips.</p>
<p>Below is how respondents ranked what is important to them:</p>



1
Service when and where it’s needed
55%


2
Secure, easy, and convenient identity verification
53%


3
Customer data privacy and security is a priority
49%


4
Self-service capabilities
44%


5
Ability to track progress
44%


6
Online forms
43%


7
Consistent user experience across government organizations
36%


8
Engage on behalf of others
8%



<p>People are asking for the customer experience they’ve come to expect from their favorite retailers and banks. </p>
 Getting to simple, smooth, and secure. There’s good news and bad news. 
<p>The bad news is that from a technical perspective, simple, smooth, and secure experiences crash head-on into:</p>
 
 Legacy apps 
 Multiple independent solution providers 
 A growing and dynamic threat landscape 
 
<p>The good news is that the challenges presented on the journey to becoming simple, smooth, and secure are being overcome and improvements are within reach.</p>
 
 Composable systems break older models of rigid software development practices and introduce modularity − allowing organizations to quickly design, build, manage, and change systems as the needs of organizations evolve. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) address connectivity to legacy systems and stem the proliferation of vendors, and costs, simplifying and shortening the citizen experience. Systems become easier to deploy, maintain, and scale. 
 A single chain of trust reduces the attack surface and keeps citizen information safe. 
 Enabling the right credential for the right transaction means
 
 No citizen is left behind 
 People get what they need for the outcome they seek leading to happier citizens and increased trust in government 
 Strong identities and authentication methods can lower the risk of fraud 
 
 
 
<p>The next blog in our government-citizen series interactions will explore the similarities and differences among countries and age groups. Are we all really all that different?</p>
 Methodology 
<p>To assess the perceptions, experiences, and preferences of citizens about their interactions with government, Entrust engaged an independent research firm in May 2023. 3,501 online survey responses were received from people between the ages of 18 and 75 residing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany UK, and USA. Only responses that met age and geographic qualifications were included, and respondents had to have interacted with the government in the previous 12 months.</p>

 Exploring the challenges, opportunities, and necessity for cross collaboration. 



 



<p>Attempting to draw similarities between two different industries may not seem the most productive use of one’s time, but there are valuable insights to be gained, if you look hard enough. Let us take the financial services and gambling industries, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the obvious risks in the financial market and the speculative nature of trading, the banking and gambling industry have more in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5370364/">common than one might expect</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both face similar risks, <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/handle/123456789/86115">including</a> operational risk, regulatory compliance, money laundering, liquidity, solvency risk, IT and cyber risks, and reputational risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both invariably have an Enterprise Risk Management function, which, as the name suggests, carries out risk management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As financial services and the gambling industry are both prime targets for fraud and money laundering, there is value in organizations from both sectors implementing a dedicated KYC program to help them comply with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">Terrorist Financing</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJ0KHXidf_AhWCgVwKHacTBaQQFnoECA8QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgdpr-info.eu%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1akHzzz224Oq1yU0pd6qSw&amp;opi=89978449">GDPR regulations</a>.</p>



 Blocking new illegal, intertwined paths. 



<p>In April 2023, a first of a kind trial took place in Basildon Crown Court in the UK. <a href="https://www.essex.police.uk/news/essex/news/news/2023/april/man-jailed-after-betting-fraud/">Jon Howard was found guilty of defrauding Bet365</a>, after the Essex Serious Crime Directorate confirmed he had used more 1,000 identities to abuse bonuses, which, had he been successful, would have netted him £236,000. (Read more about some of the ways that criminals abuse sign-up bonuses in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">‘Exploring bonus abuse in gambling’</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Howard tried to legitimatize these funds via a mortgage application where he added details of a fake job. He was recently sentenced to a five-year jail sentence. In both gambling and financial services, fraudsters continue to find more creative ways in exposing weaknesses in controls. And, as the latest tricks tend to appear in one sector before the other, there is significant incentive for collaboration between the two industries.</p>



 Desperately seeking a global gambling regulatory framework. 



<p>The gambling industry has encountered fast-paced growth in recent years. Indeed, the proliferation of high-speed internet and mobile devices have made it even easier for individuals to access online gambling platforms from the comfort of their own homes or on the go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This convenience factor has attracted a larger number of people to engage in online gambling activities. COVID-19 and multiple quarantine periods further cemented the expansion of online gambling. Despite the rapid growth, many national authorities and regulatory bodies have been slow off the mark in updating regulations or providing the industry with some much-needed clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the UK’s much delayed revision of the Gambling Act 2005 in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">‘Preparing for the UK gambling white paper’</a> here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gambling industry is categorized as a Designated Non-Financial Business and Profession (DNFBP), providing gambling services for entertainment purposes. The gambling industry also engages in similar activities to financial institutions, such as accepting and withdrawing funds. As such, players in both the gambling industry and financial services industry are required to hold a license to operate in most European Union (EU) countries. Traditionally, if you wanted to operate in multiple EU countries, then you would need multiple licenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, however, there have been substantial efforts to ease the headache of operating throughout Europe. In fact, <a href="https://www.egba.eu/eu-market/licensing/">multi-licensing has been adopted in 25 out of 29 European countries</a>,&nbsp; introducing full multi-licensing for all regulated online gambling products, according to the European Gaming &amp; Betting Association. In 2018, the EGBA <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2018/12/Manifesto-A-EU-Framework-for-Online-Gambling-2.0.pdf">published a manifesto</a> to appeal for a globalized regulatory framework for online gambling operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recommending a deepened standardization in the business, the Association is pushing for a more comprehensive regulatory framework to avoid “unnecessary compliance and supervision costs” and limit the risks of non-compliance. This would also have a direct impact on the risk exposure to fraud and money laundering. In fact, during its <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/eu-context-anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism_en#documents">periodic supra-national risk assessments</a> in 2022, the European Commission said it <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/compliance/eu-ups-money-laundering-risk-in-online-gambling-to-highest-level/">considered online gambling</a> “to be especially vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing, with this risk categorized as&nbsp; the highest possible risk level.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, gambling operators would be wise to take a few lessons from the financial services industry to better understand its regulations, and the processes they use to protect themselves against fraud, money laundering, and other types of financial crime. As KYC programs are slowly becoming the norm within multiple industries – from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> – gambling operators should follow suit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step one should be for all gambling operators to familiarize themselves with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> (AML) and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/#:~:text=Terrorism%20financing%20encompasses%20numerous%20actions,instruments%20to%20support%20terrorist%20operations.">Terrorist Financing</a> regulations. Step two is to implement stronger KYC mechanisms. With a robust KYC program in place, gambling operators can anticipate potential regulatory developments and be ready with top notch compliance programs.</p>

 The opportunities that lie ahead. 



<p>Banks encounter significant challenges when collaborating with gambling operators due to the elevated levels of risk and potential for fraud. One of the key challenges is to navigate complex regulatory requirements and AML laws that apply to gambling activities. The cash-intensive nature of the gambling industry further exacerbates the risk, as large financial transactions only increase the potential for illicit funds to be circulated. Understandably, therefore, banks are far more reticent to work with gambling operators, as they represent a higher risk. But there is still value in collaboration, or as mentioned, at least being aware of what is happening in the other&nbsp; industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between credit card fraud, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse</a>, price scraping or account takeover, gambling platforms are often at the forefront of fraud trends, and how best to counter them. Additionally, the gambling industry’s ability to deal with multiple means of payments (<a href="https://www.egba.eu/home-page/at-the-forefront-of-online-payments-innovation/">33 different types in 2018 alone for EGBA members</a>) just goes to show how expansive their experience is in tackling online payment fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, it is no secret that gambling operators are leaders in cultivating customer engagement. Many utilize the latest technology and data analytics to provide seamless, personalized customer journeys, enhance the user experience and retain players. Both <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">fintechs</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">traditional banks</a> should learn from gambling operators and take similar steps to improve the customer experience by meeting and even exceeding customer expectations.</p>



 United we stand. 



<p>While the regulatory framework may bear a heavier weight on financial services than gambling operators, the latter can certainly learn from the best controls and monitoring practices of the former.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To protect against fraud and money laundering, collaboration is a must. As most fraudsters tend to work across multiple industries and targets at any one time, banking and gambling operators can benefit greatly from exchanging information and best practices. For example, by providing feedback on fraud detection systems, secure payment processing or even staff training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professional associations, such as <a href="https://www.egba.eu/">EGBA</a> or <a href="https://www.acfe.com/">Association of Certified Examiner</a>, are two legitimate places to collaborate and exchange. More informal channels like forums or event panels are other valuable channels to gain intelligence on the latest fraud techniques and money laundering trends, and the best ways of identifying criminal and suspicious activities.</p>

<p>The eco-conscious movement is unmistakably a global environmental concern that continues to gain momentum as we see the impacts to our daily lives. Consumers and <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">world leaders</a> recognize that carbon footprints must be reduced, requiring and challenging their business partners (vendors, customers, etc.) to make measurable changes now. Many organizations are taking calculated eco-actions in various product segments: everything from electronics, housewares, clothing and batteries to heavy duty motors and industrial equipment. Careful life-cycle considerations are evaluated at every product stage, from design and concept to end-of-life.</p>
<p>Credit cards are no different. Consumers demand eco-friendly materials, card recycling programs, and even more importantly, the assurance that their bank or credit union is actively engaged in these programs. Increasingly, many products now demonstrate their own unique eco-journey to include these lifecycle eco-considerations along the way – packaging, production efficiency, waste, green-certified buildings, etc. The mere ability to recycle something isn’t enough and even though the term “eco” is many times in absentia of standards or regulations, it’s becoming one of the highest priorities in consumer goods.</p>
<p>What exactly is the scope of eco-cards and why is it important? Traditional credit card materials are typically some variant of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), widely known as the <a href="https://www.ciel.org/project-update/plastic-climate-the-hidden-costs-of-a-plastic-planet/">biggest contributor to global plastics proliferation</a>. Although the credit card form factor is small, global annual card production is estimated to be 3.3 billion cards in 2023, drawing scrutiny around the total lifecycle, use case, and further debate around physical vs. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/04/trends-in-passport-personalization/">digital card</a> issuance. Purists believe the ultimate form of an environmentally conscious card is a digital one. Realistically, the continuation of hybrid credential issuance (the issuance of both digital and physical credentials to cardholders) will remain steady in the near future as <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/us-consumers-prefer-seamless-and-fully-integrated-payment-experiences-new-entrust-survey-reveals">consumers demand both alternatives for different use cases</a>.</p>
<p>More and more companies are driving sustainability efforts into their initiatives, with an increasing trend in qualifying eco-materials. The breadth of these green programs is far and wide, varying from a fractional percentage in material reduction to biodegradable, recycled PVC, PLA, PETG, R, O, P, and everything in between. <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/blogs/2022/11/30/sustainable-banking-payment-cards/">ABI forecasts an 18% decrease</a> in the use of PVC in global card production by 2026, but the full impact of material changes can only be realized if cards are fully recycled at the end of their life vs. ending up in a landfill. Educated consumers recognize companies who promote their <a href="https://www.entrust.com/legal-compliance/environmental-social-and-governance">sustainability programs</a>, looking to bridge environmental awareness with overall product viability. In the absence of eco standards and regulation, companies are looking to partner with material suppliers, equipment providers, and logistic services who have demonstrable programs in place that can help meet overall sustainability goals. To this end, it’s imperative that vendors, customers and everyone engaged in product-centric decision-making, are aware of eco-friendly initiatives and sustainability programs, as well as broader ESG program goals, and the related benefits and value proposition.</p>
<p>In a capitalistic world, consumers, world leaders, and companies alike are at the same crossroads, demanding more from eco and sustainability efforts to make the environment we live in safer and cleaner. For their part, organizations are looking for trusted advisers to lead them through materials research, equipment capabilities, or aligning with industry trends ahead of standardization. This critical juncture is where Entrust has invested resources to bridge the gap between technical feasibility and demand for sustainable practice. We’ve dedicated resources − from our R&amp;D, business teams, material suppliers, and equipment suppliers to logistics services − to co-create meaningful solutions to meet these critical goals now and into the future. Leveraging an eco research and innovation platform that was designed to build the knowledge base for holistic solutions vs. driving product-led materials or features. In simpler terms, eco R&amp;D is the foundation required to build diverse enterprise relationships supporting the broader initiative. The mere existence of an eco-project doesn’t automatically generate “trusted advisers,” but the collective effort will create a roadmap where partners feel comfortable collaborating on technical concepts to support consumer demand.</p>

<p>From inflation and conflict, to rising interest rates and the growth of neo banks, to synthetic identities and deepfakes – banks and credit union leaders are navigating tumultuous times. Yet, through it all, these same leaders recognize the immediate need to meet the demand for an enhanced customer experience to drive loyalty and increase revenue. And it all starts with a streamlined secure onboarding process – one that provides digital-first customer experiences with an accelerated time to value.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the quicker a financial institution can move a prospective customer from account opening to card issuance to making their first purchase, the more satisfied the consumer becomes and the faster the financial institution realizes value. And, if that can all happen in less time than it takes to brew a cup of coffee – all the better! Of course, it’s equally as important to be Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliant, as well as secure through each and every transaction. Fraud is a large and growing problem that can cost banks as much as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">$4MM per breach (IBM</a>), not to mention the potential reputational damage and lost consumer trust that has the power to seriously damage future growth potential.</p>
<p>What follows is a roadmap to navigate this journey.</p>
<p>Enable digital customer onboarding.</p>
<p>We’ve heard from many customers that banks and credit unions alike only have a 90-second to 5-minute window of time that consumers are willing to spend verifying their identity and opening an account. Any longer than that and you risk application abandonment – that isn’t a lot of time to provide a great consumer experience that will lead to top-of-wallet status. That’s why it’s critical for banks to adopt technologies that allow them to offer remote customer onboarding enhanced with biometric identity verification; identity and device reputation authentication (also known as Electronic Know Your Customer, or eKYC); and digital contract signing.</p>
<p>Provide digital and physical payment card options.</p>
<p>Once a new customer account has been approved, it’s time to provide a method to make payments. Traditionally, a customer would need to wait for a physical card to be mailed to their home address after opening their bank account. While this process is still an important part of any bank’s card issuance program, it can be beneficial to offer other methods of card issuance that will help the bank realize time to value more quickly, and to exceed customer expectations.</p>
<p>For those customers that open an account remotely via their mobile device, doesn’t it make sense to instantly issue them a digital card to their newly installed banking app so they can start using it right away? Enhancing existing card programs with digital offerings with functionality like digital card issuance, NFC payment, tokenization, wallet push provisioning, and card controls allows banks to streamline processes, reduce cost of ownership, and provide a boost in customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Many banks and credit unions also offer the option to instantly print a card in-branch. This method is a nice addition to any payment card issuance program because it gives branch employees the autonomy to surprise and delight customers by printing them a new replacement card, or a new card for those who choose to open an account in person.</p>
<p>The key to a successful card issuance program is to ensure that your bank can rise to the customer’s immediate challenge and provide the flexibility to open an account and receive their card via the method that works best for them, and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Secure the end-to-end experience.</p>
<p>Securing the end-to-end customer experience (from account opening to transacting), is vitally important to mitigate costs and reputational damage resulting from banking fraud or a breach. As mentioned in the consumer onboarding and account opening phase, it’s important to make sure to adhere to the latest eKYC and AML compliance requirements.</p>
<p>When it comes to protecting transactions once an account has been opened, banks and credit unions should look for solutions that provide risk-based authentication to proactively identify fraudulent patterns through fraud detection algorithms, device identity scans, and adaptive risk analysis. Applying those solutions across all e-commerce transactions, high-value transactions, and irregular locations will help identify and mitigate potential fraud.</p>

<p>The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a unique alphanumeric code for legal entities, funds and trusts participating in commercial, trade, or general financial transactions. It enables identification across a wide range of financial applications and has the potential to play a significant role in the modern financial system by enabling counterparty bona fides verification. This verification is essential for the know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) processes required in traditional and modernized financial services activities. </p>
<p>Amit Sharma is the Founder and CEO of <a href="https://finclusive.com/who-we-are/about-us">FinClusive</a>, a global Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) infrastructure provider that enables increased compliant and equitable financial engagement by facilitating traditional banking’s connectivity with emerging technology networks, existing and alternative payment rails, and financial services providers. FinClusive’s CaaS is a globally orchestrated anti-money laundering/financial crimes compliance toolkit with modernized KYC/KYB- backed digital identity credentialing and LEI issuance and validation.</p>
<p>How are Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) transforming businesses—and emerging markets in particular? What requirements does the LEI meet?</p>
<p>As both traditional and non-traditional financial markets incorporate cross-border transactions, there is a significant need for a uniform identifier across jurisdictions that is precise, digitally verifiable, and interoperable across global regulated financial services providers. The hurdles for verifying identities across the world has resulted in financial fraud, crises, and other abuses, which has become even more complex in the virtual assets space, internet-native financial services applications (web3), and decentralized financial services (DeFi). The LEI has both the necessary infrastructure and simplicity for ubiquitous application across bank and non-bank transactions for businesses around the world.</p>
<p>What are the challenges with know-your-business (KYB) and legal entity verification more broadly? How do we enable businesses to interact seamlessly, transparently, and compliantly in a cross-border world with next generation banking and payments needs?</p>
<p>The biggest challenges for KYB across the industry arise from inconsistent regulatory requirements for identification and compliance across jurisdictions, coupled with the disparate nature in which corporate identities are issued, validated, stored, and accessed. In these cases, entities involved in cross-border transactions often lack the ability to verify that their counterparty is legitimate, non-fraudulent, and not posing a significant business risk. Adding processes like Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) goes a long way in addressing these concerns by systemizing the issuance and validation of legal entities, and further, enabling them to verify each other while ensuring adherence to global financial crimes compliance practices and requirements. Broader compliance solutions that are purpose-built for know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) application, including FinClusive’s full-stack compliance-as-a-service (CaaS) platform, are another way that businesses can take security and compliance into their own hands, while enabling near real-time verification and coverage of essential business/entity verification—including the validation of an entity’s beneficial owners.</p>
<p>How are these changes going to happen? Who is driving the changes? </p>
<p>While the best outcomes are reached collaboratively between the public and private sectors, it is important that industry-focused solutions are carefully considered by lawmakers when debating how to regulate the rapidly evolving financial services industry, including and especially those engaged in cross-border payments and virtual assets. As such, industry associations like Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) and companies like FinClusive can work hand-in-hand with government actors to guide policy in order to achieve the safest and most effective results for customers. This collaboration enables efficient due diligence, verification of identity, and applications across multiple jurisdictions, financial services operations, and increasingly between counterparties directly (peer-to-peer/business-to-business).</p>
<p>What timescales are we working towards with adoption and resulting benefits for the areas we’ve discussed? What are some examples of low hanging fruit (use cases)?</p>
<p>Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) have a wide range of use cases, some of which can be actualized more quickly than others. FinClusive already uses LEIs in know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) use cases, allowing organizations to gather key information about a client or counterparty before entering a transaction and conduct the requisite verification of legal entities wherever located. LEIs can also reduce error and friction for banks, creditors, invoicing, and a wide range of other business relationships. For example, organizations often have minor variations in names used across different official platforms, leading to significant confusion when trying to track the financial history of an entity or ensure adherence to global sanctions requirements and individual jurisdiction-based know-your-business and monitoring requirements.</p>
<p>A uniform LEI makes KYC/KYB exercises significantly smoother for all parties. The removal of these hurdles also allows for faster engagement between counterparties and financial transactions around the world. G7 and G20 countries have increasingly looked to LEIs as a strong way to bring global consistency and efficiency to legal entity verification and validation. Coupled with FinClusive’s global KYC/KYB, due diligence, monitoring, and digitally verifiable identity credentials, entities can ensure requisite background checks that mitigate identity fraud, and enable engagement between trading/financial counterparties—and their financial intermediaries—seamlessly and securely, while bringing needed efficiencies to their financial transactions.</p>
<p>How do we drive further adoption and enablement at scale?</p>
<p>Adoption at the international level must come from a coordinated government and private sector approach. FinClusive is one of several organizations globally offering Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) services, but there are only a few based in the United States. Additionally, regulatory mandates are yet to be made requirements—although financial services regulators around the globe are increasingly indicating their importance and use. Building broader infrastructure for LEI adoption around the world and coordinating with federal policy is crucial for widespread use. Enabling multiple financial services providers with LEIs alongside the essential monitoring and other controls to combat fraud and illicit finance, will advance know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) modernization, especially as alternative accounts and payments products and services continue to proliferate in the market.</p>
<p>What potential does the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) have for global financial inclusion?</p>
<p>Reliable, easily accessible identification has the potential to transform businesses in developing markets. LEIs give trading partners and their financial institutions a new way to interact with unprecedented efficiency and is expected to have immeasurable benefits for global trade and business-to-business (B2B) money flows in the developing world. Small businesses, entrepreneurs, non-profits, development organizations, global corporations, and even alternative financial services providers themselves can seek out and receive a fully credentialed LEI through FinClusive or another provider, enabling them to engage meaningfully in the global economy with legitimacy and transparency.</p>
<p>With more than 99% of global growth stemming from small and medium enterprises (including micro enterprises and commercial entities of all types—corporate, LLC, non-profit/public benefit, and others), LEIs can enable seamless engagement and verification alongside financial system controls that can benefit those enterprises struggling to access or maintain their financial services.</p>
<p>Why is FinClusive working with Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs)? How does the LEI fit into your services?</p>
<p>Thanks to our partnership with Ubisecure, FinClusive is one of the only United States-based GLEIF Validation Agents. This allows us to streamline validation of legal entity data and really speed up the registration of LEIs. We are also the only nonbank/non-financial institution to do this. We have integrated the LEI and our proprietary Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Check utility into one platform for our clients, allowing our customers to confirm their partners’ identity, beneficial owners, know-your-business risk, and financial crimes compliance status in one tool. LEI on its own can lack due diligence and jurisdiction validation, both of which FinClusive can cover by integrating LEIs with our <a href="https://finclusive.com/products/fincid">FinCID</a> solution. Integrating anti-money launder controls, know-your-business capabilities, and compliance into our full-stack platform allows us to maximize our global orchestration of providers and analytics partners, as well as the reliability and efficiency of cross-border payments and business relationships, thereby advancing financial inclusion of businesses around the world.</p>

   The key to secure, seamless experiences 

<p>Would you be surprised to learn that 91% of all new car sales in the U.S. are "connected vehicles." Not me. I've been watching the automotive world evolve, creating an ecosystem bristling with distinct entities and relationships that shape the modern driving experience.</p>

<p>The complexity of this ecosystem can be overwhelming. There's the vehicle itself, with its multitude of sensors and software components, plus subscription-based services and smart city infrastructure. And, of course, there are the people involved –&nbsp;car owners, drivers, manufacturers, sales and service personnel, and more. By placing identity at the core of this ecosystem, we can unlock a world of possibilities and ensure secure connections between all entities, with seamless and personalized experiences for all stakeholders involved.</p>

<p>It's not just about any one of these parties or services; it's about the entire web of identities connecting within and around the vehicle – including the head unit in the car that connects to a manufacturer's control systems in the cloud, the sensors and cameras that connect with each other and to the cloud, and even person-to-person and person-to-device connections. With unified identity, we can protect, manage, and govern these entities, while personalizing experiences and supporting sustainable business models. Now that's what I call smart mobility.</p>

 Smart mobility requires identity 

<p>When identity is infused into every part of an automotive manufacturer's connected strategy, it becomes a powerful driver for success.</p>

<p>Consider digital buying journeys. Car manufacturers are shifting towards digital sales models, where customers lead the conversation and have full control over the process – from initial research, to customizing and ordering a vehicle online, to finalizing the purchase at the dealer or directly with the manufacturer. In many ways, this experience is heading towards becoming much like any other retail e-commerce experience.</p>

<p>Once a customer sets up an identity online at the beginning of the buying journey, that identity stays with them through the sales cycle. It lets them receive digital and physical car keys and sign up for in-car services. The vehicle-to-be can be represented with a digital identity, too, ultimately synchronizing its characteristics with its "physical twin" once manufacture is complete.</p>

<p>With a unified approach to identity, the owner can even apply meaningful access controls to other drivers, ensuring safety and personalization – think seat settings for different drivers or automotive performance guardrails for new teen drivers in the family.</p>

 The current reality: identity as an afterthought 

<p>&nbsp;In the absence of a unified identity framework, the integration of physical and digital security measures becomes disjointed and prone to vulnerabilities. The risk of leaking customers' personally identifiable information (PII) increases when each service and application handles identity management independently.</p>

<p>Without an identity-centric approach, it's easier for malicious actors to exploit weaknesses and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. You can see this for yourself when you connect a smart mobile device to a rental car – often, you'll lose control of your entire contact list and driving history. Without proper identity management, the potential for unauthorized or unintentional data sharing becomes a real concern, jeopardizing privacy and leaving individuals vulnerable to unwanted solicitations or misuse of their personal data.</p>

 The vision: identity at the center 

<p>By placing digital identities and relationships between them at the core of the connected car ecosystem, we can solve these challenges from the inside out. Gradually building the security posture over time as digital identities are added, we can ensure a smooth and secure experience for car owners. From tracking the manufacturing process using digital identities to providing real-time updates through a digital key in the owner's phone wallet, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Unified identity requires a powerful, scalable, and flexible solution. It involves storing identity profile information, ensuring synchronization with non-identity data feeds, and delivering a seamless human experience during registration and onboarding. At run time, checking identities and access rights becomes effortless, and reliable communication with various applications and APIs is established.</p>

<p>ForgeRock, a leading provider of identity solutions, drives these powerful, scalable, and flexible solutions. With components that separate policy enforcement from decision-making, ForgeRock empowers enterprises to adopt a Zero Trust architecture for all identities – both <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/CIAM">human</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">IoT "things."</a> By leveraging strong authentication standards like FIDO2 WebAuthn and federation protocols like OAuth and OpenID Connect, identity-related issues, such as impersonation and unauthorized access, can be mitigated effectively.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with the integration of AI-driven technologies, such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a>, identity provisioning and authentication become self-driving and adaptive. This automation enables continuous authentication checks, ensuring a secure environment for all connected vehicles.</p>

<p>Putting identity at the center of the connected vehicle ecosystem is the key to unlocking seamless, personalized experiences. By embracing a unified identity, we can overcome challenges, enhance security and privacy, and foster a thriving connected car environment. With ForgeRock's powerful solutions, the future of connected vehicles looks brighter than ever before.

 The Shyft Perspective — June&nbsp;2023 <p>As decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow, its allure has expanded to a broader demographic, offering financial services to those unserved or underserved by the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</p><p>Indeed, one of the main reasons for DeFi’s existence is to bank the unbanked and provide a platform for moving assets in a decentralized and permissionless way. However, DeFi is not without its own unique set of challenges.</p><p>One of the most glaring problems in the DeFi landscape is the unknown paths the assets travel — the commingling of funds. This issue threatens to significantly hamper the growth and acceptance of DeFi if not addressed promptly and effectively.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson once said, “The price of freedom is eternal vigilance and personal responsibility.” It is crucial to recognize that there are many misuses of decentralized finance&nbsp;freedom.</p><p>Malicious actors are abusing DeFi protocols for money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption, and scams, among other things. Addressing these issues at the current moment has become paramount for the vitality and growth of the DeFi ecosystem.</p> The Commingling of Funds in DeFi — Ride in the Wild&nbsp;West <p>Commingling of funds in DeFi refers to the pooling of assets from different participants into a single wallet or smart contract. While this helps facilitate transactions and optimizes liquidity, it also blurs the lines of ownership and raises critical questions about the security and accountability of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Such funds, often with a suspicious or unknown origin, create a profound barrier to the sound operation and regulation of the DeFi platforms.</p><p>Envision a scenario where an illicitly obtained large sum of money is deposited into a DeFi liquidity pool. Once mixed with other funds and redistributed through returns, these funds become nearly untraceable, providing a difficult puzzle for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulators.</p><p>The gravity of this issue extends further as it risks ‘polluting’ the liquidity pool with unverified funds, potentially affecting all participants in the&nbsp;pool.</p><p>In an environment that already battles with the problems like lack of oversight, this further compounds the regulatory challenges, potentially putting the entire DeFi space at risk of stringent regulatory measures. As the DeFi space matures, it is crucial to address these pressing concerns.</p> DeFi Investors: Seduced and Often&nbsp;Betrayed <p>Despite all the challenges, many who have tipped their toes in the crypto water perceive DeFi as an attractive and potentially lucrative investment opportunity. But the less adrenalin-tolerant, yet major investment players, are carefully observing the space and waiting for their safe moment to&nbsp;come.</p><p>What’s this irresistible DeFi power of seduction? The yield farming strategies inherent in DeFi platforms, whereby users provide liquidity to earn rewards, are particularly compelling. The DeFi protocols usually offer significantly higher yields than traditional financial instruments, presenting an enticing proposition for investors.</p><p>On top of that, DeFi also introduces a new level of accessibility, allowing anyone with an internet connection to participate in high-yield opportunities, regardless of geographical or economic constraints.</p><p>As the allure of decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to seduce the highly risk-tolerant investors, a surge of new participants is entering the scene. Enticed by high yields and unparalleled accessibility, they contribute to a significant inflow of capital, defining it as an expansion beyond borders of infinite financial opportunities.</p><p>Amid this growing interest, the importance of Compliant DeFi is coming into sharper focus. However, the adventure in the wild DeFi land might be quite tragic for some, so now the issue at hand is how to be better safe than&nbsp;sorry.</p> Compliant DeFi — Is it Safe to&nbsp;Play? <p>Simply put, compliant DeFi is the innovative fusion of decentralized finance with traditional regulatory standards. It marries the borderless, open-access ethos of DeFi with the security and transparency of conventional compliance measures like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">KYC</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML</a>, and CFT. The goal is to cultivate a more trustworthy and secure DeFi landscape that attracts institutional investors and compliance-friendly users.</p><p>One of the significant areas where Compliant DeFi shines is in dealing with regulatory complexities that wild DeFi land is&nbsp;facing.</p><p>Compliant DeFi is the answer to the misuse of financial freedom in DeFi. It eliminates the wild chaos and introduces a level of order, enhancing the sector’s security while maintaining its decentralized nature.</p> Why Compliant DeFi Matters at&nbsp;All <p>Compliant DeFi has the potential to shine bright in the land of finance and attract institutional investors, including those less or none traveled in crypto&nbsp;land.</p><p>By providing an environment that adheres to preventing the notorious comingling of funds and applying regulatory standards such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), complaint DeFi effectively bridges the divide between the decentralized finance world and the traditional financial ecosystem, creating a symbiotic relationship that mitigates risks substantially.</p><p>As the DeFi space swells with new funds, trust and security become increasingly significant concerns. Traditional DeFi platforms, while operationally efficient, often end up nesting commingled funds, and at any moment, unknown toxic issues might crawl out of this Pandora’s box.</p><p>Though at first glance, Compliant DeFi might be less seductive, it confronts these challenges head-on and secures a safe investment environment. This is the new brave new DeFi world where user interests are guarded, safer, more transparent, and accountable. It is a world where major investors (the non-adrenalin driven) feel comfortable interacting and looking at the long-term prospectives.</p><p>In a nutshell, this is the one, and most probably the only, alternative for DeFi, the moment that opens the road to sustainable growth and expansion without the shadows of malpractices or security concerns.</p> Keeping the Books in Check: Accountability in the DeFi Ecosystem <p>The skyrocketing influx of investors in the DeFi space, especially the more traditional institutional ones, calls for a level of accountability. Yet, again, Compliant DeFi stands tall, providing an environment that marries the innovative opportunities of DeFi with the professionalism of conventional financial services.</p><p>By aligning with regulatory standards and ensuring enhanced transparency, Compliant DeFi has the potential to attract an even broader investor base. And logically, such increased and secured participation can foster a robust, sustainable growth trajectory for the DeFi ecosystem.</p><p>In this dynamic era of digital finance, for DeFi, balancing high-return prospects with security, trust, and regulations is a tightrope to walk. Compliant DeFi appears as a reliable solution in this balancing act, solidifying its role as an integral part of a maturing DeFi landscape.</p> Final Note <p>Marking a transformative shift, Compliant DeFi indeed emerges as a significant catalyst, spearheading the drive towards expansive growth and wider acceptance within the DeFi landscape. This innovative approach is not just a tool but a comprehensive solution, proficiently harnessing the extraordinary potential of DeFi, while simultaneously addressing its inherent challenges.</p><p>As we navigate the complexities of the future, it becomes increasingly apparent that compliant DeFi, with its robust approach to security and regulation, is poised to decisively influence the evolution of digital&nbsp;finance.</p> The Flash &amp; his Love for&nbsp;DeFi <p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p></p> 
<p>As I was walking around Identiverse last week, I was reminded of the old Barbara Mandrell song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRHjl3xMB3o">I Was Country, When Country Wasn’t Cool</a>.” HYPR has been doing passkeys since passkeys (then known simply as FIDO credentials) weren’t cool. It’s given us a unique point of view on the overall impact and security of passkeys.</p>  
<p>First off, passkeys are so vastly more secure than passwords that you should run — don’t walk — to implement them everywhere that you can. Seriously. Stop reading this blog and go implement some passkeys. One of the notable moments of Identiverse was when Ryan Rowcliffe and Cisa Kurian highlighted that CVS has implemented passkeys on cvs.com faster than Google has deployed passkeys. (Go check out cvs.com and register for a passkey. It’s pretty cool.)</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/T98/reports/2023-dbir-executive-summary.pdf">Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report</a> highlights that more than 50% of breaches come from attackers using credentials and a large number come from phishing attacks. The beauty of passkeys is that they’re not susceptible to phishing and can’t be compromised in the ways that passwords can.</p> 
 The Different Flavors of Passkeys  
<p>However, it’s also worth looking at the question of the security level of different types of passkeys. As a quick refresher, synchronized passkeys (the type that you’re hearing the most about) can be synchronized or passed between devices by features in your operating system (iCloud Keychain, etc) or by your password manager (Dashlane, 1Password, LastPass, etc). Device-bound passkeys are tied to a single device.</p> 
<p>As most security practitioners know, meeting the requirements of multi-factor authentication requires having at least two independent factors of “something you know,” “something you have,” or “something you are.” Synchronized passkeys only meet the requirement of “something you know” or “something you are” depending on whether you verify identity with a PIN or biometric, respectively. Because of how they can be shared and transmitted, they don’t meet the possession requirement. This means that some organizations are looking at how they add multi-factor authentication on top of passkeys. (This feels a little bit like buying the latest Tesla and sticking a 1970’s spoiler on it.)&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Organizations also need to be comfortable with who will be managing their passkeys. For implementations of synchronized passkeys, organizations need to accept that they won’t know who is managing the passkeys that they’re provided. The passkey could be managed by the iCloud Keychain, Android, Dashlane, 1Password or another solution yet to be identified. Users will be in charge of who manages the passkeys on their devices.</p> 
<p>(Let me reiterate the earlier point: passkeys are so much more secure than passwords that you should absolutely go implement them right now.)</p> 
 Passkeys Built for the Enterprise  
<p>There are several scenarios where enterprises may want an authentication solution that meets the requirements of MFA and doesn’t have the same challenges highlighted above. This is where HYPR’s Enterprise Passkeys come into play. At their core, these are device-bound passkeys and are the same FIDO credential that HYPR has been based on since we were founded nine years ago.

<p>We have the tools to build a greener Internet, one app at a time.</p> The Climate Crisis <p>The United Nations classifies the climate crisis as the defining crisis of our time. Businesses everywhere are called to revamp their infrastructure and processes so that we may stave off calamity.</p><p>In the tech industry, data centers are often the focus of concerns, and rightly so. Water is used to cool data centers to keep them from overheating, causing a big drain on our water supply. In fact, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/30/1119938708/data-centers-backbone-of-the-digital-economy-face-water-scarcity-and-climate-ris">a mid-sized data center consumes around 300,000 gallons of water a day, or about as much as 1,000 U.S. households</a>. </p><p>Furthermore, the amount of data we create every day is astonishing. It's projected that by 2025, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/">181 zettabytes of data</a> will exist. The processing power and electricity it takes to compute and store the massive amounts of data we produce daily is already at about <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/5-ways-big-tech-could-have-big-impacts-on-clean-energy-transitions">1% of global energy consumption</a>, with no signs of lessening.</p><p>These statistics are bleak, but there is hope for a brighter future. While working to make data centers more energy-efficient should be prioritized by those who utilize them, there is another option. </p> Edge Computing and the Decentralized Web <p>Building apps on the distributed and decentralized web comes with several green🌱 benefits.</p><p>Decentralized Data Storage - Instead of sending data to a server at a data center, data can be stored locally or at or near the edge. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> is a distributed file system built on <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, a hypermedia P2P protocol that stores data on various nodes in the network. Apps with WNFS also enjoy offline access, reducing the need for constant Internet access to use the app!</p><p>Reduced Data Transfer - Local-first edge apps can process data locally, meaning fewer data transfers to the network! Our smartphones are sophisticated computers in their own right, and we can do many computations without needing to access additional servers or the cloud.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCAN</a>, Fission's capabilities-based authentication network, doesn't rely on ACLs or Access Control Lists. Therefore, permissions can be validated with fewer calls between the user, the app, and the resource server.</p><p>Energy-Efficient Computing - Instead of running the same computations repeatedly and sending those requests to a server or even the distributed network, why not "cache" the results or save time and compute power in other ways? </p><p>Fission's <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM</a>, or Interplanetary Virtual Machine, takes arguments and applies them to a Wasm function. This outputs a CID or content identifier. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> to inform us if an operation has been run before so we can optimize our efforts and copy the CIDs of those outputs (the receipts) into our work. This saves both time and compute power! </p><p>In addition, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optimization">adaptive/hot spot optimization</a> and make popular operations faster by hardcoding frequently called arguments. </p><p>Finally, we can choose the order of operations that is most efficient while not impacting the results. This is done in IPVM, where we ensure mutations always happen at the end. In <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">RhizomeDB</a>, Fission's decentralized database, this is done with CmRDTs that enable data replicas to process updates in any order.</p> <p>We are working at the protocol level, but many ways exist to help make the Internet greener.

<p>To provide stakeholders with vital IT services, organizations need to keep their private <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> operational, secure and compliant. Data center management encompasses the tasks and management tools necessary for doing so. A person responsible for carrying out these tasks is known as a data center manager.</p>



 What is the role of a data center manager? 



<p>Either physically onsite or remotely, a data center manager performs general maintenance—such as software and hardware upgrades, general cleaning or deciding the physical arrangement of servers—and takes proactive or reactive measures against any threat or event that harms data center performance, security and compliance.</p>



<p>The typical responsibilities of a data center manager include the following:</p>



 
 Performing lifecycle tasks like installing and decommissioning equipment 



 Maintaining service level agreements (SLAs) 



 Ensuring licensing and contractual obligations are met 



 Identifying and resolving IT problems like connection issues between <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/what-is-edge-computing">edge computing</a> devices and the data center 



 Securing data center networks and ensuring backup systems and processes are in place for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/disaster-recovery">disaster recovery</a> 



 Monitoring the data center environment’s energy efficiency (e.g., lighting, cooling, etc.) 



 Managing and allocating resources to maximize budgetary spending and performance 



 Determining optimal server arrangement and cabling organization 



 Planning emergency contingencies in case of natural disaster or other unplanned downtime 



 Making necessary updates and repairs to systems while minimizing downtime and impact to IT operations and business functions (also known as change management) 
 



<p>Certification programs exist for IT students and professionals who want to acquire or enhance the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in data center management.</p>



 Common challenges of data center management 



 Navigating complexity 



<p>By nature, asset management within an enterprise data center is complex. A data center is often comprised of hardware and software from multiple vendors, including numerous applications and tools. A data center environment can also co-exist and interact with private cloud environments from multiple cloud service providers. Each hardware component, software instance and cloud-based environment can have its own contractual terms, warranty, user interface or licensing permissions. Every element of a data center also has unique processes and procedures to follow when implementing patches or upgrades. While a challenge in its own right, complexity is also a contributing factor (if not a direct cause) of many other challenges faced when managing a data center.</p>



 Meeting SLAs 



<p>Because of a data center’s complex multi-vendor environment, it can be difficult for data center managers to ensure all SLAs are being upheld. These SLAs can span:</p>



 
 Application availability 



 Data retention 



 Recovery speed 



 Network uptime and availability 
 



 Tracking warranties 



<p>Data center managers can struggle in a complex environment to track which warranties have expired or what each warranty covers. Without visibility over warranty information, money may be needlessly spent on components that may have otherwise been covered.</p>



 Costs 



<p>For private data centers, IT staff, energy and cooling costs can consume much of the limited budget allocated to what’s typically deemed a non-value-added cost to the organization.</p>



 Monitoring 



<p>Data center managers may be forced to use insufficient or outdated equipment to monitor their complex data center operations. This can result in gaps in performance visibility and inefficient workload distribution. Capacity planning is also negatively impacted, since data center managers reliant on disparate or outdated equipment may not have the accurate metrics needed to assess how well a data center is meeting current demands.</p>



 Limited resources 



<p>Data center managers often work with limited staff, power and space due to budgetary constraints. In many cases, they also lack the proper tools needed to manage these limited resources effectively. Limited resources can hinder service management, resulting in the delivery of delayed or inadequate IT resources to business users and other stakeholders across an organization.</p>



 Meeting sustainability goals 



<p>Many organizations are working to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/it-sustainability">reduce their carbon footprint</a>, which means finding ways to reduce the energy consumption of their data centers and transition to green energy sources. Data center managers are tasked with implementing the hardware and procedures that reduce their environment’s carbon footprint while simultaneously dealing with existing data center complexity and limited resources.</p>



 How to overcome the challenges of data center management 



 DCIM software 



<p>Data center managers can use a data center infrastructure management (DCIM) solution to simplify their management tasks and achieve IT performance optimization. DCIM software provides a centralized platform where data center managers can monitor, measure, manage and control all elements of a data center in real-time—from on-premises IT components to data center facilities like heating, cooling and lighting.</p>



<p>With a DCIM solution, data center managers gain a single, streamlined view over their data center and can better understand what’s happening throughout the IT infrastructure.</p>



<p>A DCIM solution provides visibility into the following:</p>



 
 Power and cooling status 



 Which IT equipment and software components are ready for upgrading 



 Licensing/contractual terms and SLAs for all components 



 Device health and security status 



 Energy consumption and power management 



 Network bandwidth and server capacity 



 Use of floor space 



 Location of all physical data center assets 
 



<p>A DCIM solution can also help data center managers adopt virtualization to combine and better manage their data center’s IT resources. More advanced DCIM solutions can even automate tasks and eliminate manual steps, freeing up the data center manager’s time and reducing costs.</p>



 Colocation data centers 



<p>A colocation data center is a third-party service that provides an organization with physical space and facility management for their private servers and associated IT assets. While the organization is still responsible for staffing and for managing their data center components, a colocation service offloads the burden and costs associated with building, running and maintaining a physical space.</p>



 Hardware, hybrid cloud and AI solutions for sustainability 



<p>There are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/modernize/it-sustainability">hardware, hybrid cloud and AI solutions</a> available to help data center managers reach their organization’s sustainability goals while maximizing data center performance. For example, the right server can greatly reduce energy consumption and free up physical space—in some cases, up to 75% and 67%, respectively.</p>



 Data center management and IBM 



<p>With electricity, you want enough capacity to get the job done, but not so much that you’re wasting it when not using it. Use hybrid cloud and AI to streamline operations, save energy and increase performance, making sustainability a true business driver—while delivering a return on your investment.</p>



<p>Reduce your footprint: &nbsp;IBM® LinuxONE Rockhopper 4 servers can reduce energy consumption by 75% and space by 67% (when compared to the same workloads on x86 servers with similar conditions and location) [1]. &nbsp;With energy-efficient data centers, consolidated workloads and improved infrastructure, you can save money and lessen your footprint.</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-getting-started">IBM Cloud Event Notifications</a> is a service that can filter and route events received from other IBM Cloud services or custom applications to communication channels like email, SMS, push notifications, webhook, Slack, Microsoft® Teams, ServiceNow, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine">IBM Cloud Code Engine</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage">IBM Cloud Object Storage</a>.</p>



<p>This post explores how you can create and configure the Event Notifications service using an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure-as-code">Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</a> template (in this case, Terraform) and configure an example application to send custom events.&nbsp;</p>



 Architecture overview 







 
 Using an IaC tool, the infrastructure engineer deploys and configures the common infrastructure components that are required for a given solution. In this example, we focus on the minimum components required to demonstrate the usage of the services that are included:
 
 Creating an instance of <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/event-notifications">Event Notifications</a>. 



 Configuring sources, topics, subscriptions and email destinations. 



 Configuring sources, topics, subscriptions and SMS destinations.&nbsp; 



 Creating an instance of <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage/create">Cloud Object Storage</a> and authorization between the Event Notifications and Cloud Object Storage instances, sources, topics, subscriptions and destinations. 
 
 



 The developer creates a new Code Engine project and deploys the application to the project. Although Code Engine is used in this example, the application could have also been deployed to a VPC virtual server instance or Kubernetes cluster. 



 The application generates a new event to the Event Notifications instance based on an internal event in the application. The event is delivered based on the subscriptions and destinations that are configured by the infrastructure engineer using the Terraform template. All events received through this API source are delivered to an Object Storage bucket. 
 



<p>The Event Notifications instance is configured to enable lifecycle events and an <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-source#en-api-sources">API source</a> to receive both platform events and events from a custom application that is to be deployed by the application developer.</p>



 Configuring for lifecycle events 



<p>The Terraform template enables the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-resource-lifecycle-events">resource lifecycle events</a> default source and adds two filters for when new instances are created and deleted from the cloud environment. These events are reported by the IBM Cloud Resource Controller:</p>







 Configuring for application events 



<p>The Terraform template creates a new <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-source#en-api-sources">API source</a> for the custom application events. It then configures a destination and subscription to a newly created Cloud Object Storage bucket using the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints&amp;mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&amp;mhq=object+storage+endpoints#advanced-endpoint-types">private COS endpoints</a>:</p>







 Generating the values required for the custom application 



<p>The custom application requires a few pieces of information to be able to forward its events to the Event Notifications instance.&nbsp;The template generates these values at the end so they can be handed over to the developer.</p>



 
 The location of the Event Notifications instance (i.e., <code>instance_location</code>). 



 The unique identifier for the Event Notifications instance (i.e., <code>instance_guid</code>). 



 A <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-service-access-management">service credential</a> is created for the application on the Event Notifications instance. This service credential has an <code>api_key</code> that is needed by the application to authenticate and pass events to the Event Notifications instance. 



 Finally, the <code>api_source_name</code> and <code>api_source_id</code> for the API source is provided. 
 







 Sending the custom event using the values provided 



<p>The application developer can include the values provided as environment variables to the application. They are used as shown below:</p>







<p>The payload in the event that is submitted is reduced since we know the subscriber to this event going will only go to a Cloud Object Storage bucket. Additional properties should be added based on the expected destination channel (learn more in the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-spec-payload">documentation</a>).</p>

<p>IBM’s partnership with the All-England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) has driven digital transformation at Wimbledon for more than 30 years. And this year, Wimbledon is tapping into the power of generative AI, producing new digital experiences on the Wimbledon app and website using IBM’s new trusted AI and data platform, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a>.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">Learn more about watsonx</a>



 Automated AI commentary built from foundation models 



<p>IBM first pioneered the use of AI to <a href="https://research.ibm.com/publications/automatic-curation-of-sports-highlights-using-multimodal-excitement-features">curate video highlight reels</a> in 2017, work that earned&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-ibm-sports-and-entertainment-partnerships-transform-an-industry-and-win-an-emmy/">IBM Consulting team a</a> 2023 Emmy® Award. The solution uses gesture recognition (such as fist pumps and players’ reactions), crowd noise and game analytics (such as break points) to identify highlight-worthy videos in both golf and tennis.</p>



<p>This year, fans can add AI-generated spoken commentary to Wimbledon highlight reels, hearing play-by-play narration for the start and end of each reel, along with key points. Fans can also turn on closed captions to further enhance accessibility, a key consideration for AELTC.</p>



<p>The solution is built from a foundation model developed using watsonx, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx"></a>IBM’s enterprise-grade AI platform designed to manage the entire lifecycle of AI models, from curating trusted data sources to governing responsible, trusted AI. Work began with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">watsonx.data</a>, a data store that connects disparate data sources and allows developers to filter the data for things like profanity, hate speech or personally identifiable information. For AI Commentary, the team drew source material from nearly 130 million documents.</p>



<p>The data was then used to train a large language model chosen from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a>, a next-generation studio for building and training generative AI models for business use cases. The IBM team then fine-tuned the model, adding the specific domain expertise of Wimbledon, including the use of unique Wimbledon nomenclature, such as “gentlemen’s draw” rather than “men’s draw.” The final model boasts 3 billion parameters, and the team will continue to monitor its performance using governance tools, ensuring the model performs as expected.</p>



<p>“The watsonx platform has allowed us to quickly leverage the power of generative AI without sacrificing trust or transparency,” says Aaron Baughman, a Distinguished Engineer and Master Inventor at IBM. “This is what we mean when we say ‘AI for Business.’ To use AI in a commercial setting, you need to have confidence that a model is scalable, reliable and trusted.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Co-creation with IBM iX<a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/ibmix"></a>® 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/ibmix">IBM iX</a>, the experience design arm of IBM Consulting, works with the Club year-round to design, develop, maintain and secure the tournament’s website and mobile apps. The goal of this work is to continually enhance the digital experience with new, innovative features, while maintaining the tradition, beauty and design simplicity of Wimbledon itself.</p>



<p>Twice a year, the IBM iX and the Wimbledon team meet for workshops guided by the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/">IBM Garage™</a> methodology, an enterprise design thinking collaboration that sets a roadmap for building and iterating the next generation of features that drive fan engagement. They use personas and journey maps to guide the design process, and agile development techniques to quickly iterate and build new features. In addition to the AI Commentary feature, the team is introducing several other enhancements, including:</p>



 AI draw analysis 



<p>As soon as any tournament draw is released, players and fans alike intuitively assess each player’s luck and path through the field: do they have a “good draw” or a “bad draw”? This year, IBM AI Draw Analysis helps them make more data-informed predictions by providing a statistical factor (a draw ranking) for each player in the singles draw.</p>



<p>The analysis leverages two previous innovations IBM built for the Club: the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/all-england-lawn-tennis-club-ibm-ix/">IBM Power Index</a>, an AI-powered analysis of recent player performance and momentum (plus sentiment gleaned from natural language processing of media discussion by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-discovery">IBM Watson Discovery</a>), and Likelihood to Win, a prediction of who will win a singles match.</p>



<p>The draw analysis, derived from structured and unstructured data, determines the level of advantage or disadvantage for each player and is updated throughout the day as the tournament progresses and players are eliminated. Every player has their draw ranked from 1 (most favorable) to 128 (most difficult). Fans can also click on individual matches to see a projected difficulty for that round.</p>



 Path to the final 



<p>Based on the AI Draw Analysis, users of the Wimbledon app can also see which opponent each player is most likely to play. It lists all potential matchups in the draw, ranked by the IBM Likely to Play. For each match in progress, fans can also follow the live scores and stats provided by IBM SlamTracker.</p>



<p>As a proven consultative process that taps into enterprise-scale automation and AI toolsets, the partnership between IBM and Wimbledon continues to deliver an innovative fan experience to millions around the world.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode over Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. What are the cultural aspects of digital identity? So that’s definitely a good question and very relevant questions and this is one of the questions that our guest today is going to answer.</p>
<p>Our guest today is Kalev Pihl. He has worked with digital identity over 25 years. He started with a topic in governmental side, preparing Estonia for electronic identity, or national identity cards. Since then, Kalev has worked in the financial sector and in Microsoft. During the last 15 years, he has been the CEO of SK ID Solutions, a trust service provider that serves digital identities in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Hello, Kalev.</p>
<p>Kalev Pihl: Hi, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s nice talking with you, Kalev.</p>
<p>Kalev: It’s been a while.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, Kalev. So, let’s talk about digital identity. And the first thing we want to hear from our guest is something about yourself and especially your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Kalev: I think of the journey to digital identity for me went through this very physical, governmentally controlled national identity. So that was my starting point. And I guess that’s where I’m a bit stuck with my mindset as well, sometimes. And this is my limit. But that’s how it started.</p>
<p>So, it started from the idea that in the world of physical human beings. Governments tend to have this role in society to name, number and identify the residents, they treat as their residents of the country, we are speaking about.</p>
<p>And whilst we have probably different other nicknames in different other societies. And somehow, globally, these governmental-issued identities have become the norm of; How do we know each other across the world. How do we identify the people whom we don’t know beforehand. So, I think from that angle, I’ve stuck with the idea that governments have the role of naming and identifying who we are.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. I think it’s – I mean, in my view, probably in the constitution in most countries, I’m not a lawyer, but I’m sure it’s written in some of the laws. So that’s one of the functions of the government. And yeah, and that has been translated in our very, let’s say, not very recent time. But talking, especially in the last maybe 20 years that we have such digital identifications, like Estonia is pioneering and in a few other countries as well. It’s pretty digital, pretty well-established.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah. I think that the – for the beginning of any country or state in the physical world, some limit, some borders, what is the ground they own. Then we are talking about some legal framework, what is the agreement. Then we need to know; between whom is the agreement? And those are then the human beings in the society, and that’s kind of what every state or country is made of, I would say.</p>
<p>And that’s something that if we go now, from this real-life identity and tried to tackle the digital identity, the idea. Then there are two kinds of attitudes. One is that digital world is borderless, global or universal even. And therefore, doesn’t require and there’s no relation to any, these kind of physical limitations and countries, states and therefore, like no borders, no anything. And then the other is that it is just – it should be, is and will be always a reflection of something that physically makes sense. Only then it becomes meaningful in a larger context when it is physically meaningful.</p>
<p>So, I think that’s one of the staring points if we say that there is point to the cultural differences. Then the culture that we started off is clearly not so much digital, but rather what is the culture before any digital and then definitely, we have different digital cultures as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, that’s true. Every country has internally a different culture while some often several cultures inside a country as well. And this is something that shapes digital identities that we, the ones who are in this industry have been shaping and continue shaping today. So, yeah, tell me more about that role that the culture plays in shaping and influencing the current and the ones that are coming in the digital identity.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yep, sure. That’s the topic for today. So, the culture that we can see in the digital identities is quite a lot, related to, the ways how we culturally trust our own governments. How the government trusts its citizens, residents. And also, it’s very tightly connected to the idea of what is and how the privacy as such is defined in the society. A&nbsp;couple of episodes ago, you discussed heavily again, this kind of <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/privacy-by-design-iso-standard/" title="ISO standard on the privacy">ISO standard on the privacy</a>. And privacy is something that is cultural as well, and it’s not globally, universally defined as a value. And where the value kind of lies actually and these cultural differences. How they look in the digital identity is exactly, I would say, let’s take the two extremes.</p>
<p>One of those extremes is that digital identity is something that is central, that binds all of the digital actions that one does in a digital world together. And therefore, makes you, in essence, traceable, recognised everywhere. You cannot hide in a digital world, based on that identity. This identity reveals you everywhere.</p>
<p>And then we have the other extreme. We have digital identity that must, in essence by definition, protect you from being recognised from one environment to another. You must have different representation in different contexts. You have to have the right not to be recognised and not to be traced.</p>
<p>So, I would say that, culturally, the need might be on both of those extremes and something in the middle. And that’s I think, something that we are struggling globally now, that we are trying to talk about digital identity and what this identity does. What kind of privacy does it guarantee and what the privacy means to anybody.</p>
<p>And then we – then we are stuck with the fact that we don’t define the digital identity. We believe that everybody understands the identity and digital identity in the same manner. And then we also tried to say that the privacy is preserved. Privacy is granted. Privacy is by default as we like to say, or by definition and by default. But what this privacy means in this context of digital identity and usability also is not defined. So, we kind of use the buzzwords, and we neglect the background from which we come from. And therefore, we don’t understand each other, and we try to regulate that into different places. And well, do a lot of mistakes in that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah.</p>
<p>Kalev: I don’t know if that makes sense to you, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Of course, a lot of sense. So, one concept, one particular concept you mentioned is privacy, right? Which can – well, not can but means different things in different cultures, in different countries. That’s true. I understand that. And it’s a challenge to try to have a definition and based on that create the laws, create the technologies that support that. Yeah, indeed. It’s a very, very good reflection that you are doing.</p>
<p>Kalev: I think that with the privacy, again, similarly, those extremes. And as I said, one of those extremes is on this identity and the definition regarding that privacy is that: OK, the privacy means that there is no data about me anywhere that I specifically didn’t reveal myself knowingly, giving the consent to that specific data to be revealed about me. Which makes me in the centre of all the transactions about me. And well, gives me a lot of work, let’s be honest, because there are several institutions all the time that work kind of for me. Make my digital life easier, and they need to make decisions. And if those decisions need my data, then therefore I need to make a lot of decisions to reveal or not reveal that data to them.</p>
<p>And the other side of that is and I would say the other way of looking at the same privacy, kind of, from the same concept. Still saying that privacy is preserved, privacy is kind of granted and by default, by definition. Is that whenever your data is used, then you, by nature of the setup, have the control over who and where and for what used your data. And therefore, you can kind of trace back it and say that, well, why did you do one or the other thing? And if they didn’t have the right, didn’t have your permission, didn’t have legal rights to something then they will be punished by the law.</p>
<p>So, it’s kind of – one is preventing anything to happen upfront. The other is giving the privacy through the control that you know everything that has happened with your data. And therefore you are able to take the parties involved and make them responsible for their actions. So, like these are maybe couple of ideas of how to look at the privacy from different angles as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, in the case of privacy, just to give a concrete example. But how this would start if privacy or any other concept has to be defined based on the culture of our country, or our region? So how it has really defined?</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, the question then, when we talk about like, building creating digital identity. We kind of often think that this is one type of things to be done everywhere. What I’ve learned over the years, and I’ve really had happy accidents of meeting so many different countries, cultures, in different places talking about digital identity now, really tens of years. Then it still turns out that we are building the digital identity for a specific set of human beings. And those human beings have some connection to a culture, even if that’s a digital culture. Even if we say that digital identity in a social network, like Instagram, is a digital identity. For the people who use Instagram, who have some cultural preferences, otherwise, they wouldn’t use that environment. So, they have kind of agreed to a cultural norm there.</p>
<p>Or if we say that we are looking at the country, somewhere in the world, like Thailand or Mexico. Then we are building the digital identity for that culture that suits the beliefs and traditions of that set of human beings. It’s not a one-size-fits-all. But rather that this one-size-fits-one kind of thinking that I’m now become to believe, more into recent years. That there is not this one single solution that everybody will, kind of, inherently fell in love into. They have so many things in their historical backpack that it will definitely tilt their preference.</p>
<p>They have some bias to expect something that any other culture would never ever expect from the same solution. And we have to be designing mindfully those digital identity solutions for a specific culture, and I think that this is a value in the world. That we do believe in different things, we do act based in different preferences, culturally and that makes us interesting as human beings. We are not the same everywhere in the world and how to preserve that in the digital world. How not to become culturally one the same. Following one and the same set of rules everywhere, having the same solutions everywhere is an interesting, very interesting challenge, I would say for the humanity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes, it is, and I agree with when you said that there shouldn’t be like one solution to be somehow imposed to the globally. That is a reason why they are in practice. I mean, the reason why then – just in the case of the national digital identities. The one from Estonia is different from one from Finland, Sweden, Singapore, et cetera. They are based on similar underlying technologies; open ID connect, publicly infrastructure, et cetera. But in the end, they are – they were designed differently because they’re solving a problem for different cultures. That is correct.</p>
<p>Kalev: Like facial recognition anywhere in the world, fingerprint-based identification somewhere like. Those are things that either are or are not culturally meaningful. I would say Western Europe has some kind of cultural connection in taking, giving and recognising fingerprints, and it’s deeply I would say, related to the criminalistics and then crime. And therefore, this kind of feeling when somebody asks your fingerprint somewhere, well, wasn’t very, very pleasant, I would say. Touch ID and other similar kinds of things have now a bit eased this feeling. But if we’re talking on the national level, fingerprint collection, fingerprint-based recognitions, then this feeling is still there, whilst it isn’t there with a face.</p>
<p>Although like, if we talk technologically then it doesn’t matter based on which kind of biometrics, I recognise you. But the acceptability within the culture, like face versus fingerprint was really, really different, still is a bit different. And the same kind of routing in the criminology didn’t appear in many Asian countries, in some Middle East countries where these fingerprint-based quick recognition tools in physical interactions were introduced. And there was no objection from the society. It was very, very acceptable.</p>
<p>So, all of those, kind of, bits that we are taking from different either literature, or some really historical reference that we take with us. Those too change the way how we are able or not able to roll out any given technology for the digital identity, absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s a very good example, the one of the fingerprints. I didn’t think about that. But yeah, it doesn’t surprise me that in different parts of the world, the perception is completely different. And it’s just the culture as you said.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, facial recognition in Middle East countries, revealing your face in public for female citizens, well, it’s not very common. And something that again, we from Western Europe don’t recognise easily, but it is, it is a thing.</p>
<p>Oscar: Could you share now some successful examples, or I mean maybe not, it sounds like from these discussion site, like there are not many, at least 100% successful examples. But some, in some extent, successful examples of how these cultural human aspects have been taken into account to deliver good solutions for digital identity.</p>
<p>Kalev: Well, being a CEO for SK ID Solutions. Of course, I have to tell that I believe that we have been able to deliver for at least the Baltic States, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, solutions which are relevant for the culture where we are providing those services. And in that regard, we have also faced some clear opposition from the cultural perspective in some areas here. But yeah, that’s one of the things that maybe is possible here and isn’t possible in some other countries. So, our current service that is really used for more than half of the population in the Baltic countries is based on the fact that people know and use their national identity code as a unique identifier for themselves. And it is used in different environments now but is kind of creating unique identifier per any kind of system.</p>
<p>The same pretty much applies to the other countries. But then when we will take that concept, the same concept that is successful in variations also in Finland, in Sweden, in Norway, those are all kind of based on the single one identity. And all of them have like bank ID in Sweden is definitely a success story, from the usability and amount of users behind it. They are based on this idea that there is this one unique identifier, and you can reuse that in different environments. And it’s really serving the culture there and here. So, I would say that this is the way how it has been functionally well rolled out.</p>
<p>And we have to then say that the same ideology would not be allowed, possible, accepted, for example, in Germany. That kind of falls to the pieces in the border, of Germany. Simply isn’t welcomed there, by constitution. Because the constitution in Germany says that: well you shouldn’t, you should never ever create a solution where user is reusing its attributes in a manner that you can trace them. From one, let’s say government institutions to another, from one company to another. You have to be messed up everywhere. Where you try to figure out if that same person came from one institution to another, you are bound to by constitution to be puzzled by that.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, well, interesting. Well, that’s defined by law in that case.</p>
<p>Kalev: Similarly, it is not allowed in Hungary, for example, to have a unique identifier for a person.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what were the objections or the reactions you had in, you mentioned earlier in the Baltics. So, what, what was not culturally accepted, let’s say there?</p>
<p>Kalev: One of the things was that really this identity code is semantically meaningful, and to use that as user ID at some points definitely was kind of a controversial and needed longer and public debate. In Estonia, I think, 15 years plus, quite long public debate about whether really the identity code as such can be publicly shared. And then it turned out that the reason actually – well, there’s definitely this semantic part that it really reveals your birthdate, which means that well somebody can understand how old you actually are.</p>
<p>But the more practical reason for objecting that was that, and it turned out that and it still is the case. For example, in US a lot of, that kind of identity breaches that we are discussing, and which are like big, big, big fuss around the world. Those are based on the notion that’s kind of user identity, for example, the social security number in US, it is not treated as user ID, but rather as a password. And those are very different things.</p>
<p>So, one is the link like this is who you are. And the other is proof that it is you that the claim is actually correct that this is your user identity. So, when it turned out to be kind of public, then what use cases were hit. And what was discussed quite a lot towards this type of phone-based service when you call in and the operator asks to identify you, your unique identifier. Which is public, which is listed everywhere where you have ever been, which is written into your identity documents. But still, as there was no better alternative then they opted for asking you for the identity code. And therefore, if that was now used publicly everywhere, well, everybody understood that cannot be used anymore.</p>
<p>And somehow the discussion, thankfully, has gone to that direction, at least in this region. that it wasn’t the right thing to do from the beginning to ask this identity code as a password. Because it has never been meant to be secret. The fact that not everybody in the world knows that doesn’t make it a secret.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah. So, what is nowadays, in Estonia, what is the kind of called, the username? Or there is such a username in – for this identity? Tell us a bit on how it works.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, it is like 11 number identity code. It really consists of your, like, six numbers of that represent your birthdate and one of those. Then the seventh one gives the century and the sex you are being given. Then there are four digits that you have to really randomly kind of remember. And it has been long discussion whether those should be or could be changed. And now, in Finland, in Latvia as well. We have had this experiment of introducing another identity code instead of the semantically meaningful one. And this semantically meaningful identity code can be like, in Latvia, you can once in a life, go and replace your meaningful, semantically meaningful identity code to this new identity code, which doesn’t mean anything anymore.</p>
<p>It’s only a couple of years old, this project there so I cannot say how successful it is. But what is interesting with this 11-digit code really that is based on a birthdate is that most of them are able to remember it, because the birthdate is something that you can remember. If a society like Estonia would be able to remember just random 11 digits correctly, I’m not sure. But like bigger populations, I’m even less sure because they should have like more digits remembered, maybe. Then should be based some kind of – and somehow already based in letters and names and so on.</p>
<p>So, in Estonia, it really is semantically meaningful 11 digits which you can easily remember, and people normally do remember their identity code. They are reusing that on a daily basis in different contexts. Therefore, it is something that is not also easy to forget, because the society requires you to remember it. That is also this identifier we are using to allow you to kind of state who you are in the electronic identity context, and the same applies to Latvia, Lithuania.</p>
<p>And then the other, maybe just remember the other part of what was discussed in this context of electronic identity then yeah for the identification maybe the semantical information to recognise person is maybe OK. And then – but is it OK for the signature and then therefore, we have had a discussion of where in the signature this type of information should appear or not appear at all.</p>
<p>So again, something that we are now discussing, not so much on this user identity but still on this, on signature part. You should still uniquely identify who signed something. But do you need anything other than this identification of this unique person? Whether it makes any sense and discussion, culture discussions not happening in all countries in a similar manner. Some countries are more kind of prone to say that it shouldn’t be there. Others say that it is actually well, impossible to do without. It’s very, very different already in those three countries. I don’t know if I answered your question, actually.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, you have definitely illustrated pretty well how it works in Estonia and also in the Baltics. And that gives us a clearer idea that the –yeah, the problem that you are bringing here is, of course, is big and it continues. As you say, there are some experiments in Latvia, Finland, and there are discussions in Estonia. So, this continues, even though there are good solutions, but this continues, this discussion continues.</p>
<p>So, if we focus now on, let’s say, you and I. We are working in companies who are building digital identity products. There are also, for instance, governmental institutions, who are building also digital solutions or services that rely very heavily on these digital identity solutions. So, from – what is the role of technology developers and designers in addressing these issues, these cultural aspects of digital identity?</p>
<p>Kalev: I think the biggest responsibility we carry is to be mindful about these phenomena of the cultural differences. And not to sell this kind of digital utopia that, that whenever we go to technical solutions, and your culture doesn’t matter, your infrastructure readiness doesn’t matter. It’s just “Buy my tech and you will be happy.” Promises should be avoided everywhere where it’s possible, even if there is a customer who’s willing to buy that promise. That’s really, I would say, the threat in the world what I see.</p>
<p>And maybe the other thing that is culturally important and must be addressed, I would say. In those, kind of, sales processes and discussions about future tech. Is focus on really the cultural position of government, of public sector, how capitalism and making money is perceived in society. All of those things have different perceptions and therefore, your solution must suit the ideology that this culture is accepting. Either the government is the trusted, and well-meaning party in the society where everybody is welcoming stuff that comes from the government because it’s always for the benefit of the bigger goods. Or the government is perceived as somebody who is sneaky. Who is always spying on you, who you suspect of making you guilty over the things that you maybe did or maybe didn’t. So, basically, being paranoid about the government.</p>
<p>Similarly, you have to be mindful about if the private sector is something to be perceived as innovative, as providing service for the value they are actually getting from the market. If they are actually stealing behind the people who are paying to them, who are overcharging everybody, who are greedy. Or if they are really making the economy work and able to kind of collect the taxes in the country at all.</p>
<p>So, like, these perceptions are also reasonable to know and to remember. When we are offering – what type of setup should a country, should a society, should this bunch of human beings were requiring the digital identity. What they should ask for, what they should build for, what is the way how to fund, how to make that environment sustainable? Me, being a capitalist believer, I’m always kind of telling that, that when we are building digital identities, we have to see if there is a way how somebody can earn something from the fact that digital identity is successful. That it is used, that it is spreading, that it’s actually making sense to people.</p>
<p>And if such, for example, motivation is in the society, then there is a possibility that somebody will go after this benefit and therefore make the digital identity successful. If the, like monetary value is taken away from the system, there is kind of everything is free of charge, paid by this anonymous taxpayer or government. Then there might be that we have an environment where if the government is trusted, if the government’s promotional speeches about take it, use it, it’s for better, good. Those could be trusted and could be a good vehicle for rolling out a digital identity.</p>
<p>But it again, very much depends on like, did we provide the same model that this culture accepts? Or we took a model from some other culture and tried to sell it to a totally foreign environment for that proposal? So, I think that what we have to – the technology providers do, we have to really build for those cultures that we are selling into and building into.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes, yes, we need definitely to understand very well the cultures and where we are selling or helping with these technologies. As you said in some countries, the government is highly trusted, in others don’t. Then can be the banks are highly trusted in some countries, and in other countries, not at all. And then same can happen with telcos, as you said, also the private sector, some technology vendors from the private sector. So yeah, that’s very important. And the first thing you say is about, yeah, be mindful what you promise. That’s definitely a good reminder.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah. I think that this kind of naivety about technology being all good for every different situation still lives on. Similarly, of course, exists this naivety that technology, whatever it is used is evil. So, I think that both exist, but you should never fall into one or the other. It is never so simple.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. All right. I will ask a final question. So, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, I think that the message I hope has been quite clear that when building and when asking for technical solution, and especially as we are talking now digital identity. If asking for digital identity, ask: What is the fundamental belief of the environment where you are building it to? Don’t try to change culture through technology. It goes the other way around, culture defines technology.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, you said it very clear don’t try to – don’t try to change culture with technology. Yeah, absolutely. Very simply and well said.</p>
<p>While hearing you, your explanations, came to my mind that for business when people are – businesspeople are traveling to other countries, there are some books that I, for every or for most countries say “what is the business etiquette” of every country. So, you should read that before traveling to that country. So, there should be a similar book but for the digital identity, right? We should have for every country, what and how you should – “what is the culture in every country in terms of digital identity and identity?” So, we know before doing business. So that’s something that came to my mind when I was hearing you.</p>
<p>Kalev: It would be nice if those books exist.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, maybe, maybe I think you could be one of the co-authors, at least, you know a lot about this. Thank you very much, Kalev, for this very insightful conversation. So please let us know if people would like to follow this conversation with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, you can definitely find me through LinkedIn or write me. Our contacts on the <a href="https://www.skidsolutions.eu/">skidsolutions.eu</a> site are quite publicly available as well. So, I’m very public person in a sense, nothing is hidden.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. Again, thank you very much, Kalev for joining us and all the best.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, all the best to the listeners as well.</p>

<p>When IBM Consulting’s Neeraj Manik spoke recently with a large pharmaceutical client about how to streamline and improve its front-office and back-office financial processes, he pointed to a web of interconnected business challenges the organization was facing: “too many invoices, too many suppliers, too much money being paid to suppliers,” as Manik put it.</p>



<p>Manik, VP and senior partner for IBM Consulting, outlined a massive opportunity to strategically redesign the client’s finance operations and payment processing by leveraging AI, data analytics, metrics and automation. Ultimately, modernizing these processes could save hundreds of millions of dollars, improve the employee experience and make the company more agile and competitive, he says. Manik sees leveraging this technology as a fundamental change from years past, when a company might outsource business processes to save as little as 30% without considering how outsourcing might affect organizational efficiencies, job accuracy, and employee and client experience.</p>



<blockquote>
Technologies such as AI and automation have transformed the outsourcing market and BPO services, giving companies the ability to create efficiencies while also modernizing processes rather than relying on offshore outsourcing.
</blockquote>



<p>Labor arbitrage, or outsourcing labor to the lowest-cost workforce, has been the central strategy associated with business process outsourcing (BPO) for years. It often meant sourcing customer support, information technology and other office operations from countries with lower costs of labor. Today, though, technologies such as AI and automation have transformed the outsourcing market and BPO services, giving companies the ability to create efficiencies while also modernizing processes rather than relying on offshore outsourcing.</p>



<p>Technology-enabled business process operations, the new BPO, can significantly create new value, improve data quality, free precious employee resources, and deliver higher customer satisfaction, but it requires a holistic approach. Tapping into AI and automation helps businesses streamline and strengthen their operations, while providing rich information that helps enterprises quickly predict and respond to trends and threats alike.</p>



<p>Not only do companies that work with IBM Consulting get IBM’s experience in process design and business strategy; they also get the added bonus of IBM’s deep partnerships with companies like ServiceNow, Celonis and Salesforce. Ultimately, instead of being forced to focus on a single solution or technology, organizations can partner with IBM Consulting to invest in broad, transformational business initiatives and outcomes.</p>



<p>The new BPO is no longer just about cutting operational costs. When done right, it can make a business flexible, smarter and able to quickly scale to meet shifting market conditions. “Modern BPO is a creator of growth, differentiation and competitive advantage,” Manik says. </p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/intelligent-workflows/quiz/">Take this assessment to learn how intelligent workflows can help your business</a>



 Spotting hidden opportunities 



<p>At a time of rising costs, talent constraints and economic uncertainty, technologically enabled BPO offers an opportunity for companies to build intelligent workflows and leaner processes across finance, human resources, procurement, supply chain and customer operations. According to organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry, more than 85 million jobs could go unfilled by 2030 because there aren’t enough skilled workers to take them. The new BPO enables companies to quickly access more expert, technical, functional and industry specific talent than they can assemble in-house, driving new levels of efficiency across their business functions.</p>



<p>When working with clients, Manik looks for business opportunities that might be hidden under the surface: How can an organization’s BPO capabilities and methods enable a larger business transformation?</p>



<blockquote>
“What we can see is sometimes just the tip of the iceberg. There’s so much underneath this that can be unlocked in terms of business value.”
Neeraj Manik</blockquote>



<p>“It is our role as IBM Consulting to say, ‘how do we help you connect the dots?’” Manik says. “‘What we can see is sometimes just the tip of the iceberg. There’s so much underneath this that can be unlocked in terms of business value, that can improve how you go to market, how efficiently you run your supply chains, and how you can raise your margin profile.’”</p>



<p>For IBM Consulting, it’s not only about producing a list of recommendations for action, Manik says, but about following through and helping companies implement process automation and manage change, ensure adoption and get results.</p>



<p>The results can be apparent quickly. In the case of insurance giant Generali, for example, IBM Consulting rolled out two new AI assistants in France—one that helped upskill employees and another that interfaced directly with customers. Generali also became one of the first insurance companies to use AI to tackle the complex task of escheatment, or returning unclaimed assets and property. The new tools augmented the work of thousands of insurance agents, saving $1million in the first year of deployment, and increasing productivity by 5%. The program’s success in France led Generali to scale AI solutions internationally.</p>



 Seeing the bigger picture 



<p>As companies plot their investments in various transformation projects, Manik has one central piece of advice: “Make sure every decision you make about technology starts with and has a clear and direct link to business outcomes,” he says. “It sounds obvious, but it’s something that many C-suite leaders tend to forget as they get excited about new technology or a specific upgrade,” Manik says. It’s his role to help leaders take a step back and look at the big picture: “Don’t focus solely on what to adopt next,” he says, “but ask yourself why you need it in your operating model.”</p>



<p>One car manufacturer, for example, opened up a conversation by asking about an upgrade to its data servers. Manik reframed the question. “Hang on — we recognize your need to modernize, but to what end?” he told them. “How will this technology decision deliver the business impact you need?”</p>



<p>That question sparked a conversation about the carmaker’s larger goals, including its push to produce more autonomous vehicles. “Once we really understood that they are trying to change how quickly they can produce cars and different types of vehicles, we realized they needed a different supply chain design,” Manik says. “We are now on a path with them around supply chain transformation.</p>



<p>“Many times the conversation starts with technology, but migrates somewhere else,” Manik says. “Ultimately, it’s not about adopting new technology for technology’s sake, it’s about rethinking business processes and core competencies to uncover new business opportunities and areas to optimize — sometimes in ways that customers aren’t expecting.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20221006.html">According to Warranty Week</a>, claims totaling 46 billion USD were paid by the global automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers in 2021. 54 billion USD in accruals have been made. This means that based on experience, roughly $630 per vehicle sold is held back for upcoming warranty issues. The challenge to avoid or reduce warranty claims and their costs is enormous, as flaws can happen along the complete value chain. This is where a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin">digital twin</a> can help.</p>



 The current warranty landscape 



<p>Lean production leads to a higher efficiency, less material usage, and reduced costs. But it also leads to a higher risk for new, unknown quality issues, and therefore potential warranty topics. With more and more software built into a vehicle, the percentage of software-related warranty claims is increasing year over year. The need now is to detect new unidentified failures and problems as early as possible.</p>



<p>Generally, software issues can easily be fixed via over the air and do not need a recall. This leads to a reduction in total warranty costs for software related warranty topics in a customer-friendly and efficient way. At the same time, the total figures of global claims and accruals did not change much over the last five years. What does that mean?</p>



 Early data-driven warranty re-invention 



<p>The global automotive OEMs have always faced warranty issues and therefore their warranty management capabilities are quite mature. From including social media data to stay aware of trends, to using IoT data to decrease failure rates in plants, some over-performing companies are leading the direction in leveraging data for warranty topics.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/data-powered-warranty">Our 2020 IBV benchmark study “data driven warranty reinvention”</a> emphasizes this point, given the responses of the 300 automotive leaders responsible for warranty management in their organizations across 11 countries in Asia Pacific, Europe, the U.S., and Canada. They were, among other things, asked for their warranty KPIs. The ranges of performance fed back to us show potential for improvement for every company. Even the over-performing early technology adopters have still a lot of possibilities to better use their data.</p>



 Opportunities with data-driven digital twins 



<p>Much has happened in engineering (e.g., avoiding warranty issues through simulation), manufacturing (e.g., detecting and preventing failures through sensor data analysis) and after sales (e.g., detecting trends through social media analysis) through the usage of data analytics. But even as the adoption of new technology supported new warranty improvement practices, it remains a huge undertaking to root cause failures backwards through the value chain. Additionally, the warranty costs are still handed back to the supplier.</p>



<p>The reasons are manifold—from siloed information, missing data, and unclear data ownership to outdated analysis tools—and the recent manufacturing 4.0, smart factory or internet of things approaches do not resolve these issues completely and to full satisfaction.</p>



<p>The new shiny knight for reinventing warranty analysis is the digital twin. Here’s why: The digital twin is not a one-time project to hook up different systems to connect different sensors. It is a process. More specifically, it is a living process that makes true root-causing and early detection possible, including cross-referencing alerts along the value chain, from design and build to sales and after sales. It gathers and connects information, making it cross-referenceable and ready to analyze group-wise.</p>



<p>The digital twin has the power to resolve the old issue of, “We know the failure part, we kind of know which vehicles this part was built in, but we do not know which supplier batch was erroneous. Therefore, we cannot recall only the affected vehicles, we need to recall all possibly affected ones.”</p>



<p>When the digital twin of a vehicle spans from design and engineering to manufacturing of the operational twin, we have all the information together for both warranty reduction and warranty avoidance.</p>



<p>Warranty management is a continuous process. And it will be reinvented with the wide availability of digital twins.</p>

<p>Assets are the lifeblood of any successful business—from software programs tailored to meet an enterprise’s unique needs to a pipeline that stretches across oceans. One of the most important strategic decisions a business leader can make is how these assets are cared for over the course of their lifespans.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a small enterprise with only a few assets or a large-scale corporation with offices spanning the globe, asset lifecycle management, or ALM, is a fundamental part of your operations. Here’s what you need to know in order to build a successful strategy.</p>



 What is an asset? 



<p>First, let’s talk about what an asset is and why they are so important. Companies use assets to create value. There are many different types of assets, both physical and non-physical. Examples of physical assets include equipment, office buildings and vehicles. Non-physical assets include intellectual property, trademarks and patents.</p>



 What is asset lifecycle management? 



<p>Each asset a company acquires goes through six main stages over the course of its life, requiring careful maintenance planning and management tactics to provide its owners with a strong return on investment.</p>



<p>The following are the six stages of asset lifecycle management:</p>



 
 Planning: In the first stage of the asset lifecycle, stakeholders assess the need for the asset, its projected value to the organization and its overall cost. 



 Valuation: A critical part of the planning stage is assessing the overall value of an asset. Decision-makers must take into account many different pieces of information in order to gauge this, including the assets likely length of useful life, its projected performance over time and the cost of disposing of it. One technique that is becoming increasingly valuable during this stage is the creation of a digital twin. &nbsp; 



 Digital twin technology: A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin">digital twin</a> is a virtual representation of an asset a company intends to acquire that assists organizations in their decision-making process. Digital twins allow companies to run tests and predict performance based on simulations. With a good digital twin, its possible to predict how well an asset will perform under the conditions it will be subjected to. 



 Procurement and installation: The next stage of the asset lifecycle concerns the purchase, transportation and installation of the asset. During this stage, operators will need to consider a number of factors, including how well the new asset is expected to perform within the overall ecosystem of the business, how its data will be shared and incorporated into business decisions, and how it will be put into operation and integrated with other assets the company owns. 



 Utilization: This phase is critical to maximizing asset performance over time and extending its lifespan. Recently, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-asset-management#:~:text=Enterprise%20asset%20management%20(EAM)%20is,uptime%20and%20reduce%20operational%20costs.">enterprise asset management systems (EAMs)</a> have become an indispensable tool in helping businesses perform predictive and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-preventive-maintenance">preventive maintenance</a> so they can keep assets running longer and generating more value. We’ll go deeper into EAMs, the technologies underpinning them and their implications for asset lifecycle management strategy in another section. 



 Decommissioning: The final stage of the asset lifecycle is the decommissioning of the asset. Valuable assets can be complex and markets are always shifting, so during this phase, it’s important to weigh the depreciation of the current asset against the rising cost of maintaining it in order to calculate its overall ROI. Decision-makers will want to take into consideration a variety of factors when attempting to measure this, including asset uptime, projected lifespan and the shifting costs of fuel and spare parts. 
 



 The benefits of asset lifecycle management strategy 



<p>When you’ve invested your hard-earned capital in the acquisition of assets, it’s important to keep them running at peak levels for as long as possible. Systematizing and executing an effective asset management strategy can produce a wide range of benefits for your organization, including the following:</p>



 
 Scalability of best practices: Today’s asset lifecycle management strategies use cutting-edge technologies coupled with rigorous, systematic approaches to forecast, schedule and optimize all daily maintenance tasks and long-term repair needs. 



 Streamlined operations and maintenance: Minimize the likelihood of equipment failure, anticipate breakdowns and perform preventive maintenance when possible. Today’s top EAM systems dramatically improve the decision-making capabilities of managers, operators and maintenance technicians by giving them real-time visibility into equipment status and workflows. 



 Reduced maintenance costs and downtime: Monitor assets in real time, regardless of complexity. By coupling asset information (thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT)) with powerful analytics capabilities, businesses can now perform cost-effective preventive maintenance, intervening before a critical asset fails and preventing costly downtime. 



 Greater alignment across business units: Optimize management processes according to a variety of factors beyond just the condition of a piece of equipment. These factors can include available resources (e.g., capital and manpower), projected downtime and its implications for the business, worker safety, and any potential security risks associated with the repair. 



 Improved compliance: Comply with laws surrounding the management and operation of assets, regardless of where they are located. Data management and storage requirements vary widely from country to country and are constantly evolving. Avoid costly penalties by monitoring assets in a strategic, systematized manner that ensures compliance—no matter where data is being stored. &nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 How to build an effective asset lifecycle management strategy 



<p>Because of the increased complexity of asset maintenance and the technologies required to build an effective maintenance strategy, many businesses utilize enterprise asset management, coupled with a strong <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-cmms">computerized management system (CMMS)</a> and advanced asset tracking capabilities to manage their most valuable assets.</p>



 Enterprise asset management systems (EAMs) 



<p>Enterprise asset management systems (EAMs) are a component of asset lifecycle management strategy that combines asset management software, systems and services to lengthen asset lifespan and increase productivity. Many rely on a CMMS to monitor assets in real time and recommend maintenance when necessary. Top-performing EAM systems monitor asset performance and maintain a historical record of critical activity, such as when it was purchased, when it was last repaired and how much its cost an organization over time.</p>



 Computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) 



<p>Computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) are software systems that maintain a database of an organization’s maintenance operations and help extend the lifespan of assets. Many industries rely on CMMS as a component of EAM, including manufacturing, oil and gas production, power generation, construction and transportation. One of the most popular features of CMMS is its ability to spot opportunities for companies to perform regular preventive maintenance on their most valuable assets.</p>



 Preventive maintenance 



<p>Preventive maintenance helps prevent the unexpected failure of an asset by recommending maintenance activities according to a historical record and current performance metrics. Put simply, it’s about fixing things before they break. Through <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a>, operational data analytics and predictive asset health monitoring, today’s top-performing asset lifecycle management strategies optimize maintenance and reduce reliability risks to plant or business operations. EAM systems and a CMMS designed to support preventive maintenance can help produce stable operations, ensure compliance and resolve issues impacting production—before they happen.</p>



 Asset tracking 



<p>Asset tracking is another important component of asset lifecycle management strategy. Like EAM and CMMS, asset-tracking capabilities have also improved in recent years due to technological breakthroughs. Here are some of the most effective technologies available today for tracking assets.</p>



 
 Radio frequency identifier tags (RFID): RFID tags broadcast information about the asset they’re attached to using radio-frequency signals and Bluetooth technology. They can transmit a wide range of important information, including asset location, temperature and even the humidity of the environment the asset is located in. 



 WiFi-enabled tracking: Like RFIDs, WiFi-enabled tracking devices monitor a range of useful information about an asset, but they only work if the asset is within range of a WiFi network. 



 QR codes: Like their predecessor, the universal barcode, QR codes provide asset information quickly and accurately. But unlike barcodes, they are two-dimensional and easily readable with a smartphone from any angle. 



 Global positioning satellites (GPS): With a GPS system, a tracker is placed on an asset that then communicates information to the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) network. By transmitting a signal to a satellite, the system enables managers to track an asset anywhere on the globe, in real time. 
 



 Asset lifecycle management strategy solutions 



<p>Many of today’s asset lifecycle management (ALM) solutions leverage cutting-edge technology like real-time data delivered via IoT, AI-enhanced analytics and monitoring, cloud-based capabilities and powerful automation that can help streamline workflows. Enterprise asset management (EAM) with the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/asset-management">IBM Maximo Application Suite</a> helps companies optimize asset performance, extend asset lifespans and reduce downtime and cost.&nbsp;It’s a fully integrated platform that uses advanced analytics tools and IoT data to improve operational availability and spot opportunities to perform preventive maintenance.</p>

<p>The unique nature of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Digital Travel Credential (DTC) presents an exceptional opportunity to build a next-generation system for passport issuance and inspection, setting a new standard for the traveler experience. Entrust fully supports the vision set out by the ICAO for technological advances from the current eMRTD standard for ePassports to a future state that will see only virtual eMRTDs. But the journey to paperless passports will take many years.</p>
<p>There have been several policy and technical papers released – and, despite the gaps in technical specifications, we’ve seen many seamless travel pilots already. However, much of the policy work at the ICAO level to enable the passport-issuer created DTC remains in-progress or has yet to begin. Governments and industry should begin to contribute to policy discussions now to support future technology decisions.</p>
<p><a></a>DTC Standards</p>
<p></p>
<p>VC = Virtual Component&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PC = Physical Component</p>
<p>There remains significant work to do on communications protocols between the DTC and inspection systems. Most of the Type 2 and 3 specifications are yet to be developed.</p>
<p>DTC Pilots</p>
<p>Pearson Airport, Toronto</p>
<p>The Canada Border Services Agency worked with Entrust and Face4 Systems Inc. on smartphone-based enrollment including DTC derivation for a touchless arrivals process for returning Canadian citizens. The goal was to test passing identity information and traveler declarations to the CBSA back-end for processing, essentially replicating kiosk-based traveler processing, but via a self-service touchless process.</p>
<p>UK / EU</p>
<p>Eurostar is working with iProov and Entrust on smartphone-based enrollment including DTC derivation for a touchless train journey check-in and border processing for passengers departing the UK from St. Pancras International. The DTC can be reused for subsequent journeys. Hundreds of transactions demonstrated improved traveler throughput without compromising security. Eurostar is deploying the service as an operational system before rolling out to stations in the EU.</p>
<p>Netherlands / Canada</p>
<p>This pilot is a collaboration between the Ministry of the Interior, the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (KMar), the National Service for Identity Data (RvIG), Schiphol Airport, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and IDEMIA. Funding is provided by the European Commission. Canada’s engagement is limited to facilitating temporary procedural changes to waive the presentation of a physical passport prior to boarding. The project scope is for Netherlands and Canadian citizens departing Canada for the Netherlands.</p>
<p>DTC Use Cases</p>
<p>ICAO identifies the following potential DTC use cases:</p>
 
 Enable seamless travel 
 
<p>Using the packet of verifiable traveler data as the enabler of touchless travel experiences.</p>
 
 Improve the Advance Travel Authorization process 
 
<p>Authentication of data submitted to Electronic Travel Authorization and similar schemes, and elimination of data errors.</p>
 
 Streamline border management 
 
<p>Pushing the border out before travel starts by enabling the passenger to send data in advance, allowing authorities to make early watchlist checks.</p>
 
 Emergency Travel Document (ETD) 
 
<p>Type 3 DTCs could be issued by authorities to citizens whose passport had been lost or stolen during travel, saving significant costs and inconvenience for traveler and government alike.</p>
<p>What can document issuers do now?</p>
<p>Document issuers could follow the path being paved by the Netherlands Ministry of the Interior by getting involved in seamless travel pilots. Historically, document issuers have had little influence over how their documents are utilized. A pilot of this sort would require forging close relationships with immigration authorities and airlines. A pilot under the control of a document issuer would perhaps be easier to implement. The two obvious use cases within the control of a document issuer are streamlining border management and the issuance of emergency travel documents.</p>
<p>The rate of adoption of innovations in the passport world has some very understandable friction. Most passports are valid for 10 years, and ICAO’s policy to be backward compatible with previous technology whenever possible may make changes appear slower in implementation. But for the people directly involved, whether from industry or government, there is a growing excitement for the changes the DTC will bring to the world of travel.</p>

<p>HYPR recently announced the appointment of Matt Hartley as our Chief Revenue Officer. With more than two decades in cybersecurity and technology, Matt brings invaluable expertise in sales leadership and go-to-market strategies to propel HYPR through the next stage of growth.</p>  
<p>Prior to joining HYPR, Hartley held senior positions driving rapid scale and predictability across the revenue lifecycle at security organizations including iboss, Forescout, Optio Labs and MobileIron. As Chief Revenue Officer at iboss, Hartley led go to market growth in the SASE/SSE market. During his tenure at Forescout, he built their US Federal unit and then scaled the business as the VP of Americas Sales. Before Forescout, he served as General Manager of Optio Labs, head of Federal sales at MobileIron, and held regional sales positions at various technology companies.</p> 
<p>HYPR spoke to Matt Hartley to talk about his new role, the state of the market and why he chose HYPR.</p> 
 What gets you excited about this role? How do you think your previous roles and experiences prepared you for this position?  
<p>MH: I'm excited to join HYPR because the transformations happening in the market, particularly a shift of applications and people off traditional campuses and "perimeters," present security challenges and business opportunities that HYPR uniquely addresses.&nbsp; Identity is a critical market that spans beyond security into risk, HR, compliance and other business-critical functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While the security industry has been talking about the importance of identity for years, it rapidly accelerated with the pandemic.&nbsp; We have also seen legacy MFA solutions built on the password collapse under the onslaught of automated attacks. Importantly, we've now reached a point where we have novel solutions that can address the authentication pain point that has been the top vector of breaches for many years.</p> 
<p>My experiences to this point have shaped an understanding of the cyber security issues and also how solutions to these problems can create lasting business value for our customers.&nbsp; And HYPR is already leading in that direction with the most demanding customer environments at global scale who attest to the enhanced security of the HYPR platform but also of tremendous productivity gains for their end users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Why HYPR?  
<p>MH: HYPR’s vision, culture and world-class talent is what ultimately drew me to the company.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR stood out in its level of expertise, technical breadth and platform approach. I saw a team of collaborative doers, focused on solving problems and moving forward.</p> 
<p>Moreover, I understood that HYPR has a proven Identity Platform used by over 16 million users in 125 countries with a transformative roadmap informed by their global clients. HYPR sits in a unique position with control and visibility at the endpoint, browser, and mobile device.&nbsp; This distinctive advantage provides a powerful combination for customers at the point of authentication where many cyber incidents begin today. I am thrilled to join this team as the company enters a next-level growth phase helping more organizations fix the way they log in and create identity trust.</p> 
 Where do you see the market headed in the coming year, what are some of the major trends and themes we’ll see?  
<p>MH:&nbsp; We are beginning a sea change in the identity industry. The FIDO standard is being broadly adopted for consumer and enterprise use cases. The support of Apple, Google, and Microsoft for passkeys will certainly accelerate user adoption and acceptance. The transition to passkeys will present challenges and opportunities for the market. Companies will need to make critical decisions&nbsp; about how they implement, use and manage passkey-based authentication. Companies need an identity security partner with expertise in change management and a solution that provides flexibility along with the controls enterprises require. HYPR is&nbsp; already helping organizations accelerate their rollout of passkeys to meet internal and customer demand for modern authentication.</p> 
 Anything else you want people to know?  
<p>MH: The next generation of authentication is here NOW. If you're tired of passwords and want a consumer experience for users that makes logging in a delight, while simultaneously more secure, <a href="https://get.hypr.com/contact">contact us </a>to have a conversation.</p>

   Extra Virgin Olive Oil is often inauthentic, according to the article on Well and Good. Not only that, those mislabeled oils can cause health issues due to the unhealthy seed oils or nut oils that are added and which some people are sensitive to.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 5th June to 18th&nbsp;June <p>Welcome to the latest edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, keeping you up-to-date with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency regulations.</p><p>From the UK’s Crypto Parliamentary Group advocating accelerated crypto regulations to Brazil embedding robust laws for crypto transparency, we’ve seen significant strides on the regulatory frontlines over the two&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>The US, on the other hand, is grappling with regulatory uncertainty as industry leaders call for comprehensive oversight.</p><p>Let’s not wait any further and dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Shift: Countries Align Towards Robust Crypto Regulations <p>In a bid to streamline and fortify the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector, legislative assemblies across the globe are taking decisive action. The focus appears to be squarely set on creating robust frameworks for regulation and oversight, potentially redefining the global crypto landscape.</p><p>Starting in the UK, the Crypto and Digital Assets All Parliamentary Group (APPG) has urged the government to expeditiously introduce crypto financial services regulations.</p><p>As cryptocurrencies continue gaining momentum, the government’s previous suggestion to include crypto within existing financial service regulations is being championed by the APPG. They aim to see the UK equipped with specific crypto regulations within the&nbsp;year.</p><p>Aiming to leverage the UK’s potential leadership in the sector, lawmakers are also debating bills to grant law enforcement agencies more authority over crypto activities, alongside the current requirement for crypto companies to register with the Financial Conduct Authority.</p><p>Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in Brazil, President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva has solidified his country’s position within the crypto world by signing comprehensive regulations into law. This decree, which defines the roles of the Central Bank and the country’s securities regulator, is set to take effect on June 20, positioning Brazil as a stable, innovative hub for digital&nbsp;assets.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669744785182056448?s=20">Image Source</a><p>A central aspect of the law is the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism within the crypto industry, further solidifying Brazil’s commitment to a secure and transparent environment for digital currency transactions. This regulatory measure harmoniously aligns with Brazil’s ongoing exploration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the Digital Brazilian Real.</p><p>The urgency of these international regulatory shifts is further underscored by the United States’ current predicament.</p><p>The lack of federal oversight in the US digital commodity market has created uncertainty, sparking conversations about the approach of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>The Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, advocates for Congressional intervention to protect customers, ensure market stability, and safeguard the traditional financial system from potential contagion. He suggests implementing well-established regulations focusing on asset protection, trading activity surveillance, conflict of interest prevention, and cybersecurity standards.</p><p>Further echoing these concerns, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has expressed her support for regulatory oversight of cryptocurrency to protect consumers and investors.</p><p>As cryptocurrencies continue to disrupt traditional financial structures, the collective call for swift, comprehensive regulation has now clearly become a global phenomenon. The challenge, as always, lies in striking the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring stability and protection for all participants.</p><p>Now, we’ll analyze two of the biggest developments from the fortnight and look into their possible impacts on the crypto ecosystem.</p> Cross-Party UK Group Pushes for Swift Crypto Regulation <p>The Crypto and Digital Assets All Parliamentary Group (APPG), a cross-party body in the UK, has urged the government to expedite regulating cryptocurrency financial services.</p><p>The APPG recently published a report outlining 53 recommendations for cryptocurrency regulation, aiming to position the UK as a leader in the global crypto market. It advocates for expanded powers for lawmakers over the crypto sector to boost financial security and consumer protection.</p><p>The group’s report, launched in response to a vision of making the UK a crypto hub, also highlights the need for dedicated units within regulatory bodies to handle digital assets. Additional recommendations include backing stablecoins with high-quality fiat currency assets and considering the environmental implications of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>This proposal by the APPG diverges from a recent suggestion by the House of Commons Treasury Committee to regulate crypto-like gambling.</p><p>Instead, the APPG’s report focuses on establishing a comprehensive tax framework for crypto, mitigating financial stability risks, and curbing economic crimes linked to crypto. The group is also examining the potential for a Central Bank Digital Currency.</p> The Impact <p>The ripple effects of these proposed regulations could be far-reaching. From the perspective of crypto users, increased regulatory oversight might bring more security to digital asset transactions. It could help safeguard investors from potential fraud and insulate them from high-risk exposure.</p><p>Clear-cut regulations might also foster transparency in the crypto market, thereby boosting investor confidence and attracting more participants to the ecosystem. However, regulatory decisions could also potentially hinder the freedom and privacy that is intrinsic to the world of digital currencies. It’s a delicate balance between regulation for protection and stifling innovation.</p><p>For the ecosystem at large, establishing a stable regulatory framework can help enhance the legitimacy of crypto transactions and integrate them more seamlessly into traditional financial systems.</p><p>The attention given to the environmental impact of crypto is critical, given the ongoing debate about the carbon footprint of blockchain-based transactions.</p><p>Overall, the move towards regulation signifies the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a significant part of the financial sector. It’s a crucial step towards shaping a more secure and transparent future for digital assets in the global&nbsp;market.</p> CFTC Chairman Advocates Congressional Action for Robust Crypto Regulation <p>CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam is pressing for a shift in the United States’ regulatory response to cryptocurrencies.</p><p>In a recent address to the House Committee on Agriculture, he underlined the need for a more proactive stance instead of the SEC’s current “Regulation by Enforcement” method, citing it as unfit for the fast-evolving crypto industry.</p><p>He highlighted major issues, such as the collapse of large digital asset platforms and market manipulation, as examples of why a change in strategy is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>Behnam’s suggested solution? Adopting regulations familiar to traditional finance, covering customer asset protection, trading surveillance, conflict of interest, and strict cybersecurity measures.</p><p>Such a move could have major ramifications for the crypto ecosystem. On the one hand, it may protect users from mishaps like platform bankruptcies and unscrupulous trading, potentially even easing the market’s infamous volatility. Stricter cybersecurity standards would also fortify the defense against persistent cyber&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Yet, an uptick in regulation could restrict the independence characteristic of digital currencies. It’s, therefore, vital to find a balance that protects users while not hampering innovation in the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>On a broader scale, clearly defined regulatory frameworks could enhance the industry’s credibility, potentially attracting more institutional players and fostering mainstream cryptocurrency acceptance. However, overregulation risks dampening the sector’s innovative flair.</p><p>The proposal to transition from a reactive to a proactive approach in regulating cryptocurrencies signifies a potential watershed moment in the United States’ regulatory stance on digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The impact of this change will undoubtedly shape the role of cryptocurrencies within the broader financial system, setting the tone for their&nbsp;future.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669744785182056448?s=20">What is Shyft Veriscope?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669428636691185664?s=20">Travel Rule Compliance Challenges</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669668973800038401?s=20">Secured User Data&nbsp;Exchange</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Emerging cloud-based technology trends like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, the Metaverse, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-the-iot/">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/what-is-edge-computing">edge computing</a> are evolving at a rapid pace, seemingly adding new capabilities every few months to fundamentally transform how people and organizations interact with them. For enterprises to match scale and speed, it is critical to modernize their core business applications to accelerate innovation.</p>



<p>However, for many, there are perceived challenges as they start their journey.</p>



<p>Modernization is not a new term. Most executives have it as a key priority. In a recent IBM IBV study, 83% of executives surveyed stated modernizing their applications and data was a business priority but only 27% admitted to having started their modernization efforts. And those who do get started often focus on operational objectives like operating expenses and labor spend instead of more strategic priorities. Only 45% of respondents prioritize growth from improving existing products or services and building new capabilities.</p>



<p>Application modernization is at the core of&nbsp; a hybrid cloud-enabled transformation that can deliver up to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/QW8VB8AP">13 times higher revenue impact of cloud investments</a> when orchestrated as an end-to-end reinvention of the enterprise.</p>



 A unified approach is critical in a hybrid multicloud world 



<p>In a 2021 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/7BJPNGND">IBM IBV</a> study, executives who were surveyed expected the use of both mainframe and cloud-based applications to grow with a fit-for-purpose digital strategy, pointing to the need for enterprise-wide transformation that facilitates integration and optimization of both environments. 70% of the surveyed mainframe customers planned to leverage hybrid cloud to improve the integration and effectiveness of core business applications and intended to use a cloud orchestrator/management platform to coordinate workloads in multiple environments. Yet, 82% of executives agreed that their teams lacked the necessary skills for managing these cloud- and legacy-based applications collectively.</p>



<p>It is not surprising then that organizations sometimes face unforeseen challenges as they try to accelerate their cloud adoption. Enabling the right tools, skills and an enhanced developer experience can balance productivity and smooth delivery across the legacy and modernized environments without disruption of business processes.</p>



<p>Today’s typical full-stack development environment may need the front-end application developers on multiple distributed platforms to interact with the back-end teams using z/OS-based development environments.</p>



 New additions to the IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/z-and-cloud-modernization-stack">IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack</a> can provide a unified full-stack experience for developers working on hybrid cloud applications, regardless of whether it’s a front-end application that will run in a private/public cloud environment or a back-end application running on z/OS (or both). This consistent enterprise development approach allows for all application developers to share the same industry-standard open tools across the end-to-end breadth of the application(s). This is achieved by being built on and optimized for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, providing clients the option to exploit a cloud-native experience.</p>



<p>Today we’re announcing new additions to the IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack capabilities, including the following:</p>



 
 The z/OS PaaS experience: Deliver a self-service experience to developers to provision the environments and software they need for development, right into their personal sandbox. A custom z/OS development environment can be established via an automated, cloud-native approach. Use the IBM-provided capabilities to rapidly recreate complex z/OS environments for development. Newly available is the facility to extend these capabilities with your own automation using the published open-source <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/what-are-openshift-operators">Operator</a> Collection SDK and specification, which provide the resources and tools to build your own operators connecting Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and z/OS. 



 Create secured open standard-based APIs: Efficiently provide secure access to IBM zSystems applications and data through industry-standard APIs using the Open API specification on IBM Cloud or any cloud of choice with IBM industry partners. Provide a comprehensive and agile development environment for <a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/playlist/dedicated/1_ykaqj9pe/1_ldh1byk5">creating and consuming APIs in minutes</a>. Based on the z/OS Connect offering, you can scale business-critical APIs and leverage the strengths of the IBM zSystems platform while providing integration with enterprise API management solutions like the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-integration">IBM Cloud Pak for Integration</a>. 



 Cloud-native experience for developing and deploying applications: Provide a cloud-native approach to developing and modernizing z/OS applications, designed to increase speed and agility for greater developer productivity. Efficiently modify existing COBOL, PL/I, Java or Assembler programs, but also take advantage of new programming languages, including Python, Node.js and Go. Seamlessly integrate with standard (Git) enterprise-wide CI/CD toolchains or with DevOps platforms of our partners. Using the new <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/blogs/mark-indermaur/2023/06/13/announcing-ibm-wazi-deploy-a-new-open-source-based">IBM Wazi Deploy</a>, deploy modified applications using Ansible or Python scripts into the Sandbox test environment created as part of the z/OS PaaS experience. Then, when they are ready, deploy them into production. 



 Rapid application analysis: Mitigate the risk of application changes by rapidly analyzing code changes to help ensure clients know the dependencies before getting started. Leverage visualization features to help make the dependencies easy to share and understand.

				  Attracting and Aligning Partners in Ecosystems 
<p>When it comes to creating an ecosystem, one of the main challenges lies in attracting and aligning the right partners who can contribute to its growth and success. However, partners may hesitate to join if they are unsure of how they fit into the ecosystem or what their role would be. This is where an EGF comes into play.</p>
 Addressing the “Cold Start” Problem with an EGF 
<p>An EGF serves as a powerful tool to address the “cold start” problem. By providing structure and guidance, it becomes easier for partners to understand how they can actively contribute and extract value from the ecosystem. Additionally, the framework jumpstarts the ecosystem’s growth by aligning partners’ interests and facilitating collaboration.</p>
 Going Beyond Platforms: The Role of Ecosystem Governance 
<p>While platforms primarily handle technical interactions and data movement, ecosystems encompass much more. They revolve around various roles and activities, determining what is encouraged, what is forbidden, and how interactions occur. Furthermore, ecosystems require effective governance, including addressing liability and indemnity concerns.</p>
  Tailoring an EGF for Maximum Value Creation 
<p>When an EGF is specifically tailored for a MVE, it plays a crucial role in delivering a compelling value proposition. It becomes instrumental in attracting partners and establishing a solid foundation for the ecosystem’s growth. By identifying areas where to build and where to rely on partners, organizations can strategically leverage the strengths of different participants to maximize value creation.</p>
 Simplifying Governance for Efficiency and Trust 
<p>While governance frameworks can often be complex, Continuum Loop advocates for simplicity and efficiency. The key is to focus on the core components that require governance, minimizing roles and processes to maintain manageability. Additionally, implementing governance artifacts such as glossaries and assurance levels becomes critical in ensuring shared understanding and maintaining trust among ecosystem participants.</p>
 Empowering Organizations with Continuum Loop 
<p>At Continuum Loop, we are deeply committed to empowering organizations in designing and implementing effective ecosystem governance frameworks. Our expertise lies in aligning governance, business, and technology to help companies build vibrant ecosystems that thrive on collaboration, innovation, and shared success.</p>
 Leveraging Ecosystem Governance Frameworks for Success 
<p>By leveraging the power of ecosystem governance frameworks, organizations can create an environment where partners can contribute their unique expertise, drive value creation, and collectively shape the future of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>The word "wallet" gets used a lot, but is rarely defined. Whether you're fresh to web3 or a seasoned veteran, you've likely felt this confusion. Even worse: maybe you don't know you're confused? Let me explain.</p> What Is a Wallet?   "Which wallet should I use?"  "What wallet should I send this to?"  "Can I import my wallet?"  <p>In each of these questions, "wallet" refers to a completely different part of the Wallet Stack: a <code>Wallet Client</code>, an <code>Account &amp; Account Address</code>, and a <code>Recovery Method</code>—which itself infers the existence of a <code>Wallet Structure</code>.</p>The Wallet Stack consists of: a Wallet Client, a Recovery Method &amp; Wallet Structure, and and Account &amp; Address.<p>Colloquially, calling every part of the stack a "wallet" isn't an issue. For many people right now, they all indeed feel like the same thing. Where the problem becomes real is in the UI copy itself.</p><p>Across and within various <code>Wallet Clients</code>, the word wallet leaks inconsistently into the user experience. It's no wonder people get confused. For new users this can be misleading. For experienced users it may never be clear what's actually going on underneath.</p><p>Let me pick on Coinbase Wallet for a moment to ground this in an example. Not only are they the most successful brand in blockchain, they are also one of the worst abusers of the word wallet.</p>Coinbase Wallet: A tragedy in 3 parts<p>To enter Coinbase Wallet's world, one must:</p>  Install Coinbase Wallet (a <code>Wallet Client</code>), which will prompt you to  Create a new Wallet (aka set up a new <code>Recovery Method</code> that will generate a password protected <code>Wallet Structure</code>), at which point  The app will provision you with 10 Wallets (which are actually 10 <code>Accounts</code> identified by their unique <code>Account Addresses</code>).  <p>Because many people only go through this flow once, and never bother going into settings, their confusion may be fleeting. But can you imagine what internal Coinbase Wallet sprint planning looks like? "Alex, can you fix the bug with wallets being derived non-deterministically from the wallet a user imports into the latest version of our wallet?"</p><p>Poor Alex. Poor us.</p><p>Those of us designing and building need to be more precise. So: let's get precise.</p><p>A couple of notes: This post uses Ethereum examples, but the ideas hold true for smart contract enabled chains in general, and will be identical in practice for all EVM compatible chains. You’ll also notice I’m explicitly not using the word dapp. If a dapp is software whose backend is strictly hosted on a blockchain, that is a subset of all apps. I believe all apps will have wallet interactions in the near future.</p> Wallet Clients <p>When someone asks "Which wallet should I use?" what they're really asking is "Which wallet client should I use?"—examples being Metamask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, a Ledger Nano, or a Gnosis Safe. The <code>Wallet Client</code> is the interface they'll use to connect to an app, sign messages and transactions, and manage their on-chain assets.</p> Varieties Of Wallet Client <p>A wide variety of <code>Wallet Clients</code> exist, and the list grows daily. To thoughtfully recommend one, it's important to know a bit more about a person's intentions. What's their threat model? Which chain(s) are they going to be using? What do they want to do in web3?</p><p>Even with clear answers to those questions, making the right recommendation can be complicated. <a href="https://mirror.xyz/depatchedmode.eth/uxsq5GRcelYkwPB-BicnfjTPisxiNVJCQQ3bIGPPmmQ">There are just so many options out there</a>. It’s helpful to think about the ways you can categorize <code>Wallet Clients</code>:</p>  Software vs Hardware: Most folks will start out by using a software wallet on their laptop, tablet or phone—either in the form of a native app, web app, or a browser extension. Eventually, they're going to want more security and are likely to move to something like a Ledger Nano—a dedicated piece of hardware with embedded firmware. Software and hardware clients mostly map to the concept of hot wallets and cold wallets respectively. TLDR: putting valuable assets into cold storage on a hardware wallet client is a good move.  Finance vs Identity-focused: Historically, folks have turned to their <code>Wallet Client</code> to manage the financial activity they’re engaged in on-chain: monitoring their portfolio value, or swapping and staking assets. But, over the past year we've seen <code>Wallet Clients</code> such as Autonomy and Rainbow begin to support viewing and interacting with an NFT collection, and even constructing public profiles. These features address the emerging desire to garden on-chain identities—or rather, <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e">inventories</a>.  Single vs Multi-chain: Most <code>Wallet Clients</code> focus on support for a single blockchain ecosystem: Metamask on Ethereum, Phantom on Solana, Kepler on Cosmos, or Kukai on Tezos. But there are options that support multiple chains from a single interface. Trust Wallet may have the broadest blockchain support out of the box, while Metamask has begun supporting additional blockchain networks via its 3rd party Snaps add-ons. Single chain <code>Wallet Clients</code> tend to be more mature and have better UX, but multi-chain clients are the final destination.  EOA vs Contract-based: Signing transactions and messages (for better and for worse) is the backbone of web3 experiences. Most <code>Wallet Clients</code> rely on Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) under the hood and require a single signature to "okay" a transaction—we'll explain this in more depth shortly. When you want to up your security, diversify your recovery paths, bundle transactions, set spending limits, or support other sophisticated organizational workflows, there are also contract-based clients. Gnosis Safe and Argent are examples of contract-based clients that enable features such as multiple signatures (multi-sigs) to process a transaction. Beware: not all apps support multi-sigs directly.   Challenges Wallet Clients Face   Overloaded Scope: At this moment in time, <code>Wallet Clients</code> pull triple duty in the web3 space, handling: private key management, application UI, and transaction/asset management. Billy Rennekamp explains how this could be restructured with his proposed <a href="https://billyrennekamp.medium.com/account-coordinator-a-proposal-for-the-future-of-wallets-9fc54032a202">Account Coordinator</a> pattern.  Not Being Metamask: If you're using anything other than Metamask, chances are high you're connecting your <code>Wallet Client</code> to an app using a wallet transport layer like <a href="https://walletconnect.com/">Wallet Connect</a>. Or you’re hoping your <code>Wallet Client</code> has decided to emulate Metamask.  Poor Mobile Support: On mobile, most apps expect you to copy the URL to your clipboard, open your <code>Wallet Client</code>, launch its in-app web browser, and then paste the URL. Once again, implementing <code>Wallet Connect</code> in your app helps alleviate this and allows your users to use their mobile browser of choice. As a sidenote, most web3-enabled apps are neither responsive nor mobile-friendly; it is imperative that developers and designers adopt a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-develop-and-test-a-mobile-first-design-in-2021/">mobile first approach to user experience</a>.  Inconsistent Terminology: Accounts? Wallets? Import? Add? Connect? Link? Different combinations of these words appear all over the place referring to different things. Hopefully this post will help to chip away at some of that confusion, but there is still a lot of ground to cover. It is critical the teams behind <code>Wallet Clients</code> continue to engage in user research to identify the right mental models and terminology to support them—with a mind towards localization as well!  No Settings Portability: If you've ever tried migrating to a different instance of Metamask, or from Metamask to Rainbow Wallet—not picking on either of them specifically—you've learned with some frustration that you have to setup everything from scratch again: account names, block and allow lists, token lists, network settings, etc. That process is both tedious and error prone to do even once, let alone maintain on an ongoing basis.  Centralization Under the Hood: Many of the user experience improvements wallets have achieved in terms of displaying assets and transaction history have been gained through leveraging highly centralized 3rd party APIs. Moxie Marlinspike published an excellent tear down of <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">where this centralization has introduced fragility</a> into the ecosystem. There are better ways.   Accounts &amp; Account Addresses <p>When someone asks "Which wallet should I send this to?" what they're really asking is "What's the account address I should send this to?"—the long base-58 string that identifies your account on the chain.</p><p>So, what exactly is the account that address identifies? Well, there are two distinct types.</p>The triangle is, in fact, the strongest shape. Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs):   live off-chain—ie. they are "external" to the blockchain  are controlled by a private key, from which a public key and address are derived  are responsible for initiating all transactions   Contract Accounts:   live on-chain as code  are controlled by the functions defined in that on-chain code  can only act in response to transactions issued by EOAs  <p>Though Contract Accounts are becoming more common, most people still have EOAs. This is because, even if you use a Contract Account, an EOA must still be present somewhere in the chain to trigger the action you want to take—though there are <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337">plans in motion</a> to address this with Account Abstraction.</p><p>With both types of accounts, the Account Address is the way that you refer to it in a transaction.</p>Differences between EOAs and Contract Accounts Human-Readable Aliases <p>Most folks can’t just remember and rattle off the 20 byte long base-58 string that is their <code>Account Address</code>. So, protocols such as ENS allow a human-readable alias to be mapped to any address. The result is that I can invite you to send tips to <code>depatchedmode.eth</code> (🤑) instead of forcing you to test the limits of human memory (and typing skills). Many apps and <code>Wallet Clients</code> support these aliases in both directions: raw addresses will show up as ENS domains when they exist, and pasting ENS domains in various places will resolve to their underlying addresses.</p><p>It is worth underscoring that you can change the address your ENS domain points to, in case you migrate to a new primary account in the future. Because of this, an ENS domain can be a more stable way to identify yourself to other people in much the same way that your phone number remains stable as you move from one home to the next.</p>ENS domains can be pointed at an EOA or Contract Account. What's In Your Account? <p>Nothing. Surprised? This is one of the reasons that many people say a <a href="https://gaby.mirror.xyz/0Wq9zk0pZu_s3W1S4BiNcYXw9uSfSVbyGjNPgLHcs18">"wallet" is a broken metaphor.</a> When you think of a wallet, you imagine a thing that:</p>  Contains Stuff: It’s full of coins, bills and cards that you fold up and slide into your front pocket.  Is Default Private: Nobody can see any of that stuff unless you decide to show them.  <p>The blockchain account you’re managing in your wallet shares neither of those characteristics. A blockchain account:</p>  Contains Nothing: When I say that nothing is in your account, I mean it. No matter what asset you are referring to, whether it be ETH, an ERC-20, or an NFT, the balance that is attributed to your account is stored elsewhere and points to your account. In the case of an EOA this shouldn't be surprising, because the assets are on chain and—as we just illustrated—your account is not. The same is true for contract accounts.  Is Default Public: Anyone can look up your ENS domain or public address to see the entire list of current and past assets associated with that account, as well as all its transactions.  Realize the truth: there is no wallet. Challenges That Accounts Face <blockquote><p>You need each of the following for Safe NFTing:<br>✅A multi-sig archival wallet for things you don't plan to trade. Don't connect this to any service at all.<br>✅Transaction wallet(s) for selling/buying main marketplaces only<br>✅Aping addresses for connecting to random new stuff</p>— 6529 (@punk6529) <a href="https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1495450982079254541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2022</a></blockquote>

  Account Composition: Beyond the wallet being a broken metaphor, Dan Finlay has gone so far as to say recently that even "account" is a <a href="https://twitter.com/danfinlay/status/1526937584781230081?s=20&amp;t=W4eBXr4S6yUNZ-iSyKZAIg">skeuomorphic dead end</a>. And many folks are weighing in on how you might want to compose your set of accounts in order to best protect yourself against loss and theft.  Consent Layer: Because blockchains are permission-less and the assets are pointed at your address from elsewhere, anybody can put anything "in" your account at any time. This leaves the door open for a great deal of harassment, fraud, and general mischief. We need to carefully consider appropriate counter measures. Where and how does a consent layer (aka requesting permission) best fit into a permission-less system?  Multi-chain Address Space: In many instances, the same addresses can exist on multiple chains and networks. In other instances, it’s impossible for an address on one chain to exist on another. This all comes down to the compatibility of encryption methods used. When someone provides just an <code>Account Address</code> how do you know which chain or network they are targeting? This hasn’t been a problem in single chain <code>Wallet Clients</code>, but in a multi-chain world this problem becomes very real. There are technical standards to address this, but still not many user experience best practices.  Nascent Contract Account Support: As I already mentioned, there are a lot of benefits that Contract Accounts can bring, but they are still not widely supported for interacting with apps.   The Recovery Method &amp; Wallet Structure <p>When someone asks "Can I import my wallet?" what they're really asking is "Can I use my recovery method in this wallet client to rebuild the wallet structure that contains all of my accounts?" Bit of a mouthful, I know. Let’s break it down.</p><p>Let’s start with the <code>Recovery Methods</code>. These do exactly what you’d expect: help to recover your accounts or set them up for the first time on a new device. There are a lot of potential ways to design recovery methods, but let’s focus on the two standards-based approaches most commonly supported by <code>Wallet Clients</code> today:</p>  Private Keys: As we saw above, every account has both a private key and a public key. If you have an account's private key, you can always use it to recover the public key and account address. It’s created from a combination of randomness and cryptographic math. Strong arguments can be made that private keys should never be user facing.  Recovery Phrases (aka Seed Phrases/Mnemonic Phrases): These are the 12 or 24 word phrases (defined by <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">BIP-39</a>) that you are encouraged to back up safely &amp; securely. Their original intention was to be a human readable way to produce the randomness required to generate a private key. They are less prone to transcription errors than a base-58 string, easier to speak aloud (see: accessibility), and possibly (though it’s a stretch for most) even memorized.  <p>These recovery methods are incredibly powerful! They help your <code>Wallet Client</code> consistently derive what we’ll call the <code>Wallet Structure</code>: the list of all your accounts and the private keys that control them.</p><p>"Wait—what do you mean ‘derive’? Why don't you just say ‘create’?"</p><p>Because—brace yourself—every possible account in any blockchain address space already exists 🤯. Check out Dmitri Cherniak's <a href="https://deadringers.dmitricherniak.com/">Dead Ringers</a> for a visually sumptuous example of this in action. So, we say derived because your <code>Recovery Phrase</code> is used to discover a specific public/private keypair that controls an account.</p><p>"But wait… how do you avoid two people getting access to the same account?"</p><p>Incomprehensibly large numbers of things. There are so many possible accounts that, even though we’re deriving keypairs for them randomly, the odds of generating the same one twice are infinitesimally small. You have a better chance of hitting the moon by throwing a rock. But a well designed <code>Recovery Method</code> lets you derive the account deterministically.</p><p>"Wait—can you clarify what you mean by ‘deterministically’? Just so I’m sure."</p><p>We say it is deterministic because the same <code>Recovery Method</code> will derive the same keypairs 100% of the time. Almost all <code>Wallet Clients</code> achieve this through the magic of Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (HD wallet)—the most common <code>Wallet Structure</code>.</p><p>"OMG, yet another thing called a wallet!?" Yes.</p>Please, keep saying wallet. All words should be wallet. What Is An HD Wallet? <p>It's a tree of accounts derived from a single root keypair, and originated in the Bitcoin world as <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP-32</a>.</p><p>An HD Wallet is a pretty interesting construct because, using <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">BIP-44</a>, a <code>Wallet Client</code> can walk what's called a derivation path and "discover" all the accounts that have associated on-chain activity—magic! This aspect of an HD wallet's tree of accounts is pretty under-explored. Most wallet clients support just a single account, or a single layer of accounts. But technically you can have children accounts, and grand children accounts, and so on. There’s no limit to the number of levels!</p><p>Now, I’m but a simple designer. There are many reasons to be cautious about how HD Wallets are used, and how many accounts and child accounts you tie to a single recovery method; as they say, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. But, it seems worth investigating them more deeply as a means of addressing at least part of the account composition problem. Not everybody has the same threat model.</p>Child accounts, literally! Challenges That Current Recovery Methods Face   Diverse Threat Models: Even software professionals are not security experts. It’s hard for most people to know exactly how much time and energy they should put into securing their assets—a problem that is not unique to blockchains—and what sort of practices they should routinely engage in to monitor and respond to changing circumstances. This practice is called threat modelling. There’s a lot of room for building tools and practices that help increase awareness and default people into the practices that best fit their current threat model.  Accessibility: Though recovery phrases push accessibility forward a bit, the BIP-39 spec explicitly states "it is strongly discouraged to use non-English wordlists." The vast majority of people on Earth speak no English. So many things in this space carry with them the baggage of the programming languages that support them being English and ASCII prime.  Fragility: You only have to make a mistake with your recovery mechanism once, and then it is compromised—or lost! You may not even realize you’ve compromised or lost your recovery method until it’s too late. It’s hard to strike the right balance between ensuring a Recovery Method is at hand when you need it, but that also secured against theft. <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">Vitalik has written a great introduction to the importance of Social Recovery</a> as an alternative approach moving forward.   Wallet Out <p>So, I hope you've got a clearer model of how the pieces of the Wallet Stack weave together. And the next 10 times you feel the world "wallet" on the tip of your tongue, I hope you momentarily pause to check that your using the most precise term you can.</p><p>I hope that, in the next Coinbase Wallet sprint, someone asks "Alex, can you fix the bug with <code>accounts</code> being derived non-deterministically in the <code>wallet structure</code> when users input their <code>recovery method</code> in the latest version of our <code>wallet client</code>?" It’ll take some practice, but over time it’ll pay dividends for us, our collaborators, and the ecosystem as a whole.</p><p>Is there any single piece of the Wallet Stack that we can simply call a "wallet", though? In Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver and Vitalik Buterin’s latest white paper "<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul</a>", they opt to use wallet as a synonym for account (emphasis mine).</p><blockquote>We begin by explaining the primitives of DeSoc, centered around accounts (or wallets) holding non-transferable (initially public) "soulbound" tokens (SBTs) representing commitments, credentials, and affiliations. Such tokens would be like an extended resume, issued by other wallets that attest to these social relations.</blockquote><p>I’ll save my quibbles with the word "soul" for a separate post, but as goes Vitalik’s steady thought leadership, so goes much of the community. I suspect the wallet/account terminological collapse is where we’re headed. And that is fine, as long as we aim for consistency and clarity—both in our discussions about what to build, and the UI copy our wallet clients expose.</p>The revised Wallet Stack diagram.<p>Great challenges and opportunities lay ahead for the Wallet Stack in a multi-chain world!

It lies at the intersection between <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a> and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as <a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  We've added support for more XSD datatypes (all numeric datatypes and binary strings) (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/139?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#139</a>).  We've added support for AT Protocol’s <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Lexicon schema definition format</a> (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/140?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#140</a>) and added a “map” layout used to represent Lexicon records (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/142?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#142</a>).  We've redesigned the Rust code generator to simplify maintenance and future extensions (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/143?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#143</a>), and added an update to generate code for restricted data types with runtime validation (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/145?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#145</a>). Lastly, we've added a default value property for primitive layouts. This allows the Rust code generator to implement the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Default</a> trait for the associated generated types.   Rebase   The Rebase library is currently undergoing several changes around updates to dependencies, enhancements to Verifiable Credential verifications, quality-of-life fixes, and more. We plan on publishing a newer version alongside the current updates to SSX.    <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web. Spruce provides an ecosystem of open-source tools for developers that let users collect their data in one place they control and show their cards however they want.

<p>There are many benefits to both users and developers regarding local-first web applications. Here we dive into how local-first apps provide a better user experience while increasing resiliency and responsiveness and improving security.</p> Uninterrupted Productivity and Enhanced Reliability <p>One of the key reasons folks choose to build and use local-first applications is their ability to work offline. Users can access and interact with the app with limited or no Internet connectivity. This is great for users in rural areas with poor networks or when there is spotty coverage.</p><p>Offline functionality is made possible through data synchronization and conflict resolution. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> (Webnative File System) uses a cryptographic tree structure (cryptree) that gives every file and folder a unique key. This enables offline access control while keeping the data encrypted and portable. </p> Instant Responsiveness and Faster Performance <p>Local-first apps store and process data locally! That means less waiting around for a server to respond to the user's request. Fetching data locally leads to quicker load times and a more responsive application. It also helps users with limited bandwidth or costly Internet connections by reducing network costs.</p> Enhanced Data Privacy <p>Since the data remains on the user's device, nothing gets transferred to a server. This minimizes the risk of data breaches and opportunities for bad actors to access personal information. Users are happy because it keeps their information private, and developers enjoy not having to become security experts on top of everything else they are already doing. Another bonus - there is no risk of violating GDPR because the developer cannot access the user's info.</p><p>Fission's WNFS offers users public and private file systems. In fact, we were the first to introduce private end-to-end encrypted data to IPFS! Using <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCANs</a> to manage authorization, users have granular access control of all their files. </p> Seamless Collaboration and Data Portability <p>Users want to be able to work together on files. Concurrent editing allows multiple users to access and edit a file at once. A distributed file system like WNFS uses CRDTs to guarantee eventual consistency.</p><p>While centralized collaboration tools lock users into their platform, local-first applications empower users to switch to different devices, platforms, and services as their needs change since they're not tied to a specific infrastructure.</p> <p>Are you building a local-first application? Tell us about it in the comments! </p>

				  The Complexity of Creating Value-Driven Ecosystems 
<p>Creating an ecosystem that delivers value and attracts the right partners in the decentralized landscape is complex. MVEs provide a solution by offering a framework that demonstrates the minimum set of activities and partnerships needed to showcase the potential value creation of an ecosystem.</p>
 Collaborative Nature of Ecosystems 
<p>Unlike apps or platforms, ecosystems are not about having complete control. They thrive on collaboration, defining roles, and establishing a structure where participants can create and share value. MVEs enable organizations to start small, gradually grow, and attract partners who align with their vision.</p>
  The Crucial Role of Ecosystem Governance Frameworks 
<p>Establishing an Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) is crucial to attract and align partners. The EGF defines the ecosystem’s rules, roles, and processes, providing clarity and structure for all participants. Continuum Loop specializes in developing robust EGFs that align governance, business, and technology for seamless ecosystem operations.</p>
 Driving Innovation and Growth Through MVEs and EGFs 
<p>By embracing the MVE concept and implementing an EGF, organizations can create an environment where partners collaborate, contribute their expertise, and share the value generated. This drives innovation, fosters growth, and contributes to the overall success of the ecosystem.</p>
 Join Us on the Journey of Building Vibrant Ecosystems 
<p>At Continuum Loop, we’re committed to helping businesses navigate the complexities of ecosystem development. Our expertise and practical approach empower organizations to harness the power of MVEs and build ecosystems that thrive on collaboration, innovation, and mutual success.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>The level of activity around verifiable credentials has been nothing short of impressive, and as Kai pointed out, it’s noticeably bustling across the globe. The question is no longer if verifiable credentials will become mainstream, but rather when and how.</p>
<p>Particularly in Europe, where Kai and Anti are based, there’s been significant movement sparked by the initiatives of the European Union. Each European nation-state is making significant strides by investing in various projects. The landscape is punctuated by Large Scale Pilots, creating a wave of excitement.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: for those interested, the Large Scale Pilots were discussed in more detail during my <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet/">recent conversation with Viky Manaila</a></p></blockquote>
<p>As we recognize the value of high-integrity government credentials for commercial use cases, we mustn’t overlook a pivotal interaction: that between public and private sectors. High-value credentials from the public sector become invaluable inputs for the private sector, ripe for integration within their data ecosystems.</p>
<p>But what exactly does a commercial data ecosystem look like? What infrastructure is necessary for these commercial data ecosystems to truly flourish? The concept of a digital ecosystem is intriguing and formed part of the inspiration for this conversation (Note: I suggest reading “<a href="https://identifinity.net/wallet-wars-its-the-war-of-ecosystems-1dc9261afaa9">Wallet wars? It’s the war of ecosystems!</a>“, a blog post co-authored by Antti and Kai). In this piece, they nicely outline the dynamics between different players – the public sector, big tech mobile platform giants, and other technology providers – and various scenarios that could emerge in the battle for ecosystem dominance.</p>
<p>So this podcast discussion is centered on what makes commercial data ecosystems viable. Both guests are well-qualified to delve into these topics. I was particularly keen to hear from Kai about how advancements in his work on data spaces at <a href="https://www.mydata.org/">MyData</a> could offer valuable tools for commercial ecosystem participants to manage governance, liability, and more.</p>
<p>I was also eager to explore how we can learn from existing standard organizations serving the private sector, like <a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS1</a>, and how their approaches could be adapted for a digital-first, more decentralized world. Our conversation was certainly stimulating and I believe there’s a need for more discussions like this. I hope you find it as engaging as I did.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick soundbite from the conversation:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Antti, Kai and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
 
 How do concepts of digital trust apply or differ in organizations versus individuals? 
 How is trust achieved differently by organizations in organization-to-organization relationships versus organization-to-people relationships? 
 Are data spaces a new type of role within this digital ecosystem? Can risk or liabilities be shared within these areas? 
 Are there historical examples of organizations serving similar purposes for different ecosystems? 
 Why is liability more important in this digital space, when the issuing authority or the party attesting to the authenticity of a document don’t necessarily take liability if something goes wrong? 
 How is liability managed in this open ecosystem space, particularly when interactions don’t necessitate a legal relationship between parties? 
 How can risk be managed to ensure enough rewards and shared risk that organizations will want to switch over and engage in the new model? 
 Could consumers manage their possible vendors through a similar scenario by owning their own data, as suggested by Doc Searls‘s writings on vendor relationship management (VRM)? (Recommended book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527</a>) 
 Can the introduction of these digital ecosystems allow for earlier development of relationships in the customer acquisition cycle? 
 How can these ecosystems enable trust-based marketing? 
 How can new data ecosystems for commercial use cases be incubated and developed based on government digital identity or credentialing programs? 
 What would be some recommendations for forming governance bodies for data ecosystems and the incentives for organizations to form and deploy services within these ecosystems?

 Launching currencies on Verus, and any other PBaaS-chain (Public Blockchains as a Service), is better, faster, cheaper and more secure than any EVM-like protocol out there. This article explains why, gives an in-depth view of all the options and parameters, and teaches how to launch these currencies. Welcome to Verus, a fundamentally different protocol, and the future of currency launches and value creation.  What are Currencies? <p>Let’s go back to basics first. Currencies, also called tokens on many other cryptocurrency protocols, are a critical part of what makes blockchain useful. They can be used as a means of accounting, can represent property or rights external to the blockchain, and over bridges can be thought of as a means of communication or data transfer between blockchains.</p><p>A real-life example is a project that uses the Verus Protocol to account for energy production, transfer and usage. Other examples can be a token pegged to a fiat currency which is a representation of property external to the blockchain. Or fractionalized tokenization of assets, so many can share in group ownership of something. With all the capabilities Verus has in ways to relate tokens and currencies with VerusIDs (and subIDs), novel use cases arise naturally.</p><p>And what makes Verus currencies so powerful is that there is no coding involved. It is just creating a transaction, and then sending that transaction to the blockchain making the currency a reality. Anyone can do&nbsp;it.</p> Better, Faster, Cheaper and More&nbsp;Secure <p>Why is it smarter to launch currencies on the Verus Protocol? The answer is simple, because all launched currencies are part of the consensus mechanism. On EVM-like and account-based protocols (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche) currencies are not part of consensus and thus easily exploitable by smart contract bugs and malicious developers. With Verus, a UTXO model, all currencies are accounted for, and verified by the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, making it as secure as sending BTC on Bitcoin. To make it simple — all features on the Verus Protocol are on the first layer, the consensus layer.</p><blockquote>Verus fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape</blockquote><p>Also, where other protocols need L2 solutions which are mostly centralized, Verus includes self-sovereign identities, namespaces, privacy, DeFi, bridges, and currency and blockchain launches on the first layer. An innovation that fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape.</p><p>Launching currencies with Verus is also much faster and cheaper than with the alternatives. The magic here is that there is no coding involved. Anyone can launch a currency by just choosing the options and parameters they would like. It is as easy as typing in a command and the currency is ready to be used by the world within minutes. This process does not involve expensive Solidity developers or security audits, saving a lot of development costs.</p><p>Another big advantage is being able to export launched currencies to Ethereum as ERC-20. These currencies can then partake in the Ethereum ecosystem, yet have better security and cheaper DeFi transactions than when they are created on Ethereum itself. Each ERC-20 token can also be bridged to Verus. It’s all super easy thanks to the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge.</p><p>This is not all some fantasy, this is all functional (the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is in testing), right now, on mainnet, on the Verus Protocol. As you now know, Verus is built fundamentally differently than any other protocol out there, and ushers in a new era for brands, communities, businesses, entrepreneurs and organizations to create value in a better and more secure way than ever&nbsp;before.</p><p>The next chapter explains the options to choose from when launching currencies.</p> Options to Launch Currencies <p>For ease of explaining, all PBaaS-chain launch options are omitted. Good to know — with Verus anyone can also launch fully interoperable, independent and customizable blockchains with all the same L1 features as the Verus blockchain. The focus of this article is on launching currencies only, on Verus or any other PBaaS-chain.</p><p>To launch a currency on Verus (and any other PBaaS-chain) a namespace is needed. That namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. MyBrand@). That namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. product.MyBrand@, user.MyBrand@, more on this&nbsp;later).</p><p>On Verus a VerusID registration costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of a currency costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain’s native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). On other PBaaS-chains these costs can differ since the chain launcher can define its own costs for VerusID registrations and currency launches.</p><p>To define a currency, choose options. Then combine these options to whatever the currency needs to be. Just add the numbers together in the currency definition. The currency options are listed&nbsp;below.</p>  options:1 — The currency has reserves, and can be converted to and from the reserves (option 32 needs to be added). Can have one currency as its reserves, or multiple with up to 10 currencies. Let’s call it a “Basket currency” — a currency with a basket of reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized.  options:2 — Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create&nbsp;subIDs.  options:8 — Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID creation.  options:16 — Referrals are required for subID creation.  options:32 — The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. This option is also used for <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Ethereum ERC-20 mapped&nbsp;tokens</a>.  options:2048 — A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created &amp; has tokenized control of the root VerusID. Which means you can send the single satoshi token to other addresses and then they have control of the root&nbsp;VerusID.  <p>Let’s give some examples of combined&nbsp;options:</p>  "options":33 — this launches a basket currency. It is options 1 + 32 combined.  "options":2080 — this launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID. It is options 32 + 2048 combined.  "options":35 — this launches a basket currency, and only the rootID can create subIDs. It is options 1 + 2 + 32 combined.  <p>And so on. More information on basket currencies, simple token currencies and subIDs in the next&nbsp;chapter.</p> Two Types of Currencies <p>There are two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol. Basket currencies and simple token currencies. Both can be issued decentralized, or centralized (has minting and burning capabilities.)</p> Basket Currencies A simple example of a basket currency containing two reserve currencies.<p>Basket currencies are magical currencies that have reserves. Have a look at the simplified image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency, or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 reserve currencies.</p><p>The basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply&nbsp;burned).</p><p>A basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between. This is called the reserve ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is in the reserves and what the reserve ratio&nbsp;is.</p><p>When a centralized version of this currency is created, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, while automatically lowering the reserve ratio. Or they can burn currencies and automatically raise the reserve ratio. Anyone can also just burn the currency at will without raising the reserve&nbsp;ratio.</p><p>The conversion fees are incredibly low, 0.025% when converting to and from a basket currency, and 0.05% when converting from reserve to reserve currency. These fees go directly to the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, and/or they are accrued into the reserves making the basket currency worth&nbsp;more.</p><p>Because all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price, the protocol is MEV-free. The protocol doesn’t have any of the problems EVM-like account-based systems have. Verus DeFi is fair, cheap and has no rent-seekers.</p><p>Every(!) currency on the Verus network (also mapped ERC-20s!), can be used as reserves for basket currencies. As you might start to understand now — basket currencies are unique currencies that can not be found anywhere else and offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation. And anyone can launch them without needing any programming knowledge!</p> Simple Token Currencies <p>Simple token currencies are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanism, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/unleash-the-power-of-verus-technological-showcase-of-centrally-issued-token-fully-backed-by-gold-dcc9fae7ca0f">A small example of a centralized currency&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>The supply of this type of currency is static when it’s a decentralized version. When it’s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn&nbsp;them.</p><p>This option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">You can read more about it&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>And of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.</p> What are&nbsp;SubIDs <p>SubIDs are powerful objects on the blockchain. They can be registered in an unlimited amount under any created currency (basket and simple token currency). A few examples are product.MyBrand@ or user.MyBrand@. The name MyBrand@ is a VerusID (a namespace) that is converted into a currency. The subIDs are ‘product’ and&nbsp;‘user’.</p><p>SubIDs can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to people and products. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the subID&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Another powerful feature is that it has read, write and delete functions in what is called the “content multimap”. All kinds of information can be read and processed in the mempool of the blockchain.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there, it’s also a friendly name blockchain address that can receive, send, hold and stake funds, and can be used to login to services, password-free. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Read more about VerusID&nbsp;here.</a></p> Parameters to Launch Currencies This is all anyone needs to do to launch powerful currencies. Zero&nbsp;coding!<p>Next up are the parameters. Choose the parameters wisely to launch a currency that suits any need. Not all parameters are needed or combinable. There are many to go through, so let’s&nbsp;start.</p> “proofprotocol” <p>This parameter defines, among others, if the currency is centralized or decentralized. You can choose 1,2 or&nbsp;3.</p><p>1 is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are&nbsp;burned.</p><p>2 is for a centralized currency. If it’s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it’s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>3 is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBrand", <br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}' <p>🔍 A simple token currency called MyBrand, centralized (the controller of the rootID can mint and burn), and has a preallocation of 100 tokens to&nbsp;Klaus@.</p> “currencies” <p>Here you put the names of the currencies (or just one — it must have VRSC when launched on Verus) that will be in the reserves when it’s a basket currency (options:33).</p><p>Or when it’s a simple token currency (options:32), what people convert during the preconversion timeframe will go to the rootID of the currency, as a funding mechanism. In the case of a simple token currency, combine it with "conversions" to determine the preconversion price.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CommunityX", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","MyBrand"], <br>  "minpreconversion":[10,50],<br>  "initialsupply":100<br>}' <p>🔍 A basket currency called CommunityX. It needs to get a minimum of 10 VRSCTEST and 50 MyBrand into its reserves within the preconversion time frame to be launched. The initial supply of 100 CommunityX will be distributed among the preconverters.</p> “conversions” <p>Use this parameter when launching a simple token currency. Together with "currencies", it can be used as a funding mechanism for the rootID. It’s for the preconversion price. So when doing "conversions":[0.1], it means that for every VRSC the preconverter receives 10 CURRENCY after launch. The converted VRSC goes into the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>People can preconvert to this currency within the preconversion time frame. Define a "startblock", or let the default and minimum time frame play out, which is 20&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CoolBrand",<br>  "options":32,<br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"],<br>  "conversions":[0.1],<br>  "minpreconversion":[1000]<br>}' <p>🔍 This simple token currency is called CoolBrand. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 1000 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 10.000 CoolBrand. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds&nbsp;back.</p> “minpreconversion” <p>Use this parameter to set a minimum amount of preconversions. The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.</p><p>There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CompanyX",<br>  "options":32,<br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"],<br>  "conversions":[2],<br>  "minpreconversion":[500]<br>}' <p>🔍 This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds&nbsp;back.</p> “maxpreconversions” <p>Use this parameter to set a maximum amount of preconversions. During the preconversion time frame the amount set can not be exceeded. Everything above this amount will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CoinCommunity", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "maxpreconversion":[100], <br>  "initialsupply":100<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called CoinCommunity. During the preconversion time frame people can convert VRSCTEST into its reserves for 100 CoinCommunity in return. During the preconversion time frame there can not be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves. Whatever is preconverted more will be returned.</p> “initialcontributions” <p>The rootID can contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. Use this parameter to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it’s a basket currency (options:33), or to the rootID when it’s a simple token currency (options:32).</p><p>The funds to initially contribute need to be in the rootID when defining the currency. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency launched, the rootID has received an amount of the launched currency.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CommunityBasket", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","CoinCommunity"], <br>  "initialcontributions":[10,200], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Jane@":100},{"John@":50}]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called CommunityBasket. The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. At the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network, there needed to be 210 VRSCTEST and 200 CoinCommunity in the rootID. The initial supply of 100 went to the rootID (if there weren’t any more preconverters). At the same time of the launch, 100 CoinCommunity was minted into Jane@ and 50 into John@, this lowered the reserve ratio of the currency.</p> “initialsupply” <p>A required parameter for basket currencies (options:33). Does not work with simple token currencies. This is the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial&nbsp;supply.</p><p>Immediately after the currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to "preallocations".</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"SocialBrand", <br>  "options":33, "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":500, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Max@":1000}]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called SocialBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and in return they get 500 SocialBrand distributed among them. Immediately after launch Max@ receives 1000 SocialBrand, lowering the reserve ratio of the currency.</p> “preallocations” <p>Use this parameter to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. Funds can be directed to VerusIDs and R-addresses. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.</p><p>When using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered. This is because new currency has been minted after the initial supply ("initialsupply") is distributed.</p> “prelaunchcarveout” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>After the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, a percentage of the reserves is taken and redirected to the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"BusinessBrand", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "prelaunchcarveout":0.1<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called BusinessBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 BusinessBrand distributed among them. When the currency is launched, 10% VRSCTEST is taken out of the reserves, into the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio by&nbsp;10%.</p> “prelaunchdiscount” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to give people a discount during the preconversion time frame. After the preconversion time frame and the currency is launched, the conversion price will be higher, depending on what percentage the discount&nbsp;was.</p><p>When using this parameter, after the currency is launched, the reserve ratio will be lowered by the discounted percentage.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"DiscountBrand", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "prelaunchdiscount":0.5<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called DiscountBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 DiscountBrand distributed among them. Immediately after the launch of the currency, when people want to convert, the price is 50% higher. Also, the reserve ratio is 50% lower because of the prelaunchdiscount.</p> “weights” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to change the respective weights of the reserves in a basket currency. The total of all weights must equal 1. With a minimum of 0.1, since there can’t be more than 10 reserve currencies in a basket currency.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBusiness", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","BusinessBrand","DiscountBrand"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "weights":[0.5,0.25,0.25]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called MyBusiness. During the preconversion time frame there are various currencies that can be converted into its reserves. They have different weights to them. 0.5 for VRSCTEST, 0.25 for both BusinessBrand and DiscountBrand.</p> “startblock” <p>Use this parameter to define the block height when the currency is launched. There is a preconversion time frame before the currency is launched. When omitting this parameter it uses a 20 block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched.</p><p>The preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks, this can not be&nbsp;less.</p> “endblock” <p>Endblock can not be defined on basket currencies.

 KYC: Potential Issues to Consider 
<p>Even though KYC has become a commonly used procedure in many industries, it has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Here as some examples:</p>
 
 The collection of personally identifiable information (PII) for KYC purposes comes with legal responsibilities and storage costs, which can take a toll on companies.&nbsp; 
 Users have a tendency to dislike KYC checks, finding them intrusive and time-consuming. This can lead to lower conversion rates and a negative first impression for potential customers.&nbsp; 
 Implementing KYC can be a difficult and expensive process, further adding to its disadvantages.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Perhaps the time to explore alternative ways of verifying customer identities has come. With SelfKey iD, you can explore methods that are less tedious for all parties involved.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD

However, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Ai-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> method along with SelfKey iD can potentially become a better alternative to KYC.</p>
<p>Here are some of SelfKey.iD’s benefits:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The overall process is easier and less costly, making it more accessible for users.&nbsp; 
 The onboarding process is quick. 
 Ongoing monitoring makes sure that customer data remains accurate. 
 Existing KYC checks are reused, thus the need to collect and store PII repeatedly is no longer an issue. 
 Costs for companies are reduced, but also improves customer privacy and security. 
 It provides powerful compliance tools, ensuring that companies remain in compliance with regulations and laws.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can streamline their KYC processes, reducing costs, enhancing customer privacy, and improving compliance. Ultimately, this results in a better experience for customers and a more efficient and secure system for companies.</p>
<p>Below, we will discuss some of SelfKey iDs benefits more in depth.</p>
 High-Level Flow 
<p>SelfKey iD enables zero-knowledge interactions between individuals, making sure that users' data is kept private and secure. With SelfKey iD, the user's data does not reach your server. This adds to user privacy and prevents potential data breaches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the onboarding process is quick and simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user with a SelfKey iD visits your server, they are checked to determine if they match your filter. If they do, they can be onboarded instantly, simplifying the process and reducing the time and resources required.</p>
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can provide a secure and efficient onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security. The zero-knowledge interactions and instant onboarding features make it a better alternative to traditional KYC processes.</p>
 Quick Relying Party Onboarding 
<p>To streamline the onboarding process, the following steps are required:</p>
 
 Sign up at SelfKey iD to create your user filters. 
 Add these filters to your smart contracts. 
 When a user attempts to run your smart contract function, the system will check if they have a SelfKey iD NFT. If they do not have one, they will be prompted to get one. 
 If the issuer has a SelfKey iD NFT, they will then be able to verify whether the user matches the filter that you have set for the transaction. If they do, the user will be granted access to your server. If not, the user will be denied access. 
 
<p>Following these steps, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system ensures that only authorized users are given access to the company's services. This reduces the risk of relying parties allowing access to unauthorized individuals to their services.</p>
 The Issuance: SelfKey iD NFT User Flow 
<p>The issuance process for SelfKey iD is outlined below:</p>
 
 The user visits your project and is redirected to SelfKey iD, in case they do not already have one. 
 The user pays for the verification check. 
 The user goes through the verification process, and the issuer stores their data. Ongoing monitoring of the account begins. 
 If the user passes the checks, the issuer releases a credential that verifies the user's humanity, uniqueness in the database, and verified data. 
 The user then mints their own SelfKey iD NFT. 
 
<p>By following these steps, users can obtain a SelfKey iD NFT that verifies their identity and potentially provides access to various projects that use the SelfKey iD platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verification process may grant access only to authorized users, providing enhanced security and privacy for both users and companies.</p>
<p>Enhanced security offers several benefits such as:</p>
 
 Anti-bot security. This measure prevents automated attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious or malicious bot traffic. 
 Fraud protection. Malicious individuals often use bots for fraudulent activities like creating fake accounts or generating false clicks to generate revenue. Implementing anti-bot security measures helps to identify and prevent such fraudulent activities, keeping the business and customers safe. 
 Improved user experience. Bots can significantly hinder the user experience by slowing down websites or making it difficult for users to access information. Anti-bot security measures ensure that legitimate users can access the website or service without interruptions or delays. 
 
 The Verification: SelfKey iD User Onboarding 
<p>The onboarding process for SelfKey.iD is as follows:</p>
 
 A user with a SelfKey iD visits your project. 
 You request that the SelfKey iD issuer checks the user's information. 
 The issuer verifies whether the user's data matches your filters. 
 The issuer sends a signed message confirming the user's status.&nbsp; 
 If the user is verified, they can be onboarded, and the signed message can be used to authorize transactions. 
 The relying party (issuer) is billed for the verification check. 
 
<p>Through this process, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding method that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system may allow access to the company's services only to authorized users. The use of a signed message adds an extra layer of security, offering further assurance that the user's data has been verified by the relying party.</p>
 Reusable KYC and SelfKey iD 
<p>The benefits of using reusable KYC with SelfKey iD are as follows:</p>
 
 Your project subscribes to SelfKey iD. 
 Your project can be featured on the SelfKey iD website. 
 A user with a SelfKey iD NFT visits the SelfKey iD website. 
 The user scrolls through the list of projects that support SelfKey iD. 
 The user can potentially choose your project from the list. 
 The user quickly onboards to your project using their existing SelfKey iD NFT. 
 Your project profits from the seamless onboarding experience. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's reusable KYC system could provide companies with a more streamlined onboarding experience for users. Users can easily access multiple projects without having to go through the time-consuming and costly process of verifying their identity each time.</p>
<p>Additionally, companies benefit from increased user adoption and loyalty, as the reusable KYC system encourages users to choose projects that support SelfKey iD. Overall, this system offers a win-win situation for both companies and users alike.</p>

 How the Profile Builder Functions: 
<p>SelfKey iD's Profile Builder is a tool that allows you to create customizable filters for your project. You may use these filters to sort and manage users based on specific criteria.</p>
<p>The Profile Builder allows you to create multiple filters, which you can implement separately on your project. This means that you can have different filters applied to different sections of your app or website, depending on your specific needs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 You could create a filter that accepts citizens of Country A for one section of your app, but another filter for the same project that excludes citizens of Country A from another section.&nbsp; 
 This level of detailed filtering allows you to match regulatory requirements while also boosting the benefits of your app. 
 
<p>To set up the Profile Builder, you would first define the standards you want to filter by, such as citizenship, age, or profession. You can then apply rules and conditions to each filter to create a customized sorting system.</p>
<p>For the most part, the Profile Builder in SelfKey iD could provide a flexible and powerful tool for managing user data and creating a tailored experience for your app's users.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>SelfKey aims to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the needs of both businesses and users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of SelfKey iD could include efficient, secure, and cost-effective KYC checks, streamlined onboarding, and better conversion rates. Additionally, SelfKey iD's approach to privacy ensures legal compliance and reduces costs associated with PII storage.&nbsp;</p>

 How does SelfKey iD work? 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD is a smooth and hassle-free process that prioritizes user convenience without compromising security and privacy. The streamlined procedure may ensure that users have access to a secure and private digital identity that they can trust.</p>
 The process&nbsp; 
<p>By following the simple steps outlined by the platform, users can obtain a SelfKey iD quickly and with ease. The steps are as follows:</p>
 
  Users must first log in with their wallet and pay an entry fee.&nbsp; 
  The next step would be to undergo a KYC verification process. This method is designed to ensure that the user's identity is authentic and that they meet the necessary eligibility criteria.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The verification process typically consists of:&nbsp;</p>
 
 performing a <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">selfie check</a>. 
 providing personal information, such as name and address. 
 providing government-issued identification documents, such as a passport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, users will not be able to create duplicate accounts.</p>
 
  Once the KYC process is complete, legible users are automatically approved. 
  The final step in the process is to mint the soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT. This unique digital asset is generated using blockchain technology and is securely bound to the user's digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It might serve as proof of identity and it may be used to authenticate the user's identity in a variety of settings, such as:</p>
 
 online marketplaces. 
 financial institutions. 
 other digital platforms, such as social media and videogames. 
 
<p>Even more, as the concept of the metaverse gains popularity, the need for secure and reliable digital identities becomes increasingly important. SelfKey iD emphasizes privacy and self-sovereignty. Therefore, it may be the perfect identity credential for the exciting products and services of the future.</p>
 Minting soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT 
 Aggregating Multiple Credentials 
<p>By combining different SBT (soul-bound tokens) and identity credentials, SelfKey iD may provide a higher level of verification for the user's identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials which may be aggregated by a SelfKey iD include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Metaproof. 
 KYC credentials issued by SelfKey Network issuers. 
 Traditional accounts, such as: Google, Apple, Discord, Github, Twitter, and the likes. 
 Various identity tokens, such as Binance’s BAB token issued in 2022. 
 
<p>This implementation may have significant advantages over individual credentials, as it may increase the reliability and accuracy of identity verification. And, an increase in reliability and accuracy is crucial for online interactions and services that require trust between parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more credentials added to the SelfKey iD container, the more trust may be established, and the more reliable and secure the user's digital identity may become.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the integration of multiple SBTs and identity credentials within a SelfKey iD container might provide users with unparalleled flexibility. This may enable them to add as many credentials as they require to establish their identity in a variety of contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may enhance the SelfKey platform's versatility and utility. It might make it more appealing to individuals and institutions seeking a reliable and secure digital identity solution.</p>
<p>Essentially, SelfKey's implementation of an aggregated credential system in its platform may be a significant step forward in the development of a strong and reliable self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Traditional domain names have been in use for decades and are widely recognized. However, they come with certain limitations due to their centralized nature. Organizations that registered these domains are usually the ones who own them, which means that individuals have no control over them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized alternative to traditional domain names that offers additional functionalities. It represents a significant change in the way we think about and use domain names on the internet. ENS provides users with more control over their domain names, making it a powerful tool for individuals and businesses alike.</p>
<p>Given these options, SelfKey aims to provide subdomains with self-sovereign identity in mind. With SelfKey's ENS subdomains, individuals may enjoy all the benefits of owning a regular ENS domain on the Ethereum Mainnet without the recurring additional costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By offering greater control and flexibility, SelfKey’s ENS subdomains may enable users to better manage their digital identities and online presence. And this may make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to build a presence on the internet.</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the benefits of ENS (Ethereum Name Service) over DNS (Domain Name System), as well as the advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomains.&nbsp;</p>
 Highlights 
 
 The Basics of DNS 
 ENS Unpacked: A Quick Overview 
 The Benefits of ENS compared to DNS 
 The Benefits of SelfKey ENS Subdomains 
 Conclusions 
 
 The Basics of DNS 
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS</a> (Domain Name System) is a traditional system that facilitates the translation of human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, into IP addresses. Every device connected to the internet has an IP address, which represents a unique numerical identifier.</p>
<p>This process is necessary because while people can easily remember and recognize domain names, computers and other devices require IP addresses to communicate with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS is an essential part of the internet infrastructure and is utilized in a variety of applications, including website hosting, email communication, online gaming, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without DNS, users would have to memorize the IP addresses of every website they wish to visit, which would be highly impractical and inconvenient.</p>
 ENS Unpacked: A Quick Overview 
 A brief description 
<p><a href="https://thedefiant.io/what-is-ens">ENS</a> (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register human-readable domain names, similar to how traditional DNS works, but with added features and benefits.</p>
<p>With ENS, users can register domain names in the form of "name.eth" instead of the traditional "www.example.com" format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting that these domain names are unique, one can use them to identify various Ethereum-based resources, such as wallets, contracts, and decentralized applications.</p>
 ENS and individuals 
<p>One of the main advantages of ENS is that it is decentralized. This means that no single entity or authority owns or controls it.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Even more, resistance to censorship is boosted and individuals are allowed to have more control over their online identities and assets by being decentralized.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it is interoperable, meaning it can be used across different applications and services on the Ethereum blockchain. This could help create a more seamless and integrated user experience.</p>
 The Benefits of ENS compared to DNS 
<p>Both ENS and DNS are used for assigning user-friendly names to machine-readable addresses on the internet. However, there are several key differences between them, namely:</p>
 
 Centralization 
 Ownership 
 Security 
 Functionality 
 
<p>Below, we will discuss these important aspects more in depth.</p>
 Centralization 
<p>The traditional DNS system is centralized, with domain names being registered and managed by a single authority, ICANN. On the other hand, ENS is a decentralized system that operates on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>As a decentralized system, ENS is not controlled by a single entity, which gives individuals the freedom to manage their very own domain. This liberty allows users to express themselves and utilize their domains to their personal needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ENS users may stand out more if they are not attached to a centralized giant. And this, in turn, may give them the opportunity to attract and engage with other individuals. All in all, having the freedom to manage their own domain in the online world comes with a large number of chances for users to show off their services or skills.</p>
 Ownership 
<p>Ownership is another key difference between ENS and traditional DNS. With traditional DNS, the organization that register domain names typically own them. ENS allows individuals to own their domain names directly, without intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that individuals can have complete control over their domain names, which can be particularly useful for businesses and individuals who value their online presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owning an ENS domain that matches their business or brand name may help individuals build brand recognition and increase trust among customers.</p>
 Security 
<p>Security is another major advantage of ENS over traditional DNS. Most centralized systems have weak security, which often leads to data breaches. Those whose data was compromised might suffer dire consequences as a result of this.&nbsp;Being a centralized system, DNS might be quite risky in this sense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ENS's decentralized architecture makes it highly effective in preventing security threats. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the same cryptographic standards as Ethereum, providing an additional layer of protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature makes it very difficult for bad players to compromise the system or steal user data. It may also make the systems more resilient to hacking or domain hijacking. As a result, ENS offers a much higher level of security.</p>
 Functionality 
<p>ENS provides unique functionality compared to traditional DNS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such feature is the ability to link multiple addresses, including cryptocurrency wallets, to a single domain name. This capability makes identity management more simple for users and it enables seamless interaction with decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it allows users to build their online identity and streamline their transactions. On the opposite side, traditional DNS only offers basic domain name resolution. This added functionality is another reason why ENS is becoming a more and more popular choice for those seeking a more flexible and user-friendly domain name resolution system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, ENS and traditional DNS serve the same purpose, but they differ significantly in terms of centralization, ownership, security, and functionality. And all of these aspects are highly important to take into account as society becomes more digitized.</p>
<p>With these possibilities in mind, SelfKey is aiming to create a subdomain that offers the same benefits as the current ENS, along with additional features that may enhance accessibility for individuals.</p>
 SelfKey ENS subdomain: Definition and Benefits 
<p>When developing new technologies, SelfKey prioritizes the concept of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity (SSID)</a>, and the SelfKey ENS subdomain is a prime example of this approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the creation of a subdomain, SelfKey is aiming to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. This technology is centered on empowering users and it may provide them with greater control over their personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey’s goal is to bring a positive change to the way people operate in the digital world. To make it more secure and accessible for everyone.</p>
 What is SelfKey ENS subdomain 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is an innovative subdomain that aims to provide a more accessible and user-friendly domain name resolution system. Given this, users might not have to pay recurring fees for their subdomain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is likely to be a subdomain of key.eth. This means that users may register their preferred subdomain by adding their name or any other word of their choosing, such as yourname.key.eth. This naming convention is similar to email addresses. And, by providing an easier way to identify and interact with Ethereum addresses, it may bring self-sovereign identity closer to mass adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as DNS made the internet more accessible to the masses by providing a simpler way to access websites than using IP addresses, key.eth may do the same for Ethereum addresses. It replaces long, complex addresses with a human-readable format that is easy to remember and share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may improve the ease of use of the blockchain and help resolve one of the challenges to widespread adoption. Because of this, key.eth may be a step towards a more user-friendly and accessible blockchain ecosystem.</p>
 What are the benefits of SelfKey ENS 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is designed to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. By putting user accesibility first, SelfKey is aiming to create a more inclusive domain name resolution system that builds on the strengths of ENS while adding to its advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This innovative approach might make SelfKey ENS subdomain a compelling choice for anyone who values privacy and security, and wants a more user-friendly way to manage their digital identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain provides several benefits to its users:</p>
 
 One of the primary advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that every verified SelfKey iD holder may receive a free key.eth subdomain on the Ethereum Mainnet that is longer than seven characters. This free subdomain may allow users to experiment with SelfKey ENS subdomain and explore its features without having to make extra financial commitment. 
 Once users have their free subdomain, they may buy more subdomains using any of the supported tokens. Users may utilize these subdomains for various purposes, such as getting payments or creating aliases for use in games. Users may buy as many subdomains as they like and use them to streamline their online activities. 
 Another significant benefit of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that users may sell their subdomains.&nbsp; Any marketplace that supports ENS trading, such as OpenSea, is a good place to start. This feature may offer users the freedom to experiment with different subdomains. And, if they decide to change their online identity or activities, they may sell them. 
 
<p>Overall, SelfKey ENS subdomain may provide great benefits to its users. It may enable individuals to not only manage and own their domains, but also boost their visibility online. These features might make SelfKey ENS an ideal choice for anyone looking to enhance their online identity and activities.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that people have become increasingly aware of the importance of privacy and ownership of personal data. However, the traditional centralized systems we rely on for managing our digital assets and domains may compromise these rights. This is where the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) comes in as part of an ideal decentralized future.</p>
<p>ENS allows individuals to own and manage their own domain names on the Ethereum blockchain, which is decentralized and secure. This means that no central authority has control over the domain name. A feature which gives individuals complete ownership and control over their online identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS may be one such solution that offers individuals the opportunity to manage and own their own domain names without the limitations of traditional domain names. This may not only give users more control over their online presence but also provide greater privacy and security.</p>
<p>As technology continues to advance, it is important for individuals to stay informed about potential decentralized solutions that can benefit their privacy, security, and self-sovereign rights. By staying in touch with SelfKey, users can learn about upcoming solutions and take advantage of the benefits that a decentralized future can offer.</p>

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>Have you ever seriously considered the negative impacts of a data breach? Are you aware of the digital safety risks that lurk around the corners of the internet? And, did you know that cyberattacks may produce life-long consequences?</p>
<p>Nowadays, applications and websites have become so common that we consider them an integral part of our daily lives. And, because we have normalized it, individuals blindly share their private information with little thought given to the implications of doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We rarely ever stop to consider what happens to our personal data once we share it with large technology corporations. And that’s because we live with the illusion that our valuable or sensitive private information is safe. That cyber attacks cannot possibly reach us.</p>
<p>However, some serious privacy violations have occurred in the past several months. And they have exposed the severe effects of sharing personal information without proper caution to safety and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite data breaches occurring on a daily basis, they aren’t discussed as often as they should be. Individuals who have not experienced such incidents may assume that they are immune to them. But anyone can fall victim at any time, and the consequences of a data breach can be irreversibly harmful.</p>
<p>In this article, SelfKey aims to provide an in-depth analysis of data breaches, recent events, and the potential aftermath for individuals whose personal information is compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly important to spread awareness about the possible consequences of data breaches. To attempt to prevent them from happening at all. With SelfKey’s decentralized solutions, a safer digital future may await us.</p>
<p>Let us elaborate on these crucial aspects in the paragraphs below.</p>

 Defining data breaches: Meaning and Overview 
 A brief, but fundamental introduction 
<p>Data breaches are serious security violations where confidential, protected or sensitive data is accessed, stolen or used by an unauthorized person or organization. These devastating incidents are also known as data spills, data leaks, or information disclosures, and they can occur in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>These digital attacks are typically well organized and initiated by malicious players, including organized crime, political activists, and national governments. However, even individuals who accidentally gain unauthorized access to systems with poor security configurations can cause data breaches.</p>
<p>The information that hackers may disclose can range from matters that may compromise national security to information that government officials want to keep hidden. When a person who has access to such information deliberately exposes it, for political reasons, it is usually referred to as a "leak".</p>
 The negative effects of a cyber attack: What happens after? 
<p>Data breaches can have far-reaching consequences, impacting a variety of information types including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 financial data, such as credit card information and bank details. 
 personally identifiable information (PII), such as full name, full address, IDs, birth certificate information, etc. 
 personal health information (PHI), such as full name, home address, or dates related to the health or identity of individuals. 
 trade secrets, and intellectual property.&nbsp; 
 sensitive or valuable information, like photos or videos. 
 
<p>Unstructured data, such as files, documents, and private information, can also become exposed and vulnerable if proper security measures are not in place to protect them.</p>
<p>These cyberattacks aren’t limited to organizations or powerful institutions, though. Anyone could be a victim. And, worst of all, the compromise or theft of the information listed above can lead to anything from:</p>
 
 financial losses 
 identity theft 
 reputational damage 
 legal repercussions 
 
<p>It's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect their sensitive information and implement strong security measures to prevent data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey understands the devastating consequences of data breaches and emphasizes the significance of implementing preventive measures. Responding promptly and adequately in case of such incidents is also highly important.&nbsp;</p>
 Recent Data Breaches: The beginning of 2023 
<p>The frequency of data breaches has increased in recent years. Alarmingly, the past several months have seen a handful of significant incidents.&nbsp;</p>
 
 One such example is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches">TikTok’s illegal processing of data</a> belonging to 1.4 million children under 13, who were using its platform without parental consent. This breach highlights the importance of proper data management practices, particularly when dealing with children's information. 
 Another example is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kfc-pizza-hut-owner-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/">the cyberattack on Yum! Brands</a>, where attackers stole personal information belonging to some individuals, including names, driver's license numbers, and other ID card numbers. This kind of data is particularly sensitive and can be used to commit identity theft, among other crimes. 
 Finally, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kodi-discloses-data-breach-after-forum-database-for-sale-online/">the hacking of The Kodi Foundation</a> resulted in the exposure of personal information and private conversations of over 400,000 users. Such incidents can have long-term consequences for the affected individuals, including reputational damage and financial losses. These breaches emphasize the need for better cybersecurity measures and data protection practices across industries. 
 
 Factors contributing to data breaches: Why, Who, and for What? 
<p>Cyberattacks have become a prevalent threat to our digital lives, and they occur on both personal and larger scales. While most people may assume that only organizations with weak security measures are at risk, individuals are also susceptible to data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, personal cyberattacks often happen due to a lack of caution when it comes to protecting oneself online.</p>
 Why do data breaches occur? 
<p>One of the most common ways individuals make themselves vulnerable to cyberattacks is by using weak or predictable passwords. This makes it easy for hackers to access their accounts and steal sensitive information. Additionally, using the same password on multiple accounts makes it even easier for hackers to gain access to a person's entire online presence.</p>
<p>Lack of proper security measures is another way individuals put themselves at risk. Failing to have anti-malware protection on their devices can allow malware to infiltrate and infect their system. Similarly, exposing personal information publicly online, such as on social media, can provide hackers with the necessary information to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Clicking on or accessing suspicious links is another way individuals can become victims of cyberattacks. It is worth mentioning that bad players often use phishing emails to trick people into giving up sensitive information. These emails can appear legitimate, so it's important to be cautious and verify the source before clicking on any links or providing personal information.</p>
 Who is responsible for data breaches? 
<p>Anyone could carry out a cyberattack, if they have the necessary tools, and if that is their intention.</p>
<p>Data breaches are a serious concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. These breaches are often the result of bad players with malicious intent. Perpetrators can range from organized crime groups seeking financial gain to political activists looking to disrupt or expose sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some instances, national governments have conducted data breaches for espionage or other motives. Regardless of the motive, it's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect themselves from potential breaches and to respond quickly and effectively if one occurs.</p>
 What are the intentions of those who initiate cyberattacks? 
<p>Malicious individuals typically have two main intentions: financial gain or causing damage to institutions for various reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of these goals, they may carry out data breaches that can have serious consequences for their victims. These attacks can result in the exposure of personal information and sensitive data, which can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, larger feuds between hackers and their targets can result in victims becoming collateral damage and suffering the consequences of attacks that were not specifically directed at them.</p>
 Caught Off Guard: When and Where Data Breaches Strike 
<p>Data breaches can happen every second and anywhere, from major technology companies to large financial institutions, and even in our own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public places such as cafes or airports, which offer public Wi-Fi, can also provide opportunities for hackers to access personal data.</p>
<p>Recently, incidents involving Yum!Brands and TikTok have highlighted the vulnerability of powerful institutions to cyber attacks. However, individuals are also at risk in their personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any given moment, scam messages spread by viruses or hackers can target friends and family members. Weak personal security measures, such as predictable passwords and email addresses, can leave individuals vulnerable to attacks. As a result, the malware can spread to the victim’s circle of friends, family, or acquaintances via personal messages or emails.</p>
<p>One common method used by attackers is phishing emails. They appear to be legitimate messages from a trusted source but actually contain malicious links or attachments. Clicking on these links can result in the installation of malware on a device, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
 Victims of data breaches: Are you safe? 
 Who do bad players target? 
<p>The victims of data breaches can be anyone whose personal data was involved, regardless of age, gender, occupation, or level of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes children, women, men, students, teachers, and employees who trust their employers with their personal information. It also includes clients, customers, and patients who share their data with businesses and healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that anyone who uses the internet is at risk of being affected by a data breach, regardless of how small or popular they are. Constantly searching for vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them, bad actors can breach even the most seemingly secure systems.</p>
<p>That's why it's essential to take the right security measures, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and being cautious when sharing personal information online. By being proactive about data security, individuals and organizations can help protect themselves and minimize the potential impact of a breach.</p>
 How can Data Breaches affect you?&nbsp; 
<p>Individuals can be affected by data breaches in two different ways:</p>
 
 At a large scale, when a centralized system is hacked, which can affect millions of people.&nbsp; 
 On a personal level, when an individual's personal online accounts are hacked. In this case, the breach may only affect one person, but it can still have severe consequences, such as financial loss or identity theft.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In both cases, it's crucial to take steps to protect yourself and your personal information. SelfKey advises using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly monitoring your financial accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
 Large Scale: Attacking Businesses 
<p>Large-scale data breaches can have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the immediate victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While companies, institutions, and organizations are often the primary targets of such attacks, individuals can also suffer the consequences on a personal level. Even if the attack was not personally directed at them, they could still become collateral damage if the company they have trusted their PII with falls victim to a data breach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of this kind of data breach can be severe and long-lasting, for instance:</p>
 
 Companies can face financial losses, damage to their reputation, and even legal action. 
 Institutions may lose the trust of their stakeholders and customers, leading to a decline in business.&nbsp; 
 Organizations may find it difficult to attract and retain talent if they cannot demonstrate that they take data security seriously. 
 
<p>Furthermore, large-scale data breaches can lead to a loss of trust in the digital economy. If people cannot trust that their personal information is secure, they may be less likely to use online services and conduct transactions digitally. This could lead to a decline in e-commerce and other digital industries, negatively impacting the overall economy.</p>
<p>All in all, the consequences of large-scale data breaches are not limited to the immediate victims. Companies, institutions, organizations, and individuals can all suffer the effects of these attacks.</p>
<p>Below, we will examine some of these negative impacts more thoroughly.</p>
 Temporary Shut Down 
<p>Data breaches can have a significant impact on companies, not only in terms of the immediate costs but also in terms of long-term consequences. When a company experiences a data breach, it may be forced to halt its activity temporarily, which can result in millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<p>According to industry surveys, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">Gartner</a> concludes that the cost of operational downtime can be around $5,600 per minute, which translates to $300,000 per hour. This can add up quickly, especially if the breach is not resolved promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the financial costs, a data breach can also damage a company's reputation and erode the trust of its customers, leading to long-term consequences.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cyberattack-forced-a-logistics-company-to-temporarily-halt-operations-dde27a19">Expeditors International</a> is still dealing with the aftermath of a data breach that occurred in February 2022, which forced it to halt its activity temporarily. The company is likely to experience long-term consequences as a result, including a potential loss of business and damage to its reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial for companies to take proactive steps to prevent data breaches from occurring and to have a solid plan in place for responding to them if they do occur.</p>
 Financial Loss 
<p>Financial losses can arise from two main sources following a cyberattack:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ransomware 
 Legal actions 
 
<p>Ransomware attacks can result in significant financial losses for organizations, as hackers can demand large sums of money in exchange for unlocking access to their encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of ransomware attacks is a cause for concern, with experts predicting that the total cost of ransomware damages worldwide could reach <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/ransomware-payouts/">$265 billion by 2031</a>.</p>
<p>Legal actions can also result in substantial financial losses for organizations. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html">The Equifax data breach</a> in 2017 affected over 145 million people worldwide and has already cost the company more than $700 million in compensation to affected US customers. The breach also affected an estimated 15 million customers in the UK, who have launched their own separate legal action in the high court seeking £100 million in compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal actions can be costly and time-consuming, and the reputational damage caused by a data breach can have long-term consequences for an organization's financial performance.</p>
 Reputational Damage 
<p>Reputational damage is a major concern for companies that experience large-scale data breaches. Such damage can lead to revenue loss and have long-term impacts on the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a company's reputation is tarnished due to a history of data breaches, people are less likely to trust the company with their payment information, and they may choose to take their business elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loss of trust can be difficult to overcome. Therefore, companies must take steps to protect themselves and their customers from data breaches. Additionally, they must try to maintain their reputation and ensure their long-term success.</p>
 Loss of Private Data 
<p>Sensitive data and intellectual property are two key areas that hackers target in a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensitive data can include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Personal information belonging to customers, patients, and employees. 
 Private company emails that contain personal health history, home addresses, and payment information.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When this type of data is breached, it can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage for the company.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is another target of hackers, particularly designs, strategies, and blueprints. When intellectual property is stolen, the competition can take advantage of the leaked information. And this, in turn, may cause long-term damage to the company's competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Businesses within the manufacturing and construction industries are particularly vulnerable to these types of cyber threats. Therefore, many small businesses believe that they are unlikely to be targeted by hackers, but this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, 60% of all hacks target small businesses because they are often easier to attack. It is therefore crucial for businesses of all sizes to take proactive measures to protect their sensitive data and intellectual property from cyber threats.</p>
 Personal Level: Targeting the Individual 
<p>Data breaches at a personal level often occur due to a lack of caution when operating in the digital world and inadequate security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People may accidentally share sensitive information, such as their social security number or credit card details, on unsecured websites. Alternatively, they could fall victim to phishing scams that trick them into revealing their login credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, using weak passwords and not updating software and operating systems can leave personal devices vulnerable to hacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey’s decentralized solutions are centered around the individual’s privacy and security, with a strong emphasis on individuality. It is highly important for individuals to be vigilant when using digital platforms and take appropriate security measures to protect their personal data from cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
 Identify Theft 
<p>Identity theft is a serious crime that can have devastating consequences for its victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When criminals gain access to a victim's personally identifiable information (PII), such as their full name, Social Security number, and birthday, they can wreak havoc on their financial and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims can have their bank accounts emptied, credit histories ruined, and valuable possessions taken away. <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/archives/factsheets/ojpfs_idtheft.html#:~:text=Identity%20theft%20has%20profound%20consequences,crimes%20they%20did%20not%20commit.">In some cases</a>, victims have even been wrongly arrested for crimes they did not commit. This is because the criminal may use the victim's identity to commit cybercrimes or other illegal activities, leaving the victim facing legal action and potentially a criminal record.</p>
 Notable examples of identity theft 
 
 The case of <a href="https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/famous-identity-theft-cases/#nicole-mccabe-identity-theft-and-assassination">Nicole McCabe</a>, an Australian woman suspected of murder after her passport was compromised and her identity stolen.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www2.texasattorneygeneral.gov/identitytheft/real-stories-of-identity-theft">Several victims</a> of identity theft had to struggle with proving they were not responsible for the withdrawal of large amounts of cash from banks, or illegally attempting to obtain loans worth thousands.&nbsp; 
 The terrifying story of <a href="https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294978560">Andorrie Sachs</a>, whose medical identity was stolen by a pregnant woman who gave birth in Sachs' name and left the baby at the hospital, resulting in a $10,000 hospital bill.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Local authorities mistakenly reported Sachs as an unfit mother and threatened to take her children away. This could also have lifelong implications for Sachs as the perpetrator had a different blood type, and uncorrected medical records could result in Sachs' death if she ever needed a blood transfusion. A healthcare provider could even prohibit Sachs from reviewing her own medical records as they might not be in her name.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why SelfKey strongly encourages individuals to take proactive steps to protect their personal information, such as:</p>
 
 Using strong passwords. 
 Regularly checking their credit report. 
 Being cautious when sharing personal information online.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By being vigilant and taking appropriate security measures, individuals can reduce their risk of falling victim to identity theft and the devastating consequences that can follow.</p>
 Personal Health Information 
<p>The theft of personal health information (PHI) is <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">highly valuable on the Dark Web</a>, as it can be worth more than 200 times stolen credit card information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of identity theft can have serious consequences, including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 Obtaining illegal medical treatments or prescription drugs. 
 Altering the victim’s medical history. 
 Using up the victim’s medical benefits.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Hackers can also sell stolen PHI to other criminals, who can use it for a range of illegal activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given these horrifying facts, SelfKey strongly advises individuals to take steps to protect their medical identity, such as:</p>
 
 Regularly checking medical records for errors. 
 Checking for signs of fraudulent activity. 
 Ensuring that their healthcare providers have proper security measures in place to protect their PHI. 
 
 Financial loss 
<p>Once malicious individuals obtain your PII, they could potentially use it to <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">damage your credit</a> score and commit financial fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lowered credit score can make it challenging for the victim to:</p>
 
 Obtain a personal loan. 
 Secure a mortgage. 
 Even impact job prospects.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, individuals who commit identity fraud can open new bank accounts in your name, drain your existing accounts, and commit check fraud. They can also apply for credit using your information, and engage in a variety of other banking scams. All things considered, it’s important to be vigilant in safeguarding your PII. The long-term financial consequences of a data breach can be severe.</p>
 Impersonation on Social Media 
<p>Cybercriminals can use your digital identity to carry out various malicious activities that can cause significant harm. Here are only a few terrifying examples:</p>
 
 They can use your digital identity to phish for credentials from your friends and family, leading to further attacks.&nbsp; 
 They can ruin your reputation by posting obscene or profane content online, damaging your personal and professional relationships.&nbsp; 
 They may look for sensitive photos and videos in your account and use them to extort you, leading to emotional distress and financial loss.&nbsp; 
 
<p>As horrifying as this may sound, there are ways to prevent this kind of disaster from causing irreparable damage to your digital identity. For instance, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> methods may be the key to protect individuals against identity theft.</p>
 Emotional and Mental impact 
<p>A personal data breach can lead to significant mental and emotional distress. The harm caused can take a long time to recover from, depending on the extent of the damage done by the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with reputational damage, victims may also have to spend a considerable amount of time and money to mitigate the fallout. And, the steps towards recovering from such a cyberattack could be draining in themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims may have to spend endless hours or days:</p>
 
 Contacting their bank, lenders, and creditors. 
 Securing all their online accounts. 
 Replacing stolen identification documents. 
 Canceling and replacing bank accounts and credit cards. 
 Dealing with criminal charges made in their name.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Victims will also need to remove malware and viruses from their devices, while constantly proving their identity and showing that it was stolen. A process which can be emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting in itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst of all, if affected individuals fail to repair compromised information or remove malware from their devices, they will risk falling victim to the same attacks over and over again.</p>
<p>The long-lasting consequences of a data breach can be devastating, particularly if your PII or PHI end up on the Dark Web. The information could be in circulation there indefinitely, making you vulnerable to further harm.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and POI (proof of individuality), or proof of humanity staking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and POI staking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers POI staking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and POI Staking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>POI (Proof of Individuality), or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, POI staking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a POI credential that can be staked on with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By staking KEY on their POI credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's POI staking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By staking their POI credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have staked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, staking POI credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens, as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POI staking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By staking on their POI credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD POI Staking 
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's POI staking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information. To ensure the privacy and security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD POI staking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By staking on their POI credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 What is Online Identity? 
 A brief definition 
<p>The concept of online identity refers to a persona which people establish for themselves on the internet. Also called internet identity, online personality, or internet persona, it may be used in online communities and websites. It can also be a way of intentionally showing and representing oneself.</p>
<p>Although some people choose to use their real names online, some internet users prefer to be anonymous. They identify themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, an online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Identity vs Digital Identity 
<p>Even though online identity and digital identity are often found in the same context, there is a notable distinction between them. The difference between online identity and digital identity lies in their scope and focus.</p>
<p>Online identity specifically pertains to the persona and representation of a person in the online realm. It encompasses the social identity an individual establishes in online communities, websites, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>It includes elements such as:</p>
 
 Usernames and profiles. 
 Personal information. 
 Digital footprints. 
 
<p>All in all, it is the perception others have of the individual based on their online presence.</p>
<p>Digital identity, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses the information and attributes associated with any entity, not limited to individuals. It extends beyond just personal online presence and encompasses a wider range of entities and their attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes organizational identities, system identities, device identities, and more. It focuses on how entities are identified, authenticated, and represented in the digital domain.</p>
<p>In simple terms, online identity refers to how a person appears and acts online, while digital identity is a broader concept that includes representing any entity in the digital world, such as people, organizations, apps, and devices.</p>
 Digital Footprints 
<p>While navigating the internet, it's important to remember that our online actions can have lasting effects on specific websites. These effects are referred to as digital footprints.</p>
<p>Digital footprints are the marks or records of our online activities and interactions that remain after using digital devices and platforms. They can include different types of data, like personal information, online behaviors, communications, and contributions.</p>
<p>Some examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Social Media Posts 
 Web Browsing History 
 Online Purchases 
 Email Communication 
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
 
 Social Media Posts 
<p>Any content shared on social media platforms, including photos, videos, comments, and likes, contributes to a person's digital footprint. These posts can provide insights into their interests, opinions, and activities.</p>
 Web Browsing History 
<p>Every website visited and the search queries made leave a digital trace in the form of browsing history. It can include information about the types of websites visited, articles read, products searched for, and online services used.</p>
 Online Purchases 
<p>When making online purchases, individuals leave a digital footprint through transaction records. This can include payment information, shipping addresses, and product preferences. This data can be collected and analyzed to understand consumer behavior and tailor personalized advertisements.</p>
 Email Communication 
<p>Emails sent and received, including attachments, provide a digital trail of personal and professional conversations. The content of these emails can reveal information about relationships, affiliations, and communication patterns.</p>
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
<p>The creation and maintenance of online profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, dating websites, or gaming communities contribute to a person's digital footprint. These profiles often contain personal information, employment history, educational background, and connections. And they form a digital representation of an individual's identity.</p>
<p>It's important to note that digital footprints can have implications for privacy, security, and reputation management. The data accumulated over time can be used for various purposes, including targeted advertising, data analysis, and even potential misuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s vital that individuals take extra caution when browsing the internet, especially when sharing private information. Even websites that appear trustworthy may be at risk of data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
 How Online Identity Works 
<p>On a daily basis, individuals rely on their online identities to access various applications. Certain websites play a pivotal role in everyday work, communication, and education. However, there are also online domains that serve as sources of entertainment or offer delightful distractions.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples in which people make use of their online identities:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Social Media 
 Online Gaming 
 Professional Networks 
 Online Communities and Forums 
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
 
<p>Now, let's take a moment to briefly discuss them.</p>
 Social Media 
<p>On platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, online identity is built through the creation of profiles. This may also include sharing personal information, posting content, and engaging with others. For example, a person's online identity on Instagram might include their username, profile picture, bio, and the photos or videos they share.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Gaming 
<p>In the realm of online gaming, players often create unique usernames, avatars, and profiles that represent their gaming persona. Their online identity in this context is influenced by their gaming achievements, playstyle, interactions with other players, and reputation within the gaming community.&nbsp;</p>
 Professional Networks 
<p>Platforms like LinkedIn focus on professional networking and career development. Online identity on LinkedIn is shaped by an individual's professional experience. This can include work experience, education, skills, recommendations, and professional achievements. It allows professionals to establish their expertise, connect with colleagues, and showcase their qualifications.</p>
 Online Communities and Forums 
<p>Though online communities and forums centered around specific interests or hobbies, individuals have the opportunity to participate in discussions, ask questions, and share knowledge. Online identity within these communities is built based on the content contributed, expertise demonstrated, and the respect gained from other community members.&nbsp;</p>
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
<p>When engaging in online shopping, individuals create accounts and profiles on e-commerce platforms. Online identity in this context involves personal information, purchase history, reviews, and ratings given to products or sellers. It influences the trustworthiness and credibility of an individual as a buyer or seller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each of these contexts, online identity is constructed through the information individuals share, their online activities, and the interactions they have with others. It plays a role in shaping how others perceive them and how they navigate various online spaces.</p>
 The Benefits of Having an Online Identity 
<p>Because the wide majority of the world has already adopted modern technology, having an online identity has become a necessity. However, there are a multitude of benefits which come with having an online identity, namely:</p>
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
 Professional Opportunities 
 Networking and Collaboration 
 Personal Branding 
 Access to Resources and Information 
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
<p>Having an online identity allows individuals to extend their reach beyond physical boundaries. It provides a platform to share ideas, expertise, and creativity with a global audience. And this may potentially lead to increased influence and impact.</p>
 Professional Opportunities 
<p>An online identity can open doors to various professional opportunities. It allows individuals to showcase their skills, accomplishments, and qualifications to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It acts as a digital resume, making it easier for others to discover and connect with them.</p>
 Networking and Collaboration 
<p>An online identity facilitates networking and collaboration by connecting individuals with like-minded people, professionals in their field, or communities of interest. It provides a platform to engage in meaningful discussions, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects, fostering valuable connections and relationships.</p>
 Personal Branding 
<p>Online identity enables individuals to shape and manage their personal brand effectively. They can curate their online presence to reflect their values, expertise, and unique qualities. This branding can help individuals stand out, establish credibility, and create a positive perception among peers, potential clients, or collaborators.</p>
 Access to Resources and Information 
<p>Having an online identity grants individuals access to a vast array of resources, information, and opportunities available on the internet. It allows them to tap into online communities, educational platforms, industry-specific websites, and research databases. This empowers them to stay informed, learn, and grow in their personal and professional pursuits.</p>
 Online Identity Risks and Challenges 
<p>As with any innovation, having an online identity does not come without risks. It’s important for people to be aware of these negative aspects and to take precautions to avoid becoming victims. Even more, it’s equally important to spread awareness and educate as many people as possible about these matters.</p>
<p>If proper security measures would be in place, the following situations could be prevented:</p>
 
 Identity Theft 
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
 Online Reputation Damage 
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
 
 Identity Theft 
<p>Online <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> occurs when someone gains unauthorized access to personal information and uses it for fraudulent purposes. For example, a hacker might gain access to an individual's online banking account and use their identity to make unauthorized transactions or steal funds.</p>
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
<p>Phishing is a tactic used by cybercriminals to deceive individuals into sharing sensitive information such as passwords or credit card details by disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity. For example, a person may receive an email appearing to be from their bank, asking them to click on a link and provide login credentials. Hackers may use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the victim's accounts.</p>
 Online Reputation Damage 
<p>In the digital age, a person's online reputation can have significant consequences. Negative or inappropriate content shared online, whether by oneself or others, can harm one's personal or professional reputation. For instance, a controversial tweet or a compromising photo shared online without consent can damage an individual's reputation and have long-lasting consequences.</p>
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">Data breaches</a> occur when sensitive information is accessed, stolen, or exposed due to security vulnerabilities in online systems. This can lead to the compromise of personal information, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, or financial data. An example is when a major retail company experiences a breach, resulting in the theft of customer credit card information from their database.</p>
<p>These risks and challenges highlight the importance of maintaining strong online security practices, being cautious with personal information sharing, and being vigilant about potential threats to online identity.</p>

 An introduction to Metaverse 
 Metaverse and humanity 
<p>In order to operate in the digital space, individuals have to exist in. Therefore, the introduction of digital identities was something which came naturally with people’s need to belong on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost every person has had an online account, somewhere, or has been listed in some digital system. This was done either by the user themselves, or by other individuals in order to keep track of records more easily. The digital realm, therefore, has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is something which almost every person seeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, advancements in modern technology have unveiled the exciting possibility of interacting with virtual objects and spaces. Venturing into the metaverse has the potential to unlock doors to new realms of knowledge. It may ignite the imagination and provide opportunities to explore aspects of the world that may otherwise be physically out of reach.</p>
<p>All in all, the metaverse may change the way we, as society, interact and educate ourselves. With all of this in mind, SelfKey strives to develop digital identity solutions that may enhance security and privacy as individuals begin to explore cyberspace.</p>
 Metaverse in a nutshell 
<p>The metaverse is a concept that came to be at the intersection of enhanced physical reality and persistent virtual space. It is centered around shared virtual spaces, consisting of various digital worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the metaverse represents a digital universe created and sustained by software, which is accessible through the internet. Within this virtual domain, individuals can interact with each other, as well as their virtual surroundings, in real-time.</p>
<p>For many years, the metaverse existed only as a theoretical concept, residing in the realm of people's imaginations. However, with the continuous advancements in technology, particularly in virtual and augmented reality, cyberspace is gradually capturing widespread attention.

 The Dark Side of Metaverse 
<p>As stated above, cyberspace holds immense potential and possibilities. However, alongside these exciting prospects, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges which come with this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the metaverse indeed raises concerns about health and social isolation, among other crucial factors, we will narrow our discussion to two primary aspects:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Privacy Issues 
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
 
 Privacy Issues 
<p>The metaverse relies on the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, which, like any cutting-edge innovation, presents its own set of challenges. As an extension of the internet, cyberspace confronts similar digital privacy and security issues, but perhaps at a more concerning level.</p>
<p>VR systems may collect user data, encompassing personal information and behavioral data, with the intention of enhancing the user experience. However, the collection and handling of such data carry inherent risks, including the potential for privacy breaches or unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Moreover, when engaging with VR applications and services developed by third parties, users should be aware that these entities may gather personal data for their own purposes, raising further privacy considerations.</p>
<p>Safeguarding this data is of utmost importance, as mishandling could expose individuals to privacy breaches, compromising their personal information and leaving them susceptible to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> or misuse.</p>
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
<p>The utilization of VR within the metaverse presents a vulnerable target for identity theft. With the aid of various machine learning algorithms, it may be relatively easy to manipulate sounds and visuals to a degree where they appear genuine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, attackers can exploit virtual reality platforms by introducing deceptive features aimed at extracting personal information from users. This susceptibility, similar to augmented reality, opens the door to ransomware attacks, where hackers compromise platforms and then demand a ransom.</p>
<p>Machine learning technologies also facilitate the manipulation of voices and videos while preserving their realism. If a hacker manages to access motion detection data from a VR headset, they could potentially employ it to generate a digital replica, commonly known as a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake">deepfake</a>.</p>
<p>A deepfake could then be used by malicious players to impersonate a user, or to try and access private accounts and systems in their name. While that is indeed a terrifying scenario, there are several decentralized solutions which may prevent such disasters.</p>

 Web3 and SelfKey 
 Conclusions 
 
 An Introduction to Web3&nbsp; 
<p>Evolution is natural in many aspects of life. With modern technology, however, it’s especially beneficial when networking and artificial intelligence can considerably enhance the way society functions. Let us discover the concept of Web3, what it is, and how it can affect our daily lives.</p>
 What is Web3? 
<p>Web3, or Web 3.0, represents a new vision for the next phase of the World Wide Web. It aims to integrate principles like decentralization, blockchain advancements, and token-driven economies.</p>
<p>The range of emerging technologies and projects it encompasses include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 decentralized finance (DeFi) 
 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 
 decentralized applications (dApps) 
 
<p>At its core, Web3 envisions a future where individuals have greater sovereignty over their digital lives. Where trust and transparency are built into the very fabric of the internet.</p>
 Web2 to Web3: How different are they? 
<p>Web2 is the current version of the internet, encompassing all the technologies and projects people are accustomed to nowadays. While Web2 has proven to be an inclusive and dynamic form of the web, it has its limitations due to its centralized nature. In this context, Web3 aims to enhance user freedom, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>There are many differences between Web2 and Web3. For now, let us explore two of the most prominent aspects which set them apart:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
<p>Web2 platforms and services are predominantly centralized, meaning they rely on centralized servers and intermediaries to operate. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon control and manage user data and have the authority to set rules and policies. Because of this, users have limited control over their data and are dependent on these centralized entities.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, emphasizes decentralization. It operates on peer-to-peer networks and blockchain technology, where data is distributed across multiple nodes. Users have greater control over their data and can interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) without the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts and consensus mechanisms enable decentralized governance models where the community collectively makes decisions, instead of relying on a single authority.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>In Web2, user data is often collected, stored, and controlled by centralized platforms. Users typically agree to terms and conditions that grant these platforms the right to use and monetize their data. Privacy concerns arise due to the potential for data breaches, surveillance, and unauthorized access to personal information.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, prioritizes user ownership and control over data. With decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain technology provides transparency and auditability, which may reduce the risk of unauthorized manipulation or access. Users have the ability to grant and revoke access to their data on a case-by-case basis, enhancing privacy and data sovereignty.</p>
<p>All in all, these differences highlight the shift from a centralized and controlled web to a more decentralized, user-centric, and economically empowering Web3 ecosystem.</p>
 Web3 Benefits and Opportunities 
<p>Due to its decentralized nature, and not only, Web3 can offer a multitude of benefits and opportunities. Let’s examine a few:</p>
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 Economic Empowerment 
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
<p>Web3 aims to decentralize power and eliminate the need for intermediaries by leveraging blockchain technology. This can result in a more trustless and transparent online environment. Users may interact directly with each other and verify transactions without relying on centralized authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to be a decentralized and trustless digital environment, due to its emphasis on limited data sharing.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>One thing that Web3 prioritizes is user ownership and control over personal data. This is also known as <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereignty</a>, and it aims to reduce the risk of data breaches by enabling individuals to be the sole owners of their data.</p>
<p>Through decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data. They can selectively grant access to their data and have more control over how it is used and shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shift towards user-centric data ownership may enhance privacy and empower individuals to protect their personal information.</p>
 Economic Empowerment 
<p>Another advantage of Web3 is that it introduces new economic models enabled by cryptocurrencies and tokens. This may allow individuals to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, where they can lend, borrow, and invest without relying on traditional financial intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization and the concept of ownership over digital assets may open new opportunities for creators, artists, and content providers to monetize their work directly. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, Web3 could potentially create more equitable economic systems.</p>
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
<p>Web3 aims to promote interoperability between different blockchain networks and protocols. This means that users may seamlessly interact with various decentralized applications (dApps) and move assets across different platforms without facing barriers or restrictions.&nbsp;It allows for a more connected and cohesive ecosystem where users may access a wide range of services and functionalities.</p>
<p>To aid this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a decentralized solution which may enhance digital privacy and security as individuals operate in these platforms.&nbsp;</p>
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
<p>Finally, Web3 enables decentralized governance models through mechanisms like smart contracts and decentralized <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">autonomous organizations (DAOs)</a>. This allows users to have a say in the decision-making processes of the platforms they engage with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can participate in voting, propose changes, and contribute to the development and evolution of the platforms they use. And this fosters a sense of community ownership and collaboration, empowering users to shape the direction of the platforms and protocols they rely on.</p>
<p>All in all, these benefits highlight Web3’s potential to transform the internet into a more user-centric, transparent, and inclusive ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that Web3 is still an emerging concept. Therefore, its actual realization and impact will depend on the development and adoption of relevant technologies and applications.</p>
 The Dark Side of Web3 
<p>While Web3 brings potential benefits, it also presents certain risks and challenges that need to be considered. It’s important to be aware of these challenges in order to take preventive measures and remain vigilant.</p>
<p>Here are five potential risks that may occur with Web3:</p>
 
 Security and Privacy Concerns 
 Bots and Maliciously-used AI 
 User Responsibility and Risks 
 
 Security and Privacy Concerns 
<p>As Web3 relies heavily on blockchain technology and decentralized systems, it introduces unique security and privacy considerations. Although blockchain is renowned for its robust security, vulnerabilities and exploits can still occur.</p>
<p>Additionally, decentralized storage and peer-to-peer networks may face privacy challenges. Therefore, they require careful attention to encryption, data protection, and identity management to ensure user privacy.</p>
 Bots and Maliciously-used AI 
<p>In Web3, identity and reputation systems can be compromised by bots through <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/sybil-attack/#:~:text=A%20Sybil%20attack%20uses%20a,of%20influence%20in%20the%20network.">sybil attacks</a>. Bots can create multiple fake identities to gain influence, voting power, or access to certain resources within decentralized networks. This can undermine the trust and fairness of the system.</p>
<p>Bad players can also program AI to distribute spam messages or engage in phishing attacks within decentralized communication platforms. These attacks aim to deceive users into sharing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links, compromising their security and privacy.</p>
 User Responsibility and Risks 
<p>Web3 shifts more responsibility onto users, as they have greater control over their digital assets and interactions. With increased control comes increased risk, as users are solely responsible for managing their private keys. This includes securing their wallets, and avoiding scams or fraudulent activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>User error or negligence can result in irreversible loss of funds or unauthorized access to personal data, necessitating heightened user awareness and education.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize these risks and address them proactively. One can do this through responsible development, regulatory frameworks, user education, and sustainable practices. The purpose is to maximize the promising benefits of Web3 while mitigating potential downsides.</p>
 Web3 and SelfKey

 The Benefits of Tokenization 
 Tokenization: Challenges and Risks 
 A Glimpse into SelfKey’s Protocol 
 Conclusions 
 
 What is Tokenization? 
 A brief definition&nbsp; 
<p>Tokenization, in the context of data security, involves the substitution of sensitive data with a non-sensitive equivalent, known as a token. The purpose of tokenization is to render the original data meaningless and devoid of exploitable value. Instead, a token is generated, which serves as a reference point linking back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system.</p>
<p>The tokenization process is designed with the aim to enhance data protection by reducing the risk associated with storing or transmitting sensitive information. By replacing sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personal identification details, with tokens, the likelihood of unauthorized access or misuse of the original data may be significantly minimized.</p>
<p>The tokenization system manages the mapping between the tokens and their corresponding sensitive data, ensuring that the original information can be retrieved when needed by authorized entities. This system may provide a secure and efficient way to handle sensitive data, reducing the exposure to potential breaches or theft.</p>
<p>Overall, tokenization plays a vital role in safeguarding sensitive information, preserving data privacy, and maintaining the integrity of systems that handle sensitive data elements.</p>
 Tokens Explained 
<p>Tokens may function as digital assets or representations of value that are built on top of existing blockchain networks. They can serve various purposes and operate within specific ecosystems.</p>
<p>Technically, tokens are programmable digital objects that are created and managed through smart contracts. These contracts dictate the rules and behaviors of the tokens, such as their supply, transferability, and functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals can create tokens on different blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana, using their respective token standards like ERC-20, BEP-20, or SPL. And, depending on their design, they can have different functionalities.</p>
<p>For instance, tokens can:</p>
 
 Be used as a medium of exchange and stores of value. 
 Represent ownership rights in a particular asset or project.&nbsp; 
 Have utility functions within decentralized applications (DApps), enabling access to specific features or services. 
 
<p>Overall, tokens operate within the framework of blockchain technology. They offer a flexible and programmable way to represent and exchange data or value within digital ecosystems.</p>
 Types of Tokens 
<p>In addition to the general definitions mentioned earlier, there are specific categories of cryptoassets that include the word "token" in their name. Here are a few examples:</p>
 
 DeFi tokens refer to crypto tokens issued by decentralized finance protocols, which aim to replicate traditional financial functions. These tokens serve multiple purposes within their respective protocols and can be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency. For instance, individuals may use them for lending, saving, insurance, and trading.&nbsp; 
 Governance tokens are specialized tokens which grant holders the ability to participate in decision-making processes for a protocol or application. As decentralized platforms lack central authorities or boards of directors, governance tokens provide voting rights.&nbsp; 
 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent ownership rights to unique digital or real-world assets. They have been utilized to combat unauthorized copying and sharing of digital creations. Additionally, NFTs have gained popularity in the art world for issuing limited editions of digital artwork or selling exclusive virtual assets like rare items in video games. 
 Finally, security tokens are cryptoassets which are designed to function as the cryptocurrency equivalent of traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Security tokens enable the sale of shares in companies or other ventures, including real estate, without the involvement of brokers. Major companies and startups are exploring security tokens as an alternative fundraising method. 
 
<p>By familiarizing oneself with these different categories of tokens, one can gain a better understanding of the diverse applications and functionalities within the crypto space.</p>
 The difference between Crypto and Tokenization 
<p>The difference between cryptocurrency and tokenization lies in their underlying concepts and functionalities.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that utilize cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies typically operate as independent entities with their own blockchain networks. They can function as a medium of exchange, a store of value, or a unit of account.</p>
<p>On the other hand, tokenization is the process of converting data, real-world assets, rights, or functionalities into digital tokens that exist and operate on a blockchain. Tokens can represent various forms of value, such as ownership rights, access to services, or participation in a project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that operate independently on their respective blockchain networks, while tokenization involves the creation and representation of data, assets or functionalities as digital tokens within a specific platform or ecosystem.</p>
 The Benefits of Tokenization 
<p>Tokenization offers several benefits for data security and efficiency. Here are a few key advantages of tokenization, which we will discuss more thoroughly below:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enhanced Data Security 
 Improved Data Processing Efficiency 
 Simplified Data Management and Migration 
 
 Enhanced Data Security 
<p>Tokenization helps protect sensitive information by replacing it with randomly generated tokens that have no intrinsic value or meaning. Unlike encryption, tokenization removes the need to store sensitive data, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches. Even if a hacker gains access to the tokenized data, it is almost impossible to&nbsp; reverse-engineer the original information.</p>
 Improved Data Processing Efficiency 
<p>Tokenization accelerates data processing and retrieval by replacing long and complex data strings with shorter tokens. These tokens are easier and faster to search, index, and analyze. And this leads to improved performance and efficiency in data-intensive applications such as databases, data warehousing, and big data analytics.</p>
 Simplified Data Management and Migration 
<p>Lastly, tokenization facilitates data management and migration processes, particularly when transitioning between different systems or databases. When migrating data, tokens can be used to maintain data integrity and relationships while ensuring sensitive information remains secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, tokenization simplifies data integration, as systems can exchange tokens instead of transferring actual data. This may reduce the complexity and overhead of data sharing.</p>
<p>All in all, tokenization may offer notable security advantages. However, it is crucial to prioritize the management and protection of the tokenization system itself. This will ensure comprehensive security throughout the process.</p>
 Tokenization: Challenges and Risks 
<p>While tokenization offers numerous benefits, there are also potential risks associated with its implementation, for instance:</p>
 
 Dependency on Tokenization System 
 Token Reversal Attacks 
 Token Mapping Vulnerabilities 
 Single Point of Failure 
 
 Dependency on Tokenization System 
<p>Organizations adopting tokenization may become reliant on the tokenization system and infrastructure. If the system experiences a breach, suffers from downtime, or becomes unavailable, it can disrupt operations and impact business continuity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial to implement robust security measures and backup systems to mitigate such risks.</p>
 Token Reversal Attacks 
<p>Although tokenized data is not directly reversible, attackers may attempt token reversal attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the tokenization system or its implementation. If successful, these attacks could potentially derive sensitive information from the tokens. And, in turn, it may&nbsp; undermine the security benefits of tokenization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vigilance in system design and implementation, as well as regular security audits, can help mitigate this risk.</p>
 Token Mapping Vulnerabilities 
<p>Tokenization relies on a mapping or lookup table that connects tokens to their original data. If malicious individuals compromise this mapping table, they may gain access to the original sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robust security measures are therefore essential to protect against this risk, such as:</p>
 
 strong access controls. 
 encryption of the mapping table 
 secure key management. 
 
 Single Point of Failure 
<p>Centralizing tokenization processes introduces a single point of failure. If the tokenization system or central repository is compromised, it can have widespread implications across the organization, potentially exposing sensitive data or disrupting operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing redundancy, disaster recovery mechanisms, and distributed tokenization systems can help mitigate this risk.</p>
<p>All in all, it's important to note that while these risks exist, there are methods which may mitigate them and maximize the benefits of tokenization. These methods include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 implementing proper security measures. 
 conducting regular assessments. 
 adhering to best practices. 
 
 A Glimpse into SelfKey’s Protocol 
<p>When developing decentralized solutions, SelfKey places great emphasis on digital identity privacy and security. The vision is to create a decentralized network which may be more secure, in which members may be able to exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may be such a platform by treating its members with transparency, equality, and fairness. Within the SelfKey Protocol, there are currently two tokens which serve as pivotal elements: KEY and SELF.</p>
 KEY: A Brief Introduction 
<p>Utility tokens derive their value from their utility or functionality within the ecosystem they are associated with. One may use them within the platform to exchange for goods or services, participate in voting or governance processes, access premium features, or facilitate interactions.</p>
<p>The KEY token may find utility in various ways, including:</p>
 
 Serving as a method of exchange for services within the SelfKey Protocol. 
 Enabling users to stake their credentials more securely. 
 Empowering members to govern the SelfKey DAO. 
 Equipping users with essential tools which may allow them to take charge of their digital identity and increase privacy protection. 
 
 The Purpose of SELF 
<p>While KEY remains the vital utility token to stake on credentials, SelfKey introduces the SELF tokens to facilitate tracking of an individual's staked credentials and their duration.</p>
<p>Having access to the SelfKey DAO may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. Individuals may use these tokens for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some notable attributes of SELF tokens:</p>
 
 Individuals who successfully stake a real identity may mint SELF tokens. 
 SELF tokens may serve as a metric for reputation measurement. 
 As a reputation signal, they may strengthen legitimate credentials and help identify illegitimate ones. 
 Users themselves may mint SELF tokens, and they hold no inherent value. 
 SELF tokens may also serve as a governance mechanism, granting influence to those who use the platform, accumulate reputation, or engage in "identity mining" to enhance platform security. 
 As users stake valid credentials, they accumulate reputation in the form of SELF tokens. 
 
<p>By introducing SELF tokens, SelfKey may enhance the ecosystem by providing individuals with a way to monitor their staked credentials and reputation. At the same time, it may promote the integrity and security of the platform.</p>
 Staking for Digital Safety 
<p>By staking KEY tokens on their credential, users may mint SELF tokens. Staking on credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of Staking, therefore, is to enhance digital security and privacy. This may prevent data breaches, identity theft, and unlawful attempts by malicious bots to infiltrate your private online accounts and systems.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rapid progress of modern technology constantly astonishes us, bringing forth opportunities for knowledge, efficiency, communication, and speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization, a relatively new concept, has the potential to simplify private data management and enhance online security through encryption methods, offering benefits in terms of privacy, security, speed, and efficiency.</p>
<p>Understanding this evolving concept becomes crucial in order to stay informed about its advancements and leverage its advantages without compromising our digital identities and online security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these purposes, SelfKey aims to educate people about digital safety and introduce them to innovative concepts and technologies that can enhance online privacy and security. Knowledge is vital in order to prevent online attacks aimed at our digital identities, therefore staying up to date with relevant news on this topic and spreading awareness is important.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>There has been much excitement and buzz around generative AI in recent months. New tools pop up every hour that will undoubtedly make us humans far more efficient. At the same time, hackers have the same tools available to them and they are some of the most innovative people on the planet. They spend whole days thinking about how to use the latest and most advanced tools at their disposal to bypass security controls of nation states, corporations and individuals.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In this post we look at how hackers are using generative AI technologies to modify their attack vectors and amplify their success rates. We also discuss the importance of identity security controls in preventing these attacks, and the increasing urgency around adopting them. We primarily focus on how deterministic methods of verifying humans are critical in this new age when artificial intelligence can mimic a human interaction with extreme accuracy.&nbsp;</p> 
 How Generative AI Makes Hackers Better  
<p>Generative AI is brilliant at making repeatable tasks extremely fast and effortless. Let’s put ourselves into the shoes of a hacker and consider the “Before AI” and “After AI” scenarios of the typical attack vectors that one would consider.</p> 
 1. Phishing  
 The practice of sending people fraudulent messages in order to trick them into providing credentials or sensitive information.&nbsp;  
<p>Before generative AI, hackers created generic emails with very minimal context and used mass mailing systems to deliver email, SMS or app-based messages to individuals. These emails often contain a malicious link that would prompt the victim to provide their password as well as a 2nd factor such as an OTP code or approving a push notification. The attacker would then get access to their account and wreak havoc.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This method is a “spray and pray” approach that yields limited results but is still highly profitable. Many hackers have moved to “spear phishing” attacks where the message is more tailored to the individual. This yields a much higher likelihood of success but is far more tedious and time consuming to execute. For example, spear phishing attacks may reference a friend or family member or recent event that a victim may have posted about on social media to increase the likelihood of them clicking the malicious link that the message contains.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With generative AI, hackers can make every single phishing message a highly tailored spear phishing message. The AI can search millions of potential victims' social media profiles, their company’s recent news and updates, and then craft a message that is uniquely tailored to that individual that they are very likely to engage with. The AI can even mask themselves to first have a “real” conversation with a victim that builds trust and then execute the malicious payload after a baseline of trust is established.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This approach is already making <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-phishing-prevention">phishing attacks</a> far more sophisticated and successful. We have seen ample evidence that successful phishing attacks can have a major negative business impact and the AI-strengthened attacks are a major concern for company CEOs and boards of directors everywhere.</p> 
 2. Social Engineering  
 The practice of manipulating humans in order to gain access to systems or resources for gain.&nbsp;  
<p>Hackers who excel at social engineering tend to make the big bucks. Social engineering can be done via many mediums such as email, in-person, over the phone or via video. During the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses had to fundamentally change their working practices and remote work became the norm. As a result, the number of social engineering attacks skyrocketed because a much higher percentage of our interactions (particularly ones that needed elevated assurance) became fully digital.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hackers took advantage of overloaded IT service desk employees and convinced them (over the phone) to reset passwords or get access to accounts. They would search the Internet to find out basic information about an employee and use that to social engineer their way into countless organizations. We also saw many examples of consumers defrauded by scammers through fraud schemes that cost the public millions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With generative AI, a hacker can use an existing model to execute attacks using deep fakes through chat, video or phone calls. These deep fakes will have full context and knowledge about their victim and be able to convince them to provide credentials, send money or divulge sensitive information that can be used for profit or political gain. For example, an AI can fully recreate a company CFO’s voice and use it to call into an IT service desk to reset their credentials. Once they have access to the account, they can send fictitious emails to affect the stock price of the business. Scary!</p> 
 3. Password Cracking  
 The practice of guessing or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/brute-force-attacks-what-to-know">brute forcing</a> a person's password.  
<p>Password cracking is a go-to for hackers. Most people have terribly insecure passwords and almost everyone has had some form of their password leaked in one of the high-profile breaches, such as LinkedIn, that everyone has read about. Hackers who are good at cracking passwords understand that most people use simple variations of the same password and can generally crack it with a little research. Unfortunately, this is a tedious process. At the same time, hackers are often limited in their password cracking due to cultural differences. If a hacker in Russia wants to hack into the account of a victim in Saudi Arabia, they would have to do significant research on this person’s hobbies, history, etc. to reliably be able to guess their passwords. As a result, hackers focus their time on higher value targets because time is money!</p> 
<p>With generative AI, hackers can use a simple prompt to have the artificial intelligence learn everything about a person on the Internet and then use the contextual information about their culture, language and background to quickly crack passwords. Furthermore, AI can be trained to mimic a human and input these credentials into websites that will soon be able to bypass the most sophisticated bot detection mechanisms.</p> 
 4. Malware (and Ransomware) Generation&nbsp;  
<p>Hackers play a never ending game of whack-a-mole against the endpoint detection and response companies such as CrowdsStrike. A hacker creates a new piece of malware, they deploy it using a 0-day, unpatched system vulnerability, or similar attack vector and do the damage they can (such as encrypting the system or stealing credentials). The security community detects this malware, tags it, and blocks this malware’s signature moving forward (they whack the mole).</p> 
<p>Hackers spend significant time modifying their malware code to avoid signature detection. This is tedious and time consuming and the perfect place for AI to be helpful. Using&nbsp; generative AI, hackers can create infinite versions of the same piece of malware and avoid detection. The malware now becomes completely malleable and the game of whack-a-mole starts to become impossible to deal with. A hacker can now make every single payload installed look completely unique. By the time that this malware is caught in the wild, triaged and tagged, the hacker has made a million more variations of it as they sleep using artificial intelligence. To make things worse, when a new 0-day is discovered by a hacker, they will be able to use AI to generate exploit chains in record time. Instead of spending days or weeks building a piece of malware, the AI will be able to use previous knowledge of other exploit kits and modify them in real time to create entirely new and unique viruses or ransomware within seconds of an initial vulnerability being discovered.</p> 
<p>With this new tool, hackers will be able to deploy malware and persist on systems much longer. They will use that time to intercept credentials by using keyloggers, extracting cached credentials, and then use these stolen credentials to spread to other systems in the organization to cause major problems for businesses.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is (and Is not) Phishing-Resistant Authentication  
<p>Phishing-resistant authentication is whenever a human is removed from the equation. A false perception is that passwordless authentication is always phishing resistant. Just like anything else, the details of implementation are critical to understand.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Let’s look at what isn’t phishing resistant:</p> 
  
  Passwords — Humans can be tricked into providing their passwords via phishing attacks or social engineering.&nbsp;  
  SMS <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">OTP codes</a> — Humans can be tricked into providing these codes using social engineering or man-in-the-middle (MitM) proxies.&nbsp;  
  App-based OTP codes — Same as SMS OTP codes but not vulnerable to phone number or SIM card hijacking.&nbsp;  
  Push notifications — Humans can be annoyed or socially engineered to accept push notifications. These are known as push attacks or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">prompt bombing</a>.&nbsp;  
  Number matching — This is typically added as a layer after a push notification is accepted. Malicious MitM proxies can be modified to bypass this control or a social engineering attack can convince a human to provide the number matching digit.&nbsp;  
  
<p>The above methods are now considered “<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">legacy MFA</a>.” They were originally developed to create an additional barrier for hackers and to prevent password spraying attacks that were causing major issues for a number of companies. These legacy methods cannot be relied upon given that fully automated bypass methods are widely available and utilized by hackers.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">Phishing-resistant methods</a> largely take the human out of the equation when they are accessing systems. The legacy methods discussed above always involve a human reacting to an authentication event by typing something in or accepting a notification. This approach is fundamentally flawed because humans are busy and ultimately just want to move on with their day. Phishing-resistant authentication always puts intent behind any authentication request.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To use an example, imagine every time any person walked past your car in the parking lot while you’re inside grocery shopping, you received a push notification to unlock your vehicle. How many people do you think would accidentally unlock their car? This is basically how legacy 2FA methods work. Phishing-resistant methods require a human to have possession of a device (such as your car key FOB or phone) and the system is only accessed when they intentionally push the unlock button.&nbsp;</p> 
 How Phishing-Resistant Methods of Authentication Prevent AI-Strengthened Attacks  
<p>Based on the strengthened attack vectors above, let’s look at how phishing-resistant authentication controls can help us against these sophisticated attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Phishing — By eliminating the need for humans to react to authentication events, credential-based phishing attacks are eliminated. When a person clicks on a link that takes them to a malicious website, hackers will have no credential to steal because there is no password and there is no OTP code or push notification that can be intercepted.&nbsp;  
  Social Engineering — The vast majority of social engineering attacks will be eliminated due to the fact that authentication now requires physical presence at the point of access. Hackers who are executing social engineering attacks remotely will be stuck and forced to focus on in-person attacks, which are incredibly risky and cost prohibitive.&nbsp;  
  Password Cracking — If there’s no password, there’s nothing to crack!&nbsp;  
  Malware Generation and Deployment — The vast majority of malware uses a phished credential to land inside a business environment. The prevention of phishing and social engineering attacks will relegate malware attacks to relying on 0-day vulnerabilities in order to compromise a system. Even when they are successful in doing so, the inability to compromise credentials via keyloggers and cache busting will make it extremely difficult for the malware to spread beyond a single endpoint in the network.&nbsp;  
  
 How to Transition to Phishing-Resistant Authentication  
<p>The exciting news is that moving from legacy methods of authentication to a phishing-resistant method is entirely possible for any size business today.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here are some guidelines on how to move forward with a phishing-resistant method of authentication.</p> 
  
  Embrace the change management. Understand that you will need to roll out a new capability to all of your users as well as train your team to support the new technology.&nbsp;  
  Provide users with choice. Most people are happy to use their personal mobile device for authentication purposes but some are not. Be ready to provide those users with a dedicated roaming authenticator such as a phishing-resistant hardware token (e.g. Yubikey with passkey/FIDO support).  
  Focus on coverage. Partner with technology providers that focus on broad coverage of use cases. This is one of those instances where you may very well have to work with a “best-in-breed” solution provider instead of the giant platforms who only focus on improving the security for their specific products. For example, Microsoft cares a lot about providing phishing-resistant access into Microsoft products, but your technical ecosystem is much more than just Microsoft (even though it’s probably a pretty big chunk).&nbsp;  
  Get top down support. Your CIO/CEO and other members of leadership should be supportive of this change. Even though a phishing-resistant method of authentication is faster and more secure, some people still resist change. Employees of a company follow and emulate the leadership so their vocal support will make your transition easier.&nbsp;  
  Put your marketing hat on. Driving user adoption of a new authentication system is much easier if you gamify it. Make it fun with prizes, positive reinforcement and acknowledgement of forward progress. Once you get to a tipping point of adoption, it takes on a mind of its own and it’s beautiful to watch.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Don’t let perfect be the enemy of great. You will have a few use cases where people may still use a password and that’s OK! These are typically very legacy apps that don’t support any federation or authentication standard such as Mainframe, or thick client apps that were written 20 years ago. In all likelihood, the number of users on these apps are minimal and you can use other controls (such as a PAM system) to better secure the access to these.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Verizon released its <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:ent:ea:na:8888855284">Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)</a>. In this 16th year of the report, Verizon highlighted their analysis of more than 953,894 incidents, of which 254,968 are a breach. The report shows three primary ways in which attackers access an organization:</p>
 
 Stolen credentials 
 Phishing 
 Exploitation of vulnerabilities. 
 
<p>A continuation of the findings in last year’s report, the 2023 report states that hackers continue to exploit the human element (including errors, misuse, and social engineering). Combining this element and the entry points above, hackers gain access to organizations to launch their attacks. In fact, 74% of all breaches include the human element, with people being involved either via error, privilege misuse, use of stolen credentials or social engineering. A slight decrease over last year! But we have a long way to go.</p>
<p>The use of stolen credentials remains the top way for criminals to gain access to organizations. This supports the basic premise that hackers just log in above all else. Stolen credentials continue to be the top access method for bad actors as they account for 44.7% of breaches. Additionally, stolen credentials play a bigger role in web application attacks accounting for 86% of breaches here. To put that in perspective, web applications make up 25% of all breaches,</p>
<p>The takeaway here is the fact that humans and their credentials are still the weak link in the security chain. Why? Because a credential is something that can be shared or stolen. It feels like a difficult problem to solve, but in reality, the market is shifting to meet the obvious demand here. If we can eliminate credentials – user name and password – then the problem can be solved. Passwordless is the answer, right? Well, not so fast.</p>
<p>While these reports can be all doom and gloom, fear not, it’s not all bad, because there are ways to fix the problem.</p>
<p>As I discussed in <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/data-breach-investigations-report/">last year’s blog</a> about the 2022 DBIR report, Verizon recommends the usual approach to solve some of these problems like deploying two-factor authentication and/or implementing password managers for users, all in an effort to avoid the impact credentials introduce. This approach can reduce the likelihood of attackers being able to exploit poor passwords to gain access to applications, systems, and data. These capabilities have been available and in production for years BUT we are still seeing similar numbers year over year from reports like this year’s DBIR.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe we need to focus on credentials. Why? As I stated earlier, bad actors log in. If we can remove their capacity to login we stop a staggering number of breaches. So if we can improve upon authenticating users without the use of credentials then organizations will be better for it.</p>
<p>Let’s examine how a 1Kosmos customer can log in. Our customers systematically replace credentials with <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">real biometrics</a> that are matched to a verified digital identity and it works across all operating systems including Microsoft, Mac, Unix, and Linux. The authentication is IAL2 and AAL2 certified and ensures the user is who they claim to be. Because we do an ID+Selfie at enrollment and compare the selfie at each and every access request we ensure that the user requesting access is that user.</p>
<p>So, how do we, 1Kosmos, replace credentials? With <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/bringing-verified-identity-and-passwordless-to-the-masses/">verified identity</a>. By combining identity verification with access management organizations can eliminate credentials, especially passwords and therefore, prevent most of the 74% of intrusions caused by humans. You may be thinking, this sounds like what my current vendor is claiming by taking you passwordless. There is an important differentiation to what I am suggesting here. Passwordless authentication is a little better than current MFA methods. Multiple biometrics can be stored on a device, more than one face and touch ID, implementing them as a main authentication method means it’s still unknown if the user is who they claim to be. The access request has proven possession, that is all.</p>
<p>The move to an ID+Selfie journey, and using that selfie as a reference during authentication, combines <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/identity-based-authentication/">identity verification and authentication</a>, now siloed activities in most organizations. This approach weaves authentication into the identity fabric.</p>
<p>Hopefully, more organizations will take this approach and next year we’ll have another decline!</p>

  <p>Set aside your preconceptions about the people who are at this moment driving the U.S. information technology (IT) industry's <a href="https://www.trade.gov/selectusa-software-and-information-technology-industry">$1.9 trillion market value</a>. They are neither John Hodgman nor Elizabeth Holmes. They are engineers and artists, marketers and analysts. They are imaginative and they are strategic. They include people who are good with numbers and people who are good with people.</p>

<p>As a career choice, the tech sector has come a long way since it first became a commercial entity in the 1960s. It had to. As technology evolved from its beginnings in government labs to scientific and industrial applications and on to personal computers, the people building and using the technology evolved, too. Now that it is integral to every aspect of our everyday lives — our work, health, education, transportation, commerce, entertainment — technology must reflect the people who use it. In other words, all of us.</p>

<p>But our LGBTQ+ community is underrepresented in tech and that's unfortunate for everyone.</p>

<p>Technology is all about solving complex problems, but if technology is developed predominantly by people from the same background and culture, it may fail to address the needs, values, or perspectives of other people. This is known as technology bias. One example of technology bias can be found in facial recognition algorithms, which are trained to learn patterns and features for identification. If the dataset primarily includes cisgender faces or lacks diversity in gender identity, the algorithm may not effectively recognize transgender individuals.</p>

<p>On the other hand, diverse teams can approach challenges from multiple angles and identify novel solutions to complex problems — and eliminate the risk of technology bias. Technology leaders recognize that diverse perspectives are more likely to generate a wide range of innovative ideas, leading to better decision-making, problem-solving, and success in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world.</p>

 Why Consider a Career in Technology? 

<p>Technology careers are growing far faster than occupations in general. According to the Bureau for Labor Statistics, the field of computer and information technology is <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm">projected to grow by 15% from 2021 to 2031</a>, adding nearly 700,000 jobs over the decade. The median annual salary for employees in computer and information technology was $97,430 as of May 2021, which is significantly higher than the annual median for occupations at large ($45,760).</p>

<p>Best of all, technology permeates every industry, so you can put your skills to work in just about any area that interests you. Whether you join a company on the cutting edge of cybersecurity or a developer of business software, gaming apps, or cloud infrastructure, technology careers offer a number of benefits.</p>

	 Flexible work arrangements: Many technology companies offer their employees a variety of options, including flexible schedules and remote work. This is especially beneficial for people with families and other personal priorities.

  How To Get a Job in Technology 

<p>There are several steps you can take to increase your chances of landing the right position in the right company. Here are some tips:</p>

In addition, there are scores of roles in the tech sector that are not, in themselves, technical, but offer the benefits of being part of an innovative, fast-paced industry. 
	 Develop your skills: Once you've identified your area of interest, start building your skills. Take online courses, attend workshops and trade shows, read books, and participate in group activities, such as hackathons or coding challenges.

  The Single-Player Ready (SPR) app architecture allows users to maintain control over their data while also participating in a larger network of related content. It has applications including even sensitive information that should first and foremost be under the user's control.

<p>When you reflect on your most used apps, platforms, and services, you’ll notice how often you're the creator.</p><p>You create your profile on LinkedIn, recommend restaurants on Yelp, post thoughts on Reddit, share your life on Twitter or Instagram, and design your latest app in Figma, to name a few. You typically upload your data to the platform, which provides distribution across its vast network along with free hosting and slick user interfaces. In return, it expects to make money from your content and attention.</p><p>At SpruceID, we think that the content you make should, in fact, belong to you. A platform with its own (sometimes competing) interests shouldn't be able to lock your content to its databases or disable your entire account on a whim. Some platforms provide data exports, but almost always as archive files lacking in data portability. This form of lock-in reduces your autonomy and stifles innovation. You should be able to do what you want with your data.</p><p>We could start with portable data formats that declare you as the owner when you create original content. This content can be stored in your own private instances of these apps that you control, and you can give out additional access how you see fit. For example, you could maintain private lists of book reviews, and choose which lists you'd like to share to a friend, without an intermediary that could remove your (or your friend's) access to those lists. They are useful in their own right, without a platform. As a result, instead of you signing in to the platforms with fiefdoms over your data, the platforms could sign in to your data vault that you control entirely.</p><p>We also recognize that digital platforms are incredibly powerful distribution networks serving content creators for cheap or free, and this is especially important for small creators and new brands. However, it is you who owns the content and it should be your explicit choice on which platform to post, and on what terms.</p><p>The Single-Player Ready (SPR) app architecture allows users to maintain control over their data while also participating in a larger network of related content. It has applications beyond just book or restaurant reviews – medical histories, financial records, or any other sensitive information that should first and foremost be under the user's control.</p><p>This next generation of consumer apps is enabled by the proliferation of user-generated content, widespread user adoption of smart devices with digital signing capabilities, and the increasing affordability of cloud computing for individuals. These technology shifts have made it feasible for users to directly manage (or delegate management of) their data instead of relying on de facto management by a few large platforms, separating the custodianship of the data versus use across networks. Digital signing further allows users to originate content with authenticity that can be verified, and create data licenses or digital permission slips that automate compliance with data privacy rules.</p><p>The architecture of users bringing their own data has been pioneered by protocols such as <a href="https://login.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Sign-In with Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ActivityPub</a>, <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, and <a href="https://solidproject.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Solid</a>. To date, these have faced adoption hurdles due to user experience difficulties caused by the usage of digital keys, the need to perform server setup, and complex interfaces for user-granted permissions. With Single-Player Ready apps, these hurdles can be overcome because applications can now offer unparalleled user experiences while maintaining user control and privacy.</p> The Building Blocks of Single-Player Apps:   Key Management: Users can create digital signatures and use encryption over their data. This allows users to originate authentic content, authenticate themselves, grant access to their data vaults, or delegate power to other keys controlled by them or someone else. Users should have many keys, and not concentrate all their control into one that can be lost or stolen. Instead, this should match expectations in the physical world using advances in public key infrastructure (PKI).  Content Authenticity: Users can create digital signatures over metadata that corresponds to original content, such as tweets, posts, follows, messages, videos, images, reviews, and more. This allows users to establish provenance for their content, especially when attested with other signatures from witnesses such as other users, platforms, or blockchains. This creates content authenticity certificates that can be verified.  Data Licenses: Users can issue and revoke data licenses that describe the policies for how their data must be accessed and handled, providing more control over how their information is shared and used, and by whom.  Personal Data Vaults: Users can securely store and manage their digital information, including content. Access to the content within these vaults is granted via digitally signed permission slips (known as capabilities), which can be revoked later.   <p>These core building blocks introduce authenticity and integrity into digital interactions with Single-Player Ready apps. Today, the root of data provenance is typically in a cluster of platform-hosted SQL databases, but there's no reason why data provenance can't be rooted in digitally signed content that users independently hold. The transition away from centralized data silos will allow users to have fuller control over their digital interactions.</p> The Building Blocks: Keys are Digital Empowerment  <p><br>One of the critical components in this new paradigm is the concept that "keys equal digital empowerment." Traditionally, users have relied on either frequently-lost passwords or "Big Login" providers, such as Facebook, Google, or other similar services, to manage their online identities and data. However, with the advent of key-based authentication standards like <a href="https://login.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Sign-in with Ethereum</a> or <a href="https://passkeys.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">passkeys</a>, users can sign messages digitally to directly authenticate themselves and may be able to further authorize access to their data.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/">  Why Sign-In with Ethereum is a Game-Changer - Part 1  Sign-In with Ethereum is a game-changer for user choice on the Internet. Instead of submitting to “Big Login,” users can now login using the same keys controlling their blockchain accounts--without an intermediary.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>However, today's UX for signing different types of transactions or performing encryption does not always reflect the smooth, frictionless interactions we are used to in most consumer applications. If every time a user wanted to “like” a tweet or “follow” someone on Single-Player Ready Twitter, they were faced with a cumbersome digital signing dialog and more confirmations to persist their content, they probably wouldn't be users for long.</p><p>This can be solved by allowing users to use different keys for different purposes. For example, some keys might be generated on the spot (session keys) to perform certain pre-authorized actions without a slew of confirmation dialogs. Other keys might be long-lived, able to grant permissions to the session key after a confirmation dialog. We can innovate on signing standards and better key management to reduce friction for users while also maintaining integrity.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/from-sign-in-with-ethereum-to-session-keys/">  From Sign-In with Ethereum to Session Keys  Session keys let users root all their digital interactions to their keys.  SpruceWayne Chang    </a><p>Keys with existing privileges can manage access to resources by delegating some (or all) of those privileges to another key. For example, you may want to give your new physician's office access to your medical history since 2015. In this scenario, you, the owner of your medical data, create a data license that entitles the physician's office to retain your general medical history since 2015 for 5 years, or until you revoke the license.</p><p>To retrieve the actual data and associated data license, you grant a permission slip to the physician's office so they can access your data vault over the next hour for those specific files, and nothing more. On future visits, you may decide to adjust the data license so the physician's office can further share your data with certain medical specialists, but no further. This kind of system operates on the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=Definition(s)%3A,needs%20to%20perform%20its%20function.">principle of least privilege</a>, where an entity is granted the minimum resources and authorizations to perform a specific function and nothing else. </p><p>You can use these permission slips (often known as "capabilities") to grant others access to your digital resources, and you can also revoke that access at a later time. Enter user-controlled data vaults (or "personal clouds"), which respect the rules set in these permission slips. At SpruceID, we believe that a user should also be able to define where their data live by authorizing who can host the infrastructure for their data. As standards for these permission slips (e.g., <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JWTs</a>, <a href="https://ucan.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">UCANs</a>, and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-spec/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ZCAPs</a>) gain adoption, they will be accepted in more and more places.</p> From Single Player to Multiplayer <p>While "Single-Player Ready" applications can be useful (and fun) without anyone else, they are much more powerful when upgraded to "multiplayer" applications, where interaction with others and network effects become very important. </p><p>We can think about how a Single-Player Ready Yelp evolves to be multiplayer. You would begin with your own personal version of Yelp. You can write the most scathing reviews about your experience at your most recent dinner if you want. Your reviews are stored in your personal data vault–your personal space to store all your honest thoughts, where you control access to the information rather than a centralized application. </p><p>From there, you can grant permission slips via digital signing to share select reviews with other "Personal Yelp" instances based on their digital accounts, such as Ethereum addresses, decentralized identifiers, or even email addresses. You can also grant data licenses that allow further sharing to your friends’ friends, which can be used to crowdsource reviews from a trusted circle. If one of those friends or friends’ friends leaves a review you vehemently disagree with or find offensive, you can eject them from your own review system. Because their content is rooted in their digital keys, you can filter out all of their reviews with a single setting - across all other places where they use those keys. You could message them using end-to-end encrypted messaging to deliver the sad news they have been removed from your reviews circle of trust, assuming they haven't blocked you first.</p><p>Single-Player Ready apps have the potential to revolutionize how we interact with online applications and services. They empower users with data portability, freedom from digital lock-in, and minimized control from intermediaries. They also enable impressive user experiences that can delight while maintaining security. The future of digital identity and data ownership is in our hands, and it’s time to take control.</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

<p>Entrust keeps the world moving safely by enabling secure identities, payments, and data. In the heart of Pride month, I can’t help but home in on that first piece – enabling strong identities.</p>
<p>Protecting and enabling identities makes every life possible. When you cross a border, make a purchase with your credit card, or access trusted accounts in your personal or work life, you’re likely using or being protected by Entrust solutions that enable trusted, authentic identities.</p>
<p>If you were to tell my younger self that I’d be out and proud working for a technology company that builds the world’s most critical identity solutions and emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion within my workplace: I would’ve told you to keep dreaming.</p>
<p>You see, it’s hard to describe the profound impact such a simple word like “identity” has on the LGBTQ+ community. Many of us spend years feeling forced to translate our authentic identities into something “acceptable” for the workplace. There is comfort in knowing my workplace values my authentic identity.</p>
<p>This month, and every month, our LGBTQ+ Alliance at Entrust proudly emphasizes the importance of providing a space for our community members and allies to openly express their identity in the workplace, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Since forming the Entrust LGBTQ+ Alliance in June of 2020, we’ve been raising awareness and visibility for our LGBTQ+ colleagues aligned with our commitment to be inclusive of all forms of diversity by:</p>
 
 Offering a monthly meeting for our Alliance members to share stories, discuss important topics within our community, and come together to celebrate our identities. 
 Hosting internal events with authors and subject matter experts on books and topics that exemplify what it means to lead with inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community. 
 Fundraising efforts for nonprofit organizations like <a href="https://outintech.com/">Out in Tech</a> and <a href="https://outrightinternational.org/">Outright International</a> to show our support and raise our voices globally. 
 Partnering with our talent acquisition team to attend events that focus on recruiting LGBTQ+ people to join our organization. 
 Creating trainings like “Becoming a Better Ally” and “Demystifying Gender Identity” more than 68% of our global colleagues taking such courses to date. 
 Working with our global benefits team to ensure colleague offerings include LGBTQ+ inclusive terminology. 
 
<p>Protecting identities will always be a core principle of what we do at Entrust, and I’m proud to be part of an organization that exemplifies how your authentic identity can be safe and secure through impactful engagement efforts. Happy Pride Month!</p>

While there’s still work to do, I’m determined to unlock opportunities for this technology and turn the UK into the world’s Web3&nbsp;centre.</blockquote><p>UK Prime Minister, Rt Honorable Rishi&nbsp;Sunak</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/announcement/expanding-uk-andreessen-horowitz/">Expanding to the UK - a16z crypto</a></p><p>Mattereum has long realised that the “wild west” atmosphere that formerly characterised the Web3 space does not create a sustainable long-term business environment, and that the future of the blockchain lies in it becoming a sober, regulated, practical space that provides real opportunities for business growth. For this to happen, investment is needed, and A16Z’s vote of confidence in the UK’s approach to Web3 shows that important investors agree and want to support innovators in what is fast becoming the world’s most effective location to do Web3 business.</p><p>As part of our commitment to creating the environment where this is possible, Mattereum has worked closely with the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce (UKJT) to develop the <a href="https://lawtechuk.io/insights/ukjt-digital-disputes-rules">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> (DDRR) that allow rapid resolution of blockchain and crypto legal disputes within the UK jurisdiction.</p><blockquote>The theory is to dispel the myth that blockchain is a fringe technology used only by those wanting to risk their livelihoods or possibly make their fortunes on volatile cryptoassets like&nbsp;Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote>The blockchain is now at a stage in its development equivalent to where the internet was in or around 1995. The internet was unstoppable in 1995 and blockchain technology is unstoppable now. It will become ubiquitous in all major industrial and financial sectors, simply because it allows for the immutable recording of data, thereby reducing friction in commercial and consumer transactions and obliterating the scope for dispute as to what has occurred.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Speech-MR-to-Smarter-Contracts-Report-Launch-Lawtech-UK-UKJT-Blockchain-Smart-Contracts.pdf">The Right Hon. Sir Geoffrey Vos (Head of Civil Justice for the UK) at the Lawtech UK Launch Of Smarter Contracts Report</a></p><p>Mattereum has also gone on to be the first company to fully incorporate the DDRR into our business model. Indeed, Mattereum’s whole business model is based on the provision of appropriate guardrails; our Mattereum Asset Passports (MAP) are a unique innovation that provides a legally binding connection between a physical object and the blockchain, enforceable in 172 jurisdictions worldwide.</p><p>This facilitates safe high-value e-commerce on the blockchain and allows AIs to interface with physical objects by providing means to determine that they are not digital fakes. It is clear that putting physical assets on chain is the next growth area for the blockchain and MAPs are already established and working as a technology to keep assets safe and to protect both businesses and consumers from fraud and manipulation. This helps lay the foundations for a future where the blockchain is a trusted technology operating within established regulations and guardrails.</p><p>The decision by A16Z to locate their first international office here is clear evidence that the UK’s approach to innovation and legislation is working. We welcome the Prime Minister’s commitment to making the UK a responsible Web3-friendly business environment and look forward to seeing a further flowering of innovation enabled by investment from Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>If you are working on a project that you think could enhance or be enhanced by the <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> system get in touch with us via contact@mattereum.com</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/mattereum-welcomes-the-arrival-of-a16z-in-the-uk-f82fe8432f5e">Mattereum Welcomes the Arrival of A16Z in the UK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We built an EVM-based game that tests the limits of blockchain development and user experience.</p> Why Build a Blockchain Game? <p>You may wonder why Fission, a protocol engineering company building a decentralized edge app stack, would set out to make a blockchain game. Fission's developer-friendly SDK works for web apps built on the distributed or decentralized web. We want to bring our tools to blockchain dapps, but first, we need to better understand the current limitations for both users and developers.</p><p>Games require a sustained state of flow, so they tend to be very good at highlighting the constraints of a medium — and directing innovation. We feel so strongly about this we believe Block, Paper, Scissors will only be the first of many game-shaped experiments in what we're calling the SLW RK'D. </p><p>The insights we've garnered from building Block, Paper, Scissors have already helped focus our work on some exciting WNFS updates, as well as Filecoin-based endeavours to be announced soon.</p> So, what is Block, Paper, Scissors? <p>Block, Paper, Scissors is an updated take on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. In our version, Block replaces Rock. So Block &gt; Scissors, Scissors &gt; Paper, and Paper &gt; Block. </p><p>But, there are two critical differences.<br><br>You don't play as an individual. You play as a team. The network you choose to play on is the team you've chosen to join. Right now there are three: Filecoin (calibration testnet), Polygon (Mumbai testnet), and Ethereum (goerli testnet).</p><p>The play is asynchronous rather than synchronous. You're always playing against your own team's previous move. To make a move, each player casts their vote on the network. The move with the most votes is the one that is played. Sounds easy, right? Well, the strategy comes in when a player or group decides to break a streak and sabotage the other players' selections — perhaps you hop onto the Filecoin network to sabotage their vote and end their streak so that Team Polygon can take the lead. These networks are permissionless, after all.</p><p>Take a look at this quick demo video.</p> Bringing the Blockchain to the Fore <p>Because we are on the blockchain, and each frame is equivalent to one block, you might say Block, Paper, Scissors runs very slowly. Part of the challenge was not just accepting speed as a constraint but embracing it! It makes the game more reflective of the medium, and it helps to reveal some key points of friction and confusion.</p><p>Block production speed becomes painful as we attempt to use the blockchain for cases requiring a faster turnaround. And because the objective is to get the longest streak, the chain that is the fastest may have an advantage.</p><p>Finality isn't so cut and dry. A move won't be final until it's a few blocks deeper in the chain state. And if something changes, that has rippling effects on the moves that came after it. If there are a lot of outstanding votes, It's hard to be 100% sure what move you are presently playing against!</p><p>The Mempool is another potential source of information — a place where you might be able to detect an influx of saboteurs, for example. But accurately and reliably presenting its state is not a simple task.</p><p>We've constantly been wrestling with how much of the block-building process to reveal and incorporate and how much to abstract away. And in many cases, addressing the challenges above is most easily achieved by introducing centralization, neutralizing a key advantage of using blockchain technology in the first place.</p><p>Ultimately we've opted to abstract many things away and rely on centralized service providers to address many of these concerns. It's the pragmatic move right now. But we believe we can provide truly decentralized alternatives as our own protocols and platforms mature.</p> Key Learnings <p>The blockchain is still quite volatile. The network goes down, and transactions can fail. <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/foundry-forge">Forge</a>, the command line tool we use to test and deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts, has been breaking down as we deploy contracts to Filecoin. Speaking of Filecoin, not many wallet clients support it yet, making game adoption more challenging.</p><p>We hope the game helps to shed more light on the character of block production and how it differs across various blockchain networks. And that it helps identify targets for further decentralization without sacrificing similar improvements to UX.</p> What's Next <p>Help us test! We invite you to play Block, Paper, Scissors while we're in Play Test mode on the three testnets. Once we've seen how it holds up, we'll deploy to mainnets, and the real game will be afoot!</p><p>New features! We were delighted to discover as we built the game that there are other ways to play. Since each move displays a color that corresponds to the selection (Block, Paper, or Scissors), and each color square is placed on a grid, it creates a visual canvas where users can coordinate to draw pixelated frames. We have a feature planned to recognize those who draft a plan for a future game state and successfully convince people to help them execute it. There will be a leaderboard for these A-Team players (because we love it when a plan comes together😉), and the tracker will be available soon.</p><p>Expansion of the SLW RK'D. We hope you enjoy playing our game so much that it inspires you to fork and build your own. If you do, we'll add it to our library of games. This library will be known as the SLW RK'D (Slow Arcade), and we hope it is both educational and fun for everyone involved. We'd love for you to join the effort and build out more games for people to play — on blockchains or any other type of distributed system! There's no wrong way to do it.</p> The Principles of SLW RK'D   Feel the Network: Game mechanics reveal the capabilities and limitations of the networks the game operates on — typically blockchains.  Embrace the Pace: Each game move corresponds to the speed of consensus on that network. For blockchains, each move is at least one block, tying game speed to block production rate.  Casual Participation: Players might track their personal records &amp; scores, but involvement in every block/move isn’t required. Come and go as you please!  Collaborative Spirit: All players and each network jointly determine each move, encouraging teamwork — mostly.  Cross-Network Competition: The leader is decided across all deployed networks.  One World, One Game: Despite the number of networks the game is deployed to or how many participants are active, there’s a singular game state at any time. The game starts once, and…  It’s Endless: With current technology and physics laws, the game’s end is out of sight—unless all deployed networks cease to exist.   Play Block, Paper, Scissors <p><a href="https://blockpaperscissors.fission.app/">Block, Paper, Scissors</a> was created by Andy, an Engineer, and Ryan, Head of Design, and is available now. <a href="https://blockpaperscissors.fission.app/">Give it a spin</a>, and let us know your thoughts on our <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Discord</a>!</p><p></p>

 With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in Germany, what regulations and safeguards are in place to protect consumers and operators? 



 



<p>Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have become very popular in recent years, as increasing numbers of German people invest in digital assets. The rapid expansion of the crypto industry has created an urgent need for regulation to protect the stability of the German financial system and its consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we will explore the growth of cryptocurrencies in Germany, and the need for a regulatory landscape to govern the use of digital assets. We will examine what the current state of regulation in Germany is, and what challenges regulators, consumers and cryptocurrency exchanges are facing.</p>



 Is crypto regulated in Germany? 



<p>In April 2023, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">was passed by European Parliament lawmakers.</a> It aims to protect investors and preserve financial stability, while allowing for greater innovation in the crypto asset sector. It is expected to come into force by the summer of 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a national level, although cryptocurrencies are legal in Germany, they are not considered legal tender or currency. Instead, <a href="https://www.finextra.com/the-long-read/534/understanding-the-regulatory-landscape-for-crypto-assets-in-germany-and-the-eu">regulators classify cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument or asset</a>, which makes them subject to regulations and laws related to securities and investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared with other European countries, Germany has taken a decidedly proactive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, passing a law in 2020 that requires all cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Germany to obtain a license from the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)</a>. This law also established rules for crypto custodians, including the requirement to hold a minimum amount of capital and ensure compliance with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Germany, BaFin is the primary regulator for digital assets and is responsible for the regulation of financial markets and institutions. This includes cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto wallets, and custodians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to the taxation of cryptocurrencies, things get complicated, as they usually do with German tax laws. Cryptocurrency is subject to capital gains tax if it is held for less than a year before being sold or traded. However, if the digital asset is held for longer, it is exempt. Profits from cryptocurrency mining are subject to income tax. If the cryptocurrency is used to purchase services or goods, it may be subject to VAT. Profits from cryptocurrencies of less than €600 per year are tax-free. There is also an exemption limit of €256 per year for income from staking or lending.&nbsp;</p>



 Cryptocurrencies and AML regulations.&nbsp; 



<p>It should come as no surprise that there are strict and rigorous AML regulations that apply to cryptocurrency exchanges and other service providers in Germany. Providers must therefore implement measures including KYC procedures and transaction monitoring to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. An additional measure is to ensure they report suspicious transactions and activities to the relevant authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Providers must also comply with the European Union’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD),</a> which sets specific rules for virtual currency exchanges and custodian wallet providers. It requires providers and exchanges to register and conduct due diligence on their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>German tax residents are required to report their cryptocurrency transactions, including purchases, sales and exchanges, for tax purposes. Failure to do so may result in fines. Cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers must also report any suspicious activity to the <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/Geldwaeschepraevention/Verdachtsmeldewesen/Verdachtsmeldewesen_node_en.html">Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).</a></p>



 Regulation of cryptocurrency trading in Germany. 



<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges in Germany offer a range of trading options, including spot trading, futures trading, and options trading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in Germany are eToro, Bitpanda, Kraken, Binance, Justtrade and Coinbase (Read more about what Coinbase’s recent expansion efforts mean for the industry at large, in our blog: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/coinbase-crypto-winter/">Coinbase commits to European expansion amid brutal crypto winter.</a>) These exchanges offer a variety of trading pairs, low fees, and user-friendly interfaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To buy and sell cryptocurrency in Germany, consumers can use a cryptocurrency exchange or a peer-to-peer trading platform. Cryptocurrency exchanges allow the purchase or sale of the cryptocurrency of choice, which is then stored in a digital wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency trading and exchanges are regulated by BaFin, which requires all <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/blog-de/krypto-lizenz-bafin-erhalten/">cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Germany to be licensed</a> to comply with KYC and AML regulations. Cryptocurrency traders are subject to capital gains tax and must report their transactions in their annual tax returns.</p>



 



 

 



 With great opportunity comes great risk. 



<p>Success stories of Bitcoin millionaires, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/crypto-rues-bitcoin-s-btc-decoupling-from-ai-fueled-tech-stock-gains#xj4y7vzkghttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/crypto-rues-bitcoin-s-btc-decoupling-from-ai-fueled-tech-stock-gains#xj4y7vzkg">decoupling of Bitcoin from the stock markets,</a> and the unstable traditional economy have also contributed to considerable crypto hype in Germany in recent years. Unfortunately, this has also resulted in incidents of fraud rising sharply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem is compounded when first-time investors encounter suspicious crypto firms, that, to the uninitiated, look legitimate. It is only months or years later, after profits have been made in the deposit phase, that the investor realizes he has been taken in by a scam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bafin.de/DE/Verbraucher/Aktuelles/verbraucher_node.html">The BaFin publishes weekly warnings</a> on its website about crypto companies that must cease operations due to legal violations.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the security concerns associated with cryptocurrencies? 



<p>While the underlying technology behind cryptocurrency offers many benefits, including decentralization and transparency, it is also vulnerable to security threats, especially in the German market, where lawmakers and law enforcement agencies are still trying to address the variety of nefarious activities surrounding crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the security concerns associated with cryptocurrency in Germany include:&nbsp;</p>



  Hacking of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets<br>  Identity fraud<br>  Phishing scams or other types of scams, e.g. financial scammers create genuine-looking documents via email featuring a fake balance on the blockchain<br>  Computer infection<br>  Fake deposits of ICOs, tokens or coins on fraudulent crypto or wallet exchanges<br>  Ponzi schemes that use fraudulent technology and deception.&nbsp;  



 Popular cryptocurrency scams. 



<p>Currently, one of the most common cryptocurrency scams is the “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scam</a>“, which uses social media or dating apps to gain the trust of victims, to steal their funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other notable cryptocurrency scams include the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/27/business/bitconnect-ponzi-scheme-satish-kumbhani/index.html">BitConnect Ponzi scheme</a>, whose founder was indicted in February 2022, and the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/co-founder-multi-billion-dollar-cryptocurrency-pyramid-scheme-onecoin-pleads-guilty">$4 billion OneCoin scam</a>, which came to light in December 2016.&nbsp;</p>

 How to keep cryptocurrency safe in Germany. 



<p>One of the most effective ways to ensure that crypto platforms are protected from fraudulent activities is by implementing a robust KYC process to verify customer identity and prevent customers from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">bypassing KYC requirements</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 What is the future of cryptocurrencies in Germany? 



<p>The German government has been working on regulating cryptocurrencies for some time, and in 2019 passed a law allowing banks to hold and sell cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There have also been discussions about new regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs), to protect investors and ensure the stability of the financial system. However, the regulatory landscape is still evolving. As the cryptocurrency market changes, regulation may change as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More and more companies and individuals in Germany are holding digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. According to <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-germany-2022/">a survey conducted by Triple A in 2022</a>, around 4.9 million residents currently own cryptocurrencies.&nbsp; Individuals with an income of €300,000 or more per year hold about two-thirds of all cryptocurrencies. In the coming years, the number of individuals holding cryptocurrencies is expected to increase as Germany as continues to become a more crypto-friendly country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The future of cryptocurrency in Germany looks promising, thanks to increasing adoption and potential regulatory changes that could further boost the industry. The German regulatory framework for cryptocurrency is evolving, with key regulators such as BaFin and the Federal Ministry of Finance overseeing compliance and reporting requirements. Strict <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML</a> regulations are in place to reduce fraud on cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Germany is sometimes known for unnecessary red tape, the country is trying to provide a regulatory framework that creates a supportive environment for the cryptocurrency market while protecting consumers. Nevertheless, individuals and businesses should always remain vigilant and aware of the risks and challenges associated with cryptocurrency and its regulatory requirements in Germany.&nbsp;</p>

 What Is Windows Credential Manager &amp; How Does It Work? 
<p>Windows Credential Manager is Windows software that stores authentication credentials that are used to log in to websites or other computers on a network. </p>
 How Does Windows Credential Manager Work? 
<p>A credential manager stores login credentials securely so that users don’t have to memorize or manage those credentials themselves. More often than not, this means storing usernames and passwords or PINs much like third-party password managers. </p>
<p>The best of these systems operate behind the scenes, creating a seamless user experience while managing a growing list of credentials. Windows Credential Manager does this for Windows users. This tool therefore simplifies the login process while streamlining the user experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0#:~:text=Credential%20Manager%20lets%20you%20view,select%20Credential%20Manager%20Control%20panel.">Windows Credential Manager</a> stores two types of data:</p>
 
 Web Credentials: This software will store login credentials associated with websites and online accounts, working in tandem with a web browser.  
 Device Credentials: The software will also store credentials related to local network resources, including services and shared files and directories. 
 
<p>The Credential Manager encrypts and stores this data securely, and only allows access to users who have the necessary permissions. </p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 Credential Storage: Windows will prompt the user to store credentials when they are entered, creating a link to that resource and the credentials provided.  
 Credential Autofill: Windows will automatically fill in credentials for devices or websites with linked credentials without manual intervention from the user.  
 Credential Management: The manager will allow the user to manually enter, delete, and change existing credentials. While changed passwords will typically be replaced automatically, this gives the user more control over their credentials. 
 
<p>The credential manager uses the Data Protection API (DPAPI), a cryptography system, to secure your credentials. This ensures that only you, as the user, have access to your stored credentials, thereby enhancing security.</p>
 Is Windows Credential Manager Secure? 
<p>Security, in the case of credential management, is a complicated topic. While a system may be secure under ideal conditions, it may not hold up under specific attacks or user behaviors. under others.</p>
<p>Windows Credential Manager has a few components that promote secure credential management:</p>
 
 Encryption: DPAPI is considered relatively secure, using a strong encryption algorithm, typically AES, to protect data. 
 Linked Accounts: The encryption key used by the program is tied to the user’s specific Windows user account. This means that even if someone else has access to that computer, they can’t (technically) decrypt those credentials unless they know the account password. 
 System Password: Access to the Credential Manager itself is protected by the Windows account password. Without this password, no one can access those stored credentials, so if this password (and additional <a>MFA authentication</a>) are secure, then so is the account. 
 
<p>However, like any security tool, it’s only truly secure as the system it is in. That is, if the operating system or applications compromise security, or have been hacked, then Windows Credential Manager is actually not very secure. </p>
<p>For example, the <a>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> database lists several procedures and attacks that can compromise Windows Credential Manager. Some of these include:</p>
 
 LaZagne, an open source tool used to recover passwords on systems. 
 PowerSploit, a set of PowerShell attack modules that allows users to attack and compromise Windows systems. 
 RainyDay, a malicious backdoor exploit tool. 
 Turla, a Russian <a>Advanced Persistent Threat</a> (APT). 
 
<p>That being said, even if systems remain safe from these exploits, it doesn’t excuse users from failing to follow best <a>identity management</a> practices. These include:</p>
 
 Strong Account Password: The security of stored credentials is only as strong as the Windows account password. If your account password is weak or easily guessable, then an attacker could potentially gain access to those stored credentials. 
 Physical Security: with physical access to a computer, a hacker is more likely than not to find a way to break encryption or hack an account password, meaning that they can bypass security.  
 Malware Protection: Malware can essentially work around credential protective measures through techniques like Man-in-the-Middle attacks or keystroke logging.  
 Data Breaches: If user credentials are compromised in a data breach at the site or service for which they were created, having them stored in Credential Manager won’t protect the user. 
 
<p>So while the Credential Manager provides a secure method of storing credentials, it should be used as part of a larger, comprehensive approach to security that mitigates both local and remote hacks.</p>
 What Are Some Drawbacks of Windows Credential Manager? 
<p>Security is a critical issue for Windows Credential Manager, but not simply related to encryption or hackers. This software carries some of the limitations that many system-specific managers have. </p>
<p>Some of these downsides include: </p>
 
 Single Point of Failure: An attacker with <a>credential access</a> to your user account can view or even export all saved credentials. This can be a major problem in cases where an attacker gains access to data that can lead to <a>credential dumping</a>. In this case, they are either all safe or none of them are safe.  
 False Sense of Security: It’s always important to use strong, unique passwords for every account regardless of whether you’re using a password manager or not. This software isn’t a shield against poor authentication practices, nor will it protect you from <a>credential stuffing</a> if users have reused credentials across several platforms.  
 Limited Cross-Platform Integration: This software is only on Windows. If you’re using multiple devices with different operating systems, a third-party password manager might serve your needs better.

				  Why was the internet built without an emphasis on identity or security? Why are we still trying to figure these out 50 years later? What role will AI play in the future of digital trust? Let’s take a brief look at the history of the internet and see what we can learn.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>The first network of networks — the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> — was declared operational in 1971; it was the first thing built that resembles the internet as we know it today. Developed by the Department of Defense, ARPANET was capable of file transferring, remote login, email, and that was about it. Because computers were, at this time, both large and expensive, they were relatively uncommon, and you would likely know everyone who had access to your network. So, no real need for formal trust just yet.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the early 1980s, several national and international networks have been created, one of the biggest launching in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network">(NSFNET)</a> funded supercomputers at several universities and connected them to the network, enabling access for research and academic organizations in the United States.</p>
<p>It was on the NSFNET that interest in international connections grew, leading to several breakthroughs, including the adoption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a> internationally and the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domain name system</a> (before this everyone had to know the Internet Protocol (IP) address of where they were trying to go). In 1989, the first commercial internet service providers hit the scene, and by 1991 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> was available to the public.</p>
<p>Now we have billions of people using the internet, and it would really benefit us to know who is who and how to manage access to private data. But how do we accomplish this given the current scale of digital interaction?</p>
<p>Enter Cryptography</p>
<p>Originally a late addition to email, encryption was developed as the need arose to keep certain sensitive information private. There are two main ways to create encryption: symmetric key cryptography and public key cryptography.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm">Symmetric key cryptography</a> is fairly straightforward. Both parties have a key, or a shared-secret; this key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data and must be known to both parties. An example you likely use every day is a login and password. Both parties know the password and, therefore, can be reasonably certain of the identity using the password and that they can be trusted. Unfortunately, if someone else finds the key, symmetric encryption becomes useless, as now there is no way for the system to tell who the true user is.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public key cryptography</a> is both more complex and more useful for sharing data with a large audience. Through mathematical functions that use large prime numbers, a pair of keys is created. One of these keys is private and is used to “sign” data or prove its origin, the other key is public and is used to verify the source and read the data. One shortcoming of this system is that if people don’t have your public key it doesn’t work, so you need a good way to distribute the key. A few examples of public key cryptography include <a href="https://www.digicert.com/what-is-ssl-tls-and-https">TLS/ SSL</a> (web browser security) systems like Bitcoin, and password managers like <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO</a>/<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Passkey-vs-password-What-is-the-difference">passkey</a>.</p>
<p>Cryptography enables us to do two very useful things: encryption and signatures. While sometimes used together, there is a clear and important distinction. Encryption allows the user to scramble a message so that only a party holding the relevant key can decrypt it; however, there is no level of certainty for the key reader about where the message originated. Signatures, on the other hand, allow you to cryptographically prove the source of data.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> are a good example of a signature in action. When a credential is issued, the person issuing the credential signs the data, and every verifier can check that the data has not been changed since it was issued. This enables the verifying party to trust whoever holds the data the same as if it was coming from the source. These systems are effective at communicating trust however, they are not yet in widespread use.</p>
<p>Signature systems, specifically these decentralized verifiable credentials, are the best solution we have come up with so far for addressing the chronic problem of not knowing who anybody is or where data is coming from on the internet. By ensuring that data is signed by an authority, such as a government, university, or trusted expert in the field, we know that we can trust this data in proportion to our trust in the authority.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the data is signed by a known acquaintance or friend you can be sure it came from that party, as opposed to a bad actor pretending to be them. The internet is ever expanding, with an estimated <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day">328.77 million terabytes of data being created daily</a> (that’s 328.77 billion gigabytes). Being able to rely on the information we find will be critical as our society continues to grow and move toward the digital future.</p>
<p>Living in an AI world</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that is capable of doing some really neat things. Because it is trained to mimic the decision-making process of a human brain, it is very good at certain kinds of tasks: recognizing patterns, such as <a href="https://recfaces.com/articles/ai-facial-recognition">identifying faces</a>, creating <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">strings of words or sentences</a> that make sense, or even mimicking <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">voices</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them">faces or videos</a>. AI has one weakness in that it typically cannot explain why it does what it does, often <a href="https://thenewstack.io/ai-surprises-researchers-by-inventing-new-hide-and-seek-strategies/">surprising even its programmers</a> with the decisions it makes in pursuit of accomplishing a task. But when AI can make almost anything look “real” and can’t really “show its work” for how it got there, how will we be able to trust anything we see online?</p>
<p>The answer will be to implement robust signature systems such as those offered by verifiable credentials. Here are just a few examples of how verifiable credentials could bring trust to AI systems.</p>
<p>For chatbots, the system is typically trained on databases or through scraping websites. If the system was, instead, trained on sets of verifiable credentials, each containing specific data that is signed by the originating authority, then the answers provided by the AI can reference the specific information it came from. Evaluation of those sources can be used to determine what trust to place in the AI-provided answer.</p>
<p>A similar system could be used for voices and videos. The next generation of cameras, microphones, and phones could use software to create a signature at the moment of media capture to provide evidence that the recording has not been altered since the taping. Software that performs light editing, such as boosting audio levels or brightening an image, could also provide a signature across the modifications, ensuring that no significant manipulation of the media occurred.</p>
<p>In short, verifiable credentials could save AI from becoming an engine of mistrust — and provide not only the internet’s missing verification layer but a verification layer able to handle the rapid pace of digital transformation.</p>

<p>The digital age has prompted the emergence of a diverse array of industries, with one of the most prolific being the financial technology <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/fintech/">(FinTech)</a> sector. A notable component of this sector is the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP), which has seen rapid growth and widespread distribution.</p>



 



<p>Interactive map</p>


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 



<p>An analysis of over 1,600 entities that provided terms and conditions on their respective websites revealed a global presence spanning 103 countries. The top ten countries with the most entities account for 55.78% of all countries. The following table demonstrates the percentages associated with each of these countries:</p>

North America and Asia follow, with 12.52% and 21.31% respectively. Other regions such as Oceania and offshore centers account for 3.06% and 13.38% respectively, while Central &amp; South America and Africa are the least represented with 4.71% and 2.26%.</p>



<p>Here’s the representation of regions in a tabular format:</p>

The Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) regulatory framework proposed by the European Commission is set to establish clear rules for crypto-assets and related service providers, ensuring consumer protection, market integrity and financial stability.</p>



<p>More broadly, the data underscores the vitality of the European VASP environment. The region leads globally, with Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) making a particularly strong showing, contributing to 40.7% of Europe’s total VASP representation. </p>

The regulation covers a broad range of activities and services, such as the custody of crypto-assets, operation of<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/trading-platforms/"> trading platforms,</a> and exchange services between crypto-assets and fiat currencies. The regulation applies to both public offers of crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers operating within the European Union.</p>



<p>Given that Europe holds the highest share of VASPs with terms and conditions referring to European countries, the MiCA regulation will undoubtedly have a major impact on these entities. The introduction of MiCA promises a unified regulatory approach, reducing market fragmentation and improving legal certainty within the continent.</p>



<p>Moreover, as MiCA is set to become a gold standard for crypto regulation, it could serve as an influential model for other regions with a significant VASP presence. The adoption of similar regulatory frameworks worldwide would foster increased trust, protection, and stability in the global crypto market, supporting its sustainable growth.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the global landscape of Virtual Asset Service Providers is highly diverse, with a significant concentration in Europe. The advent of regulatory frameworks like MiCA presents a crucial step in recognizing and formalizing the sector’s role in the financial ecosystem. This development not only stimulates further growth and innovation within the industry but also serves as a guiding light for regulatory efforts in other regions across the globe.</p>

 Offering a sign-up bonus is a popular technique by many iGaming operators to attract new players. But is it worth the risk? 



 



<p>In the online gambling world, you would be hard pushed to find a mainstream online casino that doesn’t attempt to entice new customers through bonuses. Offering bonuses to attract and retain bettors has become a staple for new and old brands in the industry, and there is no reason to believe this will not be the case for the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attracting bettors and players is the main reason why sportsbooks and other operators provide bonuses. Players appreciate the chance to play with bonus funds, so seeing appealing offers from sportsbooks makes them more inclined to register.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, while iGaming businesses work toward developing strategies to attract and retain bettors’ interest, gambling fraud proves to be a particularly tricky and dangerous obstacle to overcome. Bonuses themselves are often abused, in fact, it’s quite common.</p>



 Understanding bonuses in gambling. 



<p>Bonuses offered by gambling operators can vary, but typical promotions grant players bonus funds or free spins to encourage them to use their platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonuses are also designed to encourage players to continue betting using their own money when the bonus funds run out. Both parties should gain from a good betting bonus. For example, customers may receive bonus funds to bet with, while operators get to acquire paying customers. Challenges emerge when certain users start using bonuses for malicious activities like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though conversion rates differ depending on the operator, the most popular types of bonuses include the following:</p>



  Sign-up bonus (often with free spins)<br>  Deposit match bonus<br>  No deposit bonus<br>  Reload bonus<br>  Cashback<br>  Free bets<br>  Reward program<br>  Refer-a-friend bonus  



 What is bonus abuse in gambling? 



<p>Bonus abuse involves players signing up to a gambling platform to manipulate the promotion to their favor, unfairly manipulating the promotion incentives aimed at casino players who have yet to sign up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are betting communities that look to exploit such bonuses. This activity goes by numerous names, including bonus hunting and promo abuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering most bonuses can only be used once, this often leads to fraudsters setting up multiple accounts to take advantage of repeated bonuses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fraud terminology, this process is known as multi-accounting. Bettors typically target free bet promotions and bonuses with no deposit requirements, i.e., no deposit bonuses, such as free cash or spins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that only some people who partake in bonus cheating are seasoned fraudsters. Most bonus abusers are regular gamblers who believe they are only ‘cheating the system’, and not venturing into illegal territory. However, there is a sizeable community of tech-savvy criminals who have the resources to utilize virtual machines, emulators, and (simulated) residential IPs, such as mobile networks or Socks5 proxies, to leverage new IP addresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the different types of bonus abuse fraud include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 
  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/chip-dumping/">Chip dumping&nbsp;</a><br>&nbsp;  Collecting sign-up bonuses&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/arbing-in-betting/#:~:text=How%20to%20define%20arbitrage%20in,which%20way%20the%20game%20goes.">Arbitrage betting</a>, a.k.a., arbing&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">Identity theft</a>  
 



 
  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">Money laundering&nbsp;</a><br>&nbsp;  Account takeover&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-to-avoid-world-cup-betting-fraud/">Chargeback fraud</a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/collusion-in-betting/">Collusive play&nbsp;</a>  
 
 



<p>Whatever the type, the process of bonus abuse invariably starts at sign-up. One fraudster (or a group of them) will create as many accounts as possible, a process called ‘gnoming’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They use disposable emails, fake aliases, and fake or stolen credit card information to bypass <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> checks. Once they have created multiple accounts, they then take advantage of the promotion in question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engaging in casino bonus is not illegal per se, but breaking terms and conditions is. For example, all bonuses will typically include terms detailing that they have the right to confiscate any winnings if they suspect the account player to be involved in some form of bonus abuse. These terms can be murky but are typically referring to players who manipulate bonuses to their advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same would apply for any suspicions that the account is being used in a fraudulent manner, such as the account being used by someone else other than the official holder. Fraudsters would be breaking many of these terms if they were to create multiple accounts under other people’s names.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If caught, the user’s bonus money and winnings will be confiscated, and the user’s deposit may also be frozen in their account.</p>

 Recognizing the warning signs. 



<p>To prevent bonus abuse in online gaming, operators must first be able to spot them. There are numerous signs and behavioral patterns to watch out for:&nbsp;</p>



  When the account is fake, there is typically a much shorter period between sign-up and withdrawal or chip dumping. For example, if a newly assigned bonus is instantly lost to a third person at a poker table.&nbsp;  



  Certain games usually attract more fraudsters than others. Games like poker, where players can play against each other and more easily manipulate the outcome, are most at risk of bonus abuse.<br>  Fraudsters use VPNs, TOR browsers, or blacklisted residential-like proxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Understandably, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">KYC and ID verification platforms</a> have become crucial in helping gambling operators identify potentially nefarious or fraudulent practices.</p>



 Techniques used in bonus abuse. 



 Exploiting loopholes in terms and conditions. 



<p>One of the most common restrictions in T&amp;Cs involves preventing players from playing specific games with bonus funds. Blackjack and poker games are usually excluded from bonuses due to their lower house edge. This is because <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/matched-betting/">matched bettors</a> could complete their wagering requirements on an outcome close to 50/50, meaning they were almost guaranteed to make money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While most gambling sites use technology to detect and prevent players from claiming bonus funds on forbidden games, bonus abuse invariably involves avoiding promotional restrictions to play games with bonus money.</p>



 Multiple account creation. 



<p>Most casino platforms allow users to create one account per user, a restriction monitored by the IP address of the device or household used to register and redeem the bonus. Fraudsters trick casinos by signing up for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gnoming-multi-accounting/">multiple accounts</a> via IP addresses, VPNs, TOR browsers, etc. &nbsp;</p>



 Identity theft and manipulation.&nbsp; 



<p>Sophisticated criminals often buy real ID documents on the dark web for use in defrauding gambling platforms. As these documents are not falsified, systems may fail to detect the abuse. Indeed, <a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/synthetic-identity-fraud">synthetic identity fraud,</a> which uses a combination of real-person and fake data to form a new identity can bypass some weak KYC checks.</p>



 The impact of bonus abuse on sports betting sites.&nbsp; 



<p>Bonus abuse is becoming increasingly widespread and costs the iGaming sector approximately <a href="https://www.intergameonline.com/views/a-tale-of-woe-betting-gaming-and-bonus-abuse">15% of its</a> annual gross revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jon Howard, an Essex-based <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2023/04/24/bet365-236k-fraud-plot/">fraudster</a>, was recently imprisoned for five years for his part in various frauds, which resulted in the bookmaker losing over £236,000.&nbsp;This was the first bonus abuse fraud penalty ever seen in the UK.</p>



<p>Howard played a leading part in a syndicate that created over 1,000 bet365 accounts using different aliases to use welcome bonuses and evade deposit limits.</p>



 Responsible gambling measures. 



<p>To mitigate fraudulent gaming activity, operators must deter online bonus abuse. Some operators opt for the removal of deposit bonuses altogether, which is far from ideal, considering gambling bonuses are a sure-fire way of bringing people to a gambling platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other cases, some operators provide loyalty bonuses, rather than sign-up bonuses to discourage bonus abuse. This approach risks alienating the casual, everyday gambler, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many operators also use profiling tools to detect and restrict accounts that are engaging in unwitting cheating or fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must also work toward spreading awareness about the consequences of online gaming bonus abuse. This involves starting initiatives and collaborations among other operators and sharing best practices and helpful information to safeguard the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recently published <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK Gambling White Paper</a>, which details the new approach to the UK’s iGaming regulation, also sets out new proposals to tackle bonus abuse fraud and other fraudulent activities by curbing “bonus” and “free spins” offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonus abuse has also been a recurring problem in Europe, with most countries taking strict measures to put an end to such activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in 2019, Malta-based companies <a href="https://www.egr.global/intel/news/genesis-global-and-ag-communications-fined-for-bonus-abuse-in-sweden/#:~:text=Genesis%20Global%20and%20AG%20Communications%20fined%20for%20bonus%20abuse%20in%20Sweden,-Malta%2Dheadquartered%20pair&amp;text=Malta%2Dbased%20duo%20Genesis%20Global,recurring%20bonuses%20to%20online%20players.">Genesis Global and AG Communications were fined</a> by gambling regulator Spelinspektionen for allegedly offering recurring bonuses to their Swedish player base. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators in other regions of the world have also adopted ways to reduce gambling fraud. With the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gambling-latam/">Brazilian gambling market on the verge of widespread regulation</a>, operators should be concerned about fraudsters looking to take advantage of an immature market.</p>



 Battling bonus abuse fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>As the iGaming industry flourishes, so does the number of fraudsters looking to exploit the system for their illicit interests. As bonus abuse is among the industry’s most significant challenges, operators must seek proactive measures to tackle cybercriminals and their methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides stricter protocols and spreading awareness, KYC and AML checks can reduce bonus abuse in iGaming, combat money laundering, and minimize financial losses.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>IDnow’s user-friendly, efficient, and secure <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">AML and KYC</a> solutions can help with player onboarding, financial risk checks, age verification checks, and more. With IDnow, operators can guarantee compliance with international regulatory standards and curb fraud, such as bonus abuse fraud, without compromising the player experience.</p>


 
 
 
 What is bonus abuse?&nbsp; 
 

<p>Bonus abuse occurs when people sign up for multiple accounts to abuse promotions offered by online gambling operators.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 Are there any legal consequences for engaging in bonus abuse?&nbsp; 
 

<p>If caught partaking in bonus abuse, the user’s bonus funds and winnings are confiscated. They might also have their deposited funds frozen. For punishments more severe, it depends on the technique of bonus abuse. For example, receiving permission from a friend to use their details will be viewed very differently than stealing personal information.</p>

 
 
 
 What steps can online casinos take to prevent bonus abuse?&nbsp; 
 

<p>The steps to prevent bonus abuse include setting more complex bonus terms, lowering bonus payouts, and ensuring the site’s KYC process is as rigorous as possible.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 


 Is bonus abuse worth the risk?

 Bluesky: A Short Overview 
<p>Our digital lives are fragmented — we all maintain profiles across multiple social sites. If you move from one site to another, you have to start over with no history of the friends or content you created there. This is because the original web protocol made it easy to link websites, but had no built-in way to link people and their content, making it hard for people to maintain control over their online identities.</p>
<p>When a centralized platform owns your online identity and is the only host of your content, you’re vulnerable to getting cut off without warning. It’d be like if the city you lived in one day decided to kick you out, and there was no way to move your stuff to a new city and keep in touch with your friends. An analogy for what Bluesky is building is an identity and transport system between cities, so you can move from one place to another and keep your friends.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s goal is to rebuild social so that:</p>
 
 Users own their data and can take it anywhere they want to go. 
 Developers will never get locked out of the ecosystems they help build. 
 Creators will always own their relationships with their audience. 
 
<p>To achieve these goals, Bluesky has developed a social protocol — in other words, we designed a new approach to storing and retrieving information about people in a social network. This is where the “decentralization” part of Bluesky comes in. A protocol is a set of instructions for computers to talk to each other. It creates a set of rules for how your data can move across different services, even ones not run by us. This open protocol is why most data – your posts, follows, likes, and blocks  – is public on Bluesky right now. Making a post on Bluesky is like making a blog post you publish to the web. The underlying protocol for Bluesky is ATP, much like the underlying protocol for the web is HTTP. Our goal was to make social media work more like the open systems that defined the early web, like blogs and email.</p>
 A Network of Cities 
<p>ATP, or the Authenticated Transfer Protocol, is a federated social protocol. Here’s an analogy using cities in the real world to describe federation online: Centralized social platforms are like one big city that everyone lives in, and federated protocols are like a network of cities, of all different sizes. In the federated network, people can move between cities depending on what kind of community they’d like to be in. The Bluesky social app we’re running right now is just one city in a network that will grow over time. The AT Protocol gives you a passport (identity) to travel with, and lets you take all of your belongings (data) with you, enabling an eventual network of cities to interoperate. When we launch federation, more cities (servers) will pop up.</p>
<p>Just as different cities can have different laws and cultures, different parts of a federated network can be governed differently. Systems like<a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation"> composable community moderation</a> can help create a system for governing the different “cities” in the network. In the future, we hope to see many new and different kinds of cities (i.e. other social apps like dating apps or video feeds) get built by users and developers, as well as the bridges and tunnels that connect these cities. With your Bluesky passport, you can travel freely between digital spaces, with the tools to create your own or to curate your experience at home. We believe that the future of social media is co-created and open. Join us!</p>

 Introduction   
<p>Nearly every aspect of conducting business today begins with an act of authentication. Communicating, using tools, interacting with data, processing transactions – all depend on the ability to verify our identity to gain access. Much attention is paid to the consequences of poor authentication security — just check the headlines for the latest breach — but the user’s experience (UX) of authentication also has a profound impact on an organization.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=b7a7dd2c-7826-451f-b282-f8fd5cc8923f&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
<p>HYPR and Vanson Bourne recently published our 2023 State of Passwordless Security Report, which surveyed 1,000 IT and security experts to better understand current perceptions, challenges and trends when it comes to authentication and IAM. In this State of Passwordless Spotlight report, we dig deeper into the findings, focusing on how the authentication user experience affects organizations and their employees and customers.</p> 
<p>This Spotlight report also specifically looks at the impact of UX on financial services organizations. Finance is the top sector for attacks and is subject to rigorous regulations around security and authentication. As such, it frequently serves as a bellwether in the IAM sphere, providing an early look at important developments and trends.</p> 
<p>Key Takeaways</p> 
  
  
   
    
      64%  <p>of organizations say a poor user experience is a major authentication pain point</p>  
      Four  <p>different systems for authentication are being used by employees daily</p>  
      $375/ employee  <p>spent on password-related help desk issues annually</p>  
      39%  <p>of financial services firms plan to adopt or use passwordless (or passkeys) authentication in the next 1-3 years&nbsp;</p>  
    
   
  
  
 Authentication UX Challenges  
<p>Our research shows that organizations face significant challenges when it comes to authentication and user experience. Nearly two-thirds of surveyed companies (64%) cite challenges with user experience as a major pain point in their authentication processes.</p> 
<p>Poor UX not only leads to user frustration and dissatisfaction, it obstructs work, increases costs and actually decreases security because users can bypass certain security features meant to protect the user, systems and data.</p> 
 Productivity Lost to Time Consuming Logins and Lockouts  
<p>There’s no getting around it, login methods that rely on passwords create friction, which only gets worse as security stipulations like long, complex strings, frequent rotation and additional authenticating factors are imposed. In 2024 this will be compounded with PCI 2024 requiring longer passwords.</p> 
<p>There’s also significant time wasted when employees forget their passwords and require resets. Nearly 3 in 10 (29%) of IT and security professionals cite password/ credential resets as an ongoing pain point for their organization . Moreover, around eight in ten (81%) report they’ve been unable to access critical information due to forgetting their password.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Password-Based Authentication Increases Help desk Spend&nbsp;  
<p>Poor UX not only harms employee productivity, it places a significant strain on the help desk support system. Over the last 12 months, 76% of organizations had an increase in help desk requests relating to password resets or other authentication issues. In terms of actual costs, organizations spend 32% of their IT help desk budget on password resets and password-based authentication issues. This breaks down to $375 per employee per year, wasted on password issues.</p> 
<p><br></p> 
 Array of Authentication Systems and Requirements  
<p>Organizations also face challenges from the sheer variety of authentication systems used on a daily basis — four on average. This means multiple, varying sign-on requirements that employees must remember and use, adding friction and frustration in their day-to-day work.</p> 
<p><br></p> 
 A Good UX Is Critical to Security  
<p>Any security control is bound to fail if people don’t use them willingly. Nearly a third (31%) report resistance from employees in using their organization’s authentication technology.</p> 
<p>Resistance frequently expresses itself in workarounds that create security risks for organizations. Employees may share passwords, store password lists on their computers or leave their systems signed in while they are away, some even use tools like a mouse jiggler to avoid having to re-authenticate.</p> 
 Don’t forget IT  
<p>We don’t usually put the IT experience in the UX category but we should. The IT user experience also impacts adoption, costs and security. The survey found that&nbsp;</p> 
<p>56% of organizations face IT-related obstacles in their current authentication approaches, including management complexity (34%) and integration difficulties (31%).</p> 
 Outsized Impact on the Finance Sector  
<p>We already know that the finance sector experiences the most attacks on its authentication processes — 81% for those in financial services vs. a global average of 74%. They also face tremendous pressure from regulations and security frameworks to implement stronger authentication processes to combat these greater risks.</p> 
<p>Most of the regulations currently on the books require multi-factor authentication, which traditionally incorporates a password as one of the factors. This is creating demonstrable friction in financial services organizations. For nearly every UX issue discussed above, the finance sector has been hit even harder.</p> 
  
  85% of respondents in the finance industry report they’ve been unable to access work-critical information due to forgetting a password; 5% higher than the global average  
  The help desk spend on password-related authentication issues is $389/employee vs. a $375 average across industries  
  Nearly half (48%) face challenges in implementing traditional 2FA/MFA due to time consuming login  
  
 Passwordless Authentication Improves UX&nbsp;  
<p>Authentication plays a central role in enterprise digital transformation and almost every other strategic initiative or service. A poor authentication experience can slow or even derail projects so it’s critical to get it right.</p> 
<p>Nearly half of the IT and security (45%) experts name improved user experience as the reason to move to passwordless authentication. A full 86% believe passwordless authentication helps ensure user satisfaction. Benefits of passwordless authentication, specifically FIDO-based (passkeys) authentication include:</p> 
  
  No password resets  
  Faster login speeds: FIDO-based passwordless MFA uses a single, secure gesture for login that is up to 3 times faster than traditional MFA  
  Reducing account lockout  
  Consolidating multiple authentication systems into one  
  Increased employee and customer satisfaction  
  
<p></p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>These findings reveal the toll that the authentication user experience can take on all aspects of a business. Many organizations are contending with significant hits to productivity and their bottomline due as a result of their current authentication practices.</p> 
 Passwordless MFA That Is Built for Users

 As the rise of crypto continues, so does the risk of criminal activity. What can crypto firms do to protect their business and customers from fraud? 



 



<p>Could Satoshi Nakamoto have predicted how profoundly Bitcoin would change the landscape of the traditional financial system when he released his Bitcoin White Paper on October 31, 2008?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that whitepaper, Nakamoto wrote of virtual currencies that use cryptography to secure and verify transactions. He explained that bitcoin miners (or nodes) support the network and provide a way to initially distribute coins into circulation. Since there is no central authority to issue coins the nature of the Bitcoin blockchain lends itself to decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within just a few years of the white paper, so-called cryptocurrencies had blossomed all over the internet. However, because there is no central authority, cryptocurrencies are operated independently and exchanged with a much more limited supervision, mostly through crypto exchange platforms. Since cryptocurrencies provide a high degree of anonymity that is often unattainable in the traditional financial system, it has attracted criminals looking to launder money from their illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the 2010s to modern day, the steady increase in use of cryptocurrencies forced the hand of European lawmakers to devise a European legal framework. With the creation of countless crypto-related businesses and exchange companies, European institutions had to implement proper legislations for crypto activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two legislations were specifically created for that purpose: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto-Assets</a> (MICA) and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti Money-Laundering Directive 5</a> (AMLD 5). Note: As the UK is no longer part of the European Union, UK lawmakers have started work on their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">own proposed crypto regime.</a> In addition to defining clear rules for designated actors conducting crypto transactions, the EU and the UK has also established a set of rules and principles to safeguard against the misuse of crypto assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Newly adopted regulations now require crypto exchanges and custodian wallet providers to implement <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC/AML regulations</a> to better deter money laundering. However, non-compliant crypto platforms are still out there, posing numerous risks to their businesses, and their customers.&nbsp;</p>



 The long and bumpy road toward compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>It’s safe to say that in the early days of crypto, crypto firms were perhaps not as ‘keen’ on transparency as they are now. These days, KYC and compliance measures are top of mind for crypto firms, as operations are now under heavy scrutiny by national and international authorities. Crypto firms must therefore enforce strict screening processes, by ensuring there is a robust KYC process in place to verify customers’ identities, addresses, and source of funds. Monitoring transactions and assessing risks are also part of their requirements. Implementing such measures means processes invariably need to be revamped, or new programs developed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of the arduous road to becoming regulation-ready, many exchanges decide to forgo improvements, and are still operating non-compliantly and without KYC measures in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Criminal actors, whether traditional finance or crypto, are always on the look-out for platforms without proper KYC mechanisms, to gain access and engage in fraudulent activity. Even when crypto platforms comply to the highest KYC standards, some users are still able to circumvent those controls (see our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk">previous article</a>: “Buying crypto without a KYC check? Here’s why it’s risky for both users and platform operators.”). Using non-compliant crypto exchanges can be risky for customers, as they may lose their funds following a mandatory shutdown. On top of that, non-compliant exchanges may not have adequate security measures to protect user funds and personal information. This makes them vulnerable to a whole host of different attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>History has shown that authorities have little patience with non-compliant crypto platforms. In 2017, BTC-e was <a href="https://www.ccn.com/btc-e-users-funds-stuck-in-limbo-as-companies-blame-each-other/">shut down by law enforcement in the United States</a> after it was accused of facilitating money laundering and other illegal activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alexander Vinnik, one of BTC-e’s founders, was alleged to have stolen identities, facilitated drug trafficking, and helped to launder criminal proceeds from syndicates around the world. He <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/btc-e-founder-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison-for-laundering-ransomware-funds/">was later sentenced in France</a> to a five-year jail sentence, after a long and complex legal battle with U.S. and Russian authorities amid an intelligence imbroglio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, crypto exchange platform BitMEX was charged with violating AML/KYC regulations by the U.S.&nbsp; In October 2021, the Seychelles-based company agreed to <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/bitmex-agrees-to-settlement-up-to-100m-with-us-cftc-and-fincen">pay as much as $100 million</a> to resolve charges with CFTC and the Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network.&nbsp;</p>



 Laundering crypto money 101.&nbsp; 



<p>Thanks to weak AML and KYC policies, non-compliant crypto exchanges provide an accessible avenue to launder money, particularly when they offer on- and off-ramp facilities, which facilitate cryptocurrency being exchanged for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp">fiat</a> (government-issued currency).&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-money-laundering-2022">Chainalysis</a>, illicit addresses sent nearly $23.8 billion’s worth of cryptocurrency in 2022, which was an increase of 68% compared to 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dark net marketplaces offer money laundering services, but they are not the only means used by bad actors for laundering crypto. On-chain money laundering mixers help criminals convert crypto from illicit origins, by obfuscating blockchain transactions with a view to masking the proceeds of crime. More traditional intermediaries can also be used to hide the origin of funds for crypto trading, such as offshore accounts and shell companies.&nbsp;</p>



 Most popular money laundering crypto scams. 



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/smurfing/">Smurfing</a>: Large sums of money are split into smaller amounts that are sent through via multiple transactions. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/one-of-darkwebs-largest-cryptocurrency-laundromats-washed-out">Mixing</a>: These services are used to obscure the transaction history of a cryptocurrency by blending cryptos of multiple users.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  Offshore Transactions: Offshore accounts are used by criminals to obscure the origin of funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Exchange Hopping: Criminals also use multiple crypto exchanges to transfer funds across different platforms, thereby making it difficult to trace the money trail.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  Privacy-Oriented Cryptocurrencies: Some blockchains employ advanced cryptographic techniques to hide transaction amounts, addresses, and other information.&nbsp;  



 Preventing money laundering through dedicated regulations and mechanisms.&nbsp; 



<p>In recent years, regulators have stepped up to enforce sanctions toward non-compliant operators in the crypto industry. Between criminal charges and sanctions lists, crypto entities operating either knowingly or unknowingly for illegal actors are now facing increased regulatory pressure and scrutiny. In fact, in 2023 and beyond, taking steps to become compliant with AML regulations should be the top priority for all crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto operators must implement strong KYC/AML mechanisms to ensure they are in full compliance with local legislation. This can also help regulators by identifying any red flags associated with certain transactions. For example, by adopting a layered approach through geofencing, account profiling and identity screening, crypto exchanges can drastically improve their AML/KYC programs. Recent developments in artificial intelligence mean the implementation of such detection tools can help to significantly deter criminals looking to launder money, whilst improving compliance levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The implementation of these robust controls will enable exchanges to participate in the fight against money laundering and contribute to the democratization of crypto currencies, which will ultimately lead to further mass adoption.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC to power crypto adoption.&nbsp; 



<p>Although enforcing KYC measures was a controversial decision for some crypto purists as it appears to go against many of the principles outlined by Nakamoto, they are an important tool for cryptocurrency platforms to prevent money laundering. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to increase, KYC processes have become an essential step in safeguarding the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Non-compliant exchanges will remain a target for money laundering specialists as they offer an opportunity to exploit gaps in controls. Non-compliant exchanges are also at risk from the authorities, which could not only impose major financial sanctions and business closures, but also criminal charges for mismanagement. In short, the existence of non-compliant exchanges poses a threat to crypto firms, crypto customers and the crypto industry itself.&nbsp;</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Institute of Human Rights &amp; Business x Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs  Introduction <p>This blog series aims to present the results of the common investigation project of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="http://ihrb.org">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB) which seeks to explore further the opportunities and barriers to just transition in the built environment in Europe (and beyond). This time, we will look at the urban land ownership patterns; their dynamics, transparency as well as some of the societal, economic and environmental implications.</p><p>At <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, we see this work as a part of <a href="https://medium.com/tag/built-envrionment">our built environment mission</a>. In this area we have been working together with <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/what-we-do">Laudes Foundation</a> on <a href="https://medium.com/search?q=BendNotBreak">New Economic Thinking</a> where we analyzed the deep trends in the built environments in Europe, as well as mapping multiple actors and organizations seen as seeds of hope and opportunity in this space (see: Blog <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">1</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-961744d2cb36?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">2</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">3</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-part-4-89c7683bd2c7?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">4</a>). Furthermore, in the <a href="http://radiclecivics.cc">Beyond Property</a> project, where we are collaborating with a diverse group of organisations including the <a href="http://rockefellerfoundation.org">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/">Berggruen Institute</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society</a>, as well as in the <a href="https://www.radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle Civics: Freehouse</a> demonstrator, we are working on the question of what a world beyond prevailing understandings of property would look like. Last but not least, in the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">Smart Commons</a> we have been demonstrating how public goods create private wealth, and presented ideas about how one could re-balance this equation.</p><p>For <a href="http://ihrb.org">IHRB</a>, this piece of work will contribute towards the project “<a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/building-for-today-and-the-future">Building for Today and For the Future</a>”. The project is developing a collaborative and field-defining agenda for a <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/explainers/just-transition-in-the-built-environment">just transition</a> in the built environment, through deep-dive action research in eight cities, visioning sessions, and regional and international policy advocacy. The work will also open up broader conversations on beneficial ownership as it relates to urban areas, and identify gaps and opportunities for future research. The work is in the context of IHRB’s <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment">Built Environment Programme</a>: bringing a human rights approach to built environment decision-making.</p><p>In follow-up blogs through 2024 we will share insights on the largest public and private owners of land in four European&nbsp;cities:</p>  Copenhagen  Lisbon  Prague  Athens  <p>We hope that this work can not only give insights into the dynamics of different contexts in terms of urban land ownership but also help to support and expand the ever growing community of changemakers who are working to achieve outcomes leading to the just transition. It draws inspiration from ownership mapping initiatives in other cities such as <a href="https://itsmaterial.substack.com/p/who-owns-cairo">Cairo</a> and <a href="https://therealdeal.com/magazine/new-york-september-2018/who-owns-all-of-new-york/">New York</a>. And we will be sharing interviews and insights from urban land-mapping in additional contexts, including <a href="https://cmmm.eu/">”Critical Mapping for Municipalist Mobilisation</a>” which looks at Belgrade, Berlin and Barcelona; and the work of <a href="https://geodevops.org/">GeoDevOps</a> in&nbsp;Kenya.</p><p>We hope that the blog series thoughts will prompt fruitful discussions and questions. We would welcome all readers’ views and critiques.</p><p>Please do get in touch if you would like to contribute: Aleksander Nowak <a href="mailto:aleks@darkmatterlabs.org">aleks@darkmatterlabs.org</a> / Annabel Short <a href="mailto:annabel.short@ihrb.org">annabel.short@ihrb.org</a></p>Fig 1. Initial mapping of urban land ownership in the Copenhagen municipality Land ownership and city-making: what are the connections? <p>IHRB’s <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/framework-for-dignity-built-environment">Framework for Dignity in the Built Environment</a> begins with the lifecycle stages of Land, Planning and Finance, recognizing that these are fundamental underpinnings for all that follows. Urban land ownership patterns significantly influence the possibility of just transition in the built environment.</p><p>1) Firstly, the ownership patterns of urban land can determine access and affordability of housing, infrastructure, and amenities. Concentrated ownership by a few powerful entities and consequent potential single-minded model for development can lead to exclusionary practices, gentrification, and displacement of marginalized communities. In multiple contexts, it has become evident that the shortage of housing is not the only driving factor behind the affordable housing crisis. Even in urban areas where, for example, high density zoning has been systematically applied, the rise of land values relative to building values, is vastly disproportionate. (see i.a. <a href="https://apsc.ubc.ca/news/2022/how-controlling-land-prices-could-help-solve-housing-crisis">Patrick&nbsp;Candon</a>).</p><p>2) Secondly, Land ownership influences the ability to implement sustainable development practices. Owners with a long-term perspective and commitment to place and sustainability may be more inclined to invest in energy-efficient buildings, renewable energy installations, green spaces, or public transportation infrastructure. Short-term, profit-focused ownership may hinder incentives to invest in sustainability, leading to environmentally harmful urban development.</p><p>3) Furthermore, concentrated land ownership can concentrate power and decision-making in the hands of a few stakeholders (public or private) limiting community input and participation in shaping the built environment. Inclusive land ownership models that involve local communities in land co-ownership can empower them to actively participate in decision-making processes, ensuring that the transition is just, equitable, and responsive to community needs.</p><p>4) Moreover, Land ownership patterns can influence economic disparities within urban areas, exacerbate income inequality and limit economic opportunities for marginalized communities.</p><p>5) Consequently, the way land is owned and managed can impact social cohesion and community well-being. Concentrated ownership that prioritizes profit maximization or highly debt driven urban developments without considering social needs can lead to the fragmentation of communities and the erosion of social&nbsp;bonds.</p><p>The project will also provide insights into land ownership mapping methodologies, contributing to a community of practice. The process will contribute to understanding of data transparency and accessibility in different cities. The context in each of them will likely pose different challenges, therefore, a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods will result in new strategies to get the most accurate picture of each of the contexts.</p><p>Contact:</p><p>Aleksander Nowak <a href="mailto:aleks@darkmatterlabs.org">aleks@darkmatterlabs.org</a> / Annabel Short <a href="mailto:annabel.short@ihrb.org">annabel.short@ihrb.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/urban-land-ownership-mapping-towards-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-1-72ff315fefff">Urban Land Ownership Mapping— Towards a just transition of Europe’s built environment #1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What is Open-World Compute? <p>Serverless computing has been promised as the next big thing™ in computing. There are many advantages: not needing to build and manage complex backend code, and granular billing per invocation means that you only pay for what you use. Many of these systems have adopted workflow systems (e.g., AWS Step Functions, GitHub Actions) on top of batch requests. Unfortunately, the systems to date have serious limitations: they’re locked into cumbersome proprietary APIs, have a finite number of integrations, and often don’t handle partial failure elegantly (e.g., can leave a database in an inconsistent state if something goes wrong in another step). Furthermore, many of the compute offerings today lock developers into an ecosystem, making it difficult to switch to other solutions in the future.</p><p>A more principled generation of workflow systems has developed to address some of these problems. They typically depend on the developer writing their code “correctly” and not doing things that make their code repeat work on multiple calls. This doesn’t play well with many common functionalities: what about when developers want to access time or random numbers? They also often don’t handle rollback out of the box. In short: they’re closed systems that depend on the programmer working hard to ensure that abstract properties are respected. This is a real problem: networks can (and do!) fail. Developers write buggy code (we all do it). It’s an extremely high bar.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, brings content-addressed computation to IPFS using Wasm, PKI, and capabilities. IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability. </p><p>IPVM (and Homestar) takes a different approach. Instead of depending on the developer to be careful, it restricts their programming environment. For example, WebAssembly (Wasm) can be limited to deterministic computation: any code that you compile to Wasm has to have these properties that we want by definition. IPVM also acknowledges that failure happens and pulls from recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-m-b-r-o-s-i-a-providing-performant-virtual-resiliency-for-distributed-applications/">research</a> about hiding that as much as possible by leveraging content addressing and Wasm.</p><p>Fission's vision for open-world compute is highly usable and collaborative. We want an open, multitier system that runs everywhere, connects all the world's users and services, and is substantially better than Web 2.0. Anyone will be able to broadcast a task type on the network, and it will be automatically usable without having to fork the project or ask permission.</p> Key Characteristics <p>There are several key characteristics we're considering as we build IPVM. As mentioned earlier, idempotence and determinism are key to reliable computing, but they can be challenging to understand and implement. </p><p>Wasm allows developers to bring their own language, run computations on a server, in their browser, or even on their phone, and run them in a deterministic environment so that the same inputs always produce the same outputs. </p><p>Furthermore, when we run computations with CIDs, the results output more CIDs. The CIDs do not get recomputed and reproduced each time we run them - they are essentially cached in IPFS. When someone applies that same input, it simply calls back that cached result. No new records are being created, making it idempotent. This comes for free on Merklized data, but we can also Merklize data that's read from anywhere and cache it for later use. </p><p>While pure computation is useful for many applications, you still need mutability in many cases. There are queries (reads) and pure computations, and these can go back and forth as long as we end with mutation. Because we are not giving users the ability to define the order of execution, we can reorder computation so that the mutations happen at the end.</p><p>If we bring these three properties together - determinism, idempotency, and purity, we can achieve virtual resiliency. This gives the developer peace of mind, knowing that, eventually, the computations will work no matter what crashes or curveballs are thrown at the system.</p><p>We also want replayability. The cached computations, or receipts, never have to be re-run. And when we need to make non-deterministic requests or work with time of day or random, instead of losing out on the guarantees of deterministic compute and having to use client libraries, the node can call itself, store the information, and run the RPC call. Then if we run it again, we can have replayability because those previous computations were already saved. This creates a "run once, never run again" system, making it more efficient and scalable. Using capabilities based on UCAN, we can determine who can run different computations. Perhaps one job is better for Bacalhau, another for Fastly, etc. Maybe you only want computation to happen on a cluster of machines that you and your friends run and no others. We let IPVM handle the matchmaking and authorization checking so that different systems can work together to complete the job.</p><p>And the best part is this is all happening behind the scenes! The developer doesn't need to set any of this up. 👍</p> Compute over Data Summit 2023 Presentation <p>Fission Staff Research Engineer <a href="https://github.com/zeeshanlakhani">Zeeshan Lakhani</a> gave a presentation on IPVM and his work on the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">Homestar</a> implementation at the Compute Over Data Summit, which can be viewed below.</p><p>Learn more or get involved by joining the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM working group</a>.</p>

<p>The functionality of login credentials changes based on the type of system and its security demands. The type, complexity, and number of required credentials will change in different contexts. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, credentials come in two different forms:</p>
 
 Static: Static login credentials are fixed and don’t change over time unless manually updated by the user or the system administrator. These are easier to implement but are more vulnerable to various threats like phishing or brute-force attacks. 
 Transient: Transient login credentials change over time. Transient credentials are often used alongside static credentials to provide an additional layer of security. Transient login credentials include one-time passwords, session tokens, and the codes generated by hardware or software tokens in <a>multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) systems. 
 
<p>Transient credentials offer enhanced security because even if an attacker manages to intercept or otherwise acquire a temporary credential, it will soon expire and become useless. However, implementing transient credentials can be more complex and require additional resources, such as an OTP generation and delivery system or hardware tokens.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are several different “factors,” or types, of login credentials that play a role in multi-factor authentication:</p>
 
 Something You Know (Knowledge): This factor represents knowledge-based information that the user needs to provide to authenticate their identity. It typically includes passwords, PINs, or answers to secret questions. 
 Something You Have (Ownership): This factor involves a physical device that the user possesses, which generates or receives information for authentication. Examples include a mobile phone receiving an SMS-based code, a hardware or software token generating a one-time password, a smart card, or a security key. 
 Something You Are (Inherence): This factor pertains to the biometric characteristics of the user. It can include <a>fingerprint recognition</a>, facial recognition, <a>voice recognition</a>, or retinal or <a>iris scans</a>. 
 
<p>There are several types of login credentials, each providing different levels of security:</p>
 
 Username/Password: The most common form of login credentials. The username typically serves as a public identifier for the user, while the password is a secret word or phrase (ideally) only known only to the user.  
 <a>Biometrics</a>: Biometrics are the use of unique physical or behavioral characteristics of the user for authentication. These can include fingerprints, facial scans, or voice recognition. 
 Token-Based Authentication: Here, the user is provided a token, or time- or context-specific string of alphanumeric characters, after successful login with a username and password. This token is then used for authentication in subsequent interactions. This form is often used for federated or Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication approaches. 
 Certificate-Based Authentication: This approach involves using digital certificates issued by trusted authorities that verify an organization is who they say they are. The certificates contain cryptographic keys and the owner’s identity, providing trust and security. This is often used in online encryption, such as with the <a href="https://https.cio.gov/faq/">Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS)</a>. 
<p>Each type of login credential comes with its strengths and vulnerabilities that apply to the specific requirements of your business. </p>
 What Are Some of the Threats to Login Credentials? 
<p>While some login credentials are more secure than others, they all face some sort of potential threat. There is no truly fool-proof approach to authentication.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common threats:</p>
 
 Social Engineering: The most widespread form of login threat is social engineering, or approaching users fraudulently to gain access to their information. For example, <a>phishing</a> attacks involve users revealing their login credentials to attackers posing as trustworthy entities. This is often done through deceptive emails or websites that mimic legitimate services. 
 Data Theft: hackers directly attack an authentication database, including hashed or plaintext login credentials. Following this, the hacker has immediate access to the credentials or, if they are encrypted, access to the database to attempt to crack that encryption at their leisure. 
 Brute-Force Attacks: The attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of passwords until they find the correct one. This type of attack is typically only effective on short or common passwords.  
 Dictionary Attacks: In a dictionary attack, the attacker tries a predetermined list of words and phrases as possible passwords. This can be effective against accounts with weak passwords that use common words or phrases. 
 Keylogging: These malicious programs record keystrokes on a user’s device, often without the user knowing. While insidious, these often require either direct access to the system or a larger-scale hack of that system. 
 <a>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</a>: The attacker can intercept data moving between the user and the service they’re trying to access, capturing it and reading it. 
 
<p>These threats underscore the importance of solid login credentials, careful handling of sensitive information, and ongoing vigilance about potential threats. It’s essential to keep systems updated, use secure and unique passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and educate users about potential threats and how to avoid them.</p>
 What Are Some Best Practices for Using Strong Login Credentials? 
<p>Creating and maintaining strong login credentials is essential to personal and organizational cybersecurity. Note that most of these requirements refer to passwords or other changeable authentication methods where the user has direct control over the credentials.</p>
<p>Here are some best practices to follow:</p>
 
 Require Complex Passwords: A strong password should be at least 12 characters long, with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. 
 Update Passwords: Require that users update passwords on a regular schedule, and disallow them from using repeat passwords. 
 Enable Multi-factor Authentication: MFA requires two or more authentication credentials to verify a user. This will typically be two or more forms of credentials across different categories of factors.  
 Beware of Phishing Attacks: Be vigilant about where you enter your credentials. Phishing attacks often trick people into entering their login credentials into fake websites. Always double-check the website’s URL before entering your information. 
 Implement Strong Security Questions: If your service uses security questions for account recovery, these should also be hard to guess. Treat them like additional passwords. 
 Use <a>Passwordless Authentication</a>: Some security platforms will provide ways to bypass the need to re-enter credentials constantly. These passwordless solutions eliminate some of the most common forms of authentication fraud around passwords.  
 
<p>Follow these best practices and you can significantly boost your authentication security.</p>

 DPI is neither good, nor bad but never neutral — governance is the key to achieving the goals of DPI and Digital Transformation <p>The digital technologies that serve as the ‘infrastructure’ of widespread digital transformation are increasingly recognised as key drivers of development. In recognition of the importance of these technologies in enabling development, the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">United Nations</a>, <a href="https://t20ind.org/taskforce/our-common-digital-future-affordable-accessible-and-inclusive-digital-public-infrastructure/">G20</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/digital-public-infrastructure/">WEF</a> and others increasingly highlight the importance of thinking about these technologies as ‘digital public infrastructure’ (DPI), flagging technologies such as the infrastructure and standards of digital identity, payments and data sharing as core ‘rails’ of digital transformation.</p> A technology-only approach to DPI will fail — getting governance right is&nbsp;critical <p>We know from the history of technology and development that technology alone is never a solution — from <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3560107.3560193">e-government</a> initiatives to <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/selling-charisma-circa-2010-the-mit-media-lab-and-its-one-laptop-per-child-program/">laptops</a> the lesson is that technology alone is no silver bullet. If anything, without care it <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1940761.1940772">‘amplifies’ existing patterns of power and inequality</a>. We need to establish governance of digital technologies as a critical enabling layer to ensure all DPIs deliver on their promise, and to ensure a digital transformation that is rights based, protective and inclusive. A framework for the governance of digital technologies can set the rules of the road for all digital technologies — including DPI but also private sector&nbsp;too.</p> Three thoughts on why governance is key to making DPI a&nbsp;success <p>At Caribou Digital we’ve been working on technology in development for a while — from increasing access to digital technologies, supporting dialogue around what ‘good’ digital technologies look like to enabling entrepreneurs to better use technology. Underpinning this work is a commitment to listen and learn from the way technologies are increasingly part of everyday&nbsp;life.</p><p>1. Making technology deliver for development requires institutional capacity and expertise: one form of digital public infrastructure is ‘digital public goods’ (understood as open source software, data, AI models, standards and content). There has been big progress in developing DPGs — there are <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/">150 DPGs in the DPG registry</a>, and <a href="https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2023-04/Digital%20Public%20Goods%20for%20the%20SDGs%20-%20Emerging%20Insights%20on%20Sutainability%2C%20Replicability%20%26%20Partnerships.pdf">DPGs have helped solve real problems</a>. But we know that open source alone is never a solution, and that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401205000393#aep-section-id27">it also requires institutional competency</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/puar.12141">champions</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584918301277">sustainable business models</a>. Without these, <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09593841211232677/full/html">open source software deployments commonly fail</a>. Open source systems also introduce new dependencies — for example on <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/automation/beware-systems-integrator-lock-in-open-source-dependency/d/d-id/754863">companies who integrate new open source technologies into existing systems</a>. In the Philippines, the government has advanced one of the most significant deployments of the open source digital identity platform MOSIP, one of the most developed DPIs — yet the contract for the integrator alone was just under $40m and is <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1514108/psa-eyes-national-id-listup-for-filipinos-abroad-after-may-2022-polls">a ‘crucial’ component</a> of the project. The contract is&nbsp;ongoing.</p><p>Design is key to inclusion: ensuring that DPI meet standards that reflect core values is key — especially around issues such as individual agency, inclusion and protection. We’re currently researching the implications of the design of the EU’s wallet initiatives for migrants, looking at where identity wallets have been implemented — such as <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/estonia-to-trial-mobile-id-app-based-on-ukraines-diia-409191/">Ukraine’s Diia,</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1672385">Pakistan’s Pak Identity</a> or the <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/document/digital-identity-analysis-humanitarian-sector">IFRC’s DIGID</a>. From the humanitarian context we know that many vulnerable populations such as migrants <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/document/digital-identity-analysis-humanitarian-sector">see little value in digital wallets</a>. But while design matters, we shouldn’t expect governments to become technology companies, developing all their own inhouse development capacity. Instead, governments need to be smart customers, with informed procurement practices.</p><p>2. Impact and risk assessment is key: in our research on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-and-management-information-systems-for-humanitarian-and-social-protection-response-b1b25e5623a2">registration and identity systems and management and information systems in refugee and social protection</a>, it’s clear that many deployments lack assessment of impact. For example, while there are broad policy goals of linking humanitarian systems with social protection systems, there are <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2021/6/21/rohingya-data-protection-and-UN-betrayal">widespread concerns about the transfer of vulnerable peoples’ personal data from humanitarian agencies to host governments</a>. While the humanitarian sector has established principles and approaches such as ‘do no harm’ to assess potential danger, there is a <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CWC-Managing-Digital-Risks-To-Refugee-Connectivity-Report.pdf">growing attention to the issue of ‘digital&nbsp;risk’</a>.</p><p>Due diligence and impact assessment tools are key. The UN has established <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/Blog_post_GNI_Blog.pdf">due diligence assessment tools</a> for assessing technology use across the organization. In our work on HR due diligence for tech investors, we developed an assessment tool to support technology investors consideration of rights in their decision making. Impact assessment is key to assessing the design and deployment of a specific system. To address other technologies, systems or wider path of digital transformation, a broader framework is required. A broader framework is also needed to ensure a sustainable, long term solution for countries who wish to manage the range of digital technologies in use within a sovereign jurisdiction.</p><p>3. Governance is the key to safeguarding, protection — and defining the values of digital transformation. A national set of rules of the road for digital technology under a sovereign jurisdiction can set the direction of digital transformation. This can include determining things like procurement rules to establish interoperable, transferable data formats, as well as wider principles such as civic participation, oversight and recourse. With the right rules in place a nation can benchmark systems against agreed standards and rules — and determine whether a particular system meets what we have decided are ‘good’ standards. What should a governance framework look like? Each country’s governance framework will be unique — though it’s important to recognise that its not about new laws/elements but ensuring existing laws are fit for the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>We’re currently working with UNDP to develop a model framework, and in our work so far key elements for this framework include: Legal framework; Capable institutions; Data Protection and Privacy; Policy and system design principles; Facilitating access to services; Procurement &amp; anti-corruption; Transparency and access to information; “Rights, Risk &amp; Inclusion” and Accountability.</p><p>The governance layer enables national sovereignty and interoperability: the governance layer sets out the rules of the digital railroad — ensuring that any digital transformation and technology can meet the goals of DPI. But like a railroad, standards determine whether trains can safely move from one country to another — or not. The governance layer can determine a country’s ability to interact with international partners — such as the digital governance heavyweights of the US, EU and&nbsp;China.</p><p>Governance is key to defining the private sector’s&nbsp;role:</p>  DPI is not just public or government owned tech — financial sector, data brokers and managers.  A sustainable national digital public infrastructure ecosystem requires private sector technology vendors, investors and innovators.  Getting the governance layer right — from data protection laws, procurement regulations and financial reporting — is key to ensuring that private actors and capital can be confident their role and interests will be protected.  <p>These governance frameworks have deeply value laden dimensions — consider the emphasis on individual rights in the EU’s suite of digital regulation (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">DMA</a>, <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package">DSA</a>, <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>) and on national socialism in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/4/13/china-spearheads-ai-regulation-after-playing-catchup-to-chatgdp">China’s AI Act</a>. All <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/117307/">technology systems, regulations and principles</a> reflect values and ideas about the goals that governance is intended to&nbsp;support.</p><p>DPI are technologies — and as such are neither good, nor bad — but never neutral. Governance is the key to determining the impact of digital public infrastructure, and the destination of the resulting digital transformation. Getting governance right will get the right digital transformation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/governing-digital-public-infrastructure-5cd1c985ed22">Governing Digital Public Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, blockchain has emerged as a transformative tool, capable of revolutionizing computational foundations of industries. Among its plethora of applications, one area where blockchain and AI show potential is in the realm of supply chain management.</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2021/10/21/ongoing-supply-chain-issues-are-the-result-of-a-stale-model-heres-why/?sh=63b78c2641e1">Image Source</a></p><p>Ocean Protocol is the privacy preserving, data sharing protocol for data, web3, and AI. The protocol is capable of architecting computational output and a real time data-sharing framework.</p><p>Computation is essential for understanding the world around us. The ability to run computations on sensitive data while preserving its privacy and sensitivity with Ocean Compute is a capability that supply chain and data analysts have never seen. That is, computation on a dataset without revealing the underlying data.</p> Ocean Protocol: A&nbsp;Primer <p>Ocean Protocol sets a standard for digital ownership and access control. OP tools allow people to connect real assets with compute jobs. As humans, we cannot predict the future or guess the aggregate outcome of events…accurately that is. Ocean allows everyone (individuals, industries, enterprise, and governments) to share, monetize, and leverage data while maintaining privacy and control. Ocean’s “Compute-to-Data” feature gives compute access on privately held data, which never leaves the data owner’s premises.</p><p>By leveraging the core functionalities of Ocean’s smart contracts, such as <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/datanft-and-datatoken">data NFTs</a> to represent IP ownership, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-tokens-2-fungible-composable-54b6e0d28293">datatokens</a> to define the rules of IP access, as well as <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">compute-to-data</a> to orchestrate privacy-preserving access to data — users can now build next-generation marketplaces and token-gated applications.</p><p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean-based marketplaces</a> enable monetization of private data while preserving privacy. Ocean brings together open-source blockchain technology, data tokens, AI agents, and advanced access control in a unified, interoperable ecosystem.</p><p>Access to data, computing said data, decentralized data sharing and verifiable time blocks are Ocean Protocol features that outline a foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) designed to enhance and streamline supply chain processes.</p> Decentralized Applications (dApps) in Supply Chain Management <p>Decentralized applications (dApps) are software applications that run on a distributed computing system, like a blockchain (Ethereum Mainnet for example). Unlike traditional web applications, dApps are not controlled by a single entity, providing a level of transparency, security, and efficiency not achievable in traditional, centralized systems.</p><p>In supply chain management, dApps powered by Ocean can leverage Ocean Protocol’s data-sharing capabilities to bring significant process improvement: transparency, traceability, and efficiency. Here are some potential dApps that can be built on the Ocean Protocol for use in the supply chain industry:</p> 1. Traceability dApp <p>One of the most critical issues in today’s global supply chains is the lack of transparency and traceability. A dApp built on the Ocean Protocol could provide a solution to this problem by enabling a transparent, tamper-proof record of product journeys from origin to end consumer (example: farm to&nbsp;shelf).</p><p>Such a dApp could use data tokens to provide access to product data at each stage of the supply chain, including manufacturing details, transportation logs, and quality checks. This data can be shared securely and transparently with all stakeholders, allowing consumers to verify a product’s authenticity and sustainable practices.</p> 2. Smart Contract-Based Automation dApp <p>Ocean Protocol’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">smart contracts</a> library is home to the most advanced smart contract infrastructure available on the web today. Smart contract &amp; blockchain-based structure supports the use of self-executing contracts and AI agents with the terms of the agreement written into code. A smart contract-based dApp can automate various supply chain processes, reducing manual intervention, minimizing errors, and improving efficiency.</p><p>For example, a smart contract could automatically trigger payments upon meeting certain conditions, like the delivery of goods, confirmation to a warehouse, or sale of a shelved good.&nbsp;. This would significantly reduce payment processing times, fees and disputes over transactions.</p> 3. Real-Time Inventory Management dApp <p>Managing inventory efficiently is crucial in supply chain management. A real-time inventory management dApp built on Ocean Protocol could offer a powerful tool for companies to keep track of their inventory in real time, helping to minimize storage costs and prevent stockouts or overstocking.</p><p>This concept dApp can use IoT devices to collect data on stored goods and share it on the blockchain. Stakeholders could access this data using data tokens, providing a real-time, accurate view of inventory levels.</p> 4. Data-Driven Demand Forecasting dApp <p>Understanding and predicting demand is vital for successful supply chain management. A dApp using Ocean Protocol’s data-sharing capabilities could aggregate and analyze data from various sources to provide accurate, data-driven demand forecasts.</p><p>This could include historical sales data, market trends, social media sentiment, and more. Companies could access these insights through data tokens, enabling them to make more informed decisions about production and distribution, reducing waste, and improving customer satisfaction.</p> Ocean Protocol: Blockchain x Supply Chain dApps built&nbsp;Today <p>One example of a supply chain initiative inside the Ocean Protocol Ecosystem is <a href="https://www.transportgenie.ca/">Transport Genie</a>: who aims to make it possible to transport animals humanely through AI powered smart sensors, whilst monitoring livestock from farm to their next destination. Transport Genie offers real-time alerts and uses blockchain technology to keep a digital twin record of activities throughout the transportation value&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.transportgenie.ca">https://www.transportgenie.ca</a></p> Conclusion <p>Ocean Protocol’s decentralized data sharing and compute to data framework offers fertile ground for developing dApps that can revolutionize supply chain management. By providing a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for data sharing and decision making, Ocean Protocol can help the supply chain industry overcome its current challenges and pave the way for a more sustainable and efficient future.</p><p>These use cases of Ocean Protocol highlight the transformative power of combing blockchain, AI and cryptocurrency in reshaping traditional industries.</p><p>From ensuring transparency and traceability to automating processes and enabling real-time inventory management, these dApps could revolutionize the way we manage and monitor supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>The use of data tokens to access shared data can create new economic models within the supply chain, providing incentives for data sharing and collaboration. This can lead to the democratization of data, where every stakeholder in the supply chain, from producers to consumers, can benefit from shared information.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>We’ve all had terrible login experiences. You sign into an app, only to realise you have to log in again to access another system on the same journey, and often supply personal data that you’ve already supplied. It’s frustrating, and doesn’t exactly create a positive impression of the brand – especially as sign up/login is right at the start of the user journey, setting the tone for the continued experience.</p>
<p>Clunky customer experiences lead to abandoned service sign ups, fewer returning users, fewer word of mouth recommendations, and – perhaps worst of all – security risks. When access to a service is complex, users tend to cut corners when it comes to credential management. For example, they may reuse a common password out of “credential fatigue” – a practice that risks data breaches when hackers try credential stuffing. Not to mention the security risks that come from internal workforce inefficiencies when managing several accounts/data silos per user.</p>
<p>It is a far more user friendly and secure experience for users when you offer one simple login to your organisation’s apps and services. The options within this area are varied, and will be tailored to your systems and requirements, but a great place to start is single sign-on (SSO).</p>
 One login with single sign-on (SSO) 
<p>Users want simplicity when it comes to access to your services. Single sign-on is key to achieving it. SSO lets your users log in once to authenticate to all permitted services and apps. This means that moving between different services is transparent, without the need to have multiple accounts and credentials, or input the same data multiple times.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Single sign-on also means single sign-out. Once the user has logged out, or had their account revoked, you don’t need to worry about forgotten access/logged in sessions presenting a security risk.</p>
 Customising SSO 
<p>You might be thinking that SSO sounds simple enough, but what about your unique (sometimes complex) business requirements. Can SSO still simplify your user journey?</p>
<p>Perhaps you have some of your services based on external systems. In these cases, Federation allows single sign-on between two security domains, so you can still reap the benefits of SSO.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of your systems contain more sensitive data than others. You might want to have more assurance over the identity of the user for these areas – likely requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) – but without requiring this step for more basic services. A great solution to these cases is <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/what-is-step-up-authentication/" title="Step-up Authentication">Step-up Authentication</a> – still using SSO with your usual level of authentication, then asking for further verification only when the user is accessing the more sensitive system(s) or completing a higher risk transaction.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have the same users accessing your systems in different contexts – e.g. as a private individual, but also in their work role. With the right identity solution, you can choose to authorise one account to have different permissions depending on the context in which they are accessing the account. For example, where a user may have permission to purchase something on their own behalf, they may not on behalf of their company. So, again, you can still take advantage of SSO and only requiring one account per user.</p>
 How to implement SSO 
<p>SSO is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) staple capability, and can usually be implemented quickly and easily – particularly when installed as part of a SaaS or hybrid cloud/on-premises IAM solution.</p>
<p>Many organisations who are looking to simplify their user journey get started with SSO from an IAM solution stack, which gives them the option to add on further functionality when required. For example, if the user base grows or needs become more complex later on, additional capabilities from the IAM solution stack may be added on. The key here is to choose a flexible solution that will evolve with your business.</p>

<p>In her CoD Summit 2023 presentation, Fission co-founder and CTO Brooklyn Zelenka discusses the need for location-independent compute, and how content addressing and open protocols are making it possible.</p> We're Living in a Server-Centric World <p>Since the invention of the LAMP stack in the '90s, we've been working with a server-centric model. It has led to developers specializing in front-end, back-end, DevOps, Kubernetes, Docker, and more. &nbsp;Over the years, it has become more difficult to train and maintain this complex system.</p><p>Amazon, Microsoft, and Google control the majority of data centers, which has led to further centralization. In places like South America, Central America, and Africa, the lack of compute infrastructure means that users in these areas have less access to resources.</p><p>IoT, compute over data, and LLMs cannot work long-term if we keep sending data to a small number of data centers. It's an overwhelming, massive amount of data. &nbsp;</p><p>We have to bring compute to where the data is produced, closer to the user.</p> Building a New Compute Stack <p>We know we need location-independent compute and data, but to do this in production, you first need location-independent auth.</p><p>A capability-based model like <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-ucan-decentralize-auth/">UCAN</a> removes the authorization server, simplifying permissions handling. We no longer need pristine APIs for everything and can pass around auth as necessary.</p><p>The direction and the layout of the requests become the flow of authority.</p><p>Not only is it more efficient and energy-saving, but it's also more resilient because there is no central server that can bring the rest of the network down if it goes offline.</p><p>Now that auth is handled, we can solve for location-independent compute.</p><p>We started with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> because you can write in any language you want, and it runs anywhere and deterministically. </p><p>When running a computation, we take arguments and apply them to a Wasm function. This outputs a <a href="https://proto.school/content-addressing/04">CID</a> or content identifier. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. </p><p>This means we can compute over that content-addressed data without needing a centralized server! &nbsp;</p><p>We can roll all of this and a scheduler up into a task and run it, and when it executes, it returns a receipt. The receipt includes pure values (EX: 1 + 1 = 2), effects (something you want to happen next that needs to take resources off the network, like sending an email), and metadata.</p> Input Addressing <p>With content addressing, we take data, hash it, and use that data as the key value. </p><p>Here, we're introducing input addressing, where we get a receipt as the value, and the input is the hash of the instruction (the description of what you want to have run).</p><p>Instead of validating with a hash, we validate with a receipt, making it fully deterministic!</p><p>Finally, we use an invocation (a signature) and build a workflow (by authorizing multiple computation requests at once). </p> Benefits of Wasm Compute   The distributed runtime can decide the most efficient way to run tasks in the network by handling the matchmaking for the user.  The more returned receipts, the fewer computations we'll need to run. We can skip steps and reuse receipts because they've been deterministically run already. &nbsp;  If the system crashes, you can always pick up where you left off by following the CID trail.  Reverse lookup allows the user to check if a certain input ID has been entered. If it has, they can retrieve the computed result without running the task again. This is especially helpful when running AI language models over the same data or cryptographic operations.

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The words “blockchain” and “energy” usually make uncomfortable reading as people think of the <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/05/04/cryptocurrency-energy/">outsized</a> energy and environmental costs that come with using cryptocurrencies; recently, however, blockchain technology is being seen — and being adopted — to do the opposite and drive sustainability in the energy industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a recent article in Finance Magnates <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/the-use-of-blockchain-technology-in-the-energy-industry-to-promote-sustainability/">reports</a>, blockchain is driving sustainability initiatives “by improving energy traceability, facilitating peer-to-peer energy trading, streamlining supply chain management, and decentralizing energy infrastructure.”</p>
<p>It all makes for fascinating reading; but, we draw attention to it mostly because it’s a timely reminder that not all blockchain is crypto, and that distributed ledger technology can be used to do lots of beneficial things without using much energy at all, let alone draining the grid.</p>
<p>Simply put, the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x">energy intensive computation</a> required to validate bitcoin transactions — known as “proof of work”— is unique to that activity; other uses of a blockchain, such as to support verifiable credentials for decentralized identity, do not.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
 
 A distributed ledger for identity uses signatures rather than mathematical computation to generate proof. No complex mathematical processes are needed. You either accept the signature or you don’t. 
 A write to the ledger (and one write can be the basis for millions of identity credentials) or a look up on the ledger uses no more energy, and possibly less, than browsing a web page. 
 A decentralized network using a blockchain-based distributed ledger means you can use <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DIDs</a> to move most “transactions” and their cryptographic proofing off the ledger. As no personally identifying information is written to the public ledger identity blockchains don’t need to do any ledger transactions at all. 
 
<p>Although harder to quantify, the energy saved from using a technology that enables you to trust information is also something that should be taken into account. You can build seamless, frictionless processes to take advantage of data that can immediately be verified and acted upon. This is what is happening in the energy industry use cases described in the Finance Magnates article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this saves time and money and mitigates error and fraud. So remember, when you hear the word “blockchain,” it’s not just about bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Give consumers a priceless asset: more time. Endless errands, work tasks and countless obligations big and small chip away at their free time and fill their schedules. Applying for a loan shouldn’t add to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To power a faster, better mortgage experience for consumers,&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">Freddie Mac’s Loan Product Advisor&nbsp;asset and income modeler (AIM)</a>&nbsp;continues to evolve, now including paystub data in addition to direct deposit data for income assessment. These cost-saving efficiencies provide increased rep and warrant coverage while continuing to meet Freddie Mac’s strong credit underwriting standards.</p>



 Open banking drives new mortgage capabilities 



<p>Using consumer-permissioned data from trusted third-party providers like Mastercard (with some services delivered through Finicity, a Mastercard company), direct deposit plus paystub increases the confidence in income calculations by matching digitized paystub data to borrower direct deposit history sourced from trusted providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Mortgage Verification Service</a> (MVS)&nbsp;supports this new AIM capability by providing direct deposit transaction data paired with digitized paystub&nbsp;data to fuel this innovative, data-driven approach. It identifies&nbsp;the income stream that matches the paystub, delivering accurate risk assessment results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assets, income and employment verifications are vital to mortgage lenders looking to verify borrowers’ finances. However, between unreliable results, miscommunications and paperchases, verifying assets, employment and income can be cumbersome. MVS helps borrowers get faster approvals with fewer conditions up front, allowing them to close and move into their homes faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“Partnering with Mastercard ensures we can deliver the best tools and insights the industry has to offer. This collaboration will assist lenders with quickly and easily obtaining income verification.”</p>Daniel Miller, Freddie Mac Single-Family Director of Strategic Technology Partnerships</blockquote>



<p>MVS can help lenders:&nbsp;</p>



 
 More easily assess borrower capacity/automate income calculations.&nbsp; 



 Reduce frustrations caused by paper submissions and re-asking for documentation to verify assets, income and employment.&nbsp; 



 Remove subjectivity and manual&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/docs/pdf/digital-innovation-drives-loan-quality.pdf">errors in processing and underwriting</a>.&nbsp; 



 Lower risk and probability of fraudulent activity.&nbsp; 



 Increase referrals by providing a better borrower experience.&nbsp; 
 



 Efficient assessment&nbsp; 



<p>AIM leverages consumer-permissioned data from open banking providers like Mastercard to better identify pay deposits using accurate and verifiable data that meets Freddie Mac’s underwriting standards. Lenders can automate the manual processes of assessing borrower assets, income and employment. This can improve the success rates for identifying income and employment by reading information provided on a paystub and verifying income transactions within a borrower’s bank account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Partnering with Mastercard ensures we can deliver the best tools and insights the industry has to offer,” said Daniel Miller, Freddie Mac Single-Family Director of Strategic Technology Partnerships. “This collaboration will assist lenders with quickly and easily obtaining income verification.”&nbsp;</p>



 How it works&nbsp; 



<p>Previously, direct deposits to a consumer’s bank account would qualify for rep and warrant assessment. With enhanced direct deposit and paystub capabilities, a borrower or a loan officer can upload a paystub and the technology will match the data on that paystub with the deposits from the borrower’s asset report, boosting the rep and warranty success rates and income gross-up.</p>



<p>The asset report can include 24 months of direct deposit transactional history and also includes income streams identified by the open banking platform. Now, with the added paystub capability, Mastercard can add a paystub report that can provide greater success assessing income through direct deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paystub report generated through MVS has two sections; the top section includes digitized paystub information. The bottom section is up to 24 months of income stream credit transactions only. These income streams are reconciled with the deposits shown on the asset report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an added bonus, the reduced cost of implementing MVS is reflected directly in the balance sheet. On average,&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/docs/pdf/digital-innovation-drives-loan-quality.pdf">up to 7&nbsp;days</a>&nbsp;can be cut off the processing time for each loan. The hours formerly spent by loan officers chasing down borrower documents are invested in higher-return work activities such as marketing and sales to drive additional loans.&nbsp;The new AIM capability will be available to Freddie&nbsp;Mac-approved Sellers using Loan Product Advisor beginning June 7, 2023.&nbsp;MVS is available via direct integration and ecosystem integrations including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com">ICE Technology</a>&nbsp;and Order Reports Service in the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/client-hub/">Client Hub</a>&nbsp;today. </p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us on new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity and I’m super happy to bring a former guest back, she is joining for the second time. One reason is that there has been released, super interesting results on her research. Especially in a vast country like Canada.</p>
<p>So, our guest today is Joni Brennan. She is the president of the Digital I.D. and Authentication Council of Canada, DIACC. Building on more than 15 years of experience in identity and access management, innovation adoption and industry standards development. Joni helps the DIACC to fulfil its vision by delivering the resources needed to establish a digital identity ecosystem that accelerates the digital economy, grows Canada’s GDP and benefits all Canadians.</p>
<p>Joni builds diplomatic and impactful relationship and formalises strategic partnerships. She has participated in influential committees from organisations including SCC Data Governance Initiative, OECD, IEEE, OASIS, the ISO, among others.</p>
<p>Hello, Joni.</p>
<p>Joni Brennan: Hello, Oscar. Great to be back.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, welcome back. Super nice having you. So again, we are here to talk about digital identity. Even though some of our listeners might have heard you before, I think four years back. Please tell us about yourself and this journey that you have to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Joni: Well, thank you so much for the invitation. In terms of my personal journey in the world of digital identity, I think it’s been just a bit over 20 years now, working in this space. And really starting in the, and all of this career, in the non-profit sector. Working with private sector and public sector, helping to develop standards and frameworks. Particularly focusing on risk management frameworks now, that help to contextualise the way that standards and open source have been implemented. To help to manage risks and help decision makers and adopters to make better decisions about which kinds of solutions they would like to adopt.</p>
<p>So, it certainly has been a journey moving from classic identity federation and single sign on now to web3 and distributed ecosystems. So, there are some things that have changed, but then there are also some core foundational concepts and thematics that have stayed the same. It’s great to be here to discuss the topics with you today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. As I said, one of the main reasons to discuss is that there is a very interesting report. Actually, I have it here in front of me, it’s the – title; Canadian Digital Identity Research 2022. Of course, I am sure it has taken a few years to gather and process all this information. It is a very nicely designed document and also many of those findings were like, ‘Wow’. Super interesting how things are going in Canada and I’m sure some of these findings will be similar in some other countries as well.</p>
<p>So, we’d like to hear more deeply a few of these findings and what we can learn. If we start telling us some of these key findings from this report.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, thanks so much. I find the research to be interesting as well. The research – we’ve developed four consecutive years now of research, and so the latest report is the data from 2022. So, some things that are interesting about that, as well, is that we began to perform this research; before COVID happened, during COVID, and now arguably, I would say post-COVID or the next phase. So, it’s been interesting to see both kind of how the space is developed and how people’s perceptions have developed over that period of time. </p>
<p>One of the reasons that we’ve done this research is that we found that in the Canadian ecosystem there wasn’t this kind of ‘perspectives research’. We spend a lot of time working together as practitioners, whether we’re working with policy, technology or business processes. We’re often speaking with practitioners that are in the space. So, to have the opportunity to better understand and quantify the perspectives of people, who may not be practitioners. Maybe they do understand the space, maybe a little bit, maybe not so much. So, to have the ability to have a better perspective on what people are thinking, about the work that we’re doing, this is very valuable. And of course, putting people at the centre of the work that we do is a priority. So having these perspectives is quite important.</p>
<p>Because we’ve done this research annually over the course of four years. What we have done as well as we’ve asked some questions each year to have baseline, to have trend lines. To know, how has the perception changed, year over year, over the course of four years? Or maybe that perception has not changed, maybe it’s stayed the same over the course of four years. So, we’ve seen that timeline. That’s been an interesting feature. And then each year we have also customised some of the questions. So that, we could ask the questions of the participants that were, maybe, more specific to what was happening in the world at that time. So, I think it’s a great opportunity to see what people are thinking, both at a point in time and in over time.</p>
<p>Now, how did we perform the research? Well, the research has been developed through a third-party research firm, so they manage the sample, the participation sample. To make sure that it has diversity and that it’s really asking questions to Canadians across our country, from one side to the other. As well as, we have two official languages in Canada, French and English, so as well as making sure both official languages have been consulted. So, we’ve had some regional findings as well, as we’ve gone forward.</p>
<p>With that, maybe I’ll share some of the key findings from the survey.</p>
<p>So, what I would say is that when we started this survey four years ago, this research. We asked people, first of all, do they understand the words ‘digital identity’? And I can say that for the first three years, people did not. Less than half felt that they had somewhat understanding of the words ‘digital identity’. So, without assistance, they could produce a kind of, a definition of digital identity. Now, last year, the fourth year of our research, for the first time, we’ve seen more than 50% feel that they have some understanding of digital identity without being assisted.</p>
<p>So, while the findings, I would say, are arguably low. Meaning less than 50% had some understanding for years, one, two and three. There is a sign that education, and knowledge, and awareness has been growing over each year. Now with just over half understanding. So, it’s a good trend line, meaning that education and awareness has grown. So, I think that’s interesting. It also helps us to know what kind of language we should be using when we’re speaking with people, what they might understand or where more education.</p>
<p>Now, this year we also saw in 2022, we also asked people what was their perception of the impact that digital identity could have on their lives. And I think positive news, the impact more than 55% of respondents felt that digital identity had a positive impact on their lives. And really, this was to manage records, to be able to have electronic boarding passes, things that were really around convenience and doing business anywhere and everywhere. So, this is great news. So, people feel that there is a positive impact, more than half.</p>
<p>Now, that said, 23% do remain unsure about the type of impact that digital identity has on their life. And so now we see that the 23% this is a group that we need to focus on. So, they don’t know if digital identity will help them or if it will harm them. So, there we see – okay, this is a place where we can educate that 23% on; What are the privacy impacts? What are the security impacts regarding digital identity? And how can that improve their lives for the better? So that’s a place to spend some time for education.</p>
<p>Now, the remainder felt that digital identity had a negative impact on their lives. And we do know, of course, people are free to have perceptions, positive, unsure, negative, as they so choose. But we do know as well in the Canadian ecosystem, there has been quite a bit of misinformation and disinformation, mal information. And primarily that type of information is moving in what I would call unauthenticated spaces. So, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, places where information can become viral and sometimes that information isn’t verified. Sometimes it’s being spread by mistake and sometimes it’s being spread with bad intent. So, we know that that’s been a challenge in the Canadian ecosystem and that maybe part of the group that feels a negative impact in their lives.</p>
<p>So, our focus will be on the 23%. To help them to better understand the space so that they can make better decisions about their perception of the type of impact that digital identity can have on their life.</p>
<p>Now, we have also seen, year over year, for four years, we’ve collected some demographic information about the types of people who are responding, and the types of people who are most interested, and feeling the benefits most, and most interested to use digital identity or most interested to also learn more about digital identity. And year over year, the people who are most interested and most looking forward to the benefits that digital identity brings are what we call the caretakers. So, the caretakers tend to be parents who are taking care of children alone or dependents in their home. So, this could also be senior caretakers. Whether they’re in the home or outside of the home. So, these are people who are taking care, really caregiving in all aspects of their life as well as taking care of themselves.</p>
<p>So, these people have the most interest to use digital identity to help to manage their care, so primarily tracking health care records and school and government registrations, for example. These are seen as the primary benefits. And these are the people who are most feeling pressure to manage data, to manage access to data, and really need that extra help, that these types of technologies can provide people. The conveniences and the security that can provide people in their life. These are the people that I think is a great area of focus for the work that we do. Caregivers are also workers. Caregivers are also students. And so, in all aspects of their life, they feel that this is something that can help.</p>
<p>In the Canadian ecosystem as well, we do have some, what I would call paradoxes. Meaning we do also each year, year over year, ask people their willingness to share personal information online if it makes their life more convenient. And what we’ve seen over time is there has been a slight rise in people’s willingness to share their personal information. And so, for example, in 2021, 75% were willing to share information, personal information for convenience. That went up to 78% in 2020 to be willing to share personal information if it meant that they would have more convenience in their lives.</p>
<p>Now, that said, again paradoxically. The same amount of people just around 75% between 73 and 75%, also having the highest concerns about personal information being compromised. So, yes, while people are willing to share information for their convenience. They’re equally concerned about their information being compromised through identity theft or through hacking and through other means. So, we need to be aware that people are both feeling the desire for convenience, but they’re also very concerned along the way.</p>
<p>So, when we think about that 23%, again, who are unsure about digital identity. We can help them to better understand where digital identity can help people to manage their information and get convenience while protecting themselves online. I would say that this is a paradox, but also something that we can help. And we can support by working together with more education.</p>
<p>Now, year over year, for four years, we have also asked people about their preferences regarding the way forward on digital identity. So, what we’ve asked them is basically three options. Would people prefer public sector and private sector to work together on a framework? On an approach, a collaborative approach of public sector and private sector. We’ve also asked them would they prefer government to move alone and take the lead? Or would they prefer private sector to move alone and take the lead?</p>
<p>And I can say that year over year and in fact, we’ve seen growth to 71% of respondents. They believe that collaboration is the best way forward of the public and private sector. And their thoughts on that for why is because they felt that public sector and private sector, by working together, would have more checks and balances on each other. To make sure that each was behaving with the best interests of the client, the customer, the citizen. They really like that collaborative approach, and that’s grown over time up to 71% in the last year.</p>
<p>Now, typically year over year, the people who prefer only government to take the lead or only private sector to take the lead has been a bit of a split. Tends to be around 17% wanting one or the other to go the pathway alone. And in this year, this last year we actually saw a little bit of a change in that research where, for the first time, the preference for public sector was private sector.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of a lower preference this last year for public sector to go alone. So, the finding was 12% prefer the government only to take the lead, with 17% preferring that private sector only take the lead. And I think this is actually – if people have reviewed the Edelman’s Trust Barometer and trust overall as a trend globally in the public. There does seem to be an erosion of trust in large institutions and in new technologies as well, we should say. So, seeing the trust in government a bit lower this last year, I think maps as well with the global trending lines that we’ve seen in the Edelman Trust Barometer research as well. So not entirely surprising and common with what we’ve seen around the world.</p>
<p>Now, unsurprisingly, we’ve also since as we started, we’ve done this research before COVID, during COVID and now post-COVID ecosystem. And while we were in the middle of the pandemic challenges, we asked people if the requirements of the pandemic made people feel that it was more important for them to have access to digital identity that was secure and trusted and privacy enhancing. And people felt absolutely, 66%/67%, over the two years that we asked that question. People thought; Yes, COVID was driving a need for that secure and privacy enhancing digital identity capabilities. So, of course, we think about working from home and social distancing, so people absolutely connected the benefits of digital identity with the things that we were going through at the time.</p>
<p>We also have asked some questions, and I’ll share actually what I think is one of my favourite findings right now. And then we’ll talk a little bit more about some specific capabilities. But I think for me my favourite finding over the last two years has been we asked people ‘do they want to have access to personal information that’s issued and collected about them by public sector and private sector, and do they want the ability to use that information?’ So, we’ve asked that question for two years now, and actually we’ve seen the highest numbers we’ve ever seen on our research over four years regarding this question.</p>
<p>And so, people responded overwhelmingly, 92%, that they want to know and have access to data that’s issued and collected by our federal government and by our provincial or jurisdictional governments in Canada. And so, what this says to me is that – while the words ‘digital identity’ are challenging for people to understand. What exactly does this mean? When we asked people, do they want personal data control and transparency right away without a lot of education, very high number, 92% want to have access control to personal data.</p>
<p>That was followed very closely by 87%. So, they want that same access and control, 87% of data that’s collected by the private sector. So, I think, again, right away, emotionally, people understand personal data control. It’s something they demand no matter what their background, their culture, their politics, their region. Everyone wants to have transparency and control to data about themselves. So, I think that’s just a fantastic finding. And rarely have we ever seen in fact, never have we seen numbers that high in our research.</p>
<p>Now, I share this finding because I think it very much sets up some specific capability finding around digital wallets, something that’s an emerging space. So, whether we’re thinking about the concept of the digital wallet or a trusted container of some sort. Over the last two years, we’ve asked questions specifically about digital wallets, concepts around digital wallet to work. There’s a degree of personal information sharing and personal information control that has to happen. So that’s why I wanted to set that up with that primary finding.</p>
<p>So, over the course of the last two years, we have seen the familiarity of the concept; What is a digital wallet? We’ve seen that rise. And so, the first year that we asked it was 54%. And it’s actually gone up to 59% in the last year of the research. So, people are understanding the concept of the digital wallet. What it is, what it means and why it’s important to them. When we’ve asked people about their use of digital wallets in 2021, we saw around 38% of people reported that they were using some kind of digital wallet and that rose to 41% in 2022, of respondents saying that they were actually using digital wallets.</p>
<p>And so, of those digital wallets, the highest usage recorded was of the Apple wallet. And so, in 2022, roughly a quarter, 24% were using the Apple wallet, with the remainder of the usages on wallets being spread, Samsung Pay was the next highest and then third-party wallet providers after that.</p>
<p>Why are people using digital wallets? They really like contactless payment, less clutter and less concerned about losing their cards, their plastic or physical cards. They feel that these are the benefits of using a digital wallet. So again, the setting up this ecosystem for personal data control. So, whether it’s the type of wallet that we might be familiar with, on the phone or some kind of trusted container or network. This all requires the ability to share information and to have data control. This is something that people are demanding without a lot of education.</p>
<p>So, all in all for the audience, I would say is – be aware that your customers and your clients, they may be challenged to understand, what those words ‘digital identity’ means. They may have different ideas. Among them, what the words ‘digital identity’ means. And so, there’s some education that can be done likely with your audience, and particularly for us, for our ecosystem. Again, we’re focusing on that 23% and really educating them about the privacy and the security protection that can be found, that can be achieved by using digital identity capabilities. And so that’s the place that will focus as we continue to move forward in our ecosystem in Canada.</p>
<p>And I think it’s reasonable to say that it’s probably a similar finding around the world. We might see some differences for countries that are a bit more advanced. But I do think we’re going to find some commonality, in each region around the world. And even within our customers, whether we’re thinking about their personal lives and their personal transactions. Or the way that they manage their data at work or at school. I think these findings are very valuable no matter what the lens or the ecosystem that we’re looking at.</p>
<p>So hopefully the audience will find that information helpful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, quite revealing many of the very useful facts that you have. Just share with us. Actually, one of the first one, the understanding or awareness of the concept itself of digital identity. Is quite revealing that you have evidence that it has grown. So people are understanding more. The concept is getting more familiar.</p>
<p>So, I don’t know how you ask them, but I guess you ask them to elaborate, right? So, you understand – ‘What is digital identity – and people have to elaborate in their own words.</p>
<p>Joni: We just ask them; What do you think digital identity is? So, we ask them to try to produce a definition that the research asked them. And then we measure, were they very confident, were they are able, with their definition, accurate. Or were they not confident and did they need some help? And so, at that point in the research, depending on their ability to answer the question about what they believe digital identity is. There would then be a degree of assistance. If they weren’t sure they’d be provided with a definition, so that they could then move forward in the rest of the research with a common understanding as they answered more questions going forward.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very well done. And the other thing you mentioned one paradox, so people are more willing to use the digital identity solutions, but at the same time, I’m more concerned about the privacy issues or protecting their data. So that’s also very interesting is good in old census because people are using more tools, but at the same time consciousness is increasing.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, I think for me at least, I think that this finding really is part of a call to action to say identity management practitioners who are working together to identify the risks, to mitigate the risks, to provide better solutions for citizens, clients, customers and residents. We really are responsible to move forward together in this space in a way that’s designed around people where benefits, managing their risks and their needs.</p>
<p>Because without the work that we’re doing, they’re going to take part anyway. Maybe they’re going to take pictures of their driver’s license or send me an email. And I know I have you’re not supposed to do this. But sometimes when you need to get what you need to get to on the other side of the transaction, you do what you have to do, right? So, I think we’ve all been there. So, I think this is a call to action for us to continue to work together to provide people with the option so that they can do what they need to do in a safe and secure way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. In Canada, there is a major public sector within Canada, actually there are two tiers of public sector, right? Provincial and the federal government. So, I understand that each of them makes their own solutions, and there is a private sector. So, there are like, let’s say three main developers, the creators of details in these solutions. Have you found solutions that were not properly designed and what was the effect of those?</p>
<p>Joni: In the Canadian ecosystem we do have jurisdictional governments. We have our federal government, which is a collaborative, all of us working together. And then we have provincial governments and territorial governments as well. Then of course as municipalities. So, we have the different layers of the governments and then we have the different private sector industries. And some of those industries are federally regulated like finance, and some are not.</p>
<p>So, what makes that space interesting as well is that when it comes to your legal instantiation for who you are, this is really spread out in Canada. And so, if you’re born in Canada, your legal instantiation for who you are is with your jurisdiction where you were born. If you immigrated to Canada, your legal route of your identity sits with the federal government.</p>
<p>So really the federal government is in fact a very large customer of digital credentials or digital verification. Unless you’ve immigrated. But if you’ve not emigrated like the majority of Canadians, then the federal government is a customer there to know who you are. So there does need to be a collaborative. And I would say that both in the public sector and in the private sector. It’s very important to focus on all of the element’s – trust and risk management, convenience of use. And if solutions are poorly designed, then it leaves people not happy with the experience and not trusting the experience.</p>
<p>So, whether we’re using a solution from public sector or private sector, it’s also very important to do the user testing and the alpha testing and the launch to see how were people experiencing the service? Were they able to produce the information that they needed to produce to take part in this service?</p>
<p>Because that user experience, we only have a small opportunity to create a delightful, secure experience with the people that are using the services. So poor design or in fact, it may be great design from a technical perspective. But without doing that user experience testing and finding that people’s – their emotion and how they felt while they were using the service wasn’t there. That can lead to a low adoption, low trust, and people will feel that and they will sense that and maybe they don’t come back to the solution again. Or maybe they feel, ‘oh, this was terrible’ and they tell other people.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it can’t be stressed enough that as you’re designing, public and private sector, to really work with your small set of users to see; how are they experiencing the solution? In addition to, of course, the priorities. Making sure that it’s safe and secure and using data minimisation. And all of those techniques that we would want to use for privacy and have in service.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes and related to that, and checking now the picture. We can see that they said the majority of Canadians believe that both government and private companies should work together to create a digital I.T framework. And I can see in the three years where this survey has been executed, it keeps growing. That’s the feeling of the public. That the collaboration needs to be strong. So how is that resonating with the ones who create the data services?</p>
<p>Joni: It is an interesting finding, right? And I do think it’s interesting to how people seem to hold the governments a little bit more accountable. The higher percent. So, 91-92%, they want that access to that data. I was in fact surprised that it’s a little bit lower expectation for the private sector. Around 87%, still close but a little bit lower.</p>
<p>And I think what that means is something that we all experience ourselves as well, where one person, no matter what, you know, in our lives, we Oscar is Oscar and Johnny as Johnny. Sometimes our person is work business, school, sometimes we’re a patient with our doctor. So, we have these different experiences within our lives. We are the centre of all of them. Us being at the centre is a priority to making sure that as we move through these different solutions and services, we are the constant. And we can then use data and present data as we’re moving through those contacts of the type of transaction that we’re trying to provide. And so, while let’s say for example, quite often we’re asked to show government issued ID.</p>
<p>Now, we know that we need to be able to authenticate, we need to have a verified identity and we need to be able to authenticate in a verified way to government to say, okay, this is data about us, and we want to use that data. Yes, but quite often we don’t log into government necessarily, maybe every day. Maybe if we’re at a certain phase in our life or a certain time of the year, yes, we do authenticate the government, but more often than not, we’re using that government issued data, that government issued credential to open a bank account or to go onto an aeroplane or check into a hotel.</p>
<p>So, the areas where the data about us that has different levels of verification, whether that’s our driver’s license, which for us is a provincial or territorial credential. Or a passport, which is a federal credential. Or maybe something like a verified address for the bank that we’ve been banking with over the last five or ten years.</p>
<p>Where becomes very interesting is, again, the constant in all of those equations is that there’s one person at the centre of them. And so having that collaborative, it’s very important to bridge the gap to not only are you, as a government, solving the primary use case, that is your most priority. Maybe it’s how do I authenticate the government or you as a bank are solving your use case. How do I authenticate you to access your financial information? Really, people need to traverse across both of those contexts and across many different contexts.</p>
<p>So, collaboration is the way forward and people do get that sense. And as you said that desire for collaboration has really grown over time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay, excellent. So, you are having, say, perceiving that – I’m sure you talk very often with people from all the governments. Plus, people from the private sector then, in the country. So that’s something you are already perceiving.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, absolutely. And of course, each group of stakeholders. If it’s a good government or like finance or credit networks or other. Each group has their priority use cases. And one of the things that we look at in our ecosystem in the DIACC is what are those common use cases we’re most concerned with. Really, where those ecosystems work together. Where we’re using government issued credentials to open a bank account, for example. That’s a great use case because the financial institutions want to lower their Know Your Customer anti-money laundering costs. We bring these types of government credentials into a physical bank all the time. So how can people use those credentials digitally? And how can each party be sure that the right level of risk is managed? And that’s where we focus on DIACC.</p>
<p>So, for us, use cases that centre around Know Your Customer anti-money laundering, they’re very powerful use cases. There is a global framework on Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering, and this is a place where we always see collaboration between public and private sector is an important feature. That’s one of the areas where we see a lot of commonalities, for example. Not the only area, but definitely one of the areas where that commonality exists.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, this research is super fascinating indeed. I will ask you a final question, for all the business leaders that are listening to us now. What is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Joni: I would say that this research should be used as an additive tool. It’s all available. And so, if you’re an English speaker or a French speaker, it’s available in our website, DIACC.ca. I would also say that one of the things that we focus on within the DIACC. Because we are not developing the technical standards or the technical open-source code for the methodology for how to move forward. What we’ve developed is a very high level and prescriptive risk management framework. And so, one of the things that we see in our ecosystem is that; a single solution that is one size fits all doesn’t map to the ecosystem, really. Ecosystems are living things and sometimes there’s more security needed, sometimes less. There are different conditions. </p>
<p>So, I would say for one activity for people, business leaders who are listening today is to; try to evaluate your risk. Maybe you already have. Evaluate the types of risk that you have within your ecosystem. And then look at something like our Pan-Canadian Trust Framework or risk management framework to determine, be sure that you are managing the risks that need to be managed to ensure that there is a duty of care that is set out. How do your customers expect to be cared for? How do your partners expect to be cared for? When they’re interacting with a solution or service. And then make sure you’re mitigating those risks.</p>
<p>We provide one tool, The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework. As a tool to help people measure and make sure that they’re mitigating risks in a verifiable way. And this helps decision makers to then adopt solutions today, while looking forward to knowing where and how these solutions might interact. Should I interact with another ecosystem? Are they managing risk in the same way that I am?</p>
<p>Whereas the technical solution for; Do I need to transform this data model? The software engineers I have all the confidence and the software engineers to solve. How do we transform from one data model to another? And using tools like risk management frameworks, like the pan-Canadian trust framework. Can help you to know, should you be looking at how you interact with different sets of credentials or different solutions or different ecosystems?</p>
<p>So, know your risk, manage your risk. Do your duty to care for your customers, clients, citizens and residents. And the rest of the ecosystem will evolve as it does. And we’ll continue to work together to make sure that people are at the centre. Privacy is enhanced and that people have transparency and control in this evolving and emerging digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent and for our listeners, we’re going to put in the show notes, the links to this research. So you can find it from there, from the show notes. Thanks a lot, Joni, it was a really interesting conversation. So let us know how people can follow this conversation with you or find more information all the work you’re doing.</p>
<p>Joni: Thanks so much, Oscar. Yeah, it’s been a real pleasure. I’m so glad to be back. I really appreciate the work that you’re doing with this podcast, having very interesting and insightful conversations. For people who would like to continue the conversation with us. You can find us at DIACC.ca. That’s our website. And then we do a lot of sharing and conversations in our LinkedIn group. Which you can find us at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mydiacc/">The Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada</a> in our LinkedIn Group, which is quite active.</p>
<p>So, we’d love to connect with you and continue the discussion from today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay. Fantastic. Again, thanks a lot, Joni. All the best.</p>

<p>Fission co-founder and CTO <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a> shares how UCANs simplify authorization while keeping it decentralized and preserving user agency.</p><p>When we think about authorization, an image of a central authority determining what a person is and is not allowed to do comes to mind. In technology, this translates to authorization servers checking a list to see if the person has the correct permissions to access a service.</p><p>Even on the decentralized web, this still occurs. For example, if a user is on a machine that isn't running an IPFS node, or the IPFS node they are trying to access is asleep, the only way they can access the namespace that that IPFS node is managing is to log in through some other mechanism. The same goes for many edge apps or dapps. They create a point of centralization, even in a mostly distributed system.</p><p>But what if we got rid of the authorization server entirely? What if the user acted as their own auth server? Then we would have decentralized auth. This is where UCAN comes in.</p> Capabilities <p>There are two ways to handle authorization - access control lists and capabilities. </p><p>Access Control Lists are designed for when users are sharing a terminal. Think of a shared computer register where each sales associate logs in and out of the machine to tie their transactions to their individual profile. </p><p>Properties:</p>  Stateful Auth - There is a user, a gatekeeper, and a service. The gatekeeper determines if the user can access the service according to the list.  Pro - There are three clear stages in the process.  Con - Neither the user nor the service is in control. They have no agency, and all the data is centralized in one list.  <p>Capabilities are designed for networking.</p><p>Properties:</p>  Stateless Auth - There is a user who has an address (pointer) to the service they are trying to access and a cryptographic token that says that they can access the service.  Pro - The user and service are in control.  Pro - All the required info is in the token. We can make copies of the token, share those copies with others, and revoke access to copies if we choose. Access can also be set to expire after a certain timeframe has elapsed.    UCANs vs DIDs - DID you know UCAN have both? <p>How are UCAN tokens different from DIDs?</p>  DIDs are building blocks inside of UCANs!   DIDs say who you are. They give you a public key, and you can prove you're allowed to sign (AuthN - authentication)  UCANs say what you can do (AuthZ - authorization)   The UCAN Token <p>The UCAN comprises three main components: The JWT Header, the Payload (which includes the issuer / a DID - and proofs / CIDs), and the Signature (which must match the DID in the issuer).</p><p>The proofs demonstrate what capabilities the user has access to. The capabilities include a resource (for example, a path to a document), read or write access, and other extensible fields, like an email address.</p><p>The best part, we can delegate authority without sharing keys, making the process much more secure!</p> What UCAN do with UCANs <p>Authorized Data Retrieval - When you make your files shareable, UCAN ensures no unauthorized users can request them. In other words, unless you have a valid UCAN, you can't download a content address.</p><p>Apps - UCANs are used to delegate write access in <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">WNFS</a>, and WNFS, in turn, is used in many different apps like FxFotos and Fission Drive to manage files.</p><p>Authorized Channels - If you'd like to set up a group chat or gossip with specific peers, you will want a way for folks to prove that they are allowed to be in that channel so they can be admitted. Giving peers a shared capability provides them with that proof. </p><p>Decentralized Compute - We're using UCANs in <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a> to power distributed pipelines and collaborative processes.</p> IPFS Thing 2023 Presentation <p>Watch Brooklyn's full presentation below:</p><p><a href="https://noti.st/expede/Ykh5xH/ucan-decentralize-auth#sSWVwVc">Brooklyn's Presentation Slides</a></p><p>If you'd like to learn more, UCAN visit the <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">GitHub working group</a>, check out the UCAN validator on the <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">community site</a>, or even play a fun <a href="https://ucan.lol/">adventure game</a> to see UCANs in action!</p>

<p></p><p>Recently on the blog we talked about why<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers"> decentralized identifiers </a>(DIDs) are a practical solution to real problems. <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/practicality-of-decentralized-identifiers">In that post</a> we discussed some high-level concepts behind how and why DIDs could solve many of the identity and data problems we face today, but today let’s dive deep on a specific problem set DIDs could solve: parental controls and minors’ digital security.</p><p>It’s an inescapable reality for parents today that their kids will be online. There’s no avoiding the reality that minors are going to consume a diverse array of content and interact with others on the internet, but parents do want to have a say in what’s put in front of their children. Digital safety is already incorporated by some services - such as Netflix - and platforms - like iOS - but universal parental controls and safety monitoring don’t presently exist. That could change, however, via DIDs and a concept known as DID controllers.</p><p>Before we dive into how DIDs can facilitate universal parental controls, it’s fair to acknowledge that giving adults the ability to have such control over minors may represent a potential risk to those minors’ freedoms. While that is absolutely a valid concern, it’s also true that regardless of DIDs or Web5, as a society we are pushing forward towards a future with more sophisticated parental controls. Federal lawmakers recently <a href="https://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHhYEbJQr-2FOms0-2Budh-2FjizGqQjBZ-2F-2Fr1OqtAW5Vk-2Fh5nDTBbGXewV1rTmTAQ8J-2FnHutGze-2FZdRujL0z-2BT7TPQq2rMPP57Ry7H581UcM0jJNpbmEdo_JY5fc7bPIFJAvDYWnO7d4p-2FX8FAV-2BsZ9F4kAeTjyMnD-2BG0K2bZ0-2FUf-2BuopiaAntAAkVBHDuQJAFvEBGYqFHT51-2FSOTDJz-2B8jhQIBwTwwfjU6PpsWQkmsRZ-2FHGMwJynKK9gXf8AtDP1YE6sEYYtMtmmDlG6CvQMea0rUNVpY-2FTuOKnGNSHlL9NK2Jk0q4-2FRpQ-2BbFtdlnhiQK67JNVXPiMBWqgHoT-2FNCfxxr-2F4bbdre3UHJXnBVp4xhgpxhidBEbUjonDeOsX9WuX1m9sAXLuuDylpr6dFaUbCX7V9cjRoJcnvuSBxBCwsyz0eXjWABCQjrAy9oqfdT13fwQv3bIrZGwi4hMa7GsMULwMU-2BKacfPI2kJLSHpJVUvTj0CZluT9SEPpZc9wYkLrSqv2BgqnbOZJ7IEA2ZR7oNF91e94HvIaC4j-2BaatuJDdofN1Qyqph57vfWyKDAUWfEKruDuKv7ecdo-2BsRt4-2B7nt9ljpyuTRmSS458UlBFpp4g2s9qHyc0FXVVo4C3KZLpSWPmsT58L-2BObuk46zQ4wSPr-2B7SqxnCCx-2BoK4Ttt0AhCjjxnitNriSjzZgupScdseXH00RSO3rOmi1G295urhUXfGvnevAqZh2CKf-2F3fPEn5uA9-2BNDOSVhZB-2BUEqZmRd8ND43TkEmHRQ-3D-3D">introduced</a> a bipartisan bill that seeks to establish a national minimum age for posting on social media, signaling this direction in public policy. The “Protecting Kids on Social Media Act'' would ban platforms like TikTok, Snap, and Instagram from letting kids younger than 13 create accounts — and require platforms to get parental consent to open accounts for users under 18. </p><p>With things like government-run age verification and limitations on tracking minors, it’s very clear that minors will experience restrictions and the infrastructure to enforce those restrictions is coming. In this post, we’ll cover how Web5 could provide the implementation of that system.</p> DID Controllers and the Controller Paradigm<a title="Direct link to DID Controllers and the Controller Paradigm">​</a> <p>Every DID is a string representation of an entity - the subject - that is described by a DID document enumerating things like cryptographic public keys and delegate/controller patterns. Those patterns allow for another DID, the controller, to make changes to the DID document. So what does this all mean for parents?</p><p>Minors are constantly interacting with new digital and physical services that carry age restrictions or limitations. For example, it’s generally viewed as a good thing when platforms censor certain content from being viewable to those under 18. While these types of constraints are generally tied to age and state-issued licenses, those forms of identification can be forged and circumvented and offer no entry point for parents to intervene. A DID controller model, however, allows for parents to intervene at an identity level to place appropriate restrictions on their children.</p> Parents of a DID Child: A Case Study<a title="Direct link to Parents of a DID Child: A Case Study">​</a> <p>Imagine Alice and Bob welcome their new daughter Carol into the world, and at birth she’s assigned a DID over which Alice and Bob are made controllers. Immediately, whenever anyone tries to resolve Carol’s DID and obtain her DID document, they’ll see that Alice and Bob’s DIDs are controllers over her DID. As Alice and Bob check their daughter out of the hospital, there’ll be a million pieces of paperwork to fill, but proving their identity will be easy so long as they provide proof that they own the DIDs that are controllers over Carol’s DID.</p><p>As Carol starts to take her first steps, Alice and Bob enroll her in daycare. Wanting to be certain only Alice, Bob, and their parents can pick up Carol from daycare, Alice and Bob edit Carol’s DID document to ensure that the “daycare” or “supervision” <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/protocols">protocol</a> only allows for Carol to be picked up by the specified DID-holders.</p><p>With Carol growing older, she may begin to want to explore more shows and media than the educational programs her parents put on for her. Alice and Bob may want to allow Carol to explore the internet on her own a bit, so they give her access while restricting her usage. For now, she’s only allowed to visit YouTube with some strict parental filters they’ve set at her DID-level, so that even when they graduate her to more websites she does not accidentally stumble onto content they don’t want her seeing. Additionally, because they’re controlling her DID and not just her account on a single service, any service that accepts that DID and communicates over the protocols that they’ve specified will honor the restrictions they’ve placed on their daughter. For example, let’s say Alice and Bob want to always restrict videos that contain violence from being viewable by Carol, and do so by specifying that videos with violence should be blocked according to a universal video content moderation protocol. Then, all content platforms that respect the universal video content moderation protocol should automatically block that content!</p><p>With her teenage years coming on, Carol may be tempted to stay up late and message her friends, but mom and dad know that Carol needs her sleep. Bob and Alice could, as controllers, restrict her access to her texts after 10pm with the exception of a few critical family members.</p><p>Finally, when Carol does age out of her parents’ home, they can relinquish their controllership or even set it to expire at a given date. This parental use case is perfect for Web5 as it showcases how open, universal protocols, a decentralized web, and DID controllership enable improved and seamless experiences over our currently fractured, standardless web.</p><p>If all of this sounds interesting to you, join us in building Web5 by checking out our <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub</a>, including our growing <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/">web5.js SDK</a>, where you can find and collaborate on the tools we’re creating to build the next web.</p>

  MiCA aims to regulate crypto, but its stand on DeFi remains&nbsp;unclear.  “Compliant DeFi” is becoming a topic on the rise while user security becomes a priority.  The regulatory applicability of MiCA varies based on the degree of decentralization in DeFi services.  <p>Markets in Crypto Assets, which is popularly known as MiCA, came as a proposal from the European Commission on 24th September 2020 with an objective to bring crypto-asset issuers and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under one regulatory framework. After significant deliberation and consultation between EU member states, it has been finally voted to enter into force as of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>On 16th May 2023, the council introduced an EU-level legal framework by adopting a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/05/16/digital-finance-council-adopts-new-rules-on-markets-in-crypto-assets-mica/">regulation</a> on Markets in Crypto Assets. The new rules covered utility token issuers and the issuers of asset-referenced tokens and “stablecoins.” Additionally, it took trading venue providers and crypto-asset wallets under its ambit. However, no specific mention of the DeFi crypto-assets.</p><p>The EU-wide regulatory framework that MiCA aims to introduce as of next year is rather broad in its scope and requires a rather thorough understanding.</p> Crypto-Assets and Businesses Covered by&nbsp;MiCA <p>In assets, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">MiCA</a> applies to asset-referenced tokens, including commodity-backed or currency-backed stablecoins, e-money tokens, and other tokens, including utility ones. E-money tokens are usually stablecoins backed by a single fiat currency, while utility tokens include protocol tokens, access tokens, loyalty tokens, and community tokens.</p><p>In businesses, MiCA applies to crypto asset service providers who deal in custodial wallets, exchanges, crypto-asset advising firms, and crypto-portfolio management agencies or managers involved&nbsp;therein.</p><p>A custodial wallet is a virtual asset wallet that stores both the users’ assets and private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>MiCA might also apply to NFTs if the NFT — by its founding nature — is similar to the asset types that MiCA covers. Many NFTs serve as utility tokens or financial instruments at their core. MiCA might also consider large-series NFTs to be fungible and ask for authorization.</p> Crypto-Assets and Businesses Not Covered by&nbsp;MiCA <p>In May 2023, a document came into public titled “Remaining Regulatory Challenges in Digital Finance and Crypto-Assets after&nbsp;MiCA.”</p><p>As requested by the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), the document said that, in principle, MiCA applied where the overall financial services regulation did not apply. It led to the non-applicability of MiCA to crypto-assets that qualified as financial instruments and were regulated by other EU financial law instruments. Such assets include security tokens or electronic money (excluding e-money&nbsp;tokens).</p><p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/740083/IPOL_STU(2023)740083_EN.pdf">ECON document</a> also highlighted that “partially decentralized” finance services came under MiCA’s scope, while “fully decentralized platforms” that acted without intermediaries fell outside the scope of&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>However, the ECON document could not yet decide how to deal with gaps where solutions like DeFi came under conditional supervision. And it is where the need arises for a deeper understanding of MiCA’s intricate relationship with DeFi solutions and instruments.</p> DeFi and MiCA: An Intricate Relationship <p>Whether MiCA is fit to regulate DeFi is a contested topic. DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is not a legal or technical term.</p><p>According to researchers, Decentralized Finance may include multiple elements of multiple tenets, including decentralization, distributed ledger technology, smart contracts, disintermediation, and open&nbsp;banking.</p><p>Decentralization is seen as a countermodel to traditional finance, where power centralized in the hands of a few powerful intermediaries would be replaced by technology.</p><p>However, whether DeFi comes fully under the ambit of MiCA is a function of the decentralization status of the DeFi solution.</p> Compliant DeFi: A Notable Development <p>As discussions about the intersection of DeFi and regulation unfold, the notion of “Compliant DeFi” has garnered increasing attention. This term refers to DeFi systems designed with regulatory considerations in mind, aligning decentralized protocols with existing legal frameworks.</p><p>While the essence of DeFi rests on decentralization and democratization, it doesn’t inherently resist regulatory structures. The objective remains to construct an equitable and accessible financial system.

<p>The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is an EU law regulating electronic payment services within EU states and the European Economic Area (EEA). </p>
<p>As economic ties between the EU member states become more binding, it is important that citizens and businesses in these regions have laws to help streamline banking, eCommerce, and security. </p>
 The Evolution of PSD2 and Financial Security Regulations in the EU 
<p>Developed in 2018, this regulation was intended to streamline payment security and tech development throughout the regulated area. </p>
<p>PSD2 compliance follows its predecessor, the First Payment Services Directive (PSD1). PSD1, adopted in 2007, established modern rules applicable to all payment services in the EU. The goal was to make cross-border payments standardized and simplified without sacrificing security.</p>
<p>PSD1 was a step in the right direction but had several limitations. It did not cover all payment services or implement effective customer authentication or identity verification methods. The development of PSD2 introduced new consumer protections and promoted innovation in security and the open banking movement.</p>
<p>Some of the key parts of PSD2 compliance include:</p>
 
 Open Banking: Under PSD2, banks must provide access to open APIs so that third-party banking providers (TPPs) can build additional financial services on top of that infrastructure.  
 Third-Party Providers (TPPs): Speaking of TPPs, PSD2 introduces new types of regulated service providers that can manage payments or mediate interactions between cardholders and payment processors.  
 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA): PSD2 also introduces more rigorous requirements for customer authentication during electronic transactions. This process is known as Strong Customer Authentication, which generally requires at least two independent authentication elements from the customer. 
 Increased Consumer Rights: PSD2 also enhances consumer rights in several areas, including reducing liability for non-authorized payments, introducing an unconditional refund right for direct debits in euros, and banning card surcharges. 
 
 Who Has to Follow PSD2? 
<p>PSD2 compliance applies to various organizations, including traditional banks, credit institutions, electronic money institutions, payment institutions, and certain fintech companies. The directive introduces rigorous requirements for these organizations, such as enhanced customer authentication measures and the need to open access to customer account data for third-party providers (with the customer’s consent).</p>
<p>Some of these organizations include:</p>
 
 Banks and Credit Institutions: Traditional banks and credit institutions must comply with PSD2 regulations. This includes providing access to account information and payment initiation services to third-party providers (TPPs) where the customer has given explicit consent. 
 Payment Institutions: This refers to institutions that have been granted permission to provide payment services but which are not necessarily banks. These institutions might offer services such as money remittance, execution of payment transactions, and issuing/acquiring payment instruments. These include TPPS, Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) and Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs).  
 Card Issuing and Acquiring Institutions: Organizations that issue debit or credit cards to consumers or process payments for merchants must also comply with the PSD2 regulations. 
 Other Financial Institutions: Other institutions involved in the processing or receipt of payments, including money transfer operators and certain types of mobile network operators, may also have to comply with the directive. 
 
 What Can Happen When You Don’t Comply with PSD2? 
<p>PSD2 compliance is mandatory for all applicable entities operating within the EEA, marked into law by the EU and participating countries. Organizations that fail to comply with the PSD2 risk financial penalties of up to 4% of annual returns.</p>
<p>Note that PSD2 applies to transactions where both the payer’s and payee’s service providers are located within the EEA using EU currency. </p>
 How Can Organizations Meet PSD2 Requirements? 
<p>Meeting PSD2 requirements often involves significant changes to an organization’s operations, technology, and business model if they still need to be prepared to implement secure payment technologies. </p>
<p>There are a few key areas where organizations can focus their efforts to maintain PSD2 compliance:</p>
 
 <a>Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)</a>: SCA requires that authentication use two independent factors related to MFA verification: something the customer knows, something the user has, and something the user is.  
 Open APIs: Banks and other financial institutions must provide access to their customer’s accounts via open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to allow third-party providers (TPPs) to develop new services. These APIs must enable TPPs to retrieve account information (if the customer consents) and initiate payments directly from the customer’s account. 
 Transparency and Communication: Organizations need to provide clear information about all transactions, ensuring complete transparency with the customer about any applicable fees, charges, and the timeframe for transactions. This includes information related to incidents of fraud. 
 Data Security and Privacy: Organizations must protect data confidentiality and integrity, including implementing rigorous data security measures and ensuring PSD2 compliance with other applicable laws and regulations, such as GDPR. 
 Registration and Licensing: Certain organizations, such as PISPs and AISPs, must register with their national financial regulator and may need a license to operate. 
 Fraud Monitoring and Reporting: PSD2 requires service providers to establish a framework for the monitoring and reporting fraudulent transactions. 
 
<p>It’s also worth noting that EU member states may have slightly different laws, requiring different applications based on the jurisdiction.</p>

 In recent years, soft mobility has seen explosive growth, particularly in major cities as a means of urban transport. Whether it’s electric bikes, scooters or self-service electric scooters, micromobility is seen as an environmentally-friendly and practical alternative to traditional modes of transport. However, the way it is regulated is being called into question. Some countries now require age verification of users for greater safety. 



 The future belongs to soft mobility. 



<p>Walking, cycling and even electric scooters are increasingly popular means of transport in major cities, and are referred to as “soft mobility” or “active mobility.” Why is this so? Soft mobility is seen as a solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion and promoting health and well-being.</p>



<p>Many cities around the world are turning to soft mobility or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">shared mobility</a> to meet these challenges. Dedicated self-service vehicles have appeared in urban centers in recent years. Governments and companies are also encouraging this transition to more sustainable modes of transport by offering tax incentives, subsidies and user benefits.</p>



<p>Although people are increasingly turning to these modes of transport and services are improving all the time, there are still challenges to be overcome if soft mobility is to become widespread.</p>



 What are the challenges for soft mobility? The example of electric scooters in Paris. 



<p>One of the main challenges facing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">shared mobility is safety</a>. Users of these modes of transport are more vulnerable to road accidents, particularly in urban areas with heavy traffic. Cyclists and users of electric scooters are often confronted with obstacles, so it is crucial to regulate the use of these services. For example, by ensuring that a user is not too young to hire an electric mode of transport, or that they <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">actually have a driver’s license</a> to use a scooter.</p>



<p>The laws and regulations governing the use of micromobility services vary considerably from one country to another, and even from one town to another. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/parisians-vote-on-banning-e-scooters-from-french-capital">Scooter use in Paris</a> is a concrete example of how the lack of clear regulation can undermine the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/micromobility-and-the-future-of-transportation/">future of micromobility</a>. Since the arrival of self-service electric scooter operators in the city, streets have become more congested, raising safety concerns for pedestrians and other road users. In response to these challenges, municipalities have introduced stricter rules for operators, including limits on the number of scooters available and parking requirements. However, it is not certain that this will be enough.</p>



 
   
     
                     The state of micromobility regulations in 2023 
                     Industry leaders debate the current regulatory framework for micromobility and the best ways of balancing safety with innovation and accessibility. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/state-of-micromobility-regulations-in-2023/">Watch now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


 Age verification: what do European regulations say about the use of electric scooters and bicycles? 



<p>There are currently no specific EU regulations for micromobility. However, the European Commission is encouraging coordination between Member States to develop harmonized rules and ensure responsible use of these modes of transport. Some countries have already adopted specific national regulations for micromobility, while others have incorporated these modes of transport into their existing legislation on motor vehicles.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F35470/0_0?idFicheParent=F308&amp;lang=en#0_0">France and Belgium adopted specific regulations in 2019</a> to govern the use of self-service electric scooters. These include speed and age limits for users, as well as insurance and parking requirements. It stipulates that <a href="https://www.connexionfrance.com/article/French-news/France-raises-minimum-age-for-using-an-electric-scooter">users must be at least 14 years old to use a service</a>. Spain subsequently applied the same framework in 2020.</p>



<p>Although electric scooters are considered to be motorized vehicles in many European countries, in the same way as cars and motorbikes, it is not currently necessary to have a driver’s license. Only an identity document may be required to ensure that the user is of legal age to use the service. However, with the ever-increasing number of accidents and non-compliance with parking regulations, it is conceivable that the rules will eventually be tightened.</p>



 What resources should be put in place to provide a better framework for soft mobility services? 



<p>To rent a scooter or electric bike in Marseille, you will now need to scan your identity card and perform facial recognition. The ID card will be linked to the credit card used on the user’s account, thereby helping to combat credit card fraud and provide a better framework for the use of these services. If users are easily identifiable, they will be less inclined to break the parking rules (e.g. don’t use sidewalks, don’t leave your scooter in a red zone, etc.).</p>



<p>Remote identity verification is increasingly seen as an effective solution for supervising micromobility services, but also for ensuring the safety of users by reducing dangerous behavior such as drinking and driving or speeding. By having information on users, operators can inform the authorities in the event of an offense.</p>



<p>In the long term, it is conceivable that a driver’s license could be required as a supporting document when subscribing to a micromobility service, as is currently the case for car-sharing or car-pooling services. Operators need to be on the lookout for new regulations and ensure that their services are compliant and safe for their users.</p>

			<p>June 6th, Luxembourg – <a href="https://defactorlabs.com/">Defactor Labs</a>, a trailblazing DeFi lending platform for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), proudly announces the launch of tokenizing $100 million worth of Alpha Bonds, using the ERC3643 token standard to enforce compliance on the Polygon Network, to lend capital to SMEs using real-world assets (e.g., receivables) as collateral.</p>

			<p>SMEs are often subject to the same stringent lending criteria as large corporations by traditional banks. This can impede their ability to secure funding, limit their potential for growth, and hinder their competitiveness. Defactor Labs aims to address these challenges via tokenized Alpha Bonds to bridge the $1.5 trillion USD global funding gap to ultimately better cater to SMEs’ funding needs worldwide.</p>
<p>In traditional investment practices of bonds, the transparency surrounding traditional bond instruments has often been obscured, accompanied by lengthy settlement cycles and cumbersome manual processes. On the contrary, the Alpha Bonds create unparalleled transparency, efficiency, and instant settlement through tokenization. Moreover, the Alpha Bonds are compliantly distributed to a global network of audiences to allow eligible investors to digitally subscribe and purchase these digital bonds with an e-commerce-like experience that leverages the benefits of tokenization.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the secondary trading of Alpha Bonds is enabled due to them being issued on the ERC3643 standard. With ERC3643, the compliance rules are embedded into the digital securities, where investors have the opportunity to achieve liquidity by trading their Alpha Bonds with eligible counterparties without a middleman — a possibility that has historically been unattainable. This increased liquidity further strengthens the appeal and viability of these innovative investment instruments.</p>
<p>Defactor Labs, in collaboration with <a href="https://cms.law/">CMS</a>, a globally renowned law firm with 78 offices across 40 countries, have chosen Luxembourg as the jurisdiction to issue the digital bonds. While CMS provides legal guidelines and documentation, <a href="https://blackmanta.capital/">Black Manta Capital Partners</a> provides a BaFin broker-dealer license and marketplace, powered by <a href="http://tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>‘s ERC3643-based tokenization engine for Defactor Labs. These partnerships streamlined the launch of the Alpha Bonds to allow Defactor Labs to focus on their core businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, the effectiveness of the Alpha Bonds has already been proven through their pilot projects. These projects have already facilitated $30 million in transactions and successfully financed $2M in the past three months, emphasizing the practical viability and reliability of their approach, with no defaults recorded.</p>

		 
	 
    Launching Alpha Bonds is a monumental milestone for not only us at Defactor but for the worldwide network of SMEs. Our goal has always been to create a truly inclusive global economy with access to liquidity for all. With this partnership with Tokeny and Black Manta Capital Partners, they are the missing pieces we needed to ultimately fulfill our goal. We are excited to officially launch Alpha Bonds and allow investors to earn a return, while at the same time helping SMEs to grow around the world.  Alejandro GutierrezCEO and Co-Founder of Defactor Labs       Tokeny, as the technology partner of Defactor Labs, is excited to contribute to bridge traditional finance to DeFi through the launch of 'Alpha Bonds'. By leveraging the ERC3643 standard to tokenize $100 million worth of bonds, Defactor Labs aims to not only allow institutional investors to compliantly access DeFi, but also provide them with liquidity options in an open network thanks to ERC3643 protocol’s on-chain compliance nature.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny       Traditional finance is in a constant state of transformation, and we at Black Manta Capital Partners believe that an important part of the financial market will be permissioned decentralized finance. The ‘Alpha Bonds’ project, as Europe’s first institutional grade DeFi product, lays the foundation for bringing real world assets into the DeFi space, and we are delighted to be working with Defactor Labs and Tokeny to bring this innovative product to market.  Alexander RapatzFounding &amp; Managing Partner at Black Manta Capital Partners

<p>New services and checks for use cases regulated by the FCA and UKGC</p>



<p>Munich, June 6, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, announces the expansion of its platform to include fully automated document liveness capabilities, data checks and Financial Risk Checks as well as new fraud prevention features. The platform expansion will also include a central, no-code workflow management tool.</p>



<p>Document liveness checks to combat the most sophisticated fraud attempts</p>



<p>The automated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">document liveness check</a> relies on IDnow’s expertise in video analysis and requires the end user to record a video of their ID document, thus enabling an automated check on the visible security elements of the document, such as holograms. This feature helps companies in their fight against the rising risk of fraud through forged documents.</p>



<p>Fully automated KYC and AML services with data checks</p>



<p>IDnow’s new fully automated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) services, the latter of which screen against multiple global <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> and Sanction lists, ensure real-time AML compliance at the onboarding stage while allowing ongoing&nbsp;monitoring to confirm compliance post-onboarding.​ Fintechs, crypto providers and more traditional financial service providers can benefit from a complete alert management functionality and audit history&nbsp;with tailored alert matching.</p>



<p>The new data checks enable a frictionless KYC process&nbsp;which takes just a&nbsp;few&nbsp;seconds, particularly&nbsp;for&nbsp;use cases regulated by the UK’s&nbsp;Financial Conduct Authority (<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">FCA</a>) or by the UK Gaming Commission (<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/">UKGC</a>). However, they also add&nbsp;an additional layer of security&nbsp;to protect businesses around less regulated use cases, for example, in the mobility industry.</p>



<p>Additionally, the latest platform expansion also includes Financial Risk Checks that use public third-party and self-declared data.&nbsp;These provide gambling companies with insight into affordability indicators which protect online gamblers and comply with the latest updates to the UK Gambling Act, helping businesses to avoid potential fines and reputational damage. The public and third-party data allows for ongoing monitoring of changes in player circumstances and verification of reported income without the need for additional documentation.</p>



<p>A single platform to access data sources and orchestrate KYC workflows in real-time</p>



<p>These new data check capabilities are added to IDnow’s single platform, thus allowing customers to orchestrate both data checks and document- and biometric-based identity proofing workflows. Data checks are required by the responsible regulatory bodies, document and biometric checks can be added for other sensitive use cases for an extra layer of security.</p>



<p>The AML services and real-time data checks are easily configurable via the online self-service orchestration portal which offers complete control to IDnow’s customers. It lets them tailor and optimise data checks and document-based identity verification in one intuitive dashboard via drag-and-drop functionality, thus providing a single entry point for all the new integrated services.</p>



<p>Proprietary fraud prevention technology and a high level of compliance</p>



<p>To detect single and serial fraud attempts, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">IDnow’s platform</a> uses proprietary fraud prevention technology that collects risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources. In addition, IDnow regularly collaborates with law enforcement agencies, providing the company’s dedicated fraud team with the latest knowledge of fraud techniques and methods from around the world.</p>



<p>Bertrand Bouteloup, Chief Commercial Officer at IDnow, said: “With the help of our AI-powered engine, which employs the latest fraud prevention capabilities, we can combat the most advanced fraudsters and allow our crypto, fintech and financial customers to grow their businesses with confidence and be a strong partner for large financial institutions at the same time. Our document liveness feature is clearly a game changer in this market.”</p>



<p>“We are pleased to be able to enhance our platform offering, specifically in the UK, to help our customers fight fraud, achieve compliance and build trust across Europe and beyond. Thanks to these new functionalities and our strong regulatory expertise, our customers can easily expand their services and rely on a&nbsp;platform that achieves&nbsp;compliance according to the&nbsp;most rigid regulatory&nbsp;requirements within the UK, the EU and beyond.”</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 22nd May to 4th&nbsp;June <p>Welcome to the latest edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, keeping you up-to-date with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency regulations.</p><p>In the last fortnight, we’ve seen global bodies and economies make strides in crypto regulation.</p><p>IOSCO has proposed the first global crypto-asset market regulation, whereas the World Economic Forum is advocating for regulatory cooperation, illuminating the complexity of the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>In the face of these changes, Georgia, too, is bolstering its crypto-friendly reputation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong and UAE’s central banks are uniting to push the envelope in digital currency and fintech cooperation.</p><p>Let’s not wait any further and dive straight&nbsp;in.</p> A Global Journey Towards Unified Crypto Asset Regulation <p>The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is steering the ship toward the world’s first unified regulation of crypto asset markets. This move, catalyzed by the collapse of the FTX exchange, aims to quell a wide spectrum of industry issues, from market manipulation to customer protection.</p><p>The call for a harmonized regulatory framework resonates across the crypto industry, compelling regulatory bodies such as the US SEC, Japan’s FSA, Britain’s FCA, and Germany’s BaFin to rally alongside IOSCO. As these bodies collaborate and invite public feedback, a clear regulatory vision may begin to&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>Elsewhere, the European Union has recently concluded its comprehensive crypto regulations, nudging nations like the United States and Britain to follow suit. And amid regulatory uncertainty, India is hedging against potential risks, having implemented a new tax policy on crypto&nbsp;gains.</p><p>Amid all these, an intriguing alliance has formed between the Central Banks of Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates, united by a shared vision for crypto regulation and fintech development. Notably, Hong Kong granted retail investors access to crypto trading services on June&nbsp;1st.</p><p>Echoing these global movements, Georgia strides ahead with new crypto regulations, setting the stage for compulsory supervision of Virtual Asset Service Providers from September 2023. This initiative is part of the country’s aspirations to become a global crypto hub and fortify against money laundering.</p><p>From the think tank realm, the World Economic Forum has recognized the urgency for global coordination in crypto asset regulation. Through a paper exploring the inherent challenges and suggesting best practices, they add another layer to this global dialogue on crypto regulation.</p><p>Now, let’s analyze two of the biggest news from the world of crypto regulations over the last two weeks and decode their impact on crypto users and the broader ecosystem.</p> Decoding The World Economic Forum’s Take on Crypto Regulation: A Mixed Bag for the Crypto Ecosystem? <p>The World Economic Forum, in collaboration with its Digital Currency Governance Consortium, recently published a paper articulating the urgent need for global cooperation and regulation of crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>While emphasizing the avoidance of regulatory ambiguity and inconsistent enforcement, the paper sheds light on the challenges the current regulatory framework faces, particularly its failure to align seamlessly with the crypto ecosystem’s unique characteristics.</p><p>The paper’s analysis of the issues is meticulous, exploring the complexity added by crypto mixers, self-hosted wallets, and decentralized exchanges. It asserts that such elements, when coupled with the crypto sector’s growing interconnection with traditional finance, escalate the potential contagion risks, necessitating a robust regulatory response.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1662148287875498012?s=20">Image Source</a><p>The paper also breaks down regulatory frameworks into understandable categories, such as outcome-based regulation and risk-based regulation, and highlights the emergence of an “agile regulation” approach involving a multi-stakeholder effort.</p><p>Illustrating this, the paper cites Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority’s agile regulatory practices.</p><p>However, the paper does critique the “regulation by enforcement” approach prevalent in the United States, arguing that it obstructs meaningful dialogue around the regulatory framework.</p><p>So what does all this mean for crypto users and the wider ecosystem? A global regulatory framework might offer clarity for crypto users and businesses, simplifying cross-border operations. Agile regulation, in particular, could nurture continued innovation and growth in the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Global cooperation and the sharing of best practices could simplify the regulatory landscape, offering a fair playground and increasing overall stability. This could lure traditional investors and institutions, encouraging mainstream acceptance of the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>On the flip side, the push for regulation could clash with the crypto community’s privacy values. Regulation might also stifle innovation, especially for smaller entities struggling with regulatory compliance.</p><p>A global regulatory framework risks centralizing power, contradicting the decentralization that many crypto assets champion. Striking a balance between fostering innovation, maintaining user privacy, and ensuring market stability is the challenge at hand. This crucial juncture for the crypto ecosystem will shape its future direction.</p> Banking on Crypto Regulations: The Cross-Border Partnership Between Hong Kong and the&nbsp;UAE <p>The collaboration between the central banks of Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) promises to enhance financial cooperation, particularly in cryptocurrency regulations and fintech development. This partnership has wide-ranging implications for crypto users and the overall ecosystem.</p><p>With harmonized regulatory measures, investors could gain confidence due to stronger consumer protection and reduced risk of fraud. This cooperative approach might encourage other countries to develop aligned rules, promoting regulatory consistency for global investors.</p><p>At the same time, tighter regulations can pose challenges. Crypto creators might find a complex regulatory environment daunting, possibly resulting in slower growth in the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Additionally, new rules could conflict with the basic principles of decentralization and anonymity that define cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The central banks’ commitment extends beyond regulation to fostering fintech development. Joint initiatives and knowledge-sharing could stimulate innovation, creating a positive cycle that advances the industry.</p><p>Through this collaboration, both Hong Kong and the UAE can draw on each other’s strengths to enhance their financial ecosystems.</p><p>Still, there could be potential pitfalls. Development might lean towards the strengths and interests of these two countries, limiting the breadth of fintech innovation and possibly restricting the applicability of these solutions in other&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Navigating the complex landscape of cryptocurrency and fintech, the partnership between Hong Kong and UAE central banks offers an intriguing case&nbsp;study.</p><p>The outcomes will likely have a profound influence on how these areas evolve in the future, not just within these countries but potentially on a global&nbsp;scale.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan to Enforce Crypto Travel Rule from June&nbsp;1st</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">MiCA Paving the Way: From Liability to Transparency</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1664701122714521601?s=20">May Monthly&nbsp;Overview</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 At Identiverse 2023, the narrative around removing the password has reached inevitability: it’s not if or how, it’s when. Unsurprisingly, passkeys were a common theme because they’ve achieved the two requirements for finally pushing the 62-year-old password into retirement: They’re faster than a password and they are easier for the user.

<p></p> 
<p>At Identiverse 2023, the narrative around removing the password has reached inevitability: it’s not if or how, it’s when. Unsurprisingly, passkeys were a common theme because they’ve achieved the two requirements for finally pushing the 62-year-old password into retirement: They’re faster than a password and they are easier for the user.</p> 
<p>In the recent <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-security-report">State of Passwordless</a> vol 3, we showed that 45% of Security decision makers think that improving the user experience is the reason to go passwordless. Users have discovered an incredible number of ways to get around security they find irritating (I’m looking at you,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vaydeer-Undetectable-Multi-Tracks-Simulate-Realistic-dp-B093WN48SD/dp/B093WN48SD/ref=dp_ob_title_ce"> Mouse Jiggler</a>).&nbsp;</p> 
 Adding Pain With Number Matching  
<p>Given Microsoft’s recent announcement that Authenticator will now mandate<a href="https://www.itpro.com/security/cyber-attacks/microsoft-authenticator-mandates-number-matching-to-counter-mfa-fatigue-attacks"> number matching</a>, we’re likely to see even more focus on the experience. The new policy requires that the numbers in a user's password match exactly with those on their registered mobile device. (You can see a video demo<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhyRpB5xv-A"> here</a>.) This has led to a layer of complexity in the authentication process. Users now have to remember not just a password, but also ensure that certain numbers correspond to those in their personal devices. While<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf"> CISA’s guidelines</a> for moving to phishing-resistant MFA respect number matching as one way to get to phishing-resistance, the experience is pretty challenging.&nbsp;</p> 
 Adding Pain With Complexity?  
<p>We’re going to see another level of complexity added to passwords with the implementation of the 2024 PCI requirements. Password length and complexity requirements drive users nuts. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) 2024 password length requirement is a perfect example of how security measures can impact user experience. With the updated requirements requiring a minimum of 12 characters for passwords, users are being forced to remember more complex and lengthy credentials. While this might enhance security, it will also lead to frustrated users, increased password reset requests and significant account lockouts. Fortunately, the PCI 2024 requirements also acknowledge FIDO and that this can serve as one or more of the factors required for authentication.&nbsp;</p> 
 FIDO and Passkeys to the Rescue  
<p>So where does this leave us given that both of those changes are designed to address the ability of hackers to use automated attacks <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">to bypass traditional authentication systems</a>? This is why FIDO has developed so much market momentum, particularly around passkeys. First off: a passkey is any FIDO credential. If you’ve been using FIDO for years, you’ve been using passkeys, it just has a new name.</p> 
<p>Passkeys offer a more streamlined experience for users by reducing the need for remembering complex passwords. The good news is that with Apple, Google, Microsoft and a number of the password management solutions offering to support synchronized passkeys, it’s increasingly easy for companies to adopt passkeys and for consumers to use them. It’s soon going to be as natural as anything that we do to authenticate on our phone today.&nbsp;</p> 
 The User Experience Holy Grail  
<p>From a user experience point of view, passkeys can help us to achieve the holy grail: having an authentication experience that is simpler and faster than passwords. HYPR not only supports passkeys through our app, we also provide what Apple, Google and Microsoft don’t — the servers and infrastructure required for organizations to authenticate based on passkeys. Beyond that, we also offer Enterprise Passkeys: passkeys bound to a single device with the controls that enterprises need to feel confident that they have control of their credentials and authentication strategy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Interested in finding out more about how passkeys can support your users or consumers? <a href="https://get.hypr.com/contact">Contact us</a>.</p>

 Neighbourhood Warmth — Month Notes (no.&nbsp;1) <p>This is the second in a short series of month notes about our Neighbourhood Warmth project. It has also been crossposted on the blog of our project partner, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/category/climate/">mysociety</a>.</p>Rodborough Common,&nbsp;Frome Month 1 <p>We wrapped up <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2023/03/30/neighbourhood-warmth-monthnotes/">our first instalment of monthnotes</a> with thoughts on how to tackle our overarching enquiry:</p><p>“How can we support communities to organise locally around a simple and achievable home energy&nbsp;action?”</p><p>Since then we’ve been sculpting <a href="https://neighbourhood-warmth.staging.mysociety.org/">the skeleton of a digital service</a> that we’re planning to test in June. Currently it outlines the benefits of collaboration and enables neighbours to connect with each other, by forming&nbsp;teams.</p> Questions lead to questions <p>You may have noticed that our timescales have slipped a bit! After an initial burst of brainstorming we spotted an impending crunch and decided to extend our partnership for another month. This provided breathing space to organise workshops. And it allowed us to unpack a few questions that are bubbling up as we revisit the drawing board and&nbsp;iterate.</p><p>Here’s a&nbsp;flavour:</p>  How can digital technology facilitate purposeful connection, and on what basis (eg proximity, housing type, tenure, existing relationships or motivations)?  What mechanisms enable teams to form, evolve and progress together?  How strongly do we want to encourage a particular sequence of&nbsp;actions?  <p>As we crumble these and related questions into more granular design decisions, we’re regularly referring back to the research questions in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u46mfXRYYdzpxWi5d40-Yb-f86FxL5z8AT_zEhyPegM/edit#heading=h.u9dfvp64qkns">our plan for this Alpha phase</a> to maintain focus. We’ve made strides on the first three, and our attention is now turning towards the remaining two:</p>  How a service like this could signal demand to the council or to retrofit organisations, to help build the supply of retrofit finance and services in an&nbsp;area.  How a service like this could connect residents with suppliers for services across parts or whole of the retrofit&nbsp;journey.   I’m gonna get myself connected <p>We’ve also been laying <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVhoGaWMBPpVNND2AXnu4gvdM4OTVnPhyFi6eJmru8Y/edit?usp=sharing">foundations</a> for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LWGJJz3P3Hl17DdO2VOp8xaSb3kQ-lz2VOno8KC0Faw/edit?usp=sharing">co-design workshops</a> that we’ll use to test and learn with communities in Frome, Birmingham and hopefully at least one more location. Due to their distinctive characteristics, these communities allow us to run parallel experiments.</p><p>In Balsall Heath, John Christophers is at the heart of a community-led effort to make the most of government funding that involves <a href="https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/">Birmingham City Council</a>, <a href="https://www.mecctrust.co.uk/">MECC Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.midlandsnetzerohub.co.uk/">Midlands Net Zero Hub</a> to name a&nbsp;few.</p><p>And in Frome, thanks to funding from <a href="https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/funding/programmes/climate-action-fund-programme">The National Lottery’s Climate Action Fund</a>, the town council has partnered with the <a href="https://www.cse.org.uk/">Centre for Sustainable Energy</a> so that <a href="https://www.frometowncouncil.gov.uk/mayor-of-frome-welcomes-free-energy-advice-home-visit-session/">its Healthy Homes team can advise residents</a>.</p><p>We’re interested to see how people’s perspectives on Neighbourhood Warmth may be shaped by these diverse contexts, histories and experiences. By shining light from different angles, we hope their responses will help us to resolve some of the questions that we’re still grappling with.</p><p>Thanks to generous engagement with fellow travellers on the road to community-led retrofit, our thinking continues to be stimulated in the meantime. Thanks to everyone who read and shared our previous monthnotes, and made time to meet in the&nbsp;interim.</p><p>In relation to the research questions above, we’re honoured to have been invited to drop in to the <a href="https://ukgbc.org/">UK Green Building Council</a>’s local authority retrofit forum. This is a golden opportunity to share our work with council officers. We’re curious to know how a richer picture of home energy action could bolster their efforts to support residents. If Neighbourhood Warmth provided a clearer view of demand, how could that help in the development of local supply chains? And zooming out a bit further, we’re exploring the potential for knock-on benefits at regional and national levels with the <a href="https://www.wmca.org.uk/">West Midlands Combined Authority</a>.</p><p>As always we’re all ears. So if you have thoughts please get in touch via <a href="mailto:climate@mysociety.org">climate@mysociety.org</a> and <a href="mailto:info@darkmatterlabs.org">info@darkmatterlabs.org</a> and spread the word so that we get more feedback.</p>

 We sat down with our Sales Director, Olivier Artus, to discuss the PVID framework, its impact on the financial market, its evolution over time and its implementation at IDnow. 



 What will the PVID certification mean for the financial market in practice? 



<p>The PVID certification offers a clear and precise reference for all remote identity verification players on the French market. It allows financial market players to integrate a certified solution of substantial level into their process, which will make the entry into a relationship consistent with a face-to-face equivalent. This is the first time that the French authorities that regulate the financial services market have proposed a solution, integrating biometrics, that is 100% compliant with the Monetary and Financial Code (CMF), without having to add any additional measures other than ID and biometrics.</p>



 What will the PVID standard add to the remote identity verification process? 



<p>The real difference is the instant compliance of the entry into the relationship. Until now, the use of biometrics in a transaction, although secure, had no substantial value, i.e. was not recognized or certified by an authority. Thanks to PVID, we finally have a solution that offers a face-to-face equivalent, in line with the requirements of the regulators.</p>



<p>In addition, the PVID standard makes it possible to offer online access to unbanked populations. Thanks to the certification, it is no longer necessary to add additional measures such as the first payment by bank transfer, for example, which is less inclusive and often a source of failure or even cost. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">use of biometrics</a> is now recognized as a full complementary measure.</p>



<p>The rules imposed by traditional financial institutions for opening an account have made the entry into a relationship a real challenge. If we had had a PVID standard at the time of the health crisis, for example, traditional banks would have been able to do even more business securely and therefore more transactions.</p>



 Will all players in the financial sector be affected by this certification? In particular the crypto players, the fintech world… will everyone be on the same page? 



<p>All players subject to <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr/">ACPR</a> and <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/regulation/regulation-homepage">AMF</a> regulations will now be able to include a biometric entry path in their solution: credit institutions, personal and capital insurance, fintech, payment institutions, etc. Some other sectors will not be immediately affected by PVID, such as property and casualty insurance, which does not have a KYC obligation as it is not considered a risk area.</p>



<p>Other sectors of the financial sphere such as issuers of prepaid products and so-called credit FinTechs will obviously be interested in the development of such solutions to enhance trust when entering into a remote relationship.</p>



<p>As far as crypto is concerned, the AMF in France has defined the PSAN status (Service Provider on Digital Assets) in order to better supervise the market players and requires for this the implementation of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">complete KYC path</a>, including identity verification. This is equivalent to the PVID process for banks. More globally and in order to harmonize the European crypto regulatory landscape, it is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets)</a> regulation that will enter soon, still with the objective of protecting investors and preserving financial stability.</p>



<p>The first beneficiaries of the PVID standard will therefore be banks, neo-banks, payment institutions and credit players. What is important to remember is that players who are not directly concerned by PVID will be able to accelerate their insertion into the market and strengthen confidence in the construction of a customer relationship, thanks to this type of standard.</p>



 What will be the benefits of a PVID certification for financial market participants? 



<p>The last two years have seen a significant increase in cases of online identity fraud. In our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">latest Identity Fraud Trend Report</a> we found a 144% increase in the use of fake identity documents between November and December 2021. PVID certification strengthens traditional remote identity verification solutions, and improves the fight against identity theft through the use of biometrics.</p>



<blockquote><p>Beyond the fight against fraud, the challenge of the PVID standard is to fight against financial crime during remote identification, and therefore money laundering. This involves identifying the origin of funds and the destination of funds. The PVID process completes the financial institution’s AML/CFT system.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



 Do you think that the arrival of PVID will increase confidence in the market? 



<p>Of course. The primary objective of PVID is to strengthen the trust between the financial institution and the customer when subscribing to a service or opening an account.</p>



<p>The end customer will go through a process that is based on a public repository published by a recognized government agency, which represents an additional element of trust for him. For its part, the financial institution will rely on an expert company that provides it with a solution certified by the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ANSSI</a> to a substantial level with regard to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">European eIDAS regulation</a>, in order to verify the authenticity of the identity of the customers it deals with.</p>



<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/solution-pvid/">PVID standard</a> adds control points to identity documents. The dynamic capture of the document allows the detection of security features that cannot be verified in static mode. Then, a manual analysis completes the automated verification of the captures. It is carried out by operators trained in fraud who check, correct and give a final verdict on the user data in less than 5 minutes.</p>



 What, in your opinion, are the challenges to encourage the adoption of this new type of standard? 



<p>The first challenge is the user experience, which must be simple, intuitive, fast and perfectly integrated into our customers’ acquisition flow. The use of a mobile phone in the context of a long-distance relationship can be a barrier for less technophile users. For this reason, we offer an omnichannel pathway (on smartphones, tablets and computers). Our PVID certified pathway offers an intuitive, step-by-step guided experience to simplify the identity verification process for the user, for high conversion rates.</p>



<p>Furthermore, citizens are becoming increasingly vigilant about the handling of their personal data. Here again, our solutions are compliant with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Our solutions and all processed data are securely hosted in Europe and we have our own infrastructure. Thus, we guarantee the complete confidentiality and protection of all shared data and analyses performed.</p>



<p>In addition to the user aspect, we also have a duty to support financial institutions in learning how to use the solutions and optimize their processes.</p>



 In terms of geography, who will be affected by PVID? And in your opinion, will this certification evolve? 



<p>From a technical point of view, the solution will initially apply to the entire French market under the aegis of the ACPR. As France is a recognized financial center, it is likely that the PVID process could also be recognized as compliant in other EU countries in the context of remote entry.</p>



<blockquote><p>It can be assumed that this regulation will continue to exist and that it may evolve from a functional point of view. Optional modules may be added to the solution to suit different countries and local regulators.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



<p>In the context of the emergence of digital identity and identity wallets, our near future will be to rely on a PVID certified solution for the creation of a recognized digital identity of substantial level.</p>



 What is the status of certification at IDnow? 



<p>We have never been so close to being PVID certified. We are at the end of the certification process, so we hope to be able to announce this very soon.</p>

A SAID is uniquely and cryptographically bound to a serialization of data that includes the SAID as a component (or field) in that serialization.</p><blockquote>Note 1: Serialization is defined as a process of translating a data structure or object state into a data format that can be stored, transmitted, and reconstructed at a later&nbsp;time.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: In KERI, all identifiers are SAIDs. For example, Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) are SAIDs of their associated key inception events. Identifiers of Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs) and their schemas are also&nbsp;SAIDs.</blockquote> Content-Addressability <p>An identifier that is content-addressable is based on an encoded cryptographic digest and is, thus, cryptographically bound to the content that it identifies.</p> Self-Reference <p>An identifier that is self-referential appears within the content that it is identifying.</p> SAD (Self-Addressing Data) <p>SAD (Self-Addressing Data) of a SAID is defined as a representation of data content from which the SAID is derived. The SAID is both cryptographically bound to (content-addressable) and encapsulated by (self-referential) its&nbsp;SAD.</p><blockquote>Note: the example SAID above starts with the character “E”. This is a CESR character code that specifies that the SAID is generated using a Blake3–256 digest.</blockquote> SAID Protocol <p>A “naive” cryptographic content-addressable identifier is not self-referential. This is because the naive cryptographic derivation process of a content-addressable identifier is a cryptographic digest of the serialized content. Changing one bit of the serialization content will result in a different digest. Therefore, a self-referential content-addressable identifier requires a special derivation protocol.</p><p>The generation and verification protocol of a SAID—which makes it both content-addressable and self-referential—is outlined with an example&nbsp;below:</p>  Here is an example of a python dict with the empty field&nbsp;“said”.   {<br>  "said": "",<br>  "first": "Sue",<br>  "last": "Smith",<br>  "role": "Founder"<br>}   Serialize the data into JSON with no extra whitespace.  Replace the “said” field value in the serialization of data with a dummy string # of the same length as the to-be-generated SAID. Here, we use a Blake3–256 digest with 44 characters.   {"said":"############################################","first":"Sue",<br>"last ":"Smith","role":"Founder"}   Compute the digest (Blake3–256) of the serialization that includes the dummy value for the “said”&nbsp;field.   EJymtAC4piy_HkHWRs4JSRv0sb53MZJr8BQ4SMixXIVJ   The value of the “said” field is now replaced with the computed and encoded SAID to produce the final serialization with embedded&nbsp;SAID.  The final serialization may be converted to a python dict by deserializing the&nbsp;JSON.   {<br>  "said": "EJymtAC4piy_HkHWRs4JSRv0sb53MZJr8BQ4SMixXIVJ",<br>  "first": "Sue",<br>  "last": "Smith",<br>  "role": "Founder"<br>} <blockquote>Note: The SAID protocol preserves the insertion ordering of its content. That is, it preserves the order in which elements are added to a data structure</blockquote> Advantages of Using&nbsp;SAIDs <p>Here are some advantages of using SAIDs over other types of identifiers:</p>  SAIDs facilitate greater interoperability, reduced ambiguity, and enhanced security in the management of&nbsp;data.  A cryptographic commitment—such as a signature, digest, or another SAID—to a given SAID is essentially equivalent to a commitment to its associated serialization.  Any change to the serialization invalidates its SAID thereby ensuring secure immutability and evident reasoning with SAIDs about serializations or equivalently their&nbsp;SAIDs.  SAIDs facilitate immutably referenced data serializations for applications such as Verifiable Credentials and Ricardian Contracts.   ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) <p>An ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) is a variant of the Verifiable Credential (VC) that is designed to be used with other protocols in the KERI ecosystem.</p><p>ACDC or Authentic Chained Data Container has the following meaning:</p>  Authentic: ACDCs are authentic using digital signatures that are signed and verified by keys associated with&nbsp;AIDs.  Chained: ACDCs may be chained together as a directed acyclic&nbsp;graph.  Data Container: A data container is a serialized data structure of label-value pairs. That is, it is a way of bundling together data&nbsp;items.  <p>A Data Container is a way of bundling together data items. An Authentic Data Container (ADC), therefore, is a data container that provides cryptographic verifiability of the integrity and source of its bundled data. In other words, that data is both tamper-proof and is non-repudiably attributable to its source. Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs) are ADCs that are chained/linked together to provide granular proof-of-authorship (i.e., authenticity) of their contained data as a directed acyclic&nbsp;graph.</p><blockquote>Note: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of vertices and edges, with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed&nbsp;loop.</blockquote><p>As a variant of the VC, ACDCs share the same fundamental properties as traditional VCs. However, ACDCs are specifically designed to work with the KERI protocol and consequently benefit from its best-in-class security properties. Unlike W3C VC, ACDC also provides normative support for credential chaining. The features that distinguish ACDCs from traditional VCs will be discussed in detail later in this&nbsp;blog.</p><blockquote>Basically, you can think of ACDCs as VCs on steroids!</blockquote><blockquote>Note: As defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credentials">W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model v1.1</a>, a verifiable credential is a set of tamper-evident claims and metadata that cryptographically prove who issued it. This definition also applies to&nbsp;ACDCs.</blockquote> Simple ACDC&nbsp;Example <p>Here is an example of an ACDC from an issuer to an&nbsp;issuee:</p> {<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON000113_",<br>  "d": "EFprJkdpcJSet8aLY9PaMicyyUkEFnVjrIRZTmftmhkg",<br>  "i": "EmkPreYpZfFk66jpf3uFv7vklXKhzBrAqjsKAn2EDIPM",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EgveY4-9XgOcLxUderzwLIr9Bf7V_NHwY1lkFrn9y2PY",<br>    "i": "EQzFVaMasUf4cZZBKA0pUbRc9T8yUXRFLyM1JDASYqAA",<br>    "dt": "2021-06-09T17:35:54.169967+00:00"<br>  }<br>} <p>Here, each field has the following description:</p>  “v” is a version string that provides protocol type (ACDC), version (1.0), serialization type (JSON), the size of the ACDC in the lowercase hexadecimal notation (00113 = 1*16**2 + 1*16 + 3 = 275 characters), and the terminator character (_).  “d” is the SAID of the&nbsp;ACDC.  “i” is the AID of the&nbsp;issuer.  “a” is the block of attributes (claims) of the holder (i.e. the data subject).  <p>There are the following fields inside&nbsp;“a”:</p>  “d” is the SAID of the nested “a”&nbsp;block.  “i” is the AID of the&nbsp;holder.  “dt” is the date-time of the issuance.  <blockquote>Note 1: The primary field labels in ACDCs are compact, i.e., having only one or two characters. This design choice was made so that ACDC can support resource-constrained applications such as those in supply chains and&nbsp;IoT.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: an ACDC may be untargeted, that is an ACDC without a holder. An untargeted ACDC provides an undirected verifiable attestation or observation of a piece of data. For example, a thermometer may make verifiable non-repudiable temperature measurements and publish them as&nbsp;ACDCs.</blockquote> Naive Conversion to a W3C&nbsp;VC <p>The example ACDC above may be converted to a W3C Verifiable Credential (W3C VC) in a “naive” manner as&nbsp;follows:</p> {<br>  "@context": [<br>    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",<br>    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"<br>  ],<br>  "issuer": {<br>    "id": "EmkPreYpZfFk66jpf3uFv7vklXKhzBrAqjsKAn2EDIPM"<br>  },<br>  "validFrom": "2021-06-09T17:35:54.169967+00:00",<br>  "credentialSubject": {<br>    "id": "EQzFVaMasUf4cZZBKA0pUbRc9T8yUXRFLyM1JDASYqAA"<br>  }<br>} <p>This conversion is naive since some security properties of the ADCD are lost during the conversion. For example, the SAIDs of the ACDC and its attribute do not appear in the W3C&nbsp;VC.</p><p>A more secure conversion standard between ACDC and W3C VC is currently being developed by Kevin Griffin from GLEIF in this draft specification:</p>  <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/vc-acdc/">https://weboftrust.github.io/vc-acdc/</a>  <blockquote>Note: Unlike W3C VC, an ACDC does not have a “proof” section. A digital signature is attached to the ACDC using the CESR Proof Signature protocol.</blockquote> Distinguishing Features of&nbsp;ACDCs <p>ACDCs have features that distinguish them from traditional VCs. Some of the major distinguishing features&nbsp;include:</p>  The security model that is derived from&nbsp;KERI,  Compact formats for resource-constrained applications  Composable JSON&nbsp;Schema,  Support for credential chaining,  Support for Ricardian contracts,  Support for chain-link confidentiality, and  Support for graduated disclosure.   1. KERI Security&nbsp;Model <p>An ACDC inherits its security properties from the KERI protocol that enables the ACDC to be used in a portable but securely attributable, fully decentralized manner.</p><p>A security property that I would like to emphasize here is the one that emerges from using SAIDs as identifiers. In fact, all identifiers in ACDCs are SAIDs or URIs that contain SAIDs. Hence, a digital signature on an ACDC provides a cryptographic commitment to the ACDC itself as well as to all the data from which the SAIDs in ACDC were derived. Examples of SAIDs in an ACDC&nbsp;include:</p>  the top-level identifier of the ACDC itself and the identifiers of nested data blocks inside the ACDC: Using SAIDs as identifiers enable a compact but secure representation of the ACDC and associated blocks.  the identifier of ACDC’s issuer and holder: The identifiers of the issuer and the holder (i.e., the issuee) are autonomic identifiers (AIDs), which are SAIDs of the inception events of their key event logs (KELs). A digital signature on an ACDC can be verified using the issuer’s KEL while the holder may cryptographically prove its holdership over the ACDC using their&nbsp;KEL.  the identifier of the ACDC’s status registry: The status of an ACDC is determined by a status registry, called a transaction event log (TEL). The issuance and revocation events of an ACDC are recorded as TEL entries that are anchored to the KEL of the ACDC’s&nbsp;issuer.  the identifier of the ACDC’s schema: The schema of an ACDC is a JSON schema where the schema id field ("$id") is the SAID of the schema. This ensures that the ACDC schema is static and verifiable to the&nbsp;SAID.  <blockquote>Note: With the use of the SAID protocol, the schema of an ACDC is static, i.e. immutable. This makes the ACDC protected against the schema malleability attack where an adversary attacks the source that provides schema resources.</blockquote> 2. Compact ACDC&nbsp;Format <p>An ACDC may be expressed in multiple ways including in compacted or uncompacted formats. Simple examples of the same ACDC that is expressed in compacted or uncompacted formats are given&nbsp;below.</p> # Compacted ACDC variant<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON000119_",<br>  "d": "ECh56mUZGxTZtpiTrxaB7wZlQtRsD4N5pY5adc_B1748",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",   <br>  "ri": "EMrPQvNVXag7MtTXVNtOBtUmjBWj6QLpPH8QBqBITUH_",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": "EBkbsuJIH_8aCUKNFFpRjT5G5_YsQ6_pZrcrCVQFnzC3"<br>}  # Uncompacted ACDC variant<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON00018c_",<br>  "d": "EDycvNBB5c1cqvgOnCmwBPmcrk80bYyRVfc-G_351kO9",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "EMrPQvNVXag7MtTXVNtOBtUmjBWj6QLpPH8QBqBITUH_",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EBkbsuJIH_8aCUKNFFpRjT5G5_YsQ6_pZrcrCVQFnzC3",<br>    "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T00:30:16.261184+00:00",<br>    "name": "Jane Doe"<br>  }<br>} <p>Here two more fields are introduced:</p>  "s" is the SAID of the JSON Schema that is used to produce the&nbsp;ACDC.  "ri" is the identifier of the ACDC’s status registry.  <p>In the compacted variant, the value of "a" is the SAID of the attribute section, which is equal to the value of the digest "d" inside "a" of the uncompacted variant.</p><p>Compact ACDCs are useful in resourced-constrained applications where the receivers/verifiers of ACDCs may cache some piece of data with their SAIDs. Other uses of compact ACDCs will also be discussed in later sections of this&nbsp;blog.</p> 3. Composable JSON&nbsp;Schema <p>The schema used by ACDCs is the JSON Schema. The JSON Schema supports composable schema that enables the use of any combination of compacted and uncompacted sections and subsections in an ACDC. With this property, the ACDC’s verification protocol allows the same ACDC to be expressed in multiple forms while still being verifiable using the same digital signature from an&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>For the above examples of compacted and uncompacted ACDC, the schema of their attribute section "a" may be constructed with the keyword "OneOf" as&nbsp;follows:</p> {<br>  "a": {<br>    "oneOf": [<br>      {<br>        "description": "Attributes block SAID",<br>        "type": "string"<br>      },<br>      {<br>        "$id": "ELpLieummE-O6FzaQ7RW-yPV__x36x6XkmdFBr6ua7ec",<br>        "description": "Attributes block",<br>        "type": "object",<br>        "properties": {<br>          "d": {<br>            "description": "Attributes block SAID",<br>            "type": "string"<br>          },<br>          "i": {<br>            "description": "Holder's AID",<br>            "type": "string"<br>          },<br>          "dt": {<br>            "description": "Issuance date time",<br>            "type": "string",<br>            "format": "date-time"<br>          },<br>          "name": {<br>            "description": "Name",<br>            "type": "string"<br>          }<br>        },<br>        "additionalProperties": false,<br>        "required": [<br>          "d",<br>          "i",<br>          "name"<br>        ]<br>      }<br>    ]<br>  }<br>} <blockquote>Note: If an ACDC schema allows for multiple variants, the issuer of such an ACDC must digitally sign the most compacted variant. A verifier who subsequently receives an uncompacted variant may convert it into the most compacted variant before verifying it against the digital signature.</blockquote> 4. ACDC&nbsp;Chaining <p>Unlike the W3C VC data model, the ACDC specification provides normative support for credential chaining. Chaining between ACDCs forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the ACDCs are nodes in the graph. The directed edges between ACDCs are represented by field "e", which specifies the relationships between the connected ACDCs. A simple example is given below where an edge represents a mother-son relationship between Ms. Jane Doe and Mr. John&nbsp;Doe.</p> # An example ACDC that attests to the identity of Ms. Jane Doe.<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON00018c_",<br>  "d": "EDycvNBB5c1cqvgOnCmwBPmcrk80bYyRVfc-G_351kO9",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "EMrPQvNVXag7MtTXVNtOBtUmjBWj6QLpPH8QBqBITUH_",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EBkbsuJIH_8aCUKNFFpRjT5G5_YsQ6_pZrcrCVQFnzC3",<br>    "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T00:30:16.261184+00:00",<br>    "name": "Jane Doe"<br>  }<br>}  # An example ACDC that attests to the identity of Mr. John Doe. <br># The edge section indicates that Ms. Jane Doe is his mother. <br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON000203_",<br>  "d": "EFh8dlxwT2EjhknxNAP5xIhYmiurtGbeDQ-pS5jOaOlE",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "ECHkWfh71fLmkeJpeMvic6RQp5P73PizTGQelXB7ZNEE",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EFFD47E5Ev1zJF3zIagGEM7kbTI9DoT3scItzDPq9Jnm",<br>    "i": "EKW8xHilZH8-CetHzBOddWpG0bS_vJlphrK3zh95u0zF",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T01:07:44.885411+00:00",<br>    "name": "John Doe"<br>  },<br>  "e": {<br>    "d": "EE12DuT-V4IPumKmRsirulOeroO38aCEb4mjKy8SlE0m",<br>    "mother": {<br>      "n": "EDycvNBB5c1cqvgOnCmwBPmcrk80bYyRVfc-G_351kO9"<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>The edge section "e" is the representation of the directed edge that originates from the embedding ACDC. Inside the edge section, the fields have the following meanings:</p>  "d" is the SAID of the edge&nbsp;section.  "n" is the SAID of the ACDC to which the edge is directed, i.e., the SAID of Ms. Jane Doe’s&nbsp;ACDC.  <blockquote>Note: The edge section may also be compacted using the section’s SAID.</blockquote> 5. Ricardian Contracts <p>An ACDC may consist of a rule section "r" to provide a Ricardian Contract. To satisfy the properties of a Ricardian contract, the rule section may be hierarchically structured into sections and subsections with named or numbered clauses in each section. The labels on the clauses may follow such a hierarchical structure using nested maps or&nbsp;blocks.</p><blockquote>Note: A Ricardian contract is a type of digital contract that combines legal and financial terms with computer-readable code. It aims to create a machine-readable representation of a legal agreement by embedding the terms of the contract within a digital document. This approach allows both humans and machines to interpret and execute the contract.</blockquote><p>An example of an ACDC with a rule section for warranty and liability disclaimers is given&nbsp;below.</p> # An example ACDC with a rule section<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON0003e0_",<br>  "d": "EKZ0qdcyz2Mpl9QNuP0p1Sd0vr1Ov4g4wsDeZ7DJqGh6",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "ECHkWfh71fLmkeJpeMvic6RQp5P73PizTGQelXB7ZNEE",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EDhg1jZaNPJdYpiNwQRsjlZMiXF6XYAzlNhgkGBfXwMb",<br>    "i": "EKW8xHilZH8-CetHzBOddWpG0bS_vJlphrK3zh95u0zF",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T01:14:49.919153+00:00",<br>    "name": "John Doe"<br>  },<br>  "r": {<br>    "d": "ENyB1FGejfsC2MoYXJO9WOFJttmB3lw5NC0y_dSBPlq0",<br>    "usageDisclaimer": {<br>      "l": "Usage of a valid, unexpired, and non-revoked credential does not assert that the holder is trustworthy, honest, reputable in its business dealings, safe to do business with, or compliant with any laws or that an implied or expressly intended purpose will be fulfilled."<br>    },<br>    "issuanceDisclaimer": {<br>      "l": "All information in a valid, unexpired, and non-revoked credential is accurate as of the date the validation process was complete. The credential has been issued to the person named in the credential as the subject."<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>In the rule&nbsp;section,</p>  "r" is the rule section of the&nbsp;ACDC.  "d" is the SAID of the rule&nbsp;section.  "l" is the text of a Ricardian contract&nbsp;clause.  <blockquote>Note: A rule section and its subsections may be compacted using the section’s and subsections’ SAIDs, respectively.</blockquote> 6. Chain-Link Confidentiality <p>One of the most important features of ACDCs (using their rule sections "r") is support for Chain-Link Confidentiality that imposes contractual restrictions and liability on a recipient (i.e. a disclosee) of confidential information. This property provides a powerful mechanism for the protection of personal data and confidential information.</p><p>The concept was first coined by Woodrow Hartzog and is defined as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>“A chain-link confidentiality regime would contractually link the disclosure of personal information to obligations to protect that information as the information moves downstream. The system would focus on the relationships not only between the discloser of information and the initial recipient but also between the initial recipient and subsequent recipients.”</blockquote><blockquote>[Woodrow Hartzog. “Chain-link confidentiality.” Georgia Law Review 46 (2011):&nbsp;657.]</blockquote><p>This approach links recipients of information in a chain, with each recipient bound by the same obligation to protect the information. These chain contracts would contain at least three kinds of&nbsp;terms:</p>  obligations and restrictions on the use of the disclosed information,  requirements to bind future recipients to the same obligations and restrictions; and  requirements to perpetuate the contractual chain.  <p>An exchange of an ACDC compatible with chain-link confidentiality starts with a disclosure offer from a discloser to a recipient. This offer includes a metadata ACDC with the information to be disclosed such that the recipient can agree to those terms. Once the recipient has accepted the terms (with a non-repudiable digital signature) then full disclosure of ACDC may be&nbsp;made.</p>A simple example of chain-link confidentiality. 7. Graduated Disclosure <p>A discloser of an ACDC may choose not to reveal the entire content of the ACDC in their initial interaction with the recipient. Instead, the discloser may opt to partially or selectively present the information contained within the ACDC that is needed to further a transaction with the recipient—i.e., revealing only the information that is necessary for the recipient to continue the interaction. Subsequently, the discloser would disclose further information only after the recipient agrees to the terms established by the discloser. This process may involve multiple steps, where the discloser progressively reveals more information as the recipient consents to additional terms. This process is called graduated disclosure.</p><blockquote>Note: Here, “graduated” means “arranged in a series” or “divided into different levels.”</blockquote><p>ACDC leverages graduated disclosure that enables adherence to the principle of least disclosure, which is expressed as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>The system should disclose only the minimum amount of information about a given party needed to facilitate a transaction and no&nbsp;more.</blockquote><p>ACDCs employ three types of graduated disclosure mechanisms, including compact, partial, and selective disclosures. Different types of disclosure may be defined as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Compact disclosure: Compact disclosure of an ACDC discloses the SAID of its content (blocks or sections of the ACDC). Both partial and selective disclosure rely on compact disclosure.  Partial disclosure: The content of an ACDC can be partially disclosed via the exchange of only the SAID of a given content block, i.e., using compact disclosure. The SAID of a content block provides a cryptographically equivalent commitment to the yet-to-be-disclosed content. A later exchange of the uncompacted content is verifiable to an earlier partial disclosure. Another type of partial disclosure is the disclosure of metadata about the&nbsp;content.  Selective disclosure: In selective disclosure, the set of attributes is provided as an array of blinded blocks, where each attribute in the set has its own dedicated blinded block. A selectively-disclosable attribute section appears at the top level using the field label A, which is distinct from the field label a for a non-selectively-disclosable attribute section.  <p>To give an example that demonstrates the difference between partial and selective disclosure, let’s consider the following attribute block&nbsp;a:</p> # An example of an attribute block "a"<br>"a": {<br>  "d": "EA5Fm9mP5tWreQTw2xjiXYDDGzuPVtqyfekYIz6y2jMY",<br>  "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k",<br>  "name": "Jane Doe",<br>  "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, USA"<br>} <p>With selective disclosure, the attribute block may be transformed into a selectively-disclosable attribute block as&nbsp;follows:</p> # An example of a selectively-disclosable attribute block "A"<br>"A": [<br>  {<br>    "d": "EJ1FZBKhdVcAiaZS6eHAHMrL_ANysjLkyyOXTyAEA-lb",<br>    "u": "0AAJ1MJgB3aqLHNencIF-CcH",<br>    "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k"<br>  },<br>  {<br>    "d": "EL1EbFKUR_brFCt3knKOW92STd67AuNbRfmUzgplV12G",<br>    "u": "0ABLGaIT_A5yLMDEBUCCPaF7",<br>    "name": "Jane Doe"<br>  },<br>  {<br>    "d": "EN-gWdH5AWQwfdyGmK6CSA5ciXKZbvTYEvKXaSE-74rL",<br>    "u": "0AAlI8guN7866YoSeK7cZR5M",<br>    "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, USA"<br>  }<br>] <p>where each selectively-disclosable block has its own SAID d and a random universally unique identifier (UUID)&nbsp;"u".</p><p>By using random UUIDs for each selectively-disclosable block, an adversary—which possesses both the schema of the attribute block and its SAID—is not able to discover the remaining contents of the attribute block in a computationally feasible manner by using, e.g., a rainbow table attack. Therefore the UUID "u" field of each attribute block enables the associated SAID "d" field to securely blind the block’s contents.</p><blockquote>Note 1: The field labels of the selectively disclosable attributes are also blinded because they only appear within the blinded block. This prevents un-permissioned correlation via contextualized variants of a field label that appear in a selectively disclosable block.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: The primary difference between partial disclosure and selective disclosure is determined by the correlatability with respect to its encompassing block after its disclosure. A partially disclosable field becomes correlatable to its encompassing block after its disclosure whereas a selectively disclosable field does not. After selective disclosure, the selectively disclosed fields are not correlatable to the so-far undisclosed but selectively disclosable fields in the same encompassing block.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e">KERI jargon in a nutshell.

     <p>The US Department of the Treasury has <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf">published</a> its first illicit finance risk assessment of decentralized finance (DeFi).</p> 
     <p>This is a major development for the financial crime space, as it clarifies important points about the US government’s view on what the biggest risks in DeFi are, and what anti-financial crime responses are needed to address them.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>Here are some of the key findings from the assessment:</p> 
       
       It calls out illicit activity from cyber thefts, ransomware and scams as among the types of criminal activity that may be perpetrated in the DeFi space, or that may use DeFi services for money laundering.<br><br>  
       The Treasury highlights that: “The primary vulnerability that illicit actors exploit stems from non-compliance by DeFi services with anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) and sanctions obligations.” In this case, the Treasury warns that even decentralized services engaged in regulated activity could fall within the scope of AML/CFT regulations and may face compliance obligations.&nbsp;<br><br>  
       The department indicates it is undertaking a review to close gaps in the US AML/CFT framework that allow certain DeFi services to operate outside of the regulatory perimeter.&nbsp;<br><br>  
       It also calls out poor cybersecurity controls among DeFI services, which leaves them vulnerable to hacks.&nbsp;<br><br>  
       The Treasury warns of the money laundering risks that DEXs and DeFi bridges pose in terms of enabling cross-chain laundering.&nbsp;<br><br>  
       It warns also of proliferation finance risks, given North Korea's use of DeFi services – both to raise funds through hacking and theft, and laundering funds through the DeFi ecosystem.&nbsp;<br><br>  
       The department highlights the transparency of the blockchain as a critical tool in combating financial crime in DeFi, noting that “a wallet address publicly identified with a hack may be the subject of intense public scrutiny, making it hard to launder proceeds in that wallet, even though its owner remains unknown”.  
       
     <p>The Treasury also cites Elliptic’s recent <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/reports/the-state-of-cross-chain-crime-2022/">State of Cross-Chain Crime</a> report, noting that ransomware actors laundered more than $50 million through DeFi services in the first half of 2022.</p>

 It’s not about signing; it’s about the use case 
<p>In this two-part blog series we provide an overview of the problems around digitization, specifically on the challenges with remote signatures and some of the options available to limit the risks of fraud and increase confidence in your signing process.</p>
<p>The move to electronic signatures over pen-and-paper ones did not start with the COVID-19 pandemic – in fact, most of today’s laws regulating the use of electronic signatures were published in the early 2000s to facilitate the growing needs of online commerce.</p>
<p>But, it’s fair to say that the pandemic did represent an important transition in the world of digitization and electronic signing: Within the last two years, electronic signatures went from a “nice to have” – and organizations who deployed them were considered innovative – to a must-have that’s here to stay. Electronic signature solutions provide so much more traceability and efficiency than the traditional pen-and-paper version that there is little chance you would think about reverting to print &amp; sign.</p>
<p>What you may be wondering, however, is how to digitize the rest of your signature and other approval processes that still rely on in-person, face-to-face interactions. These processes are typically high-value and considered critical to a business; you may be reluctant to digitize them over fear that using a remote signature would increase risks of fraud, impersonation, document repudiation, nullification, etc.</p>
<p>Signatures are evidence of intent, consent… and identity</p>
<p>The admissibility of an electronic signature very much depends on the law(s) and regulation(s) that apply to your organization, and your local attorney will be best positioned to advise you on the specific requirements for your signatures.</p>
<p>Some industries are good at providing frameworks to enable remote business while mitigating the risk of fraud. For example, the banking sector is known for its strong regulations and standards for identity verification (i.e., Anti-Money Laundering, Know-Your-Customer, etc.) and these can easily be reused as part of a signing process.</p>
<p>But your organization’s industry may not have come up with such standards yet. If you are looking for solutions to ensure that your signatories are properly identified before they sign your documents remotely to limit your risks, there are several options for you to consider – and for which Entrust can help:</p>
 
 ID or passport checking software/service 
 Identity verification services from a publicly trusted certification authority (CA) – or a qualified trust service provider (QTSP) in the European Union 
 Private or national eID schemes 
 
<p>Therefore a good first step toward the digitization of your business-critical processes is to work out which of these options would be suitable for your organization from a security, legal, and compliance point of view. Definitions and requirements for electronic signatures vary across countries and states; this is why electronic signature requirements should always be discussed on a case-by-case basis with your legal department and/or an attorney.</p>
<p>Software and services related to identity verification are ideal when you are looking to fully own and control the process. However, not all solutions in the market are designed to be used as part of a remote signing process, so it’s important to pick the solution adapted to your specific use case(s).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most widely used option for remote electronic signatures that provide strong evidence of the signatory’s identity and consent to sign, is to work with public CAs (and QTSPs if you are in the European Union). These authorities specialize in verifying identities of organizations and people as part of a signing process. The verified identity details are issued in special credentials called digital certificates, which can in turn can be used to generate digital signatures.</p>
<p>Finally, eID schemes are becoming more and more prominent, especially in the European Union thanks to the eIDAS Regulation, but remain limited to certain industries or countries. In the second part of this blog series, we will provide further insights into digital signatures and eID schemes, but you can already <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-signing/digital-signing-as-a-service/remote-signing-service/rss-infographic">check out our Digital Signing 101 infographic</a>, and learn more about our signing-related solutions here:</p>

			 The New Financial World: AI Meets Tokenization 
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain are two groundbreaking technologies that have the potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance and investment. When combined, they can create powerful synergies that enable more efficient and optimized decision-making processes. The prospect of these two potent and transformative technologies intertwining is thrilling, yet somewhat daunting, given their virtually limitless potentials.</p>
<p>Tokeny has always been at the forefront of technology. In fact,&nbsp;in 2018 we started to bridge AI with tokenization. Identity checks of individual investors are already greatly accelerated by the KYC software solutions that are integrated into our onboarding processes. The software compares investors’ identity documents with the information and “liveness” tests by using AI-powered face scans to verify the user matches the photo on authorized documents. Furthermore, our tokenization platform represents these ID verifications on the blockchain with on-chain identities, which makes these certifications actionable. Token issuers, DeFi protocols, and other relevant users can trust these identity proofs to enforce compliance or filter their participants.</p>
<p>However, this example is just the tip of the iceberg. We believe that AI’s ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data with speed and accuracy is invaluable in the financial realm. It can&nbsp;help investors and financial institutions make better-informed decisions&nbsp;by identifying patterns, trends, and correlations that may go unnoticed by human analysts, or simply take too much time to find. AI algorithms can analyze market data, news articles, social media sentiment, and other relevant information to generate real-time insights and predictions on markets and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>One area where AI excels already is in portfolio optimization. By utilizing advanced algorithms, AI can identify optimal investment strategies based on an investor’s risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. It can analyze historical market data, perform risk assessments, and make dynamic adjustments to portfolios, ensuring they remain aligned with the investor’s objectives. This already exists and is continually evolving at an outrageous speed.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;without a programmable financial infrastructure, it would be too complex for AI applications to take action&nbsp;based on their conclusions, and achieve the goals requested by its owner. An AI agent cannot easily open a bank account, move money, buy and sell assets, or anything in that nature.</p>
<p>Here is where blockchain technology comes into play: Blockchain networks provide a programmable and secure infrastructure that enhances the transparency, integrity, and trustworthiness of financial transactions, and enables programs to access valuable financial resources. By leveraging blockchain, AI systems can access real-time, tamper-proof market data and execute trades directly on decentralized protocols.</p>
<p>Indeed, smart contracts, a key feature of blockchain technology, enable the automation of financial agreements and transactions. AI algorithms can leverage smart contracts to autonomously execute predefined investment strategies, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs.&nbsp;Artificial intelligence decides, and the blockchain executes.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Our prediction is that the integration of AI and blockchain technologies has the potential to optimize financial and investment decisions in a variety of ways. AI’s data analysis capabilities can provide real-time insights and assist in portfolio optimization, while blockchain networks enhance transparency and automation. Together, they enable more efficient and trustworthy financial services, paving the way for a future where decentralized and AI-powered systems play a central role in optimizing our financial decisions.</p>
<p>Blockchain networks are the programmable financial infrastructure that AI has been missing. Now the technology is there, the only missing part is a large selection of tokenized assets.</p>
<p>What do you think about AI: Opportunity, or the path to apocalypse?</p>

<p><a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-2-2023-bluesky-beta-app">Since our last update</a>, quite a bit has changed. Just a few months ago in February, we only had a couple hundred users, and in April, we crossed 50,000 users. We recently passed 100,000 users, and are excited that so many people have joined us. Our priorities continue to be a focus on moderation and curation to ensure a safe and pleasant environment for users, and protocol work to launch federation.</p>
 Recently Released Features 
 
 Custom feeds. Users can have more ownership over their social media experience by <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">picking the algorithms</a> that power their feeds. So far, third-party developers have created feeds ranging from mutuals only, first posts from new users, cat photos, the #nba hashtag, and more. 
 Blocks and mutelists. Blocks on Bluesky prevent interaction, and organizations and community leaders can maintain shared mutelists for others to subscribe to. 
 More fine-grained content moderation controls. Users are able to select hide, warn, or show for content categories ranging from nudity to impersonation. 
 Custom domains as handles. Both individuals and organizations can set their account handle to their domain, creating a unique identifier across the network. Read our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">tutorial here</a> for how to set this up. 
 Production desktop app. We launched the desktop web app at <a href="https://bsky.app/">https://bsky.app/</a>. 
 Invite codes per account. We added server-level tooling to distribute invites on a regular cadence. Previously, accounts did not have invite codes of their own. 
 Accessibility improvements. We added alt text to images, an improved dark mode, and more. 
 App passwords. We released this as a short-term solution for people to use with third-party apps while we continue to work on Single Sign-On (SSO).

 The AT Protocol Developer Ecosystem 
<p>As the number of beta testers on Bluesky continues to grow, so too does the size of our developer community. Recent updates from our team include:</p>
 
 Open-sourced client. We published the code that powers the Bluesky social app <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app">publicly on GitHub</a> and are accepting community contributions (but please read the rules and guidelines first!). 
 Feed generator starter kit. We published a <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator">GitHub repository with a template</a> for developers to build custom feeds. 
 Community documentation. We’ve published a <a href="https://atproto.com/community">community page</a> on our <a href="https://atproto.com/">protocol documentation site</a> with links to a quick start guide, community projects, and developer groups to join. 
 
<p>To see projects from community developers, you can visit <a href="https://atproto.com/community/projects">this page</a>, or if you have a Bluesky account, check out the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atproto.com">@atproto.com</a> account. Some highlights include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/connect-bluesky-to-flipboard/">Flipboard</a> added Bluesky integration, so now you can browse Bluesky content from within Flipboard 
 Skylink is a <a href="https://skylinkchrome.com/">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://skylinkff.com">Firefox</a> extension that detects if the domain is linked to a Bluesky profile as you browse the web, which really exemplifies the “social internet” 
 <a href="https://bsky.jazco.dev/">Atlas</a> maps the social clusters on the network, and is a fun way of visualizing communities joining the beta 
 <a href="https://skyfeed.app/">SkyFeed</a> surfaced custom feeds even before we released them in the official Bluesky app 
 
 Roadmap and Growth 
<p>A few weeks ago, we intentionally slowed our invite roll-out while we built more moderation tooling and capacity for users on the app. We staffed a content moderation team with shifts that cover a 24/7 schedule, and consulted with trust and safety experts to establish new processes and policies to support a growing userbase. We’ve resumed sending out daily invites to the <a href="https://bsky.app/">waitlist</a>, which is where the majority of users already on Bluesky received their invites. For those who don’t know someone personally with an invite code, the waitlist is the fastest way to receive a code, though please be patient as we work through the list.</p>
<p>We recently shared our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/5-5-2023-federation-architecture">technical architecture for federation</a> and are releasing a sandbox environment for developers to test soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who have used the feedback form within the app; we’ve heard your product feedback over the last few months. In the near future, you can expect these features and improvements as we move towards federation:</p>
 
 Improved labeling, reporting, and related moderation tooling 
 Account portability between servers 
 Updated community guidelines for the app 
 Protocol documentation and specifications 
 
<p>Meanwhile, we’re actively hiring. If you’re eager to join our effort to build the open social web, please apply to one of the listings on our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/join">jobs page</a>.</p>
 Giving Feedback 
<p>When the population of beta testers was even in the tens of thousands, it was still fairly manageable for the team to receive bug reports and requests from tags and mentions directly in the app. However, this method of feedback does not scale, so we’ve implemented some changes to our preferred feedback routes. Please do not tag the entire team’s personal profiles for bug reports or support requests in the app — this makes it difficult to surface important notifications. Instead:</p>
 
 To flag specific posts or profiles for the team’s attention, please use the in-app reporting feature. Our mods review every report we receive. 
 For bug reports or app feedback, please use the feedback form in the app itself (located in the side menu on mobile or the right side on desktop). 
 If you’re familiar with GitHub, you can also file an issue <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social">on our repos</a>, though please read our contribution guidelines in the README first. 
 For support requests, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a>. 
 For security reports, please email us at <a href="mailto:security@bsky.app">security@bsky.app</a> or visit <a href="https://bsky.app/.well-known/security.txt">https://bsky.app/.well-known/security.txt</a>.

 Stakers can claim DF39 rewards. DF40 runs Jun 1 — Jun 8,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 40 is here&nbsp;(DF40).</p><p>DF40 is the 12th week of DF Main, the final phase of DF. This week, users can earn rewards up to 150K OCEAN. In DF Main, weekly rewards will grow to 1M+&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>In DF40 we’re introducing the ability for participants to engage in veOCEAN Delegation via our <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/delegate">df.oceandao.org</a> portal. This enables users with multiple wallets, apy optimizers, and new mechanisms to be built upon Data Farming’s Active Rewards&nbsp;stream.</p><p>The article <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">“Ocean Data Farming Main is Here”</a> has the full details of DF Main. In fact, it’s a self-contained description of Ocean Data Farming (DF), including all the details that matter. It is up-to-date with the latest reward function, weekly OCEAN allocation, and estimates of APYs given the current amount of OCEAN&nbsp;staked.</p><p>DF is like DeFi liquidity mining or yield farming, but is tuned to drive data consume volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards stakers with OCEAN who allocate voting power to curate data assets with high&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>To participate, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">users lock OCEAN to receive veOCEAN</a>, then allocate veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs) via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/data">DF&nbsp;dapp</a>.</p><p>DF39 counting started 12:01am May 25, 2023 and ended 12:01am Jun 1. You can claim them at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF40 is live and will conclude on Jun 08,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>DF Round 40 (DF40) is the 12th week of DF Main. Details of DF Main can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards (section 2), and DF40 overview (section 3), and the introduction of veOCEAN Delegation.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As a participant, follow these step on how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  Passive and Active Rewards are distributed on Ethereum mainnet. Click “Claim”, sign the tx, and collect your&nbsp;rewards  <p>Rewards accumulate over weeks so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF40&nbsp;Overview <p>DF40 is part of DF Main, phase 1. This phase emits 150K OCEAN / week and runs for 52 weeks total. (A detailed DF Main schedule is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.)</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Some key parameters:</p>  Total budget is 150,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  <p>Active rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>For further details, see the “<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#c9d1">DF Reward Function Details”</a> in DF Main Appendix.</p><p>As usual, the Ocean core team reserves the right to update the DF rewards function and parameters, based on observing behavior. Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 4. Introducing veOCEAN Delegation <p>To continue improving accessibility and composability of Data Farming, delegation has been introduced into the UI, and integrated into Active&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>Starting in DF40 participants can delegate their Allocation Power via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/delegate">df.oceandao.org/delegate</a> to facilitate coordination between wallets, apy optimizers, or to engineer novel mechanisms.</p><p>This is the same implementation as veCRV’s veDelegate mechanism and has been available for a close to 1 year. However it’s delegation mechanism is now woven into Data Farming’s Active Rewards&nbsp;stream.</p><p>Addresses being delegated to will start receiving the rewards generated by participating in Data Farming and helping to curate quality assets that generate DCV (Data Consume&nbsp;Volume).</p> 4.1 Steps to delegate your&nbsp;veOCEAN   Go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/delegate">DF Portal — Delegate</a> and enter or copy the wallet address you wish to delegate to into the ‘Receiver wallet address’&nbsp;field.  Click the Delegate button and sign the transaction. You can view information about your delegation in the My Delegations component.  If needed, you can cancel the delegation to regain your Allocation Power before the delegation expires.   4.2 Steps after delegation. <p>When you delegate, you transfer 100% of your veOCEAN Allocation Power for a limited period. After delegation, you cannot manage your allocations until the delegation expires.</p><p>The delegation expiration date is the same as the veOCEAN lock end date at the time of delegation. If necessary, you can extend your lock before delegating.</p><p>If you extend your lock, you have to update your delegation.</p><p>You can cancel your delegation at any&nbsp;time.</p> Conclusion <p>DF39 has completed. To claim rewards, go to<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF40 begins Jun 1, 2023 at 12:01am UTC. It ends Jun 08, 2023 at 12:01am&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>DF40 is part of DF Main. For this phase of DF Main, the rewards budget is 150K OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>Starting in DF40 participants can delegate their Allocation Power via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/delegation">df.oceandao.org</a> to improve their UX when engaging with Data Farming and Active&nbsp;Rewards.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Flux is a fully distributed, human-centered platform that facilitates social coordination with greater privacy, agency, and flexibility. With a Discord style design for communities to grow on, Flux is customizable open-source software made for Web3 integrations.</p> Flux at a Glance <p>Description: Flux is a fully distributed, Discord style platform.</p>  Website: <a href="https://fluxsocial.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Fluxsocial.io</a>  Developer Docs: <a href="https://docs.fluxsocial.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">docs.fluxsocial.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp?ref=blog.holochain.org">discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/flux_social?ref=blog.holochain.org">@flux_social</a>   Why is Flux being built? <p>When using traditional social media applications you are always restricted by the feature sets that the developers of that specific app have decided to implement. Discord, Facebook, Slack, and others are all implementing features like events, chat, groups, posts etc. The vision for Flux is to become a general purpose platform for collaboration. Community members themselves decide which features they want to install using our plugin store. And any developer can extend their community’s plugins by developing their own.</p> Why did they choose Holochain? <p>Flux is built on AD4M, which is an agent-centric framework for decentralized social applications. The core of AD4M uses Holochain, which makes Flux extendable and customizable while ensuring validation rules are enforced. </p><p>Flux, as a project, grew out of Junto which had set out to build a social media platform using Holochain where people held their own data. As it developed Junto shifted focus to more intimate communities, becoming Flux. The importance of agent-centricity and data ownership remains however. So while there are many p2p technologies out there, Holochain continues to be a key tool for delivering on this vision.</p> Flux Ecosystem Session <p>Get a hands on view of Flux as David Atkinson downloads and uses the app with the Flux team in an ecosystem session.</p> Can you say more about the collaborative potential of Flux? <p>While the collaborative nature of Flux seems apparent in its basic Discord-like features, its true power lies beneath the surface. First, as an AD4M app, Flux is completely interoperable with any other AD4M app — meaning you can see data from Flux in any other UI built over AD4M. This means you could turn chat messages into “to-do” stickies in a different view, without actually duplicating or siloing any data. Because AD4M decouples data from the front-end, it’s super simple to develop new apps or UIs, deploy them, and invite others to use them with you. In this way, Flux is a fully evolvable and extendable platform in which any user can develop new features and put them into play with others. </p> How are they using Holochain? <p>AD4M is a sort of spanning layer that connects lots of different protocols together, from Ethereum to AWS. AD4M uses Holochain to store these connections and ensure their security. While it is designed to connect all of these different protocols together, AD4M needs Holochain to bootstrap everything and make it open, resilient, and scalable.</p><p>In many ways AD4M is an extension upon Holochain, taking the same root ideas of agent-centricity, and giving them access to all of these other systems to interact with. Holochain is the key enabler of this social technology.</p> Can you say a little about your experience developing on Holochain? <p>The way that Flux accesses Holochain through the AD4M spanning layer makes it even easier to build applications on Holochain as the SDK really feels like working with a traditional real time database like Firebase! This is a different way of interacting with Holochain than most developer teams have, but we really think that this is just the beginning of all the ways this technology will be used. We are learning and building alongside Holochain with excitement for the future. </p> How can I get involved? <p>Join the AD4M Discord, where you can connect with us about Flux and other AD4M apps: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp?ref=blog.holochain.org">discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp</a><br><br>Try Flux yourself! First download ad4m (<a href="https://ad4m.dev/download/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ad4m.dev/download</a>), and then connect to Flux (<a href="https://app.fluxsocial.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">app.fluxsocial.io/</a>) and join our test community.</p>

<p>In preparing to welcome students back to campus at the beginning of each year, semester, or quarter, many higher education institutions struggle with managing the process of registering students. With 80% to 90% of school identification cards printed during a short registration period, it’s not uncommon for campuses to experience long lines of students crammed into small registration offices waiting to receive their credentials. And, with a greater focus on school security and safety, campuses are increasingly adopting secure identification credentials to help mitigate unauthorized access into campus facilities.</p>
<p>With our expert guidance, you can learn how to ensure your card printers perform consistently and produce high-quality student ID credentials while minimizing costs and security risks. These best practices will help ensure your student ID program is ready so you can confidently and seamlessly welcome students back to campus.</p>
<p>Here are three essential tips every campus card office needs to know now:</p>
 
 Ensuring proper maintenance of your ID card printers 
 
<p>To ensure optimal printer performance for your student ID program, it’s crucial that the printer is cleaned according to manufacturer recommendations. We recommend cleaning after every 500 cards are printed or every ribbon change. Cleaning regularly will significantly reduce cost as well as technical cleaning, which requires the services of a technician and can be costly. Additionally, regular cleaning ensures that your printer consistently prints high-quality cards every time, that your credential administrators have a better user experience, that printer downtime as well as service calls are minimized, and that the life of the printer and printhead are extended.</p>
 
 Minimizing costs 
 
<p>You can do several things before the next school year begins that will help reduce future maintenance and service costs. As mentioned above, if you clean your printer with care, you will reduce the number of service requests and calls, as well as waste. This also helps extend the printhead life, which means fewer replacements to pay for. We also recommend testing your card stock and card technology to ensure they are compatible with your printer. Another thing to look at is your supplies inventory to prevent last-minute purchases. Do you have everything you need to start the school year strong? Finally, follow the printer User Guide’s storage and shelf-life recommendations to extend the printer’s life as long as possible.</p>
 
 Reducing security risks 
 
<p>ID credential issuance manufacturers often release updates regularly to enhance security. Take advantage of each update – don’t ignore them; they are there for a reason. It’s also important to follow through with any recommended software driver and firmware updates to minimize the possibility of security breaches. Ensure you have the latest version of Instant ID software to resolve any existing software and hardware issues.</p>

				  Your product or service lives and dies by your brand. So how can you make sure your brand is remembered and leaves a good impression? It all starts with user experience. In this article we’ll look at how UX impacts your brand, a few tips and tricks, and look at Indicio’s approach.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>It is typically said that you only get one chance at a first impression. Unfortunately, when it comes to new technologies, that often means it can’t just “work;” it also needs to look and feel enticing enough to the end user to get them to try it in the first place — and come back for more.</p>
<p>In the decentralized identity space, many companies are working on creating digital wallets to store digital identities using verifiable credentials that are held on the end user’s mobile device. Unfortunately, given the sheer number of options people have with apps on phones, it’s not a surprise that a recent survey found roughly 25% of apps are used only once after being downloaded.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Percentage of apps used only once by year</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Chart credit: <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271628/percentage-of-apps-used-once-in-the-us/%20">https://www.statista.com/statistics/271628/percentage-of-apps-used-once-in-the-us/&nbsp;</a></p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>So how do we make sure that digital wallet apps don’t suffer this fate? Verifiable credentials have to be useful. The more useful they are, the more people can do with them in everyday life, the more they will be used. But that alone isn’t a guarantee of success. Digital wallets and verifiable credentials have to be easy to understand and easy to use. That’s obvious, right? But even that is not enough: They must be visually attractive. A <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265002981_Visual_Appeal_vs_Usability_Which_One_Influences_User_Perceptions_of_a_Website_More">2009 study</a> examined the effects of visual appeal and usability on user satisfaction found that user satisfaction was higher when using websites with high visual appeal and low usability than when using a site with low visual appeal but high usability. That first impression counts — but it’s often the last thing teams will think about when creating innovative technology. If you’re wondering how long that first impression lasts, according to research done by Google you have just <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/38315.pdf">17 milliseconds</a> to “hook” someone. The secret sauce to doing that is providing a combination of low complexity and high prototypicality (basically what the user expects to see — most users will have an assumption in their mind of what an ecommerce site or blog should look like and how they can interact with it).</p>
<p>When it comes to UI/UX, Indicio employs a simple, clean design. “We want someone to be able to pick up this technology and be able to use it without having to put a lot of thought into it,” says Indicio’s VP of Operations Scott Harris. While we have a step-by-step guide for our Holdr+ app (our version of a digital wallet) and other customer-facing products, we recognize that users are busy, or simply don’t want to read an exhaustive manual (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article-abstract/28/1/27/2363584?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">only 25% of people read manuals</a> for consumer products), the shortest learning curve is the path to success.</p>
<p>If you’re building a decentralized identity solution and would like to review your UI/UX or discuss best practices, Indicio is happy to help. You can get in contact with our team <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">here</a>. And if you are just looking for a plug-and-play solution we can easily adjust <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a> or <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a> to fit your needs.</p>

<p>Detecting stolen and synthetic identities at the very front end of new account origination for every type of user can pay huge dividends but too often, tightening fraud controls can deliver an alienating experience to legitimate customers and impact employee onboarding. Recent reports reveal that identity fraud remains an escalating issue, resulting in annual losses exceeding $24 billion (USD). Consequently, the significance of accurate identity verification and robust fraud prevention measures cannot be overstated, as they directly impact your business’s profitability.</p>
<p>The digital landscape of our economy introduces vulnerabilities to the process of identity verification, necessitating organizations to fortify themselves against these threats. The digital identity verification arena is swiftly adapting to counter the expanding menace of fraud. Emerging tools and technologies are empowering numerous companies to validate a consumer’s true identity in real-time, prior to finalizing any transaction. Today, we explore six prevailing trends in the realm of identity verification.</p>
 
 Addressing Challenges with Hard-to-Verify, Underserved Populations<br>
Identity verification professionals are encountering difficulties in authenticating the identities of hard-to-verify populations, such as young adults and recent immigrants. These groups often lack conventional forms of identification or a presence in traditional data ecosystems, making their verification challenging. To tackle this issue, identity verification professionals are exploring <a href="https://www.enformion.com/alternative-credit-data-vital-information/">alternative data providers</a> that can facilitate better verification of these populations’ identities. 
 The Surge in Identity Theft and Synthetic Identity Fraud<br>
	The rise in identity theft and <a>synthetic identity fraud</a> poses a growing concern for identity verification professionals. Losses from synthetic identity fraud are projected to exceed $2.42 billion in 2023, emphasizing the crucial role of identity data in detecting fraudulent activities. Criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods, making it difficult for traditional identity verification solutions to detect fraudulent behavior. Consequently, there is a heightened focus on security and compliance as businesses strive to safeguard themselves and their customers from the financial and reputational damages resulting from identity theft. 
 Leveraging Identity Verification for KYC and KYB<br>
Identity verification for <a>know your customer (KYC)</a> is gaining importance as businesses strive to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations. Identity verification professionals are utilizing advanced technologies like machine learning and blockchain to enhance the identification and verification for KYC, assisting businesses in maintaining compliance and avoiding financial and reputational harm. 
 Mobile Identity Verification – The Rise of Phone-Based Identity Verification<br>
	Phone-based identity verification, also known as mobile identity verification, is gaining popularity as a means of verifying individuals’ identities. The increasing number of mobile users and the convenience of using mobile devices for identity verification are driving this trend. Identity verification professionals are harnessing the capabilities of mobile devices, such as Face ID and Touch ID, to enhance identity verification and detect fraudulent activities. This trend is expected to continue as mobile devices become even more ubiquitous and powerful. 
 Integration of Biometrics<br>
	Businesses are turning to biometrics integration to aid in identity verification. By utilizing biometric technologies, companies can verify client identities through fingerprints, facial recognition, and <a>LiveID</a>. With the prevalence of fingerprint and facial recognition technology in many mobile phones, more consumers are adopting these methods. In most cases, businesses can combine multiple biometric methods to increase the accuracy of identity recognition. 
 Consumer Concerns Driving the Need for Change<br>
44% of American consumers consider banking fraud and identity theft to be their top concerns according to a <a href="https://www.fico.com/en/newsroom/fico-survey-us-consumers-fear-bank-fraud-and-id-theft-more-terrorist-attack">report by FICO</a>. Financial institutions are also deeply worried about identity theft, given the annual losses of approximately $16.8 billion. Hence, there is a clear demand for action against identity theft.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Finance is one of the most tightly regulated sectors in the Western world, and not without reason. It forms the foundation on which modern welfare states are built on. Historically, it has been one of the most fragmented sectors within the European Union, as each of the member states had spent centuries co-evolving with their local finance providers. Each has adapted to local needs and has been shaped by local histories.</p>
 European Monetary Union 
<p>Slowly but surely, the European Commission is seeking to accomplish a true monetary union within the member states, mimicking the formation of the largest contemporary federal republic – the United States of America. The process has been far from a walk in the park, and there is still considerable work required before the “United States of Europe” becomes a sovereign superstate.</p>
<p>Adopting the Euro as a common currency was a major accomplishment towards the goal. Another important aspect, hidden from plain sight, is unifying the regulation between the member states. For the traditional banking sector, one of the most important regulatory frameworks is called the <a href="https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/index.htm">Basel Framework</a>. Now in the third iteration of the framework, it is often referred to as <a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm?m=">Basel III</a>. Banks are currently implementing the latest updates after the previous iterations, Basel I and Basel II.</p>
<p>Following the delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Commission has published its long-awaited proposal on implementing the final Basel III reforms. These reforms were required to be implemented in European law by January 1st, 2023.</p>
 What is the Goal of the Basel Framework? 
<p>The end goal has been clearly stated since the Basel I agreement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Taking a major step towards European unification by completing an EU-wide finance union and trying to prevent a continent-wide economic collapse by strengthening bank capital requirements, increasing minimum capital requirements, mandating the holdings of high-quality liquid assets, and decreasing bank leverage dynamically.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This has proved to be controversial from the start. To address the presented concerns, the Commission is expected to launch a public consultation on the review of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), and the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD).&nbsp;The implementation of the Basel III reforms is another major milestone towards the goals of the Commission.</p>
 Ongoing Issues in Implementing the Basel Framework 
<p>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the persistent inflation stemming from the extremely stimulatory monetary policy practiced by the European Central Bank (ECB) since the 2008 financial crisis, is far from over. It is likely to fuel arguments in favour of allowing more divergence in European law from the Basel III standard. For example, Nordic banks are currently operating at noticeably lower risk levels than major French and south European banks.</p>
<p>The Nordic banks have more of their assets tied to mortgages that are already stress-tested to 6% Euribor rates, instead of holding large quantities of sovereign debt from highly indebted southern European countries. In addition, the mortgages are typically valued at 70% of their face value, compared to 100% of the face value of sovereign debt. This is because the current regulation allows the assumption that a sovereign state cannot become insolvent – until of course one does, like Sri Lanka recently. EU-wide <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/nordic-banks-would-outperform-eu-peers-in-stress-test-worst-case-scenario-66008634">stress tests</a> clearly reflect the difference in resilience. If this difference will not be reflected in the regulatory environment, then banks that have historically operated at higher risk than their competitors – by, for example, not diversifying their assets clearly across asset classes – could gain an unfair advantage. We will see whether the inevitable Basel IV will address these concerns.</p>
<p>For private investors, not all of the changes have been positive. For example, artificially limiting access to non-EU markets and financial instruments helps to keep the fees of European brokers at much higher levels than their American and Asian counterparts. In addition, some EU countries continue to blatantly ignore both European law and national one-to-one agreements on taxation, instead pushing all the burden to correct double taxation to the private investors themselves. They are now faced with complex legal procedures in foreign languages with little to no help from the national authorities – who were supposed to handle everything automatically already, years ago.</p>
 Remote Identity Proofing 
<p>Many could argue therefore that the changes have been without a net benefit so far, but there is one positive change on the horizon. This change is about allowing one to create a strong digital identity via remote connection, without already possessing a strong electronic ID (eID). This is called remote identity proofing, and it could potentially change the fintech landscape dramatically throughout the whole European Union, by allowing its more than 300 million residents to utilise financial services in all of the 27 member states, without having to physically travel. </p>
<p>The identity verification process is necessary to fulfil the legal requirements of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) legislation. Despite the common misunderstanding, identity verification does not, by itself, represent any kind of trustworthy relationship between the end user and the organisation. Unlike the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable LEI</a>, for example.</p>
 How Remote Identity Proofing Works 
<p>The verification would traditionally be carried out in person, by verifying a physical identity document and comparing the photograph of the holder of the document to their face in real life. For remote identity proofing, the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/">European Telecommunications Standards Institute</a> (ETSI), an independent organisation that standardises norms at the European level, has created a standard framework for remote identity proofing.</p>
<p>The standard recognises identification through video in a live stream, with the recording of the entire process, as the only way that remote identity proofing can have the same level of legal compliance as a physical face-to-face verification. This repeats what is already stipulated in the eIDAS regulation for the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI, often referred to as EU ID or EUID). This is as opposed to using still photographs or selfies, which have high fraud rates and therefore are not eIDAS compliant.</p>
<p>The first national launches of the EUDI are scheduled for 2024, and a continent-wide rollout will hopefully follow soon after. That will bring strong individual identities to the masses, then it’s time for the other half: strong organisational identities.

<p>Consumer demand for intuitive digital services has changed the way we approach everything, including banking. We are moving from a primarily in-person service model to an anytime, anywhere model where consumers can manage their accounts and cards on their own conveniently on their mobile banking app or online portal. This digital transformation is a journey that requires making decisions that not only provide consumers with the convenience and flexibility of self-service capabilities, but also time to value for the financial institution.</p>
<p>One digital tool gaining in popularity among consumers is digital wallets. In fact, the use of digital wallets made up 48.6% of 2021’s <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/news/payments-trends/digital-wallets-and-push-provisioning-enlarge-banks-payment-options-151920/">ecommerce transaction value</a>. Banks that want to compete and satisfy consumer expectations must better support these popular digital wallets. Yet, as convenient as these apps are, the ability to enroll a payment card into the wallet can be frustrating if not fully supported properly. Currently, cardholders can either choose to enroll their card in Apple Pay manually or via a bank enabled push provisioning.&nbsp; Manual entry of card details for wallet enrollment can be a time-consuming and complicated process. Push provisioning can be done right within the banking app with a click of a button; however, not all banks have enabled this process. To offer an additional enrollment option for cardholders, Apple Pay has now issued a mandate requiring participating banks to offer more simplified options for provisioning to their wallet.</p>
<p>In response to this mandate, Entrust has launched a new in-app provisioning extension to the Digital Card Solution, from within the Apple Pay app. Coupled with the in-app push provisioning feature Entrust already offers, banks are now enabled to offer two ways of automatically enrolling cardholder cards into Apple Pay:</p>
 
 from the banking app 
 from the Apple Pay app 
 
<p>How the Entrust Digital Card Solution in-app provisioning extension works</p>
<p>If a bank enables the Entrust Digital Card Solution in-app provisioning extension, the cardholder will follow the first steps of manual card entry in Apple Pay, but will benefit from a more seamless experience:</p>
 
 Within the Apple Pay app, the cardholder will click on the “+ Icon” in the top right corner. 
 On the “Add to Wallet” screen, they will select a section called “From Apps on Your iPhone”, with their bank. 
 The cardholder will then authenticate to their banking app. 
 From there, they then click on the card they want to enroll and will confirm enrollment. 
 The cardholder will then accept the terms and conditions. 
 
<p>After this short process, their payment card is enrolled and ready to use.</p>
<p>With this new feature within the Apple Pay app, the cardholder does not have to manually enroll the card by entering sensitive information (like the card number and the PAN). Instead, the cardholder will see their bank card already proposed for enrollment. This occurs because Apple Pay will pull the information from all banking apps installed on the phone to show the cards eligible for provisioning into the wallet. Cardholders also benefit from full tokenization and security, thanks to the authentication process that has already taken place in the bank app.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience for the cardholder is like the in-banking app enrollment but is initiated directly in the Apple Pay wallet.</p>
<p>And the benefit to banks? It will allow banks to promote the enrollment to Apple Pay even further. The bank also gains additional visibility within the Apple Pay app. Ultimately, adding this enrollment option will lead to higher usage and help banks reach and/or maintain top of wallet status.</p>
<p>Existing Entrust Digital Card Solution customers can easily add the new in-app provisioning extension to their offering, as this feature can be enabled thanks to the already implemented Entrust SDK.</p>
<p>Existing customers can reach out to their account executive to learn more. Those who are interested in this new feature, and push provisioning to Apple Pay in general, can contact us <a href="https://www.entrust.com/contact/sales">here</a>.</p>

<p>Today covering 90 issuing authorities worldwide, the <a href="https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/PKD/Pages/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20ICAO%20Public%20Key%20Directory,cards%20and%20Visible%20Digital%20Seals.">ICAO PKD</a> offers an effective means for countries to upload their own technical data related to ePassports and electronic ID cards and download that of other issuing authorities, thus eliminating the need for bilateral exchange of this data. Essentially, the ICAO PKD takes on the role of a central broker for this technical information while also helping to ensure that the information adheres to the necessary technical standards (i.e., ICAO 9303 specifications) to maintain interoperability.</p>



<p>Security is a top priority in air travel</p>



<p>By joining the time-limited ICAO PKD pilot, IDnow has received temporary permission to read out the data stored in the NFC (Near-field communication) chip of ePassports and electronic ID cards and to use this data in their commercial solutions in the air travel domain.</p>



<p>“Security and facilitation are a top priority in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">air travel</a>, and identity verification plays a crucial role in any travel security equation nowadays,” says Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow. “We are therefore very pleased to participate in the ICAO PKD pilot. Being part of this program allows us to verify the authenticity of an electronic ID document and its rightful origin. In addition to our advanced in-house fraud fighting measures, we are thus able to verify that the data on the document’s chip is authentic and that the issuing authority is the one it claims to be. Furthermore, we can extract the embedded portrait photo of the document holder from the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">NFC chip</a> and use it for biometric verification, knowing that it has not been tampered with,” he adds. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p>Manually granting access to entitlements and access reviews is not easy. Organizations are shifting focus towards learning and discovering capabilities. Automation tools such as policy mining are being introduced to reduce the burden of governance for granting access and reviewing access. Policy-based provisioning of access and access reviews can help to reduce the efforts of reviewing fine-grained or coarse-grained access by automating these processes.  In this whitepaper, we will take a look at Tuebora’s model for mining provisioning policies, the importance of birthright provisioning, and automatic access to entitlements.

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the latest <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a> feature that allows issuers to conveniently send credentials directly from the platform to recipients’ emails and Dock Wallet. Now, issuers can enjoy a streamlined process that saves time, improves efficiency, and ensures secure delivery of important credentials.</p><p>When you issue a credential by using the recipients’ decentralized identifiers (DIDs), they will immediately receive the credential in their <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Digital Identity Wallet app</a>.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identifiers?ref=blog.dock.io">decentralized identifier</a> is a unique digital identifier that you fully own and control through your ID Wallet. DIDs enable you to securely receive and present their credentials in a privacy-preserving way.</p> Steps for Sending the Credential by Email <p>Let’s say the Nursing Licensing Authority wants to send each nursing graduate their credential by email. They will now see a field in Dock Certs to add the recipient’s email whenever they issue a credential.</p><p>1. The Nursing Licensing Authority enters Clarissa Olson’s email in Dock Certs.</p><p>2. The Nursing Licensing Authority previews the credential and selects Send credentials.</p><p>3. Clarissa will receive the credential by email as soon as it is issued from Dock Certs.</p><p>4. Clarissa scans the QR code with her Dock Wallet to import it on the app. She then gets a wallet notification saying she received a credential from the Nursing Licensing Authority. The QR Code becomes voided after Clarissa imports the credential.</p><p>Free trial users can only send themselves a &nbsp;Credential and will need to choose a plan in order to email it to other people. <br>See the complete <a href="https://www.dock.io/guides/dock-certs-user-guide?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs issuer guide</a> on how to use all of the features.</p> Send a Credential by DID <p>With our latest feature, an issuer can send a credential directly to a recipient's Dock Wallet by simply entering the recipient’s DID in the Subject ID field in Dock Certs. If, for example, an employer wants to send an employee a job status credential, the employer would simply enter the staff’s DID in Dock Certs and they will receive the credential directly in their Dock Digital Wallet. This feature is powered by our DID Relay Service.</p>  The Nursing Licensing Authority sends the credential by using Clarissa’s DID.  <p>2. Clarissa receives the notification in the Dock Wallet.</p><a href="https://certs.dock.io/dashboard?ref=blog.dock.io"></a> About Dock <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently and securely.

  Japan’s enforcement of the Crypto Travel Rule from June 1st, 2023, marks a significant step in tightening cryptocurrency regulations.  The new regulations, while promising increased transparency and trust in the market, may also pose challenges to privacy and operational changes.  Shyft Veriscope, with its strategic partnership with Sygna, emerges as the best frictionless Travel Rule Solution, balancing regulatory compliance, cost-efficiency, and user&nbsp;privacy.  <p>In the world of technology and innovation, Japan has always been a front-runner, setting trends that many&nbsp;follow.</p><p>With a unique blend of technological adeptness and a robust economy, the country continues to maintain its global significance, and its latest move in the cryptocurrency domain is no exception.</p><p>Starting June 1st, 2023, Japan will enforce stringent Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations to further refine and intensify the oversight of cryptocurrency transactions while supporting the crypto&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Announced by the Japanese parliament on May 23, this decision exemplifies the nation’s proactive efforts to align with global crypto regulations more effectively and exhibits the state’s adaptability to the evolving financial regulatory requirements.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">The Most Googled Questions on FATF Travel Rule&nbsp;Answered</a></p> Work in Progress Since March&nbsp;2021 <p>In a regulatory journey spanning over a year, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) received a request in March 2021 from the Financial Services Agency (FSA) to introduce self-regulatory rules concerning the “crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.”</p><p>This was followed by the JVCEA incorporating these rules in April 2022, which further led to the enforcement of the crypto Travel Rule through an amendment to the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds (APTCP) in December&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Later, to clarify how the “crypto Travel Rule” applies to Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), the FSA initiated a consultation process on these guidelines, signifying its intent to uphold transparency and dialogue within the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>And by March 2023, the FSA concluded its public consultation on APTCP guidelines, and now, in June, the Travel Rule will soon be officially enforced in Japan. In a country where cryptocurrencies have been adopted legally, the implications of these new AML regulations are far-reaching.</p> The Impact on Crypto Ecosystem <p>The enforcement of the Travel Rule in Japan is set to cast a wide net of implications across the cryptocurrency landscape. For starters, it may infuse a greater degree of trust in the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>By taking stringent measures against potential illicit activities, the rule can effectively alleviate some of the concerns existing and potential users might have about the crypto industry. This could increase crypto use and investment, lending greater liquidity and stability to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Moreover, the Travel Rule brings the promise of heightened transparency. The mandate for exchange providers to share crypto sender and receiver information allows for a more open view of transaction flows. This could significantly reduce fraudulent activities and make it difficult for malicious actors to exploit the system, fostering a safer trading environment.</p><p>Despite these positives, there are some contradictions not to be&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>For instance, for many crypto users, the allure of cryptocurrencies lies in the anonymity they&nbsp;offer.</p><p>But with the new regulations in place, this veil of anonymity gets partially lifted, potentially dissuading some users and investors. This loss of anonymity could slow down the growth of the crypto market in Japan, at least in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that the effect of the Travel Rule on users’ privacy and businesses’ operations will largely depend on the nature of the platform and the Travel Rule solution they&nbsp;employ.</p> Choice of Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution <p>The choice of a Travel Rule solution can substantially impact the user experience and the level of privacy maintained in these transactions.</p><p>One promising approach is the adoption of a fully automated, peer-to-peer Travel Rule solution, like Shyft Veriscope. It allows for the necessary data exchange between VASPs without storing any sensitive user information on its servers. This approach not only mitigates the risk of data breaches but also restricts any third-party access, thereby adding an extra layer of privacy protection.</p><p>Moreover, Shyft Veriscope’s fully automated nature ensures that user experience remains positive and seamless, an essential factor that could influence users’ decision to continue engaging with the crypto market amidst these regulatory changes.</p><p>Ultimately, the choice of the Travel Rule solution becomes a critical determinant in striking the right balance between adhering to regulatory standards and preserving user privacy and experience. This will be a key factor in shaping the impact of the new regulations on both users and businesses in the crypto&nbsp;sphere.</p> CEX vs DEX: How do They Fare Under Japan’s Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>For Centralized Exchanges, which already have strict Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols in place, the impact may not be substantial. After all, these platforms already possess much of the required information about their users, minimizing the effect of these new regulations on their operations and user experience.</p><p>On the other hand, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms, known for their anonymity and less stringent KYC procedures, may face a greater challenge. The enforcement of the Travel Rule could disrupt the degree of privacy users enjoy on these platforms, potentially affecting their appeal to a certain user&nbsp;base.</p><p>So, while this regulatory change is undoubtedly transformative, it’s also diverse in its impact, affecting different areas of the crypto ecosystem to varying degrees. This difference, in effect, underscores the importance of a Travel Rule solution that can navigate these challenges while preserving user privacy and experience.</p> Comparatively Higher Threshold <p>Another noteworthy aspect of Japan’s enforcement of the Travel Rule is the transaction threshold set at $3,000. This means the rule will only apply to transactions exceeding this limit. This is a significant figure, higher than many other countries’ thresholds for applying similar AML regulations.</p><p>This relatively high threshold could have important implications for the crypto market in Japan. Smaller, everyday transactions, which constitute a large volume of crypto activity, will remain largely unaffected by these new regulations. This allows a significant portion of crypto users to continue enjoying the benefits of anonymity and ease of transactions they are accustomed to.</p><p>However, for larger transactions, the enforcement of the Travel Rule will necessitate more stringent information-sharing and verification processes. While this could potentially slow down transaction times and complicate the process for some users, it will also provide added security and transparency, helping to protect users against fraud and other illicit activities.</p><p>For crypto businesses, compliance with the Travel Rule means embracing operational changes. As such, the rule necessitates significant investments in infrastructural upgrades and personnel training to meet the new regulatory standards. This could impose a heavy burden on smaller businesses and startups, which might struggle to keep up with these requirements.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/demystifying-the-fatf-travel-rule-your-most-googled-questions-answered-part-2">Demystifying the FATF Travel Rule: Your Most Googled Questions Answered — Part&nbsp;2</a></p> How Should VASPs&nbsp;Comply? <p>With the impending enforcement of the Travel Rule in Japan, VASPs are faced with the challenging task of choosing a Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>Although the FATF doesn’t advocate for a specific compliance solution or method, VASPs have a moral duty to choose a solution that seamlessly navigates the intricate compliance requirements while preserving user privacy and experience. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Shyft Veriscope</a> ticks all the&nbsp;boxes.</p><p>Not only does Shyft Veriscope demonstrate cost-efficiency when compared to other available options in the market, but it is also a one-of-a-kind solution. As we highlighted above, being a Peer-to-Peer Travel Rule Solution, Shyft Veriscope blends efficiency and regulatory compliance without infringing upon user experience or&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope’s appeal in the evolving Japanese crypto market is further strengthened by <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/sygna-and-shyft-veriscope-partner-to-enhance-crypto-travel-rule-interoperability-and-compliance">Shyft’s strategic partnership with Sygna</a>, a well-regarded name in the realm of crypto AML compliance services with a robust presence in&nbsp;Japan.</p><p>The result is a solution that moves beyond mere compliance, addressing the “sunrise issue” of the Travel Rule and nudging the crypto industry closer towards full interoperability.</p><p>More details here: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Shyft Veriscope — The Critical Infrastructure Underpinning FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> Frequently Asked Questions on Japan Enforcing Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule  Q1: When will the Crypto Travel Rule be enforced in&nbsp;Japan? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule will be enforced in Japan from June 1st. The Japanese parliament announced the decision on May 23, aligning Japan more effectively with global crypto regulations.</p> Q2: How will the Crypto Travel Rule impact crypto users in&nbsp;Japan? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule will inject more trust and transparency into the cryptocurrency market, potentially increasing cryptocurrency usage and investment. However, the rule may also deter some users and investors as it partially lifts the veil of anonymity associated with cryptocurrencies.</p> Q3: What does implementing the Crypto Travel Rule mean for crypto businesses in&nbsp;Japan? <p>For crypto businesses, the Crypto Travel Rule means they will need to undergo operational changes to comply with the new regulations. This includes significant investments in infrastructural upgrades and personnel training to meet the new regulatory standards.</p> Q4: What is the role of the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in implementing the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Japan? <p>The FSA is the primary regulatory body overseeing the implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule in Japan. It works in collaboration with self-regulatory entities such as the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) and the Japan Security Token Offering Association (JSTOA) to develop policies and rules that shape the cryptocurrency landscape in the&nbsp;country.</p> Final Note <p>The Travel Rule brings a significant shift towards a safer and more transparent crypto market in Japan, but not without impacting some of the very elements that made cryptocurrencies attractive to a certain segment of users and businesses.</p><p>As the industry adapts to these regulatory shifts, the long-term implications will largely hinge on the evolution of this new paradigm and the ensuing global&nbsp;trends.</p><p>However, amidst this sea of changes, one thing remains crystal clear: Japan, the “Land of the Rising Sun,” is taking a proactive and exemplary stance in tackling regulatory challenges.</p><p>Therefore, as countries across the globe grapple with the intricacies of crypto regulation, they can look towards Japan’s progressive strides for valuable insights and guidance.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 Network-agnostic tokenization platform for enterprises 
<p>Any type of asset can be easily and compliantly represented on-chain using our platform, with the freedom for the issuer to select their preferred blockchain network.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in May 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>We started Tokeny with the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to effortlessly purchase and trade financial products they are eligible for. With our&nbsp;network-agnostic tokenization platform, supporting multi-chains,&nbsp;we enable enterprises to turn this belief into a tangible reality.</p>
<p>Any type of asset can be easily and compliantly represented on-chain using our platform&nbsp;with the freedom for the issuer to select their preferred blockchain network.&nbsp;We cater to institutions seeking to tokenize assets, empowering them to benefit from direct securities distribution, automated subscription processes, and diverse liquidity solutions (<a href="https://tokeny.com/dvd-transfers/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">DvD transfer</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/new-feature/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">CEX feature</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">Billboard</a>, etc.), regardless of the underlying blockchain network.</p>
<p>Our T-REX tokenization platform acts as a&nbsp;data aggregator&nbsp;that harmoniously aggregates relevant information from blockchains, ensuring data on the platform is always synchronized with the selected blockchains. With a user-friendly interface, it facilitates efficient&nbsp;smart contract management, streamlines operations, and enables ERC3643 token trading. Moreover, it provides seamless&nbsp;connectivity&nbsp;to both external platforms and the DINO distribution network, covering centralized and decentralized trading platforms within the same blockchain network that the securities were issued.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>In the realm of digital securities, the <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC3643 token standard</a> brings compliance and control by only allowing transfers when both the investor rules (via ONCHAINID, digital identity smart contracts) and offering rules are met. While this standard is open-source, its implementation is considerably more intricate compared to the permissionless token standard ERC20.&nbsp;Building a functional platform from scratch demands a significant amount of time, resources, and expertise.</p>
<p>With an extensive track record spanning 6 years, our team of 20 experienced developers has built an end-to-end platform covering the entire lifecycle of ERC3643 tokens. Our value proposition revolves around&nbsp;expediting time-to-market for institutions to increase their market share with proven solutions.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that our SaaS platform and API are&nbsp;technically capable of supporting all EVM blockchains, which constitute a dominant share of on-chain activities (94% as per DefiLlama, a DeFi data aggregator). Our solutions have been meticulously optimized for three prominent networks: Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. Notably, the presence of key multi-chain components, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/from-start-up-to-scale-up-how-tokeny-prepared-for-large-scale-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">indexer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/gas-tank-on-polygon/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">gas tank</a>&nbsp;smart contracts, allows us to efficiently add new EVM networks to our platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, issuers have the flexibility to&nbsp;move digital securities from one chain to another as well as<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-v4/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">&nbsp;upgrade their smart contracts</a>&nbsp;via our solutions. This dynamic future-proof solution allows issuers to confidently begin asset tokenization in response to any evolving circumstances. By providing a catalyst for tokenization adoption, we ensure a secure and reliable foundation for issuers to embrace this transformative trend.</p>

 How on-chain KYC and the Lightning Network will take the industry to the next level. 



 



<p>The future of crypto within the European Union (EU) is a complex and ever-evolving topic. The good news is that the EU is finally setting some ground rules for the crypto market. The bad news is that it has taken, and is likely to take, a long time to implement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, there has been a growing sense of urgency to create a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework, partly due to the increasing popularity of crypto assets, as well as concerns about their potential to be used for illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the beginning of the year, I have been traveling around Europe, attending events and meeting with industry insiders and thought leaders, and one thing’s for sure: the crypto market is certainly moving in the right direction. Of course, there’s always been buzz – both positive and negative – surrounding the industry, but what with upcoming regulatory frameworks like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed crypto regime</a>, there appears to be more confidence and excitement from operators, regulators and consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two recent developments, in particular, have really captivated the imagination of the industry: on-chain KYC and the Lightning Network. In fact, I recently moderated a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/crypto-on-chain-kyc-lightning-network/"> fascinating roundtable discussion</a> on how they’re both set to revolutionize the market. Before we delve into these topics, it’s important to know what decentralized finance (DeFi) is, and why I think it is crucial to the development of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



 Centralization is a risk. Why DeFi is the way to go. 



<p>There has been a lot of talk about the ‘perils’ of DeFi, with many assuming the recent failure of the likes of<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/coinbase-crypto-winter/"> FTX</a> could indicate the technology doesn’t really work. But, I think the opposite is true, and that the recent events have just emphasized that we actually need DeFi, and cannot be dependent on certain authorities. Centralization is actually a risk in itself. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Events such as the failure of FTX spark innovation and improvements, as well as regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi refers to a set of financial applications and platforms built on blockchain technology that aim to provide open, permissionless, and inclusive financial services. Unlike traditional centralized financial systems such as banks, DeFi eliminates intermediaries and enables direct peer-to-peer transactions and interactions through smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



 Why is DeFi integral to the future of crypto?&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralization: DeFi operates on blockchain networks, which are decentralized and distributed across multiple computers or nodes. This decentralized nature eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks, enabling users to have more control over their funds and financial activities.</p>



<p>Accessibility: DeFi platforms are generally open to anyone with an internet connection, allowing individuals from around the world, including the unbanked or under banked, to access financial services. This inclusivity promotes financial empowerment and can provide opportunities for economic growth in underserved regions. By removing barriers like geographical limitations, high fees, and strict regulations, DeFi can empower individuals to take control of their finances, access capital, and participate in global markets.</p>



<p>Transparency: DeFi operates on public blockchains, making all transactions and activities transparent and auditable. This transparency can help build trust among users as they can independently verify and audit the underlying code, smart contracts, and transactions.</p>



<p>Another important reason why DeFi is the future, is programmability. The technology utilizes smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts automate financial processes, reducing the need for manual intervention and enabling the creation of innovative financial products like decentralized exchanges, lending and borrowing platforms, prediction markets, and more.</p>



<p>DeFi offers various opportunities for users to earn yields on their crypto assets. Activities like liquidity provision, staking, lending, and yield farming enable individuals to earn passive income on their holdings, potentially outperforming returns from traditional financial instruments.</p>



<p>While DeFi has gained significant attention and adoption, it’s important to note that the space is still evolving, and there are significant risks involved, such as smart contract vulnerabilities, regulatory challenges, and market volatility. However, many believe that with further development, innovation, and user education, DeFi has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by offering more accessible, efficient, and inclusive financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn more about the role of KYC in a decentralized world in our blog, ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/decentralized-finance-defi-kyc-contradiction/">Can Defi and KYC ever peacefully co-exist?’.</a></p>



 



 
 
 

 
 
 



 Why is MiCA so important? 



<p> Amidst the ongoing development and regulatory considerations surrounding DeFi, it is worth examining recent regulations in the crypto space within the EU. One notable example is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA regulation</a>, which was approved by the European Parliament in April 2023. This ground-breaking regulation marks the world’s first comprehensive framework specifically tailored to crypto assets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MiCA introduces a range of requirements for crypto businesses to adhere to, including:&nbsp;</p>



  Registration with national authorities<br>  Compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CTF) regulations&nbsp;<br>  Provision of clear information to consumers about the risks of crypto assets&nbsp;  



<p>MiCA provides legal clarity by defining and categorizing different types of crypto assets and activities within the EU. It sets out clear rules and definitions for crypto assets, such as cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and stablecoins, which helps reduce ambiguity and promotes regulatory certainty for businesses and investors operating within the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also introduces a licensing framework for crypto service providers. Businesses such as crypto firms, wallet providers, and custodians must obtain authorization from competent authorities within the EU. This authorization requirement aims to enhance consumer protection and ensure compliance with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/combating-financing-of-terrorism-cft/">Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF)</a> regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to safeguard the interests of investors, MiCA requires issuers of certain crypto assets to provide comprehensive and accurate information. MiCA also aims to promote market integrity and stability by setting standards for the operation of crypto exchanges and trading platforms. It includes provisions for orderly trading, transparency of prices, and measures to prevent market abuse and insider trading. These measures contribute to building trust and confidence in the crypto market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While MiCA is undoubtedly an important step toward regulating crypto in the EU, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK is still debating how to move forward</a>. However, it’s important to remember that MiCA is not a complete solution to the EU’s crypto problem, as it doesn’t address on-chain KYC. &nbsp;</p>



 What is on-chain KYC? &nbsp; 



<p>On-chain KYC refers to the process of verifying the identity of a crypto user by analysing their on-chain activity. This can be done by looking at things like the addresses they use, the transactions they make, and the tokens they hold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a valuable tool for law enforcement and regulators, as it can help them to identify and investigate suspicious activity, as well as track down criminals who <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">use crypto to launder money</a> or finance terrorism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On-chain KYC is necessary to protect businesses and consumers, while preventing crime. If your crypto platform doesn’t cover on-chain KYC, then how well do you really <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On-chain KYC is set to revolutionize DeFi and this cannot be ignored. Now let’s discuss the Lightning Network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is the Lightning Network important to the future of crypto?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol that runs on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows for faster and cheaper payments and is becoming increasingly popular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The protocol is very important as it addresses one of the biggest challenges of Bitcoin: scalability. Although Bitcoin is a very secure and decentralized network, it is also very slow and expensive to use. The Lightning Network solves this problem by allowing for off-chain payments.&nbsp;</p>



 How does the Lightning Network actually work? 



<p>The Lightning Network operates through the use of payment channels, where two participants open a payment channel by creating a multi-signature transaction on the underlying blockchain. This transaction serves as the funding transaction for the channel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lightning Network allows participants to route payments through a network of interconnected payment channels. This routing capability makes it a scalable solution. Participants can, at any point, close a payment channel and settle the final state on the underlying blockchain. The final settlement transaction reflects the net result of all the off-chain transactions that occurred within the channel. By ultimately settling on the&nbsp; blockchain, participants ensure the security and immutability of the transactions.&nbsp;</p>



 What is driving the development of the crypto industry?&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralization, security and transparency are driving the evolution of the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leading blockchain protocols are decentralized and are not subject to government control or control from financial institutions. This makes them an attractive proposition to people concerned about privacy and censorship. Cryptocurrencies are secured by cryptography, which makes them difficult to hack, and a more secure store of value than traditional fiat currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, most blockchains are transparent, meaning all crypto transactions are recorded on a public ledger. This is not the case with traditional financial systems.&nbsp;</p>



 Challenges and opportunities in the DACH region.&nbsp; 



<p>Although they each have their specific challenges, Germany, Austria and Switzerland are great markets for crypto businesses to enter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the key challenges are the lack of regulation, as the crypto industry is still in its early stages there. Their comparatively high taxes can also make the markets a less attractive proposition to investors. And while there is a growing community of people who are aware of crypto, vast swathes of the general public in those countries don’t fully understand the topic, let alone want to be involved. However, this presents a great opportunity to both educate people about the benefits of crypto, while attracting new users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The German government is considering a more innovative regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, which could create a more favourable environment for crypto companies. A strong talent pool can be helpful in developing new products and services, and the DACH region has an abundance of skilled developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at the future of crypto, I am reassured by the state of play in Europe. Yes, there are a number of challenges, but there are also a number of opportunities. The future of crypto in Europe will likely depend on how the industry addresses these challenges and capitalizes on the opportunities arising from DeFi, on-chain KYC, and the Lightning Network to create a safe, transparent, decentralized and trustworthy environment for customers.</p>

<p>In this vlog, our COO, Huzefa Olia, is joined by Kevin Shanley, Principal at Amazon Web Services Identity to discuss bringing verified identity and passwordless to the masses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Hello and welcome. Hi Kevin, how are you?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Hey, Huzefa. I’m doing great, thanks and yourself?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Wonderful. So you are new to this particular vlog our so would love for you to introduce yourself first to our audience.</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Absolutely. My name is Kevin Shanley. I lead go to market for AWS consumer identity services. And while I’m relatively new at AWS, I’ve actually been an IM for over 25 years.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Thanks for the intro. Now, in your world today you see so many different types of identities that are coming in. What are the different challenges that you see with respect to authentication?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Well, in three words, passwords, friction, and passwordless. If we double click on passwords, they’re difficult to make both complex and to remember. And this makes them susceptible to being these weak, easy, remember simple passwords that are often reused at different sites. And then that next problem becomes friction. So as we try to add security to passwords, we add friction, you make it harder for those legitimate users to actually authenticate.</p>
<p>And then the solution to that is passwordless and this is where everyone wants to go, we all want to go passwordless but that really brings it own set of problems. You may not have hardware that supports passwordless. You may not be a tech savvy person and know how to use passwordless. And so while passwords may not be very secure, at least everyone knows how passwords work, it’s just a known quantity. So that question becomes how do we get to passwordless?</p>
<p>And so well, it can brings up a couple of other points. Huzefa, can you explain how bringing a user’s true identity into authentication enhances both the security and mitigates risks?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Kevin, very interesting question. When you talk about passwordless, there’s so many different ways to get to passwordless in the market today, and most of them always take into the equation what a user’s device is.</p>
<p>But what is important is also to know who’s the user behind the device. You need to know if the user is authorized to access that particular device and the user is in fact the one that you provisioned or you created the account for. At the end of the day, identity and access management has to work together and identity has to be brought in into any kind of an access or a sign on scenario.</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Thanks, Huzefa, that’s great. And so I guess what specific strategies or technologies can be employed to incorporate a user’s true identity into authentication?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Often when we look at any kind of access, we always looking at how do I register a user’s device and then give them access?</p>
<p>What we advocate is when you bring on a user, right, already you, onboard a employee, contractor, customer of yours, do identity proofing or identity verification, and there are various different standards, the most prominent one being the NIST 800-63. So you have a guideline to how to proof and verify a user as well. But the result of that proofing and verification can be not just a verified user, but also using the user’s biometrics to authenticate them.</p>
<p>So today, when you look at any connect for passwordless access, you can essentially ask a user to prove who they are by taking their live biometrics or their live selfie to access various different systems and mainly critical systems as well where you no longer are requiring an OTP, you’re no longer requiring a user just to use a push notification but actually validate themselves by looking at the camera and us identifying if that’s the same user who registered for the service as well.</p>
<p>So hopefully that gave you some context, but now let me ask you this question, Kevin, right? When you see this flow of an identity based authentication, right? How do you think that would benefit? Which industries would benefit from this kind of an authentication?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
So, well, AWS especially, it’s really anything you care about securing, any industry that cares, cares about securing your site, financial services, healthcare, commercial sites. I mean even social networking because you’re concerned about data mining.</p>
<p>This point, bad bot traffic is now the majority of traffic on the internet. And what are these bots doing? They’re creating fake accounts, they’re attempting to break into existing user accounts. And so I mean, why do they even create these fake accounts and how can they create them? It’s because for the most part, nothing is actually verifying that there’s a real person on the end of the line and that that’s a real user identity.</p>
<p>And as we kind of pivot over to identity verification, identity proofing and stronger authentication, passwordless, that’s where we start to really close the loop on that and that’s both, it’s going to mean that you’re going to have real accounts actually in your databases. You’re going to see real traffic and real metrics and not have it all abstracted with a bunch of bad bot traffic and you’re going to end up as well as saving money because you’re not going to have to pay for that bot traffic that are taking up your monthly user accounts and such.</p>
<p>And so I guess from your perspective Huzefa, what steps can an organization take to successfully roll out an identity based authentication for the masses?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Simple answer to this would be to include any kind of identity proofing and verification into your onboarding flow. And your onboarding flow can be depending on the persona of the user, if it’s an employer or contractor, when you’re creating them as a new user. If you have customers when you’re registering them, for example, for financial services, if you’re doing a KYC or if you’re in retail and if you need to know for any kind of offer sensitive transaction that needs to be done, know who the user is, do the proofing and verification that is required, which will have all the added benefits of reducing fraud like you mentioned Kevin. And then not just do this one time, but use this identity template that has been accumulated for that specific user to use that into their authentication as well.</p>
<p>So all of, our companies have worked together to put 1Kosmos and the AWS solutions. Where do you think this collaboration with 1Kosmos and AWS will contribute to the market?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Oh, great question. So well, coming from the AWS side and how I see it, AWS is the leading cloud provider and AWS identity and access management services were recently given a top customer choice award from Gartner. In fact, AWS IM handles hundreds of millions of API calls per second, which is just a crazy number. I mean hundreds of millions of API calls per second. So we go big, we do identity well, but we can’t be everywhere. We can’t do everything.</p>
<p>And as an agile startup, 1Kosmos has both, I think the technical depth and focus to really innovate in identity-based authentication. And together I think we bring that targeted innovation together with the stability, scale availability, and cost-efficient computing to drive identity over to all to the masses.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Thank you. Thank you for that, Kevin. This is very, very insightful and I’m sure our audience wants to learn a little bit more about this. So you are going to Identiverse, you will be speaking at Identiverse. Can you tell our audience where will you be?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Yeah, absolutely. So, at Identiverse, I’ll be speaking with Mike Engle in Las Vegas. The title of our session is Bringing Verified Identity and Password List to the Masses, and that’s going to be running at 4:30 PM on Thursday, June the 1st.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Awesome. Look forward to. I’ll be audience as well.</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Great. Looking forward to seeing you there.</p>

   I was thrilled to get the news from one of our teammates at Ping that we had achieved FAPI 2.0 certification and were one of the first companies to do so.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 I’ve been involved in identity standards for a long time—from the old SAML interop testing days to OAuth to OpenID Connect and now FAPI. It is great to see open standards continuing to grow and thrive.

				  Vital records&nbsp;— such as your birth, death, marriage, and divorce certificates&nbsp;— are going digital. The only question is how. In this article, we explain why verifiable credential technology offers the best solution.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>As we look to modernize legacy systems and create digital equivalents of our most important and personal documents, it is important to get this transformation right. As a leading developer of verifiable data solutions using open-source decentralized identity technology, Indicio would like to offer the following recommendations for governments looking into turning vital paper records into vital digital records.&nbsp;</p>
 Do 
<p>Build on open-source technology</p>
<p>To put it simply, don’t tie yourself to proprietary technology when technology is evolving at a rapid pace. Plus, there’s the risk of not being able to interoperate with other identity and data ecosystems unless you go down the path of costly and complex direct integrations. With open source you own your solution and can develop on it as you see fit. You also benefit from the innovation generated by a vibrant open-source community. Community-developed code tends to be more resilient code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make use of decentralization technology</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technology allows people to hold their own data and share it in a way that the authenticity and integrity of the data can be verified without having to check in with or create a direct integration with the issuer of the information. This means that a vital record can be immediately trusted and easily shared across different systems. Sharing records through a peer-to-peer encrypted channel further enhances privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide verification methods for partners and stakeholders</p>
<p>When it comes to vital records, digital copies will only be as useful in proportion to their adoption and verification. To have a successful solution businesses and organizations must be able to easily recognize and verify a vital digital record as an acceptable document.</p>
<p>More partners and stakeholders also bring their own points of view, priorities, and use cases; they may have ideas for adoption and use cases that you haven’t thought of yet!</p>
<p>Start somewhere</p>
<p>You need to make something. Excitement over an idea can spread easily, but progress cant happen until you have a prototype or proof of concept. Even if it’s not perfect, it drives feedback from stakeholders, customers, or partners.</p>
 Don’t 
<p>Get locked into a proprietary solution</p>
<p>Even if it’s a solution from a big name there’s alway the risk of loss of support or costly upgrades. Open-source code provides longevity—it’s something you can fully own, develop on as you see fit, or draw on new features being added to the codebase by other users. This is why governments are increasingly requiring open-source solutions in RFPs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait for the perfect solution</p>
<p>Several states have already implemented virtual driver’s licenses. The technology is mature and has already been deployed by many governments. As the technology evolves incremental changes are possible to keep your solution up to date.</p>
<p>Build a siloed solution</p>
<p>Interoperability is important to creating a vital record that is widely recognized. Building and testing your solutions with other compatible solutions guarantees your records will be easily verifiable.</p>
<p>A key takeaway here is that this technology is not difficult to integrate into current systems. All this data is already available in government databases. The addition of verifiable credentials allows people to better manage their own documents and have an extra layer of security and verification.</p>
<p>The effort to move vital records from paper file cabinets to digital wallets or files is both nuanced and exciting to the team here at Indicio. If you found these tips helpful or would like to pick our team’s brain about a specific project you are working on please feel free to reach out to us <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">here.</a></p>

<p>Anonyome Labs’ CTO and Co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley recently gave Australian students studying advanced topics in security 7 insights into how&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;(DI) is rapidly solving the global&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data privacy crisis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He gave the lecture at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/">The University of Queensland</a>, a leading provider of education in cyber security, cryptography and blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley’s lecture explored how DI is the new approach to identity management on the internet and&nbsp;the biggest privacy breakthrough of the next decade.&nbsp;</p>



 Dr Ashley’s 7 insights were: 



 
 We need to improve privacy in the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">surveillance economy</a>. Data breaches have eroded consumer trust in organizations that collect and store their personal data and users urgently need to regain control. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/inside-the-massive-projected-growth-in-the-decentralized-identity-market/">Decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;enables selective disclosure around digital proof of identity, and we’re already seeing rapid uptake of this in government uses such as licenses and everyday applications such as gym memberships. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">Verifiable credentials</a>&nbsp;(VCs) have quickly become the “killer feature” of DI because they’re making selective disclosure of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">PII</a>&nbsp;possible and will drive DI’s&nbsp;ubiquity across the internet in the next decade.&nbsp; 



 The rise and rise of VCs has led to the widespread need for the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallet</a>, a massive growth area. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">Blockchain</a>&nbsp;is the anchor of&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in decentralized systems, and therefore DI is one of the most important use cases for blockchain technology.&nbsp; 



 DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity/">standards</a>&nbsp;are rapidly evolving to drive interoperability of DI solutions across the internet.&nbsp;

<p>Discover magic link authentication—a secure, passwordless login method that simplifies user access and enhances security through unique URLs.</p>
 What Is Magic Link Authentication? 
<p>Magic link authentication is a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">passwordless authentication</a> method that allows users to log in to a website or application using a unique, one-time-use URL sent to their registered email address.</p>
<p>When users want to sign in, they enter their email address, and the system generates a “magic link,” which is then emailed to them. The user clicks on the link and is automatically logged into the website or application.</p>
<p>Magic links, like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/one-time-password/">one-time passwords</a>, are often time-sensitive, expiring after a certain period or once they have been clicked. This helps enhance security and reduces the chances of unauthorized access. Using magic links simplifies the login process but relies on the user’s email account, which could be a potential point of vulnerability in case of phishing attacks or email service issues.</p>
 How Does Magic Link Authentication Work? 
<p>Magic link authentication uses a “magic link,” or one-time-use URL sent to a user’s registered email address. This link facilitates specialized and time-based authentication that doesn’t rely on passwords.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:</p>
 
 User Access: Users who want to log in to a website or application enter their email address and request a magic link. 
 Link Generation: The system checks if the provided email address is associated with a registered user. If so, the system generates a unique and time-sensitive link that contains a token specific to that user and session. 
 Delivery: The system sends an email containing the magic link to the user’s registered email address, assuming only the user has access. 
 Token Validation: When the user clicks the link, the website or application receives the token via the user’s web browser and validates it across several criteria, including user credentials, time (has it expired?) or use (has it already been validated?). 
 Authentication: If the token is valid and corresponds to the correct user, the system logs the user in, granting them access to their account without requiring a traditional username and password. 
 Token Expiration: If the magic link is used for authentication or if a predetermined time passes, the token is invalidated. Any future attempts to use the link will result in rejection. 
 
<p>Some magic link authentication systems will use SMS alongside or in place of email. However, these are rare in widely-adopted consumer platforms (although they might be more realistically implemented in enterprise systems).</p>
 Are There Drawbacks to Using Magic Link Authentication? 
<p>This process seems relatively straightforward and, ideally, secure. It removes the necessity of using passwords which, as we’ve talked about in previous articles, removing passwords can significantly reduce an organization’s attack surface.</p>
<p>While magic link authentication offers several benefits, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider:</p>
 
 Dependency on Email: Magic link authentication relies on the user’s email account, which can be an issue if the email service is down or the user loses access to their email account. It also requires users to access their email whenever they want to log in, which might only sometimes be convenient. SMS can provide an alternative to circumvent this issue. 
 Vulnerability to Phishing Attacks: If users become more comfortable clicking links in emails, they may mistake phishing attacks for authentication emails. Therefore, it’s also critical that organizations offer training and education around technology. 
 Context-Specific Security: Magic link authentication might not be ideal for specific situations, such as when a high level of security is required or when compliance and regulations call for a specific approach to authentication. Magic links also do not support identity verification independently and can open up issues when such proof is required. 
 Delays: Users might experience a delay in the authentication process since they have to wait for the magic link to be delivered to their email inbox. The email containing the magic link may also be misidentified as spam and end up in the spam folder, complicating the login process. 
 Token Management: The server-side implementation of magic link authentication requires proper management of tokens, including generating, storing, and verifying them securely. This adds complexity to the system and could introduce vulnerabilities if not done correctly. 
 
<p>While magic link authentication has advantages, these drawbacks should be considered when deciding whether it’s the best choice for a particular website or application.</p>
 How Does Magic Link Authentication Support Passwordless Login? 
<p>Magic links support passwordless authentication by providing a secure and convenient alternative to traditional username and password combinations. Instead of relying on passwords, users authenticate themselves using unique, one-time-use URLs sent to their registered email addresses. Here’s how magic links enable passwordless authentication:</p>
 
 Simplicity: Magic links eliminate the need for users to remember, manage, and enter passwords, making the authentication process more straightforward and user-friendly. 
 Security: Since magic links are time-sensitive and generated on-demand, they offer a secure authentication method. They expire after being used or after a predetermined period, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. By not requiring users to enter passwords, magic links also help mitigate the risks associated with weak passwords, credential leaks, or password reuse. 
 Improved User Experience: Magic link authentication streamlines the login process, making it faster and more efficient. Additionally, if the user has access to their email via a mobile device (or they use SMS-based authentication), they can essentially authenticate themselves wherever they are. 
 Reduced Reliance on Passwords: Magic links reduce the dependence on passwords, which can be problematic due to forgotten or reused passwords and the need for regular password updates. Passwordless authentication through magic links can also reduce the burden on users and IT support. 
 
<p>With magic links, passwordless authentication offers a more convenient and potentially more secure method for users to access their accounts without relying on traditional passwords. However, it is essential to remember that this method depends on the user’s email account, which could be a potential point of vulnerability in case of phishing attacks or email service issues.</p>

If you have any thoughts or reflections on this final blog (or on blogs <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">one</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-961744d2cb36">two</a> or <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada">three</a>) then please share them to progress this critical just transition conversation.</p> Part 4 (of 4): Network building: strategies to support and amplify the network of innovative organisations operating within Europe’s built environment  Boldly inviting a more regenerative and inclusive future to be discovered <blockquote>“It is exceptionally easy to become adjusted to catastrophe” — Adrienne&nbsp;Buller</blockquote><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada">Blog 3</a> of this series, we highlighted some inspiring examples of actors innovating in the social and ecological spaces of Europe’s transition. These sparks of fierce hope must be celebrated and bolstered, but we must also challenge ourselves to recognise and lean into the strategic gaps between them. If we want to move from lifeboats and beautiful exceptions to enduring social and spatial justice, we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent.</p>Mapping the density of alternative housing and land models in&nbsp;Europe<p>The gaps and inadequacies in the more intangible aspects of our political economy, have been surfacing with increasing frequency across many aspects of our work. Despite this initiative being focused on the specific context of Europe’s built environment, some institutional and social intelligence gaps are pervasive across all sectors. In our recent conversations we have started to think about these insufficiencies in terms of three strategic themes, as summarised below:</p><p>(1) A new cultural&nbsp;logic</p><p>In our view the current cultural logic for how we share and use assets and spaces in our cities is outdated and unjust. In the future, how can we think about creating a new Use Justice Economy, to unlock fundamentally different ways of coexisting in Europe’s built environment? The melting pot of our physical constraints and social thermodynamics is forging a new political landscape that we are ill equipped to navigate. We must therefore begin constructing the inclusive, everyday politics for a post-abundant yet just society. This will require designing and testing new generative public engagement processes, together with facilitating the R&amp;D that will be needed to support and evolve&nbsp;them.</p><p>(2) An interconnected understanding of civic&nbsp;value</p><p>The dominant economic theory of value is stifling appropriate adaptation and mitigation responses. Outdated accounting frameworks are no longer capable of capturing and presenting the intangible value of buildings and land (for example, the reduced levels of depression that are associated with co-housing models). They also ignore many of the associated risks and liabilities (such as the negative shared impacts on air quality of privately owned buildings continuing to be heated using fossil fuels). In reality, there are entire classes of assets that are missing from our investment and scenario plans; why for example are intangible public assets like preventative health still considered as a cost rather than an investment in governmental budgets? It is becoming apparent that the accounting, legal and investment frameworks of a just future are missing, whilst the existing versions will become increasingly obsolete as the constraint pressures escalate.</p><p>(3) Next generation institutions</p><p>As we have been writing these blogs a constant nagging question is the yes but…..How will many of the pathways we are suggesting be given the legitimacy and teeth to be impactful at the city, regional or country level? There is a clear need for an entire suite of next generation institutions; agile, multidisciplinary governance and decision-making vehicles, capable of building strategies and responses for the years of transition and beyond. Examples might include city land trusts (to collectively own and regulate the real estate prices), public-city banks (to receive and allocate funding on behalf of residents) or carbon and material city guardians (to measure and regulate the use of limited resources).</p> People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw&nbsp;stones <p>It is very easy to sit behind a screen, talking and writing about the opportunities and challenges of a just transition. We might leave our comfort zone at times, sharing our models for feedback and inviting others to critique and improve our thinking, but the consequences of our actions are limited. Yet what would our response be if we were actually held to account? If Dark Matter Labs was somehow granted carte blanche over EU decision making for a day, what policies or interventions would we introduce? Let’s suppose we had a large endowment; how would we allocate those funds and why? Or, if we were asked to play an orchestration role in coordinating the transition landscape, how would we&nbsp;proceed?</p><p>In reality, any strategy is restricted by the quality of the inputs that shape it. If we had the required resources and authority, we would therefore seek to rapidly increase the number and diversity of people who are able to interact with the problem space. Many people have an intuition of what could and probably should be happening, but having the time or resources to engage deeply with such ideas is a privilege reserved for the minority. We are well aware that writing blogs such as this one, is a well-intentioned yet wholly inadequate contribution towards democratising the response dialogues. In our view, socialising the constraints and implied response strategies, together with actively engaging citizens from across Europe in their design, is an absolute priority. If we had the agency we would co-create a playbook for the future, a kind of break glass in case of emergency set of policies, designed by the citizens of Europe for our shared&nbsp;futures.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@isawred?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">iSawRed</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> The evolving funding landscape: opening a space for collaborative dialogue <p>From a funding standpoint, our instinct is that any collectively intelligent strategic response could (and in fact should) include varied and co-existing approaches. If we start from a constraints frame and fan out towards an ecosystem of desired outcomes, there is the potential to build coherence across the system without limiting the scope of imaginative possibility. It seems likely that there are areas of interest, geographical points of focus, or thematic investments that can be interwoven to support the overall transition. Or, perhaps by collating narratives, ideas, case studies and conversations we could encourage new connections to form that are beyond our current perception. It feels important that we move beyond conversations about distributed power, to open space for aspects such as the equity and inclusivity of who is included (and / or centred). In our experience, there is a delicate balance between the desire to be regenerative by design and the constrictive arrogance that can be contained within that aspiration. This is an interesting point of tension that we aim to respect without surrendering our agency or accountability.</p><p>Encouragingly, we have recently observed an increasing appetite amongst funders to discuss and coordinate their strategies. This is an exciting and emerging area of our wider work and is explored in depth in our BeyondTheRules publications (for example in this <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/grantmaking-beyondtherules-8dfc752df3da">grantmaking provocation)</a>. At this point however, it is important to acknowledge that all the funders we interact with, already have deeply thoughtful and considered strategies in place. The following four groupings are therefore solely offered as prompts for discussion and reflection:</p><p>(1) Horizontal knowledge networks</p><p>How can we think about building the deep expertise needed to reimagine core components of the built environment? An example would be Community Land Trusts which have the potential to fundamentally change the unjust economic logic of land speculation. Encouragingly, the <a href="https://www.clteurope.org/">European CLT Network</a> will launch in June 2023 (with support from <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/">Laudes Foundation</a> and <a href="https://world-habitat.org/">World Habitat</a>) with the aim of scaling and deepening the impact of the CLT model across Europe. Despite this potential many challenges remain; for example, what kind of legislative changes will be needed across different geographies to support their wider uptake? How can we ensure they are not co-opted or exploited in the future? Will we need new accounting methodologies to represent their holistic&nbsp;value?</p><p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.youngfoundation.org/">Young Foundation</a> partnered with the <a href="https://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/">Community Land Trust Network</a> to bring together a group of researchers, to highlight barriers and opportunities in relation to diversity and inclusion in the CLT movement¹. A similar idea would be to analyse international best practice to identify existing and potential future pathway gaps. For example, a strong collaboration might be between the <a href="https://groundedsolutions.org/strengthening-neighborhoods/community-land-trusts">Grounded Solutions Network in the US</a>, <a href="https://www.communitylandscotland.org.uk/">Community Land Scotland</a> and a university research&nbsp;team.</p><p>(2) Moving from new economic demonstrators to full system demonstrators</p><p>System demonstrators intersect at multiple levels of the system; from mapping available land to designing new forms of finance or advocacy, thus shifting the boundaries of political possibility. If we think about eliminating vacant space in cities, what kind of actors would be needed to create viable operational models? How could they be replicated (or adapted) for varied geographies and contexts? How can we ensure robust knowledge sharing is built into their blueprint?</p><p>We conceive a system demonstrator to represent four intersecting elements:</p>  The physical, tangible demonstration of a new way of organising. For example, innovative multipurpose space use in a central district;  The system innovations that service it, such as holistic (multi-value) business plans and care agreements (as opposed to transactional contracts);  The market making infrastructure that will enable scaling (e.g.<a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/publications/public-common-partnerships-building-new-circuits-of-collective-ownership"> public-commons institutions</a> or inclusive planning&nbsp;laws);  The cultural conversations that are necessary to expand the Overton window and shift market dynamics.  <p>The coordination of these different threads is nuanced and complex. The space for creative divergence needs to be balanced with supportive, committed orchestration to drive the overall mission forwards. This is a critical area of collective capability which we believe will only be realised via deeply rooted place-based experimentation, combined with the development of technical tools and institutional reforms. Laudes currently supports some specific demonstrator projects, for example the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/press-releases/eit-climate-kic-and-partners-collaborate-with-laudes-foundation-to-advance-madrid-and-milan-sustainable-urban-approach-across-europe-2/">EU Cinco collaboration</a> which is showcasing projects for bio based and circular construction in Madrid and Milan. In the future, could we think about connecting demonstrators relating to different scales and contexts, to systemically amplify alternative visions and cultural attractors?</p><p>(3) Coordination / orchestration hubs</p><p>There is a vital requirement for actors who can play system facilitation roles in the built environment. Developing system capabilities is deep, complex work (with infinite unfolding directions and feedback loops) and thus requires reimagining our networks of governance. How can we begin designing and testing new types of highly agile institutions and equitable decision-making processes for this sector? For example, could cities with strong administrative innovation capacity (e.g. <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/innovation/">Amsterdam’s Innovation Unit</a> or <a href="https://www.stadtwohnen-chemnitz.de/arbeitsbereiche/">Chemnitz</a> in Germany) be facilitated to support hubs in emerging locations (e.g. <a href="https://ekyl.ee/en/">EKUL</a> in Estonia or <a href="https://restartukraine.io/">Restart Ukraine</a>)? Similar existing examples are the <a href="https://urbact.eu/who-we-are">EU EUBACT</a> that supports cities to coordinate and share knowledge and the <a href="https://www.alt-bau.eu/en/">ALT/BAU Transfer Network</a> that connects cities to activate unused and decaying housing&nbsp;stock.</p><p>(4) Distributed communities of practice and geographical hubs</p><p>Is there an opportunity to focus on core organisations who are centred on the inclusivity of ownership (e.g., CLTs, cooperative housing, other shared equity models) and support them to make the pathways for their operations (e.g, materials, governance, legals) and scaling (e.g, publicity, finance, policy) both more inclusive and regenerative? An example could be to look at the inclusivity of materials used in retrofitting and whether nature-based solutions could (a) improve the outcomes for low income groups in hot countries by reducing the costs of cooling (b) make the buildings more sustainable through carbon capture. Or, a cooperative housing network such as <a href="https://moba.coop/">MOBA</a> could potentially collaborate with an organisation in the same region (such as <a href="https://fundacjabrda.org/en/">Brda </a>in Poland) to improve the equitable and regenerative elements of their material procurement processes. In some cases this network could be enabled across contexts as a type of distributed community of practice. In others, a geographical capability hub might be more effective. In both cases the goal would be to strengthen or create the support pathways needed, for inclusive and regenerative scaling of the anchor&nbsp;model.</p><p>Alternatively, organisations who are creating these pathways could be supported individually, on the assumption that they will be needed for the future development and scaling of any collaborative housing models (including those that do not exist yet). These foundational pathway organisations could be conceptually clustered by theme; for example to address specific constraints (e.g. dematerialisation), or by leverage points in the system such as inclusive financing models.</p>Tracing potential networks of coherent collaboration The end comes before the beginning and the beginning comes after the&nbsp;end <p>At times during this project, looking for organisations who are working at the intersection of economic, ownership and governance issues, whilst concurrently striving for social inclusiveness and a regenerative future for Europe’s built environment, has felt like looking for a needle in a haystack. This is strangely reassuring! If the responses needed were clear and neatly packaged, we would most likely have missed the point. We are living through a complex, epoch-making moment that demands a planetary level of collective intelligence. In many respects, our understanding of the scale of Europe’s just transition challenge is only beginning to crystallise as we conclude this 4-part blog&nbsp;series.</p><p>We are grateful and honoured to be part of this community and look forward to continuing the conversation. Some immediate steps to move this work forwards are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  We will write a follow-up blog to respond to challenges, thoughts and suggestions that we have received in response to this initial blog&nbsp;series;  If you have an innovative model or idea that requires funding to scale or develop, then Laudes invite you to contact Laudes Foundation via this <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/contact">contact page</a> and address the enquiry to Alice Haugh in the Built Environment team;  Laudes is supporting a group of organisations to develop a collective theory of change to scale up the principles of collaborative housing across Europe: <a href="https://sostrecivic.coop/">Sostre Civic</a>, <a href="https://moba.coop/">MOBA</a>, <a href="https://www.urbamonde.org/?lang=en">UrbaMonde</a> and <a href="https://urbanlabtorino.it/projects/netco/?lang=en">NETCO</a>. This initiative is led by <a href="https://www.odsupport.eu/">ODS</a> and they will be attending the <a href="https://socialhousingfestival.eu/">International Social Housing Festival in Barcelona</a> (7–9th June) and <a href="https://urban-future.org/">Urban Future Festival in Stuttgart</a> (21–23rd of June).

  <p>Have you been involved with acquiring a software product for your company? If you have, you know that finding and purchasing a solution that meets your specific enterprise needs can be a challenging process. We understand the difficulty that buyers face when trying to match vendor capabilities with business requirements. After reviewing multiple vendor solutions, product web pages, and data sheets, they all start to sound the same. And videos often focus more on the muzak and narration than on educating the viewer on a specific point. Free trial accounts provide rudimentary access to the product that does not give the user the ability to explore more complex use cases.</p>

The Experience Center provides an interactive environment that lets users and administrators get a more immersive experience with the various aspects of our Platform, right from the website.

 We sit down with Martin Lycka, SVP for American Regulatory Affairs and Responsible Gambling at Entain to discuss Brazil’s upcoming gaming regulations, advice for operators, and the importance of integrity in the emerging LATAM market.&nbsp; 



 



 There is a great disparity in global gambling regulations, in terms of scope and severity, how do you compare the European regulatory landscape with emerging markets like LATAM?&nbsp; 



<p>Europe, at the risk of stating the obvious, is way ahead Latin America (LATAM) in terms of gambling regulation. However, despite a few false dawns, Brazil is firmly on the path to regulating sports betting in a near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Columbia is a great example of a very successful LATAM regulatory regime, which has drawn a lot of inspiration from gaming regulation in Spain. I think this is partly because of similarities in language and culture. It’s also worth bearing in mind that although individual jurisdictions are different and follow different kinds of sports and markets, we are talking about sports betting, so basic product mechanics will always be the same to reflect requirements in regulation.&nbsp;</p>



 Which other LATAM countries are currently in the process of regulating the industry?&nbsp; 



<p>Most Latin American countries have already regulated the land-based sector in one way or another, so it really comes down to regulating their online space. Some Argentinian provinces have regulated online gambling, and, like Canada, appear to be taking it province by province. Peru and Chile are also looking into potentially regulating online gambling and I’m hopeful it will happen in the foreseeable future, but as they’re both facing a political crisis, this is unlikely to happen any time soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Peru passed legislation that would permit the regulation of the online gambling sector last year, recent riots have again stalled any developments. In Chile, President Gabriel Boric has stated that he’s keen on revamping the Chilean constitution, but that process failed, and as a result, he’s in the process of picking up the pieces and pondering what to do next.</p>

 Brazil is on the cusp of regulation – when is Brazil’s gaming regulation likely to be passed?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The regulation will go to the Congress as a legislative bill, with constitutional urgency. This means that the Congress will have to debate and vote on it in the next 3-6 months. So, if the bill is approved, it’s likely the regulated market will launch in early 2024. As the bill is at an extremely high level, it authorizes the authorities to kick off the licensing process. There will be an uncapped number of licenses, an open licensing system, which provides for additional taxation measures. Regulation is likely to cover the process of instituting licensing, payment processing, and the requirement for internet service providers to block the internet connection for operators who choose not to become regulated.&nbsp;</p>



 What is your advice to operators based in, or targeting the Brazilian market? How should they prepare for upcoming regulation? 



<p>It should by no means come as a surprise. Brazilian sports betting regulations have been debated since 2018, when the government was authorized by Congress to regulate sports betting. My advice to operators is to keep a close eye on proceedings and start getting themselves ready. In the absence of the final iterations of regulations, however, it’s still advisable to exercise caution until regulations are passed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s very likely that the regulation will require operators to incorporate an entity in Brazil. I would not expect an obligation to locate the actual premises on the ground, as that could effectively kill the industry, but operators should be prepared to provide the Brazilian authorities with access to the data of Brazilian customers in one way or another. This could be remote, or by means of having a data server on the ground. Regarding customer verification, I believe this will be linked to their CPF identification number (a tax number attributed by the Brazilian Federal Revenue to Brazilians and foreigners who pay taxes in Brazil). There is also likely to be a focus on sports integrity, and on responsible gambling, not only because of recent match-fixing scandals that have <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwivjvb-2_z-AhUUa8AKHfvsCo0QxfQBKAB6BAgHEAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2023%2F05%2F11%2Ffootball%2Fbrazil-soccer-match-fixing-investigation-spt-intl%2Findex.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ChG0c4DUmxIfpfi26tQr9">marred Brazilian football</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government and regulator have reviewed existing regulations in other countries, so it’s also likely to take inspiration from those.</p>



 

 



 There’s a lot of talk about Responsible Gambling in the<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/"> UK government’s gambling white paper</a>, and it’s likely to feature heavily in Brazilian regulations. What does Responsible Gambling mean to you? How do you interpret it?&nbsp; 



<p>Responsible gambling is critical to the long-term sustainability of this industry. I’ve been personally working very closely with the regulator on responsible gambling standards and fully in intend to continue to do so. When the Brazilian market is finally regulated, that will provide both the operators and authorities with tools to more efficiently address the kinds of match-fixing scandals that we have seen recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The onus is on us as an industry to protect our customers, and, of course, help our customers to help themselves. That still gets sort of underestimated. If customers are beyond the point of being able to do that, that’s where we need to step up even more. The more individual care we can provide problem gamblers the better. Because what works for one person may not work for the other. Just like on the consumer side or promotional side of things: what may not be of interest to you, may be of interest to someone else, and vice-versa. This underscores the need to individualize and personalize care. That’s what I would love to see in the years to come throughout Latin America.&nbsp;</p>



 In a tangible sense, what would these kinds of measures look like? 



<p>In my view, it’s a combination of three critical pillars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Education. We need to find even more efficient ways of educating everyone involved, which goes well beyond our customers. It’s the public at large, including key decision makers, which is why Entain has launched programs here in the States (and in other countries), with the likes of the NFL, MLS, and most recently with the NHL alumni. I’ve also worked with retired athletes such as Charles Oakley and Jayson Williams to serve as responsible gambling ambassadors to convey even more efficient messages about responsible gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prevention. We need to provide our customers with tools to help themselves, and if they cannot do that anymore, we need to step in, take over control of the gambling platform – we call them interceptors. Or even just by giving customers a ring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third pillar is to put customers on a firm path toward healing; a firm treatment path. Again, the onus is on us, the industry.&nbsp;</p>

 Regarding the Canadian gaming sector, do you think it’s only a matter of time before other provinces follow Ontario and open the market to private operators?&nbsp; 



<p>Yes, it is the short answer to that, I expect Alberta to follow suit very soon, and then British Columbia, but I’m not going to speculate as to the timetable. I think if other provinces choose to go down the Ontario route, it would be the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/">most sensible thing to do</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why do you think some countries, for example Canada and Argentina, favor such a province-by-province approach to implementing nationwide regulations?&nbsp; 



<p>It’s a constitutional and legacy issue in both instances. In Canada, for example, back in 85 or 86, the federal government devolved competencies to regulate all forms of gambling, not just online gambling, to individual provinces. That is the setup, which is like the US. New Jersey, where I am based, recently won a very hard-fought for victory to regulate sports betting and online gaming, and it’s the same in Canada.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And today, we’ll hear some new ideas about open finance, open banking and definitely a bit more.</p>
<p>For that, we have our special guest today who is Michelle Beyo. She is the CEO and Founder of FINAVATOR, an award-winning payments and future of finance consultancy. She’s also a strategic adviser to FinTech’s, a Money 20/20 Rise Up alumni, a Global Council Member of Women in Payments, the Membership Chair at Canadian Prepaid Providers Organisation, a Payment Advisor at the National Crowdfunding and FinTech Association of Canada and a Board Member at Open Banking Initiative Canada.</p>
<p>Michelle started for FINAVATOR as she is passionate about payments and financial inclusion. She has 20 years of extensive industry experience, driving innovation across the retail and payments industry. Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>Michelle Beyo: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. I’m really happy to have you here in the show.</p>
<p>Michelle: Happy to be here as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, Michelle, let’s talk about digital identity. I want to start hearing a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I’m happy to share a little bit. I actually spent 20 years in the corporate space. Six years in telco and eight years in online shopping affiliate marketing. Ran Alaska, Lufthansa, Delta, United online shopping mall platforms. I really got to understand the relationship between customer and loyalty infrastructure.</p>
<p>And then I moved into the payment space. Working for the largest prepaid company globally, called InComm, out of their international office for 30 countries. And was running sales and marketing, launched their B2B division, got to see what was happening in innovation across these 30 other countries, including Singapore, Australia, UK. Helped launch WeChat in North America at 711 through the Gift Card rail, QR payment system. And truly realised – a little fearful that my kids were going to end up with Asian banking. Due to the advancements, and how far beyond where we are in North America, that Asia basically was from a banking infrastructure set in 2017.</p>
<p>And I took a leap into the startup world focused on blockchain digital identity at a startup as a Chief Client Officer in 2018. And after a year with them and helping with Bahama digital ID infrastructure and helping consent on blockchain. I actually won Money 20/20 Rise Up. Where they picked out of 500 women, 30 women to come into the Vegas largest payments conference in the world and have a separate accelerated track.</p>
<p>And as soon as I found out that I had won one of this coveted 30 spots, I quit my job at the startup and started FINAVATOR. Which is actually now four years ago in July. And starting this consultancy, did not have any consultancy experience. But did have all of my background, which I felt was touching the future of finance from telco infrastructure to affiliate marketing, online shopping. The move to digital prepaid payment infrastructures, how they were backing all new challenger bank infrastructure, BaaS infrastructure, and then digital ID.</p>
<p>So FINAVATOR truly became my ability to try and help banks, credit unions, FinTechs and corporations move to the future of finance. And really have enjoyed my journey out on my own.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely quite interesting, because you have been involved in several industries that are pretty different itself. So many are, yeah, oriented to interacting with the customer. So, understanding how the customer – what the customer needs, etc. And then just in the last year, you came to identity. So now you have this amazing experience and you’re doing your own consultancy.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, you have been working on a lot of payments and that is leading you to the future of finance. So, the topics we’d like to start addressing today are open banking and open finance. So, if you can give us what are these two terms in a nutshell, what would you say?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. I think, at its simplest point – open banking, which started in the UK in 2017. Is a safe and secure way to share data in an ecosystem. So, thinking of back to my telco days, when I started. You would sign up to one provider for three years, and you couldn’t leave. If you left, there was a penalty, and your number was owned by that telco. So, if you went to a different telco because they had a better service, you’d basically lose your identity, which was your phone number. And have to send an email to all of your friends with your new number. And they would have to reprogram your phone number in their phones.</p>
<p>There was something called Open Telco. Or at least number portability, that was mandated in Canada and many other countries around 2015. And this allowed to empower the consumer to officially own their phone number. So, if I left one telco to go to another, I didn’t have to lose my identity, which I had built for, let’s say, 10 years. As this phone number represents myself. So, I was able to port it to a competitor to get better service.</p>
<p>So, to me, open banking is that same concept of having a safe and secure way to port my data. From one bank to another bank, from one bank to a FinTech, from a bank to a wealth advisor. So really just giving me the freedom that – the information that is mine, that defines me, can be utilised to help me get a better loan. Help me get a better rate, help me get the service that is customised to myself. Based on the data that happens to live with my current bank.</p>
<p>So open banking was a regulated movement that started in the UK to force the CMA 9, which is the nine biggest banks in the UK, to create an API that was standardised. To allow for safe and secure data sharing, that was all based on consumer consent. As well as create competition, by allowing FinTechs or third-party providers to hit a certain bar of the certification to be allowed in the system.</p>
<p>So, let’s say Revolut. If you were a Lloyds customer, and you wanted to go to Revolut. And you wanted Revolut to have these five pieces of data to offer you a different product that maybe had better pricing. You were able to do that through consent through the Revolut app. And that data was then able to safely port from Lloyds to Revolut.</p>
<p>And the biggest point, I think on all of this is – in open banking there is a right to delete your data. So that data can then be deleted and to me, this is creating less data in the world. And having more control over it as a consumer. As well as empowering new services, new offerings, new companies to help serve the underserved and help serve the current market in a better, more efficient way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And I like your analogy. You started talking analogy also in telecommunication in the mobile, consumer mobile networks. The mobile number portability, which is something I think at this point, I’m not sure it’s everywhere in the world. But I think it’s by large in many countries, it’s available and it’s something that today we take for granted. But it was very painful, not long ago, it was very painful as you have described.</p>
<p>So just the idea of having a similar easiness in translated to the to the banks sounds like a dream for the ones who still have not experienced. I have not experienced something like that yet. Yeah, so definitely it sounds like a great thing to keep it spreading. And you have summarised saying that this open banking is in a nutshell is securely sharing data of the consumers. So, one consumer can move from one bank to another, or even a FinTech as you mentioned so.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, and I think the evolution of that is open finance. Which I would say is a hot topic in today’s market. The UK is moving to PSD 3, which is bringing them to open finance. Australia started with open data as a concept through a Consumer Data Right for all citizens across five industries. Which I think is the most concise vision across all countries. So, they started with open banking, moved to open finance, open telco, open energy, and then they’re going to land in open data. And it’s all centred around a Consumer Data Right across all data.</p>
<p>Very empowering vision coming out of Australia, that many countries are just starting with open finance. Turkey, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, just moved to open finance. So just to describe it – it really is, instead of just being banking, FinTech, third-party payments data or bank account data. It’s broadening the spectrum to the insurance, wealth, mortgages. Kind of more of a holistic view of anything that touches your finances. So, it’s really expanding to allow you to port your data from multiple different aspects of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So, the key here in open finance is that you do similar – let’s say portability. We use it, we use the same word between different services. Not necessarily financial services, but as you said, that touch some financial data, correct?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yes. So if you want to use some data from your Lloyds account to help you get a faster, cheaper, better mortgage that’s more customised to you. Maybe that mortgage provider is not a bank, but they’re a licensed mortgage provider that has certified in the system. Then you’d be able to facilitate that data sharing, same example to a wealth provider or an insurance provider.</p>
<p>Oscar: Alright. And besides that, benefits of the portability that we can, I can even visualise on my mind. What are the other benefits that there are for both the consumers and for businesses?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I would say one of the biggest ones is – when you think of FinTechs trying to get certain aspects of data. And not having to get data they don’t need – so only getting the five pieces of data, with clear consent from the customer. And the customer not having to screen scrape this data out of their account without their knowledge.</p>
<p>So, a lot of screen scraping issues are when open banking first came to fruition in the UK. It’s largely because 1 million UK citizens were screen scraping. Which is a service that is being utilised where it looks like you’re logging into your bank. You’re putting in your passcode, and then it’s giving access to that FinTech to look at your overarching account and scrape the whole data. To only grab the five pieces they need to push it into the system.</p>
<p>So, what this does is [A] it’s unsecure. [B] the customer has no idea they’re breaching their bank agreement by using the service. And then the FinTech ends up with all this data that they don’t need, or want. Have to store it safely and securely, when they only needed the five pieces.</p>
<p>So, when you get to an open banking system, they request the five pieces, they get the five pieces in a safe, secure type of API. And then, therefore, they’re able to delete those five pieces of data, because the way that it was coded into the system, if so requested by the customer. So, it’s a data management system, all based on consent.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds pretty good absolutely. Because imagine that all my data that is on my bank is passed to the – let’s say insurance. And then the insurance has the duty to delete whatever they don’t need as well, sounds terrible. Because you know, the less data that is transferred, the less data that is stored somewhere, the lower the risk of so many data breaches that are happening nowadays.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, on the data breach point, I always like to bring up unfortunately Marriott because they had 7.1 million data breach occurrences at one time, and it was an internal issue. They were like layering in some accounting, or loyalty system and it was an internal data breach. And this was back I think in 2018. They didn’t compensate any of the users. But think about anytime you check into a hotel. At this point, they asked for your driver’s license or your passport, plus your credit card. The amount of data a hotel has on you is pretty concerning, considering they don’t have the data security standards that you would have at a bank.</p>
<p>So, if we can get to a world – getting to your digital identity questions. Where a QR check in doesn’t actually have them store any of my data, but just validate I am who I say I am. So that they don’t need to actually hold my actual passport image with all of my sensitive data. In a non-secure, I don’t want to say non-secure, but not highly secure infrastructure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Another good example, obviously, the hotels. They will benefit, both the businesses and the consumers would benefit with open finance. And yes, I start – while you explain this idea, I was, OK, some of the data passes from one, let’s say from the bank to the insurance company. But just a minimum should be passing, so that – also thinking from the identity point of view. I’m imagining the federation, right? So, at this point, what is on your view the role of identity on this paradigm that you just described?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think it’s quite paramount as a base layer to most systems. Because if you can authenticate you are who you say you are, that’s the most important part of any one transaction. Especially a transaction that has to do with your data or has to do with your finances. So, I think it’s quite crucial that we find a way that authenticates ourselves. Especially with AI, and all of this machine learning infrastructure, cybersecurity challenges.</p>
<p>How do we ensure that we are the only entity that is Michelle Beyo and that I can then surely authenticate myself? Before I do a data share from one bank to the other, or before I do a financial transaction. And we’re going to have to layer up from our six-digit code being sent to a phone text to authenticate yourself. As we move forward in the future of finance. So, I think digital identity is crucial. And has to be put into a system, in a way that ensures that there’s only one identity for any one person.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. There has to be some level of strong authentication, that that is a must. And as you have mentioned a bit earlier also, always with a consent, inevitably, data sharing transactions.</p>
<p>Now, moving into what are the standards to also understand – without going into too much detail. You mentioned that this started in UK and in UK, there more implementations. This is really happening in real, but what are the main standards that are making this possible? Or are going to make this even more possible if we think of open finance?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. So you know, what’s interesting is – as you look at the world at the moment, and you look at open banking, open finance. Not all countries have a digital identity infrastructure. So, what that does is makes the open banking infrastructure more complex, harder to authenticate. And I think even more than open banking –&nbsp; real-time rail infrastructure needs the authentication. Digital identity for any type of fraud reduction of authenticating you are who you say you are, and it’s going to an entity who is authenticated. So that we can remove the scams out of the system.</p>
<p>I’d say the best digital identity infrastructure is probably the Indian-based UPI. It was government issued; it was a mass amount of people. And it was done very early on, on a global scale. It’s not the exact model that probably should be utilised for other countries. But they have definitely – through their digital identity framework, have been able to even. There’s homeless people in India with QR codes and a bank account due to their digital identity infrastructure. And when you pass them in the streets or you pass a tiny shop selling something, they have QR-based payment infrastructure that is largely attached to their digital identity. Which creates a more financial inclusive infrastructure.</p>
<p>In Australia, they have a digital identity framework but it’s not as widespread to the same degree as India. The UK is still working on their digital identity infrastructure. So not every country has lined up, open banking, digital identity and real-time rail. But these are three very crucial aspects to the future of finance because the authentication from digital ID is a safety point. The real-time rail is the fast and secure movement of the funds. And the open banking is the safe, consent-driven data sharing aspect. So, once you have all three of them, you’re really setting yourself up to be facilitating the future of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned one term that maybe is not so familiar, at least for me, you mentioned real, real-time rail. What is that exactly?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, they’re real-time rail is an instant payment system, sometimes called that. And the first one ever created was in Switzerland, actually, in 1989, 66 countries have faster payment systems. The UK launched quite a long time ago. But the US just launched their FedNow, that is what it’s called in the US. Which is their real-time instant payment rail, just this year. And Canada hasn’t launched theirs just yet. So, there’s many countries who have this payment infrastructure. When you look at the US last year, or Canada, still, it takes three days, three to five days for bank payments to clear and that’s just the older infrastructure of payment settlement.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, OK. Perfect. Yes, indeed, you have emphasised that all these components needed in, of course, the authentic the national digital identification is a key point. You are correct, not many countries in the world have something, I will say, suitable enough for doing this open finance. I was – in terms also of authentication that reminded me that, for instance, the FinTechs has been for a while. And not long ago the authentication was just username and password, nothing else. So, of course, now, most of the FinTechs have something better than that. But yeah, I can see something that it takes time. All this component takes time to come together to make possible some of these use cases.</p>
<p>So, if you can tell us some of these success stories, now seeing from the perspective of use cases. Let’s say success stories from, if you can, from different part of the world also to illustrate it better.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, so if we’re talking digital identity, I think Scandinavia has done probably one of the best jobs. I think Estonia was one of the first. The other really crucial part of digital identity is you can’t have CBDC, or digital currency in a very safe and secure way without a digital identity framework. So, I think there’s some great examples down that front.</p>
<p>When we’re talking open finance, open banking, the countries I’m most impressed by, obviously, is Australia. They are a country that has five major banks. They are kind of an oligopoly in the sense that those five banks hold quite a bit of the customer base. But they took an initiative past open banking, past open finance, to embed a consumer data rights to every citizen across five different industries with a roadmap to start with open banking. Moved to open finance, open telco, open energy, land with open data, which is really future proofing their country, for the future of the ecosystem. A digital ecosystem, which every business is now turning into a digital business.</p>
<p>So, they’re going to have a really great base layer of understanding that the customer owns the data, the customer is able to port the data, and the customer is able to delete the data. So, by creating a data right infrastructure, and then porting it across multiple industries. I think they’re going to have incredible innovation and eyes are definitely on them as they’re enabling this ecosystem. That really is kind of the future of any one country’s vision of how do you enable digitisation of an economy.</p>
<p>The other country that I’m pretty impressed by is Brazil. In the sense that in the middle of the pandemic, they made their first move to open banking. They made a 12-month mandate that they were going to hit an open banking live ecosystem within 12 months. And open access to their Central Bank of Brazil. And therefore, by opening the access to registered TTPs, which are Third-Party Providers. Companies, like Pix, were able to create a FinTech that reduced the cost of sending money and took the underbanked, underserved in Brazil, and gave them a digital bank with faster, more affordable payments. And I don’t have the exact number. But I believe they’re past 7 million customers and doing billions of transactions on a daily basis. And I believe they reduced the cost something like by 40%, by being able to have direct access to the central bank and fall directly in line with the open banking system.</p>
<p>And after 12 months of being enabled to an open banking system, they immediately started working on an open finance system, and are launching that within 12 months. So, I think the alignment, the passion, and the execution out of the Brazilian market is pretty impressive. And just the pure enablement of new FinTechs that are more affordable services. And finding ways to serve the underbanked, underserved, they’ve done a phenomenal job.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds like that – it sounds definitely amazing. Among all these, well, existing use cases and what comes in the future for open banking and open finance, what are some potential privacy issues that you could tell us?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think every system has to be truly based in a liability model. This liability model has to be extremely clear to everybody within the system. There has to be protection on that liability model. And I think it’s just ensuring that the certification system that allows for third parties to come into the system is robust, is reviewed, that these parties that have been certified inclusive of banks are always looked at to ensure that they’re continued to be certified to have access to the system.</p>
<p>But I do foresee in the future that customers are going to choose to have some type of insurance on their data. That they so choose, just like you have insurance on your travel, or insurance on your health, like actual data privacy insurance.</p>
<p>Because – think of the Marriott issue, or gosh, there’s data breaches every day of the week, and none of the data breaches have to do with open banking, open finance, they’re internal data breaches or external data breaches, or hacks. That there’s no real repercussion to the customer, like, or to the actual party who has had this data breach. There might be a fine, but there’s no settlement to the actual end user whose data has been potentially put on the dark web or given to different parties.</p>
<p>There’s got to the point where, if we have enough of a safe and secure data sharing infrastructure, we should be able to insure our data and be safe and secure. And if it’s breached, have some type of offset. But we have to get to a much safer secure infrastructure of how data is shared in the first place.</p>
<p>So, I just truly see that open banking, open finance is creating the pipes for the water to go through and be able to turn them on and turn them off. And we just don’t have those pipes today in every country. And I think it’s just super important for the next layer of the future of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. Now, if we look at the future, what kind of use cases or what open finance can do in the future? Something that we are not seeing today.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. So, in some countries, they started to enable dashboards, like holistic dashboards of your financial health. So, in these dashboards due to open banking, you would be able to see what your mortgage is. And then it would be able to AI predict what other offerings you should potentially layer in. To add to this product, or tell you that your current mortgage is not serving you. And that there’s three or four other offerings that would be a better mortgage based on your current finances, or the market. And then they’d be able to offer you three different companies that you might want to look into.</p>
<p>So, what this service can then do is you can actually put in your loans – this dashboard would be personalised, just for you to see kind of your financial health. It would help people have an ability to plan better, understand their finances a little bit better. From that perspective, I think it’s going to also create a whole bunch of things we haven’t even thought of, new services, new opportunities, and new ways to ensure you’re saving for your retirement.</p>
<p>Just kind of like round up did in the sense of, you know, if you’re paying for coffee, and it’s $1.50, rounding it up, or if it’s $1.40, rounding it up to $1.50 and then putting that in your pension plan or putting that into a robo-advisor. So that you’re earning money by saving without knowing it, or without feeling it, kind of perspective. So, I think just like the Internet has changed so many ways of what we are doing, and made our lives easier, in many ways. I do think that open finance, layered in with a digital identity can truly help us plan better, execute, have better offerings, save money, and really just be able to plan better for our future.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, sounds definitely a lot to expect for the future what open finance will bring us. So, Michelle, last question for you, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think what they should write is that innovation is driven by ideas. And that there’s an opportunity, especially now that the world has gone digital, to listen in to panels, topics that interests you, but you don’t have all the details on, similar to this podcast.</p>
<p>There’s panels happening in Australia on open finance, or Brazil, that you could listen into. You don’t actually have to travel to these conferences. But you can truly grasp the innovation that’s happening in other countries. And then think about how you can create something for your citizens, for your company. To pivot and start moving towards the future of finance, by learning from other countries who are already there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, I couldn’t agree more. And that’s really one, learning more about these interesting topics that are going to impact us mostly positively in today, in the future is also one reason why we invited you. So, thank you. Thanks a lot for being with us and this was really fascinating conversation with you, Michelle. If people would like to follow the conversation with you, or know more about what you’re doing, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, definitely to follow me on LinkedIn. Simply find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellebeyo/">Michelle Beyo</a>, follow <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/finavator/">FINAVATOR</a> on LinkedIn and <a href="http://www.michellebeyo.com/">Michelle Beyo</a> as well as reaching out to us on our website at <a href="http://www.finavator.com/">finavator.com</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. Many ways to do it. So again, Michelle, it was a pleasure talking with you, and all the best.</p>
<p>Michelle: Thank you so much, Oscar. It was a pleasure being here. Have a wonderful day.</p>

  The EU’s new MiCA regulation holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer losses, representing a major shift towards increased protection and transparency in the&nbsp;sector.  MiCA regulation introduces significant compliance challenges for crypto exchanges while promising enhanced user protection, potentially boosting confidence and cryptocurrency adoption.  The MiCA regulation could set a global precedent for cryptocurrency regulation, emphasizing the delicate balance between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation in the rapidly advancing field of cryptocurrencies.  <p>Europe’s ascent as the “World’s biggest cryptocurrency economy” is underscored by several telling statistics. In 2020 alone, the continent <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/09/29/europe-is-now-the-world-s-cryptocurrency-capital#:~:text=Europe%20is%20now%20the%20world's%20biggest%20cryptocurrency%20economy%2C%20with%20the,blockchain%20data%20firm%20Chainalysis%20found.">received over 870 billion Euros in crypto</a>. Moreover, the Central, Northern, and Western Europe regions accounted for a quarter of the global cryptocurrency activity.</p><p>Significantly, between July 2020 and June 2021, transfers from large institutional investors mushroomed from 1.2 billion Euros to 39.6 billion Euros, highlighting the escalating crypto activities in the region and setting the stage for imminent regulatory interventions.</p><p>In response to this burgeoning crypto economy and a series of high-profile incidents leading to significant customer losses, the European Union has enacted a sweeping set of regulations. The newly introduced Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p><p>This fundamental shift in the handling of digital assets is aimed at providing a protective shield for investors. By imposing higher standards of transparency, data security, and operational integrity on exchanges, the rules promise to enhance protection and reliability for customers.</p><p>Beyond Europe, these pioneering regulations could act as a blueprint for the global crypto industry, stimulating broader acceptance of such rules while presenting significant compliance challenges for crypto exchanges.</p><p>As the EU navigates this new terrain, the balancing act between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation could shape the future of the crypto industry worldwide.</p> EU’s Landmark Crypto&nbsp;Rules <p>On 16th May 2023, the European Union adopted a regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), initiating a continent-level legal framework for the crypto industry for the first time. The regulatory framework would apply to crypto assets, asset issuers, and crypto-asset service providers.</p><p>The provisions on assets issuers and e-money tokens will apply from 12 months after entry into force, expected to be spring 2024. Other provisions of MiCA will apply from 18 months after entry into force (i.e., in the second half of&nbsp;2024).</p> Significance of the&nbsp;Rules <p>The rules will hold providers liable for losing investors’ crypto assets. All 27 EU member states need to comply with these rules from 2024&nbsp;onwards.</p><p>Under these new rules, providers mean utility token issuers, issuers of asset-referenced tokens and stablecoins, providers of trading venues, and wallet services.</p><p>The aim behind introducing the regulations is to safeguard investor assets, maintain stability in the system, and allow the sector to become more attractive for its trustworthiness and innovation.</p> A Brief History of the EU Cryptocurrency Regulations <p>The attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies do not start with the introduction of MiCA. While the EU presented the MiCA proposal in September 2020, regulatory attempts toward crypto have been prevalent since&nbsp;2013.</p>  2013: The first official statements and analysis on virtual currencies came from the European Banking Authority.  2014: The EBA identified more than seventy risks arising from virtual currencies for all possible sorts of market participants. The EBA also suggested measures to deal with governance, capital requirements, and segregation of client accounts.  2016: The European Central Bank analyzed virtual currency schemes and acknowledged the potential advantages of virtual currencies despite an overall negative assessment.  2017: The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued a report on Distributed Ledger Technology and its application to Securities markets.  Early 2018: The European Parliament commissioned two reports. One was on virtual currencies and Central banks’ monetary policy. The second was on the fight against the illicit use of cryptocurrencies.  Late 2018: The Financial Stability Board released a paper on the crypto assets market and its financial stability implications.  2019: The International Monetary Fund singled out supervisory and regulatory elements to assist policymakers.  2020: It was only on 24th September that the European Commission introduced the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) proposal as part of a larger digital finance&nbsp;package.  2021: On 24th November 2021, the council adopted its negotiating mandate on&nbsp;MiCA.  2022: On 31st March, the tripartite co-legislative discussions started. The discussions ended with a provisional agreement struck on June 30th,&nbsp;2022.  2024: By July 2024, stablecoin-related provisions will come into&nbsp;effect.  2025: By this year, the remaining provisions of MiCA, other than those related to the issuance of asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens, are anticipated to come into&nbsp;effect.  <p>The rules discussed in this article are seen as the formal adoption of the regulation.</p> What led to These new Regulations? <p>The need for crypto regulations, chronicled in the timeline above, has always been there in the Europe market. Yet, a few incidents in the global crypto market made it all the more necessary and relevant.</p><p>One of the most prominent of these incidents was the collapse of FTX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Not only did it impact the European crypto market, but it also sent shockwaves at a global level as the founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s fortune depleted from nearly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/18/how-did-crypto-firm-ftx-collapse">US$16 bn to zero</a> within&nbsp;days.</p><p>Another incident that made people aware of the potential risks of volatility in the crypto market was the collapse of stablecoin Terra. Within a week in 2022, the stablecoin Terra and its sister token Luna collapsed, wiping out as high as nearly half a trillion USD from the crypto&nbsp;markets.</p> The New Regulations Details <p>One has to remember that nearly all of these funds lost in the incidents cited above were customer assets, either in the form of investments or deposits. In a bid to prevent such losses, the new rules hold crypto-asset service providers liable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p> Crypto Exchange Liable for Customer&nbsp;Losses <p>The rules want the issuers of asset-referenced tokens to have an adequate custody policy for their reserve assets to prevent loss and preserve the value of the&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The crypto-asset service providers should also be held liable for losses incurred from incidents relating to Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Such incidents might include cyber attacks, theft, or malfunctions.</p><p>Service providers, issuers of asset-referenced tokens, and e-money tokens will also be held liable for the information they have offered in a crypto-asset white&nbsp;paper.</p> In Focus: Traceability of Crypto Assets and Crypto Consumer Protection <p>Apart from holding exchanges liable for customer losses, other key components of the regulation deal with the traceability of crypto assets, consumer protection, etc. For instance, the rules want to ensure that crypto assets stay traceable.</p><p>The council also wants its rules to create adequate arrangements for “enhanced consumer protection” and “safeguards against market manipulation and financial crime.”</p><p>The EU also wants crypto providers to share their energy consumption details. Moreover, all providers will need to have a license to issue, trade, and safeguard crypto assets, tokenized assets, and stablecoins.</p> Crypto Licensing and Non-compliance Penalties <p>Crypto service providers operating without a license will have to go through inclusion in an ESMA (European Securities and Market Authority) public registry. In this registry, these unlicensed providers will document their non-compliance.</p> Implications for Exchanges <p>The most radical step is that exchanges will be held liable for losing investors’ crypto assets. Also, in ensuring traceability, the exchanges need to ensure that they have a mechanism to trace crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>MiCA traceability requirement is not a new concept, however, as it is similar to how banks keep a trace of money transfers.</p><p>But it cannot be denied that traceability in crypto assets is a double-edged sword. While it enhances security and regulatory compliance, it also raises critical concerns about user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Although exchanges have no option but to implement traceability, as MiCA makes it mandatory, they must ensure meticulous data governance and robust encryption methods to protect user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Transparency about these practices is crucial, with users having the right to know what data is collected, its use, and protective measures in place. It is paramount to strike a balance between security, regulation, and privacy in this ever-evolving cryptocurrency space.</p><p>In case of suspicious transactions, exchanges should ensure they have appropriate blocking mechanisms in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Besides these, the exchanges will also have to declare their energy consumption details and apply for operating licenses.</p> Potential Crypto Exchange Challenges <p>Putting up a robust compliance process could always be challenging. The exchanges will have to ensure zero scopes of technological vulnerability. Additionally, they need to ensure that operations are at par with what has been committed in the whitepapers.</p> Compliance Strategies for Crypto Exchanges <p>To cope with several compliant requirements enforced under MiCA, exchanges have no options but to make operational adjustments. For instance, the rules necessitate enhanced monitoring of exchanges’ source and destination addresses.</p><p>Adhering to FATF regulations could no doubt contribute to a robust and streamlined compliance process. However, exchanges will require a Travel Rule Solution, such as Shyft Veriscope, to comply with the FATF Travel Rule requirements while protecting their customers’ user experience and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>More on Shyft Veriscope’s capabilities: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Shyft Veriscope — The Critical Infrastructure Underpinning FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> Implications for Customers <p>The rules do not apply to P2P transfers. However, transactions above 1,000 Euros from self-hosted wallets come under their purview as and when they connect to wallets hosted by crypto asset service providers.</p> Crypto Consumer Protection <p>Authorities insist that these rules seek to reduce opportunities for intrusion into the system. Hence, hacks, breaches, and data security concerns — all could be reduced if these sets of rules are properly followed.</p> Impact on Crypto Consumer Confidence and&nbsp;Behavior <p>Enhanced consumer protection and transparency in the system would increase the sector’s attractiveness. It will improve credibility and trust, potentially resulting in improved traction and adoption of crypto in the&nbsp;country.</p> Impact on the Global Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>Regulation of crypto asset exchanges would involve collecting and transferring data between different jurisdictions.</p><p>In many cases, one party would be a jurisdiction outside Europe. However, successfully completing the transaction would require exchanges in that jurisdiction to stay compliant with European regulations.</p> Global Influence of EU Crypto Regulations <p>With the EU getting its house in order, other parts of the world, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, will have to keep up with the EU regulations.</p><p>Other countries in the European region, such as Switzerland and the UK, known for their happening local crypto scene, will be impacted as well, despite not being a member of the 27-nation bloc.</p> Switzerland <p>In Switzerland’s case, given the intricate web of business relationships with the EU, Swiss crypto companies must check if MiCA or another EU rule, MiFID II, affects them, especially when dealing with certain tokens like securities.</p><p>Also, MiCA brings unique rules for “stablecoins,” requiring issuers to have an EU-based office and a special&nbsp;license.</p><p>These changes demand Swiss crypto businesses to quickly understand MiCA’s impact and determine which services they can offer from Switzerland to EU countries and what tokens need a special document, the “crypto asset whitepaper,” to be recognized in the&nbsp;EU.</p> The United&nbsp;Kingdom <p>The UK has decided on a phased regulatory approach. It might start with stablecoins and then continue with unbacked crypto assets. This strategy is set to interplay with the European Union’s Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Even though the UK is no longer an EU member, the ripple effects of MiCA regulations can’t be&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>With MiCA creating a unified framework for crypto assets across the EU, UK-based companies offering crypto services in the EU will need to adapt. Compliance with MiCA, regardless of the UK’s local regulations, will become essential for firms looking to operate within the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>On the flip side, the far-reaching and comprehensive nature of MiCA may influence the UK’s phased regulatory approach. It could also serve as a potential blueprint for UK regulators, particularly when moving towards unbacked crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Middle East &amp;&nbsp;Asia <p>The new framework could potentially reconfigure cross-border digital asset transactions involving EU, Middle East, and Asian entities. Given the substantial number of Asian and Middle Eastern businesses and individuals engaged in crypto-related activities within the EU, the MiCA regulations could potentially impact asset flows, particularly those dealing with certain crypto assets subject to more stringent MiCA requirements.</p><p>Moreover, the increased regulatory oversight under MiCA may instigate a realignment of crypto asset flows, potentially diverting some towards jurisdictions with less stringent regulations. Crypto businesses or investors looking for a more flexible regulatory environment might consider migrating their operations or investments to territories with more lax&nbsp;rules.</p><p>The Middle East and parts of Asia, which have been comparatively less stringent in their approach to crypto regulation, could become attractive destinations for such shifts. However, this could also lead to a double-edged sword scenario where the increase in crypto activities could prompt these regions to establish more robust regulatory frameworks, echoing the rigorous standards of the EU’s&nbsp;MiCA.</p> United States <p>Major US crypto businesses, like Genesis, Gemini, and Bittrex, have had legal troubles, making others in the industry worry about the future. Big player Coinbase is now asking for clear rules for crypto companies, pushing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to make a decision.</p><p>In contrast, the EU has been working hard to create rules that protect customers and promote new ideas in the crypto industry. Their rulebook, MiCA, provides clear instructions for companies working with crypto. This not only helps protect people using these services but also builds trust in crypto businesses. It even encourages more use of the technologies behind crypto, like blockchain.</p><p>Other countries, including the US, may look to MiCA as an example when making their rules. While the US is currently dealing with different rules from different bodies, it could learn from the EU’s clear and practical approach. It’s crucial for the US to find a balanced and flexible way to manage crypto, promoting new ideas while ensuring companies follow the&nbsp;rules.</p> The Potential Impact of MiCA Regulations on DeFi Protocols <p>The new MiCA regulations have sparked questions within the crypto community, particularly about their impact on DeFi protocols. The language of the regulations is complex, causing some debate about whether they even apply to DeFi. Some reports suggest they&nbsp;don’t.</p><p>Despite this, it’s wise for funds looking to invest in decentralized finance and DeFi protocols to prepare for compliance. Even if certain decentralized activities seem unaffected by the rules, the broad scope of the regulations could still touch various aspects of DeFi operations.</p> Frequently Asked Questions: Fast Check on Everything MiCA  Q1: What is the new MiCA regulation introduced by the&nbsp;EU? <p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is a new set of rules introduced by the European Union to regulate crypto assets, their issuers, and service providers. A vital component of this regulation is that it holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p> Q2: Why has the EU introduced this regulation now? <p>The introduction of this regulation comes in response to the growing prevalence and influence of cryptocurrencies within the European economy, as well as several high-profile incidents that have led to significant customer losses. The intent is to protect investors and provide a more stable and trustworthy framework for the operation of the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p> Q3: What are the implications of these regulations for crypto exchanges? <p>Crypto exchanges will now be held to higher standards of transparency, data security, and operational integrity. They will be directly accountable for any customer losses, which means they will need to ensure robust security measures and operational protocols are in&nbsp;place.</p> Q4: How will these regulations impact customers? <p>Customers stand to benefit from enhanced protection and greater reliability in the crypto sector. These regulations aim to reduce the risk of losses due to incidents like hacks, breaches, and data security concerns.</p> Q5: Do these regulations have any implications outside of the&nbsp;EU? <p>Yes, these regulations could potentially shape the global crypto industry. They could act as a blueprint for other significant players like the United States and the United Kingdom, stimulating broader acceptance of such&nbsp;rules.</p> Q6: What challenges can crypto exchanges expect as a result of these regulations? <p>Compliance with these regulations will be a significant challenge for crypto exchanges. They will need to ensure they have zero technological vulnerabilities and that their operations are in line with commitments made in their whitepapers. They will also need to apply for operating licenses and declare their energy consumption details.</p> Q7: How will these regulations impact the future of the crypto industry? <p>The regulations represent a significant step in the evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. By striking a balance between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation, these rules could shape the future trajectory of the crypto industry not just in the EU but worldwide.</p> Looking Ahead: The Future of EU and Global Crypto Regulation <p>As the landscape of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, the trajectory of these new regulations remains to be fully discerned. If judiciously implemented and navigated with an understanding of their subtleties, these rules could potentially set a regulatory precedent for the rest of the world to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>The task ahead for the EU is multifold: it must diligently safeguard investor interests and curb potential misuse of funds. At the same time, it carries the responsibility to ensure that regulatory frameworks do not stifle innovation but instead foster growth in this rapidly advancing, technology-driven field of cryptocurrencies. The delicate balance between regulation and innovation will define the future of the crypto industry not just in Europe but globally.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency-5c0778bb11c1">MiCA Paving the Way: From Liability to Transparency</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Protocol Engineer Philipp Krüger gave a presentation on WNFS, or Webnative File System, at IPFS Thing 2023 in Brussels, Belgium. In his presentation, he gave a comprehensive yet approachable breakdown of how we constructed our versioned and encrypted file system built on top of IPFS.</p><p>When Fission set out to create an encrypted file system that would respect user agency, it needed to meet three criteria: </p>  Users would be able to take their data with them anywhere and control who had access to it  It would be available both online and offline, ensuring access no matter the user's level of connectivity  It could be shared on different devices and types of apps (for example, you could share your data on a music app on your mobile phone and a photo app on your desktop)  <p>Developers are used to running a server to hold user data when publishing an app online. During the prototyping process, dummy data is often stored in the browser. We realized that if we made the browser capable of running production data, it would ensure the data was local-first and private (because the data would never have to leave the device itself).</p> Our Frenemy, The Browser <p>So we began working with the browser to make this a reality. The first step was working with the WebCrypto API, which makes non-extractable key pairs possible. In addition, we wanted to ensure revocability, so we created asymmetric key pairs per app/device. </p> Access Control <p>Once decrypted, data is readable in the hostile browser environment. Therefore, we needed to give not just access control but fine-grained access control. We go by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">Principle of Least Authority (POLA)</a> to ensure the user only shares what they want to share.</p><p>To do this, we encrypt all of the files. However, all those keys can be difficult to manage, so we use the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-the-skip-ratchet/">skip ratchet</a> (our CTO Brooklyn's invention!) to organize them. This also gives us temporal and snapshot access control. </p>Source: Philipp KrügerSource: Philipp Krüger Data Persistence and Key Recovery <p>The browser may delete local storage, so data persistence and key recovery are two important considerations. </p><p>We use IPFS to persist encrypted data outside of the browser. IPFS also has a garbage collection feature, so to be absolutely sure that data is not deleted, the user may want to store their data on a machine they keep online (i.e., their own personal node) or utilize a pinning service. Fission does not run a pinning service, but we currently persist all user file systems for free.</p><p>Key recovery can be handled by linking a device with more reliable permanent storage for your secret keys (this can be done using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper/blob/5c1fba894a9fe51811e47865ed62d26e989a0807/accounts/login/awake.md#L4">AWAKE</a> protocol). Another option is to download a recovery kit from the dashboard app (or, in the future, from any app that supports something like it).</p> Concurrent Writes <p>A file system should have concurrent writes so editing can occur offline and multiple authorized users can edit without issue. We achieve this using a cryptographic tree structure (cryptree) that gives every file and folder a unique key. This enables offline access control while keeping the data encrypted and portable. </p><p>But what if two valid writes need to be consolidated? How do we determine which is the "correct one"? WNFS will merge them both by creating a directory that has both changes while also linking back to the previous data (using CRDTs) so nothing gets deleted. Then we leave it up to each app developer to determine how they want to query the history in the API and figure out how to do app-specific merges.</p>Source: Philipp Krüger Privacy &amp; Security <p>Previously we explained that it is important for users to have fine-grained access control because it supports user agency and resolves the issue of decrypted data in the browser. </p><p>When the user does share data with someone else, whether it's an individual or an app, this action should reveal as little metadata as possible. That's why we verify valid writes without read access (using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>), scramble the file hierarchy, create a flat namespace (using the CRDT structure), and split files into chunks so no one can distinguish file size.</p> Getting Started <p>The Rust 🦀 implementation of WNFS (<a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/rs-wnfs">rs-wnfs</a>) is available now.</p><p>You can also join our <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg">working group</a> and attend the monthly community calls or view the <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmaps/issues/2?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmaps%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">project's roadmap</a> to track our progress, get involved, and learn about upcoming features.</p>

               <p>Consumer trends and why fashion industries are changing their brand position</p>
<p>There’s been a huge shift in the way consumers demand Transparency when it comes to ethical sourced and sustainable fashion. It’s fascinating to see that more people are paving the way to more openness and demanding more eco-friendly manufactured clothing. Fast and wasteful fashion is no more! </p>
<p>When increasingly more people are changing the way they consume and behave, the fashion industry has to advance as well. Therefore we see a shift in how production is changing back to locally produced goods, true sustainability, more focus on fairly paid workers and distributed companies. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
          <p>The devastating impact on our environment </p>
<p>The use of toxic dyes, pesticides, the tremendous waste of natural resources, farming, harvesting, processing, manufacturing and the transportation for mass production all over the world is really having a devastating impact. The extravagant usage and waste of water that is needed for production is completely irresponsible.</p>
<p>The UNISOT SaaS solution can therefore be used to prove and provide honest information, that guarantees that the company is preventing waste and unethical practices, thus enabling customers to make even more sustainable and environmentally friendly choices.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                         <p>Smart Digital Twins in Blockchain, Web3 and Federated Learning in Fashion </p>
<p>Due to the intrinsic nature of public blockchain technology supply chains will become more transparent. This brings about a whole new level of incentives for companies and how they will do business.</p>
<p>With public blockchain technology we can create a link between the physical object and a digital one: a smart digital twin is created. This link is used to create a Digital Product Passport to state the origin of the actual product; blocking any attempts of counterfeit or diversion. Each action in the supply chain is recorded and due to the distributed nature of public blockchain technology no stored data can be altered, destroyed or diverted. Furthermore, UNISOT’s Smart Digital Twins functionality enables full product life cycle history feedback.</p>
<p>All kinds of exciting technologies are slipping into fashion industry, and garment companies are progressively changing into tech companies. &nbsp;UNISOT applications combined with IoT technologies, Web3 and Federated Learning can make a big change in how the Fashion Industry goes forward – in real time – for each node in the supply chain.</p>
 Let´s change the fashion industry together

Key points: 
<br> 
<br> 
  
  Most fentanyl trafficked into the United States is manufactured using precursors imported from Chinese suppliers.<br><br>  
  Elliptic researchers received offers from more than 90 China-based companies to supply fentanyl precursors, 90% of which accepted cryptocurrency payments. Many mentioned that they have shipped the same chemicals to Mexico.<br><br>  
  Many of these businesses were also willing to supply fentanyl itself, despite this being banned in China since 2019.<br><br>  
  Elliptic’s blockchain analysis shows that the cryptocurrency wallets used by these companies have received thousands of payments, totaling just over $27 million, and that the number of transactions has increased by 450% year-on-year. $27 million would purchase enough precursor to produce fentanyl pills with a street value of approximately $54 billion.<br><br>  
  Analysis of blockchain transactions also shows that a known fentanyl trafficker paid tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin to one of these suppliers.&nbsp;<br><br>  
  
Fentanyl overdoses are now the leading cause of death for those aged 18-45 in the United States. Cheaper to produce than heroin and 50 times more potent, this synthetic opioid has fueled an epidemic over the past decade, as well as becoming a huge source of profits for international drug cartels. 
<br> 
<p><br>For many years, China was the main source of illicit fentanyl. But in 2019 following intense diplomatic pressure from the US, the Chinese government regulated the drug – effectively banning its export.</p> 
<p>However, far from stemming the tide, illicit fentanyl imports into the US have soared. That’s because Mexican drug cartels have stepped in to fill the void and seize the market – manufacturing their own fentanyl using precursors (chemical ingredients) imported from China.&nbsp;<br><br>The US government has placed increasing emphasis on disrupting the financial activity of fentanyl traffickers and their supply networks. In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strengthened-approach-to-crack-down-on-illicit-fentanyl-supply-chains/">fact sheet</a> published on April 11th, the White House indicated that it intends to “expand its efforts to disrupt the illicit financial activities that fund these criminals by increasing accountability measures, including financial sanctions”.&nbsp;<br><br>Three days later, on April 14th, the US Department of the Treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1413">sanctioned</a> several individuals and businesses in China for supplying precursor chemicals to drug cartels in Mexico for the production of fentanyl intended for the US market. The sanctions also listed cryptocurrency wallets used by these businesses to receive payments.&nbsp;<br><br>The Elliptic research team identified more than 90 China-based chemical companies that were willing to supply fentanyl precursors, and that are offering cryptocurrency as a payment method.</p> 
<p>Our researchers received offers to supply large quantities of one particular fentanyl precursor. This chemical is not used in the manufacture of any other products, and is a controlled substance in most countries. However, it remains unregulated in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>GDPR and VASPs: Lessons Learned from Meta’s Historic Fine&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of the recent historic 1.2 billion euro fine levied against Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) worldwide should take heed. The unprecedented penalty, the highest ever under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), sends a strong message about the EU’s commitment to data protection and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Facebook’s Record Fine Sends a Strong Signal to VASPs: EU Regulations and Compliance are Crucial</p></blockquote><p>Reason Behind Facebook’s Fine&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta’s predicament stemmed from its systemic transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. on the basis of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) since 16 July 2020. The GDPR requires an adequate level of protection for data transferred outside the EU, and Meta’s data handling practices were deemed non-compliant, leading to the severe fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key Aspects of GDPR&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GDPR is a comprehensive legislation aimed at protecting the data and privacy of EU citizens. Key principles that organizations should adhere to include:&nbsp;</p>



  Data Minimization: Processing only the necessary amount of data for a specific purpose.&nbsp; 



 Purpose Limitation: Ensuring that data is only used for a clearly stated and legitimate purpose.&nbsp; 



 Accuracy: Maintaining up-to-date and correct data, and promptly correcting or deleting any inaccuracies.&nbsp; 
   Storage Limitation: Storing data for no longer than necessary and in a way that permits identification of data subjects.&nbsp; 
 <p>Beyond MiCA: Other Regulatory Considerations for VASPs&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the recent MiCA regulation is an important consideration for VASPs planning to operate in the EU, it isn’t the only regulatory framework they need to abide by. GDPR compliance is equally crucial, and overlooking this can lead to serious penalties, as seen in Meta’s case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GDPR Essentials for VASPs&nbsp;</p>



<p>To stay compliant with GDPR, VASPs should:&nbsp;</p>



  Understand and apply GDPR principles in their data handling practices.&nbsp; 



 Keep track of where and how they store and transfer data.&nbsp; 



 Implement security measures to protect data.&nbsp; 
   Be transparent with users about data collection, use, and storage.&nbsp; 



 Choosing the Right Partners for GDPR Compliance&nbsp; 
 <p>A critical part of maintaining GDPR compliance is choosing the right partners. When it comes to data protection and storage, partnering with companies that understand the complexities of GDPR and have a robust data security infrastructure is essential. Coinfirm, an EU-based firm, ticks all these boxes. Coinfirm’s servers are located within the EU, ensuring GDPR compliance and providing VASPs with peace of mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinfirm, Your Partner in Compliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The substantial fine against Meta serves as a warning signal to VASPs: data protection isn’t just a legal requirement, it’s an integral part of responsible business practices. While the regulatory landscape may seem daunting, Coinfirm is here to help. As a GDPR-compliant partner, Coinfirm is not only equipped to provide clear, actionable<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>analytics services, but also to guide VASPs through the complexities of operating within the EU. With Coinfirm, VASPs can confidently navigate the intricacies of GDPR, safeguarding their operations while respecting user privacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p>Whether or not you know the term, you know the experience of using a Progressive Web App (PWA): it’s the slick experience that enables you to install a web experience to your native device and enjoy the speed of use of a website with the tight system integration of a native app. They allow for experiences like recreating <a href="https://app.starbucks.com/">Starbucks’ native app in web</a>, or for creating a <a href="https://www.tigren.com/blog/uber-pwa">highly 2G-optmized experience</a> like what Uber created for some of their customers. PWAs take advantage of native features such as on-device storage, push notifications, and even windowing without requiring the overhead of a native app and the ability to install them without going through an app store. </p><p>In the same way that HTML5 and PWAs changed the way users expected to consume their apps through the minor addition of manifest, an even larger shift has arrived in the form of Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs), which combine PWAs with Web5. While PWAs redefined the relationship between the client and server by enabling richer on-device experiences through native integrations, DWAs are going to completely redefine data storage for apps resulting in a seismic shift in user privacy, ease-of-use, and data portability.</p> What changes in a DWA? <p>The basic client-server model that PWAs use is and has been the presumed standard for decades now. Users expect to open up their PWA, a client, that routinely makes API calls to a 3rd party service, the server, where all their data is stored and the business logic of the app lives. For example, a basic ToDo app PDA would provide you a UI to interface with all your action items by calling the API service that accesses those items; fundamentally the data and API layers live outside of the user’s control and ownership.</p><p>In DWAs, users own their own data and, as a result, their apps no longer need an API service because apps connect directly to the data source. This shift leads to virtually no UI/UX change, but triggers a radical change in app architecture because developers are now directly interfacing with a user’s data store instead of with app-owned server storage via API. </p><p>In DWAs, app data is stored in <a>Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)</a>, which are user-owned and redundant data stores capable of transmitting data that provide strong promises of privacy and guaranteed ownership. DWNs can be permissioned publicly or privately related to the querying decentralized identifier (DID) using <a>permissions</a> and<a> protocols</a> to allow select access to all the data stored in them. </p><p>Going back to our ToDo app example, a user would be able to store all of their todo items and app data on their own DWN rather than on a specific 3rd party’s servers, and all the app would do is focus on creating a presentation layer and additional features around the app’s concept. </p> Upgrading to DWAs <p>If you want to migrate a PWA to a DWA, the only thing you’ll need to do is make sure that whatever data you were originally storing remotely and transmitting via API calls is now stored on the user’s DWN and is accessed <a>using CRUD operations</a> on the user’s DWN. For example, your ToDo app may have previously made an API call to write a new item to your list, but now you’d replace that API call with:</p>   <code>// Write a plain text record to the in-memory DWN<br><br>const myRecord = await web5.dwn.records.create(myDid.id, {<br> author: myDid.id,<br> data: todoItem,<br> message: {<br>     dataFormat: 'text/plain',<br> },<br>});<br></code>     <p>You might expect this section on how to migrate your PWA to a DWA to drag on, but that’s really it! Regardless of your front-end frameworks, you can easily turn your app into a DWA using our <a>web5.js library </a>with minimal code changes. So long as your application treats the user’s DWN as its data storage and allows the user to own their own data, your PWA is now a DWA.</p> Benefits of a DWA <p>Even though replacing all your API calls with DWA calls may be relatively easy work, convincing your users to get on board with Web5 and DWNs may be a challenge. So what’s in it for you and them when you build a DWA?</p>  User ownership of data - users don’t have to worry about a server outage or be fearful of a company shutting down and losing all their data.  Data portability - because users are storing their own data in PWAs, they no longer need to be tied to a single service. Imagine, for example, a world with a decentralized Spotify and Tidal. If a Spotify user were to decide to leave the platform and migrate to Tidal, they’d own all their own playlist data and could therefore then give playlist access to Tidal so that all their data migrates seamlessly.   Reduced operational overhead - you no longer need to maintain a massive array of databases, clusters, and other infrastructure to host your simple PWA. Instead, a user can visit your DWA, plug in their DWN, and get to work.   What’s Next? <p>If you’d like to try upgrading your PWA to a DWA or building your own from the ground-up, you can use our <a>web5.js library</a> to interface with DWNs and DIDs. Additionally, you can find support on your developer journey by <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">joining our Discord</a> channel or by <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js">engaging in our GitHub page</a>.</p>

This detailed information can help lenders calculate income faster and more precisely to improve loan quality, simplify the mortgage process and, most importantly, expand access to credit.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Over the last year, we’ve consistently rolled out innovations to ensure our digital tools are improving speed and efficiency, reducing risk and, ultimately, helping us serve our mission by reaching more qualified borrowers. Today’s innovation further automates income assessment by using historical direct deposit pay patterns and current gross income from recent paystubs, which can help more families achieve homeownership.”</p>
Kevin Kauffman, Single-Family Vice President of Seller Engagement at Freddie Mac.</blockquote>



<p>This new AIM capability will be available to Freddie&nbsp;Mac-approved Sellers using Loan Product Advisor beginning June 7, 2023. Finicity, a Mastercard Company, is the initial service provider supporting Freddie Mac’s AIM for income using direct deposits plus paystub.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 9th May to 21st&nbsp;May <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap, your biweekly dose of crypto regulatory news from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Crypto regulatory developments are often a rollercoaster ride filled with unexpected twists and turns, as we saw during and the last two weeks were no exception.</p><p>The EU cleared the path with the unanimous approval of the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), marking a significant stride in cryptocurrency regulations. Meanwhile, South Korea has been emboldened to take decisive actions amidst political scandals, stepping up their crypto regulation game.</p><p>In the United States, the landscape continues to evolve, shaped by rigorous debates over the clarity of digital asset rules and who holds the reins over “stablecoins.”</p><p>So without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Crypto Regulation Rundown: The Balance Between Safety and Innovation Across EU, US, and South&nbsp;Korea <p>The European Union (EU) is making major strides, unanimously approving a new law known as the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). With MiCA, the EU aims to offer clear guidelines for people in the crypto market, providing a safety net for everyone involved.</p><p>But it’s not all rosy. The demands from crypto wallet providers and exchanges are high and might put a damper on new and creative&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Meanwhile, over in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking heat. The issue? They aren’t being clear about their digital asset rules. Leading the protest is the United States Chamber of Commerce and Coinbase, a giant in the crypto world. They worry that this ambiguity could hurt the digital economy and hinder its&nbsp;growth.</p><p>On the other side of the globe, South Korea is taking decisive action. Prompted by some scandals involving cryptocurrencies, they’ve put their stamp of approval on a new crypto regulation bill. This sudden move showcases the urgency for a legal framework around digital asset trading. The heart of this bill is about making things clearer and more responsible in South Korea’s expanding crypto&nbsp;scene.</p><p>Back to the United States, a fascinating debate unfolds around “stablecoins.” The bone of contention here is who should be in control: the states or the federal government? Both sides have distinct views, but there’s a shared understanding that stablecoins are part of our future. And most agree that the U.S. should make the rules so businesses don’t move&nbsp;away.</p><p>Across the globe, the chorus is growing for clear, easy-to-follow rules in the world of cryptocurrency. We need protections for those in the digital asset market, but it’s also vital to encourage fresh ideas and industry growth. How well these new rules can strike this balance will be the key to their&nbsp;success.</p> Decoding the EU’s New Crypto Rules: Mica’s Impact and&nbsp;Insights <p>The European Union (EU) has taken a significant step towards comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation with the unanimous approval of the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation.</p><p>This development comes after the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, comprised of finance ministers from all EU member states, voted in favor of the MiCA bill and amendments to related regulations and directives.</p><p>Earlier in April, the European Parliament endorsed an unprecedented set of regulations for the crypto industry, adding weight to the MiCA legislation.</p><p>With an overwhelming majority of the members voting in favor, this initiative’s primary aim is to protect consumers from potential risks linked with crypto assets and ensure providers can be held accountable for any loss of investors’ assets. This regulatory effort signifies an important shift in the EU’s approach to crypto asset management and the broader financial industry’s future.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/InbarPreiss/status/1658453533463592962?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>In line with the MiCA approval, the European Parliament greenlighted two additional pieces of legislation, further contributing to the detailed regulatory framework. These supplementary rules aim to regulate the information accompanying fund transfers and certain crypto assets, emphasizing transparency and accountability across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>One key provision of the MiCA regulation is that crypto platforms are now obliged to provide clear and comprehensive information regarding the risks associated with their services.</p><p>Though this is a win for consumers’ trust, the stringent licensing prerequisites for crypto wallet providers and exchanges could impact the pace of innovation and competition.</p><p>Another impactful aspect is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to hold substantial reserves. This protective measure can safeguard the market from potential shocks but also introduces a cap on the daily transactions of larger stablecoins, which could influence their&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The overall picture painted by these legislative measures is of a cautious yet forward-thinking EU seeking a balanced approach to harnessing the benefits of crypto assets while mitigating associated risks.</p> South Korea Takes Lead in Cryptocurrency Regulations Amid&nbsp;Scandal <p>South Korea’s National Policy Committee took a bold step forward by approving a landmark cryptocurrency regulation bill, the first of its kind in the nation’s&nbsp;history.</p><p>This action is a direct response to a controversy involving a high-profile opposition lawmaker, who has been accused of heavy cryptocurrency speculation. Now consolidated from 19 similar drafts, the bill is headed for the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, where it will face a thorough&nbsp;review.</p><p>According to legislators, this bill aims to protect digital asset investors, thwart unfair cryptocurrency trading, and establish a reliable framework for trading stablecoins. And in a significant move, it empowers the Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s premier financial regulator, to oversee cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Although the current bill is primarily centered around investor protection and fair trade, a separate bill focused on the intricacies of initial coin offerings, public disclosures, and market regulations is still under committee review.</p><p>Fueling the swift bipartisan support for the cryptocurrency regulation bill is the scandal involving Representative Kim Nam-kuk, who allegedly dabbled in sizeable speculative investments in various cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The disclosure of his extensive digital asset holdings has sparked a call for increased transparency, compelling both political parties to draft legislation that mandates lawmakers and public officials to disclose their cryptocurrency assets.</p><p>This shift in policy brings South Korea closer to the regulatory standards of the US and EU, where comparable disclosure laws were established in 2018 and 2020, respectively.</p><p>The legislation will undoubtedly profoundly impact the South Korean cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering a host of benefits and presenting certain challenges. Investors stand to gain from improved protection measures, thus fostering a safer environment in the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>The law also takes aim at unfair trading practices and establishes a robust structure for trading stablecoins, which could increase public confidence in and participation in the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>However, stricter regulatory oversight may hinder the pace of innovation and deter potential new entrants to the crypto market. On top of that, the new legislation also could infringe on the privacy of lawmakers and public officials who will be obligated to disclose their crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-the-regulated-road-ahead">The Shyft Perspective — Hong Kong’s New Crypto Climate: the Regulated Road&nbsp;Ahead</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1658156397253603334?s=20">Why Shyft&nbsp;Network?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1658850243381796868?s=20">What is Shyft&nbsp;Network?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1659578665284321280?s=20">Key Elements of Shyft&nbsp;Network</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Ping Identity is excited to see our customers, partners, and other IAM leaders at <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/events/identiverse.html">Identiverse 2023</a> in Las Vegas from May 26th to June 2nd.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>So, what does the Entertainment Capital of the World and Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) have in common? Las Vegas casinos and CIAM programs both aim to balance security and convenience by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Delivering delightful customer experiences while managing risk</p>
 
 <p>Verifying the identity of customers and authorizing transactions</p>
 
 <p>Profiling and progressively getting to know customers to understand preferences, connect them to services they desire, and provide benefits</p>
 
 <p>Guiding customers on a journey from unknown to loyal</p>
 
 <p>Evaluating behavior to separate the bad actors from the good</p>
 
 <p>Protecting against fraud, counterfeiting, and impersonation</p>
 
 <p>Supporting omnichannel experiences across physical locations (casinos) and digital properties (gambling apps)</p>
 
 <p>Ensuring resiliency across operations</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's digital-first world, we must strongly identify, authenticate, and authorize users in order to boost security and protect our customers. This is true whether you’re an online business or a casino on the strip. Hackers and fraudsters, like casino cheaters, are constantly changing tactics to steal money. We must aggressively and purposefully consider new solutions and different approaches to stay one step ahead and prevent fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To combat threats, more companies are offering multi-factor authentication (MFA) options to safeguard users. And their customers are noticing! Surveys indicate consumers put more trust in brands that offer additional security measures. To meet this expectation, businesses should build consumer adaptive MFA into digital services and leverage it as an eventual springboard to passwordless. Or, if possible, companies should leapfrog right to passwordless for new and existing customers. We need to use tools like MFA to slow down suspicious users when risk is high and, conversely, speed up trusted customers when risk is low, striking the elusive balance between security and convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term "playing with house money" basically means gambling without risk of loss. This is not the case with most digital relationships today. Casinos employ experts to&nbsp; simultaneously profile and surveil their customers to separate good actors from suspected bad actors. Similarly, the latest threat detection tools can evaluate risk signals in real time throughout the user session to determine trust and ensure valid users can transact quickly and easily. That way, your business won’t have to gamble on possible fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the threats that Vegas casinos face are as vast and varied as the digital threats facing businesses today. We all must focus on securing people, businesses, and transactions without sacrificing experience to grow loyalty and revenue. It’s the only way to give our customers extraordinary experiences that keep them coming back for more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his keynote speech on the opening day of Identiverse titled <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361523/">Identity Under Attack</a>, Andre Durand, Ping’s Founder &amp; CEO, will discuss how AI is changing cybersecurity. We also invite you to join us at the Founders Party at On the Record inside of Park MGM on June 1st from 7:00–11:00 PM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, don’t miss an opportunity to give back at Identiverse with our latest Ping4Good initiative! Summer may have just started, but local charities are gearing up to support families in need by providing them with classroom materials. That’s why Ping Identity is partnering with A Precious Child to provide 3rd-5th grade students school supplies, and all attendees at Identiverse can help! Just stop by the Ping Identity Booth (Booth 1303) to build a bag for kids in need.</p>

<p>At GlobaliD, we’ve been on a mission from day one to provide every individual with a digital identity that they own and control. Last year, we took that one step further, giving users the ability to own and control their money with the <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/launchpad-the-all-new-globalid-wallet-768cd26357c0">release of our non-custodial wallet</a>.</p><p>It’s also why, today, we’re announcing that we’re transitioning to the Universal Namespace. This will allow users to own and control a unique name associated with their digital identity through an independent third-party namespace rather than one managed by GlobaliD.</p><p>A namespace is simply a set of unique names that are tied to different types of things so they can be easily identified. In the context of the internet, the Domain Name System or DNS namespace tied domain names to relevant IP addresses so that people could easily find the websites they were looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>The concept of a namespace is key to the mainstreaming of digital <br>identity — just as it was for the mainstreaming of the internet. The early internet was a fragmented mess. The only way to find anything was through hard-to-memorize IP addresses. With the arrival of DNS, we could now visit wikipedia.com rather than 80.190.205.15.</p><p>In a sense, the DNS namespace made the internet more&nbsp;human.</p><p>The same goes for digital identity, which is even more complex than simply visiting a website. Someone you want to interact with may have many public keys, URLs, or platform accounts you need to keep track of. Now, all you need is their unique&nbsp;name.</p><p>At GlobaliD, we’ve been thinking deeply about namespaces over the last few years — we <a href="https://medium.com/@_globalid/globalid-white-paper-the-namespace-for-identity-6b755afbe42f">published our first white paper on the subject</a> in the beginning of 2019. As an early mover in the digital identity space, we’ve often had to come up with original concepts and terms in order to help develop and push the industry&nbsp;forward.</p><p>That’s also been the case when it came to a namespace for identity. As such, we originally built a namespace in-house. But the long term vision was always for the namespace to be managed independently outside of GlobaliD. That’s something we laid out in our white paper. Ultimately, we believe the namespace should be a public&nbsp;good.</p><p>We now have the opportunity to make that vision a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>For GlobaliD, this is a big step toward interoperability with other digital identity platforms. For instance, GlobaliD may support additional namespaces in the future, giving users a choice over their service provider. Regardless of which namespace you choose, your unique name will always be attached to a verifiable credential that you&nbsp;control.</p><p>In all, this is an incredibly exciting evolution for GlobaliD’s digital identity offering.</p><p>The transition will require one additional step for you, the user, but we truly believe that the end destination — where individuals control their name, their identity, and their money — is worth the&nbsp;effort.</p><p>The simplest way for this transition to work is for existing users to re-onboard with GlobaliD and claim a new name through the Universal Namespace.</p><p>This transition does mean that users will lose their existing identity history on the platform once they re-onboard with a new name. That includes things like chat history, vouches, and verifications.</p><p>This wasn’t an easy decision to make and we’re incredibly empathetic to our early adopters, but ultimately, it became clear that this was the best path forward, one most aligned with our values and&nbsp;vision.</p><p>For GlobaliD, this clean slate is also an opportunity for us to provide major upgrades to our messaging and wallet platforms as well as a bevy of new features that will arrive with our next generation digital identity platforms, which will be released in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>In the meantime, users will still be able to access their wallets via their private key, but they will no longer be able to access it through the&nbsp;app.</p><p>For now, you can head over to the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> (/uns) to reserve your unique name. Make sure you sign in with the same phone number you’ll use with GlobaliD so that we can link your name to your GlobaliD identity.</p><p>You should also keep an eye out for notifications from the current GlobaliD app that will include prompts and instructions which will help you throughout the re-onboarding process.</p><p>In all, we’ve got plenty in store for all of you in&nbsp;2023.</p> Q&amp;A   Will I be able to keep any part of my current digital identity?<br>No, you will lose access to all of the data that was associated with your old name including chat history, groups you joined, and funds in your wallet. However, you can transfer funds out of your wallet now before the transition takes place, or you can use your keys to move your entire wallet to another non-custodial client. If you are locked out of your wallet before you have a chance to migrate it, you can reach out to our support team for help exporting your non-custodial wallet recovery&nbsp;key.  Will I be able to keep my old username?<br>No. The Universal Namespace (UNS) is a new service which will manage GlobaliD names moving forward. All existing users of GlobaliD will re-onboard with UNS by claiming a name on this separate, independent namespace. Because UNS has been managed independently of GlobaliD, some names have already been reserved and owners of GlobaliD names may not have their names available on UNS. If your old name is available in UNS, then you can claim it and re-onboard using that&nbsp;name.  Will the Universal Namespace reserve my existing name?<br>No. You need to reserve your new name on your own. You will be able to do this within the updated GlobaliD app upon release, but you do not have to wait. You can go ahead and reserve your new name now by visiting the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> website.  What if I have money or assets in my GlobaliD Wallet?<br>You will need to transfer funds from your current GlobaliD Wallet to a new wallet by May 30, 2023 in order to maintain access to your money. Alternatively, you can export your wallet recovery phrase to host your wallet with another app. A new wallet tied to your username will be made available to you upon release of the updated GlobaliD&nbsp;app.  What is the Universal Namespace?<br>The Universal Namespace (UNS) is a discoverability platform that enables people to securely connect their online accounts and data with a unique name. With UNS, users can determine how they are found online by building a public profile that connects all of their digital identities to one universal name they own and control — making it easier for them to be discovered across different ecosystems. UNS is managed independently of GlobaliD and provides name services to multiple providers, in addition to GlobaliD. You can obtain a name by signing up with your phone number on the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace website</a>.  Can I export any of my data before it is deleted?<br>Yes. If you are locked out of your wallet before you have a chance to migrate it, you can reach out to our <a href="mailto:support@global.id">support team</a> for help exporting your non-custodial wallet recovery key. Otherwise, go to your Wallet tab and tap on the key icon in the upper right-hand corner to get your wallet recovery phrase. You can also contact our support team if you would like us to export your chat history. All other data such as your credentials, verifications, and public bio information will be&nbsp;lost.  What is the deadline to reserve my new username and transfer funds from my wallet?<br>We will release the updated GlobaliD app within the next few weeks and notify you when it is available so that you can re-onboard. However, you do not have to wait for this release in order to claim your new name. You can go ahead and reserve your new name now by visiting the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> website. You can also go ahead and transfer the funds from your current GlobaliD Wallet to a new wallet in order to maintain access to your&nbsp;money.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/introducing-the-universal-namespace-3bbe51b2701c">Introducing the Universal Namespace</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><br>
Note 1: Inspiration for this blog post was taken from a conversation I had with Tim Bouma about the role of digital wallets</p>
<p>Note 2: I made some edits on 5/26 and removed mentions of voltage, as they were not suited for the analogy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 An Analogy for better understanding interoperability requirements for Issuers, Verifiers and Holder Wallets 
<p>As I prepare for an upcoming trip from Canada to Europe, I’m reminded of the different power standards between continents. As usual, I will be carrying my laptop and phone, with their chargers, along with an essential universal travel adapter to keep them powered up while I’m there.</p>
<p>This is how it will all work so that I can seamlessly use my devices while I’m abroad:</p>
<p>The European electrical socket, my source of power while abroad, varies in shape, and frequency compared to what I’m used to back home in Canada. It’s the origin of the electrical energy I need to charge my devices.</p>
 <p>Various electrical sockets</p> 
<p>My universal travel adapter is the unsung hero of my tech travel kit. It’s designed to connect with the European electrical socket, which differs from Canadian standards (European outlets often have two round pins, while Canadian plugs typically have two flat parallel pins with a grounding pin).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I don’t have to worry! My universal travel adapter will allow my devices to consume electricity from the power sockets.</p>
<p>Switching gears for a minute..</p>
<p>At Northern Block, we’ve been recently experimenting with various credential profiles and credential exchange protocols. We’ve come to understand that different use cases necessitate distinct standards and technological choices. This work has led us to think deeply about the interoperability between different parties involved in credential exchanges.</p>
<p>As a company, we have a strong background in the Hyperledger Aries and <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/anoncreds-anonymous-credentials-with-stephen-curran/">AnonCreds</a> world, a topic on which we’ve shared some writings (<a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity/learnings-from-aries-indy-and-various-verifiable-credential-implementations/">here</a> and <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity/aip-2-interoperability/">here</a>). We have also contributed towards multiple open source Aries RFCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, through collaboration with some partners of ours in the digital identity community, we’ve been broadening our scope of support. This includes exchanging various credential profiles by supporting new specifications like <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/open-id-4-vc-openid-for-verifiable-credentials/">OpenID4VC</a>, both for issuances and presentations. We are at varying stages in our implementations of both these protocols. Further in collaboration with our partner, Canadian Bank Note, we’ve been recently working on demonstrating interoperability between DIDComm-based RFCs and the Mobile Driver’s Licence standard. We’ve written about the motivation and reasoning behind our mDL interoperability work with them <a href="https://northernblock.io/announcement/unifying-mdls-and-verifiable-credentials/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now..</p>
<p>Keeping all this in mind, let’s use the example of electrical sockets, my devices, and universal travel adapter as a comparison to understand how different parts interact in digital credential exchanges. This comparison also helps us understand what interoperability means for everyone involved.<br>
<br><br></p>
 Issuers 
<p></p>
<p>In this analogy, the European electrical socket is akin to an issuer of digital credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issuers generate and provide signed data that they’re authorized to issue, which can come in various formats.</p>
<p>Issuers will issue credentials in their chosen format without being forced to adhere to a specific standard, similar to the electrical socket in a specific country, which provides power according to its local standards without needing to conform to the formats used elsewhere. One issuer may pick AnonCreds and another may pick JSON-LD to issue a similar credential.</p>
<p>Each issuer’s specific use case plays a significant role in the choice of technology. For instance, a transportation ministry issuing mobile driving licences would have different needs and considerations than an issuer of organizational-related claims. Each issuer’s primary intended use case shapes their unique needs (e.g., importance of authenticity, confidentiality, privacy, security) and requirements, and thus, they select the technology and format that best aligns with these needs. Similar to the way my electrical socket in Canada follows its own standard, issuers will issue credentials in their chosen format, based on their main use case, without being forced to conform to a uniform standard.</p>
<p>The issuer’s role is considered more streamlined because they can maintain a consistent issuance method and format that doesn’t need to adapt to the formats used by other issuers. This is much like how an electrical socket in a specific country, such as Canada, maintains its own consistent standard, without needing to adapt to the differing standards of sockets in other countries, like those in Europe.<br>
<br><br></p>
 Verifiers 
<p></p>
<p>Next, my devices – my laptop and phone – represent the verifier in the digital credentialing scenario. They need the credentials in a form that they can understand and accept, much like how they need power through a specific power adapter.</p>
<p>The verifier, based on its business and other requirements, decides what type credential format the holder needs to provide to them – they place restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restrictions are independent from how the issuer issued a credential. Similar to how devices like laptops or phones require specific types of electrical input from a power socket. The power source or the power socket doesn’t determine the power requirements of the device. Rather, the device itself dictates what kind of power it needs, independent of the supply available from the socket.</p>
<p>When the wallet can provide the credential that fits the verifier’s requirements, it’s like my devices perfectly fitting into an electrical socket with a universal adapter. Everything works seamlessly.</p>
<p>However, if the wallet can’t meet the restrictions, the verifier must decide if it should adjust its requirements. This is similar to the scenario where my phone or laptop plug doesn’t fit the socket. Here, I would need to adjust or use a different adapter.</p>
<p>When credential proofs are presented by the holder, the verifier checks if they conform to its restrictions. If not, they won’t work properly and could even get damaged. Similarly, a verifier ensures the presented credentials meet their criteria for a secure and valid transaction.<br>
<br><br></p>
 Holders/Wallets 
<p></p>
<p>If we assume issuers will typically pick one issuance method for their credentials, and verifiers may place restrictions for what they deem acceptable to be presented based on their context, then there needs to be something that facilitates this interoperability, or conversion.</p>
<p>The role of my universal travel adapter mirrors that of the digital identity wallet in this scenario. Just as the adapter transforms any incoming power into a form my devices can use, the digital wallet receives these varying credentials from the issuer, manages them, and converts into acceptable formats when requested, ensuring that none of the original credential’s attributes or values are lost in the conversion process.</p>
<p>The holder’s wallet has the most complex role in this ecosystem. It needs to be able to receive, store, and manage credentials from multiple issuers, each potentially using a different credential format, likened to the role of my universal travel adapter, converting ‘power’ from various formats into a form that the device can use.</p>
<p>This allows the holder to present these credentials to verifiers in a format they can understand and accept, much like how my universal travel adapter enables me to plug my Canadian devices into European sockets, converting the European power standards into a format my devices can safely use and accept. The adapter ensures compatibility between different power grids and devices without the user needing to know the specifics. This is similar to how a wallet operates.</p>
<p>The wallet is essential for maintaining the separation between the issuer and the verifier. It eliminates the need for coordination between every issuer and verifier, even if they use different technologies or standards. The issuer might use any format, and the verifier may require any format, but the wallet provides the interoperability that allows the verifier to distance itself from the issuer, thus preserving privacy.<br>
<br><br></p>
 If The Analogy Is True, Then What? 
<p>I do think the analogy of a universal plug adapter aptly depicts the role of the holder’s wallet in the exchange of digital credentials. Much like the adapter, which ensures compatibility between diverse power grids and devices, a wallet manages credentials of varying formats, serving as a vital bridge between the issuer and the verifier.</p>
<p>Just like a plug adapter’s role, the wallet allows for seamless interoperability, shielding the verifier from the specifics of the issuer’s credential format. This operational separation, facilitated by wallets, grants scalability to the system, removing the need for direct coordination between all issuers and verifiers, regardless of the technologies or standards they employ.</p>
<p>However, such conversion isn’t a straightforward process..</p>
<p> Research is required to understand and safeguard the credential’s attributes and values during the transformation. For example, if a credential loses its privacy-preserving features during conversion, we need to clearly communicate this potential loss to the user.</p>
<p>Moreover, the complexity of transformation depends on the credential format. Some formats, like AnonCreds, Selective Disclosure JSON Web Tokens (SD-JWT), and MSO (ISO/IEC 18013-5), offer more enriched data structures than others such as JSON-LD.</p>
<p>For instance, AnonCreds and SD-JWT are rich formats where every element can be individually signed, facilitating selective disclosures. However, this feature also makes them heavier to process. In contrast, converting a rich format into a simpler one like JSON-LD doesn’t pose an issue, as there’s no loss of information. But a reverse conversion is more difficult because not every claim is signed by the issuer in JSON-LD format.</p>
<p>I hope this further underscores the need for in-depth research to understand the dynamics of different credential formats and to develop robust interoperability frameworks. </p>
<p>While we allow the standards to evolve naturally, we must focus on ensuring these frameworks can accommodate and seamlessly convert between all these formats without compromising the credential’s integrity or the issuer’s integrity.</p>
<p>Interoperability is the key here, and that’s where the research should be directed. We should let the standards evolve as they are, but there must be an effort to develop interoperability frameworks.</p>
<p>We can take inspiration from the hardware industry, where plug and play really works. We need to make our systems truly interoperable, just like hardware devices.</p>
<p>Proposed Call to Actions</p>
 
 Advance Interoperability Research: Interoperability, or the ability of different systems or components to work together, is a key concern in the realm of digital credentials. Currently, there are multiple protocols and formats, such as DIDComm, OpenID4VC protocols, and MDL formats. The need for research in this area is to understand how these different formats can interact and be converted without loss of integrity, information or functionality. This would allow for smoother interactions between holders and verifiers, regardless of their chosen credential format. 
 Improve Wallet Versatility: Digital wallets play a crucial role as they need to support and manage credentials in multiple formats. Just as a universal travel adapter can accept plugs from different countries and convert the power into a usable form, the digital wallet needs to be versatile enough to accept, convert, and manage various credential formats. This is a challenging aspect that requires ongoing research and development. 
 Analyze Credential Format Conversion: As different credential formats might prioritize different aspects (e.g., privacy, security, usability), it’s essential to understand what might be lost or gained during the conversion process. This involves deep technical analysis and understanding of the different credential protocols.

<p>Employee Access Management is the use of identity and access management (IAM) to provide employees with secure access to organisational systems and resources. It is also known as Workforce Access Management. These employee access management systems ensure that the right people have (only) the necessary access to the tools and resources needed to complete their jobs. Access levels are usually based on job roles or management levels within the company.</p>
 Importance of Employee Access Management 
<p>Secure and effective employee access management is critical to safeguarding internal and sensitive organisational information. It helps to mitigate information security risks, protect data and ensure regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>With the significant increase in hybrid and remote working since the pandemic, employee access management systems can enable employees to work from anywhere while still accessing applications securely. When remote employees access systems without an appropriate access management system, it risks leaving vulnerabilities within the system for hackers to find and take advantage of. This leads to data breaches, which has severe financial consequences and causes damage to the organisation’s reputation.</p>
<p>The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other regulations meant that companies needed to re-assess data access internally. When all employees have access to sensitive information, including where it is not necessary to their role, it increases the risk of (accidental or purposeful) misuse of data. Implementing employee access management systems that allow access to sensitive information on an individual basis, or based on attributes like job roles, helps to reduce this risk. This is known as the Principle of Least Privilege.</p>
<p>Jenny Radcliffe, aka The People Hacker, joined the Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast to discuss social engineering and the importance of protecting your organisation. In the episode, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/social-engineering-jenny-radcliffe/" title="Educate your staff or get hacked. Stories from a Social Engineer">Educate your staff or get hacked. Stories from a Social Engineer</a>, Jenny discusses how hackers find and exploit vulnerabilities within organisations’ systems, and how identity products can improve the barriers to this happening. However, Jenny also touches on the importance on User Experience (UX) within these systems. Proper UX will ensure that while the software improves security, it should also not be too complicated, or make tasks more difficult.</p>
 Understanding Employee Access Management Requirements 
<p>When investing in access management systems, the software must support all the requirements of the organisation. An evaluation of your access needs can help to build a clear picture of your solution requirements. Factors to consider include:</p>
 
 Access requirements: user management, remote working, single sign-on. 
 Increased security: authentication needs, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), authorisation. 
 Improved productivity: reduced friction for remote workers, self-service credentials. 
 
<p>These are just a few factors that may affect your solution requirements. Learn more about these system options on our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/workforce-access-management/" title="Workforce Identity &amp; Access Management page">Workforce Identity &amp; Access Management page</a>.</p>
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems provide a centralised platform to manage access, authenticate users, and support connection to identity standards applications. Additional authentication, such as MFA, adds an extra layer of security by requesting that employees provide additional verification factors beyond passwords. Privileged access management (PAM) tools enable organisations to monitor and control privileged accounts, minimising the risk of insider threats.</p>
 Balancing Security and Usability 
<p>A key factor when looking to implement employee access management is getting the ideal balance between security and user experience. Strict access controls help to withstand external risks and comply with regulations, but if your employee access management solution is overly complex it can hinder productivity. Finding a user friendly and seamless solution that offers timely support for issues is fundamental for finding the balance between security and usability.</p>
<p>IAM software that is developed to also provide services for external users – aka Customer IAM (CIAM) – ensure such features are particularly user friendly and can cater for all remote working access scenarios as well.</p>
<p>This is where Ubisecure can help, with our Employee Access Management solutions tailored to suit your company’s access requirements. While placing importance on robust security, we also understand the need for user friendly solutions, simplifying complex identity and access requirements for workforce, B2C and B2B interactions. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/contact/" title="Contact us">Contact us</a> to find out more about Employee Access Management.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>When I recorded this podcast with Wenjing, I was initially hesitant to delve too deeply into the current state of generative AI. The pace at which this field is evolving is astounding, with significant advancements appearing nearly every week. Even in the past couple of weeks since we recorded this podcast, numerous new products have been released. A notable example is Google’s generative AI chat product, Google Bard, which is rapidly gaining recognition as a strong competitor to ChatGPT.</p>
<blockquote><p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos.</p></blockquote>
<p>For that reason, in our conversation I aimed to focus on more overarching “evergreen” topics that would remain relevant despite the rapid progression of these Generative AI products. I wanted this discussion to retain its value not only for this week but for time to come.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this conversation was first sparked by my personal experience with these AI tools. Further, at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in April, I attended a session hosted by Wenjing on “Digital Trust in the Age of AI.” This session triggered many thoughts for me about the impact of AI on digital identity and trust, as well as the intersection between advancements in digital trust and the benefits and potential risks of AI. We both decided it would be interesting to have a longer discussion in a podcast format!</p>
<p>We began our conversation with the parable of the blind men and the elephant. In this story, a group of blind men encounter an elephant for the first time. Each touches a different part of the elephant and describes it based on their limited, individual experience. This leads to disagreements about the elephant’s true nature, illustrating how a singular perspective can limit one’s understanding of a larger concept.</p>
 <p>Image taken from Sophia Tepe’s “The Blind Men and the Elephant” blog post on Medium.</p> 
<p>This parable is relevant when considering artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a complex, multifaceted field. Individuals often form opinions on it based on their personal experiences and knowledge, potentially resulting in a limited or skewed understanding, much like the blind men’s perception of the elephant.</p>
<p>For this, it is important that we have more nuanced discussions about the perceived positives and negatives of such a disruptive new technology.</p>
<p>Some of the topics discussed between Wenjing and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Exponential Data Growth and AI Systems: Discussion centered around how the volume of data, particularly from AI systems like GPT-4, is exponentially increasing. As AI starts generating more content, this could create a feedback loop leading to astronomical levels of content. 
 Interaction with LLM as Protocol: The question arose whether the pre-trained Language Model (LLM) could be equated to a protocol and if individuals might interact directly with the LLM in the future. 
 Digital Identity and Trust in the Age of AI and Deepfakes: Concerns were discussed regarding the rise of AI and deepfakes, particularly their implications for digital identity and trust. The challenges of bi-directional authentication and the potential risk to content-based authentication methods were highlighted. 
 Future of Digital Trust Protocols and Authentication: The potential of AI to generate content was related to the future of digital trust protocols. The necessity of digital signatures for authentication was suggested as a possible direction for the future. 
 Reframing Identity: A broader understanding of identity was proposed, questioning whether a reframing of identity could influence our understanding of concepts like authentication. 
 Trust in AI Bots vs. Humans: Personal observations on the level of trust in AI bots vs. humans were shared, suggesting a quicker formation of trust with bots. The implications for future human-bot relationships were considered. 
 Potential Risks and Benefits of Technological Advancements: The discussion acknowledged both potential risks and substantial benefits of technological advancements. A greater level of trust in bots due to perceived lesser risk was noted, along with a significant move towards open source models in the digital trust space. 
 Open-source Model for LLMs and Other Systems: The pros and cons of adopting an open-source model for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other complex systems were questioned.

Current research and surveys conducted through Project Polaris, the BIS showed a large majority of central banks require offline payments with retail CBDC as a necessity to adopt digital currencies as national legal tender. A survey conducted by the BIS Innovation Hub Nordic Centre shows that 49% of central banks consider offline payments with retail CBDC to be vital, while another 49% deemed it to be advantageous.</p><p>Providing offline payments with CBDC is an important requirement for many central banks for reasons such as resilience, inclusion, privacy and cash resemblance. However, its implementation is complex and involves a number of technology, security and operational considerations that need to be planned and designed for at the earliest possible&nbsp;stages.</p><p>The handbook provides a comprehensive overview of the key aspects of offline payments with CBDC and is intended to serve as a guide for central banks considering implementing offline payments capabilities.</p><p>Among the handbook contributors, private sector technology providers were invited to discuss their solutions covering offline-payment and CBDC related technologies. Sovereign Wallet was the very first responder to meet with BISIH Nordic last year, and presented MetaMUI offline-payment solution.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet’s CEO Phantom Seokgu Yun and CSO Cizar Bachir Brahim gave professional insights on the requirements to a successful implementation of CBDC were acknowledged in the BISIH Handbook. Recognized as the only Korean company to participate in the global project represents that company’s commitment in shaping the future of secure, digital identity platforms.</p><p>This year, more that 95 % of Central Banks around the world have been conducting a series of CBDC pilot tests in order to expand the scope of how digital currency can reshape their economies. Countries partnered with many well known organizations have showcased their successes and difficulties with implementing their CBDC initiatives for the&nbsp;public.</p><p>The BIS handbook is intended to guide central banks in understanding:</p>  the latest available technologies and security&nbsp;measures  the risk and risk management measures available  the privacy issues, inclusion needs, and resilience options  the design and architecture principles involved  the potential operational and change management issues  <p>Sovereign Wallet’s unique solution for Offline CBDC requires the sender to register their identity approved by trusted entities such as Bank or Government Agent. Verifying users identity establishes trust between participants and allows them to conduct offline transactions until connectivity is reestablish. The proposed solution utilizes the trusted identity of the sender to help mitigate risk while adhering to privacy policies set by regulatory organizations.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet’s involvement in the BIS Handbook for Offline Payments with CBDC, alongside leading global participants, positions the company as a key contributor to the advancement of secure, inclusive, and accessible CBDC solutions. By offering expert insights and sharing its practical expertise, Sovereign Wallet plays an integral role in shaping the industry’s best practices of the potential CBDC brings in both online and offline usage.

<p>Welcome to the Bluesky beta app! This is a user guide that answers some common questions.</p>
<p>For general questions about the Bluesky company, please visit our FAQ <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/faq">here</a>. If you’re interested in learning more about the protocol Bluesky is built on (the AT Protocol), please refer to our <a href="https://atproto.com/">protocol documentation</a> or our <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/faq">protocol FAQ</a>.</p>
 Data Privacy 
<p>What is public and what is private on Bluesky?</p>
<p>Bluesky is a public social network. Think of your posts as blog posts – anyone on the web can see them, even those without an invite code. An invite code simply grants access to the service we’re running that lets you publish a post yourself. (Developers familiar with the API can view all posts regardless of whether they have an account themselves.)</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
 
 Posts and likes are public. 
 Blocks are public. 
 Mutes are private, but mutelists are public lists. Your mutelist subscriptions are private. 
 Invites and invite trees are private. 
 
<p>Why are my posts, likes, and blocks public?</p>
<p>The AT Protocol, which Bluesky is built on, is designed to support public conversations. To make public conversations portable across all sorts of platforms, your data is stored in data repositories that anyone can view. This means that regardless of which server you choose to join, you’ll still be able to see posts across the whole network, and if you choose to change servers, you can easily take all of your data with you. This is what causes the user experience of Bluesky, a federated protocol, to be similar to all the other social media apps you have used before.</p>
<p>Can I set my profile to be private?</p>
<p>Currently, there are no private profiles on Bluesky.</p>
<p>What happens when I delete a post?</p>
<p>After you delete a post, it will be immediately removed from the user-facing app. Any images attached to your post will be immediately deleted in our data storage too.</p>
<p>However, it takes a bit longer for the text content of a post to be fully deleted in storage. The text content is stored in a non-readable form, but it is possible to query the data via the API. We will periodically perform back-end deletes to entirely wipe this data.</p>
<p>Can I get a copy of all of my data?</p>
<p>Yes — the AT Protocol keeps user data in a<a href="https://github.com/web3-storage/ipfs-car"> content-addressed archive</a>. This archive can be used to migrate account data across servers. For developers, you can use <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-sync#comatprotosyncgetcheckout">this method</a> to export a copy of your repository. For non-devs, the tooling is still being built to make it easy.</p>
<p>You can read our privacy policy <a href="https://bsky.app/support/privacy">here</a>.</p>
 Moderation 
<p>What does muting do?</p>
<p>Muting prevents you from seeing any notifications or top-level posts from an account. If they reply to a thread, you’ll see a section that says “Post from an account you muted” with an option to show the post. The account will not know that they have been muted.</p>
<p>What does blocking do?</p>
<p>Blocking prevents interaction. When you block an account, both you and the other account will no longer be able to see or interact with each other’s posts.</p>
<p>How do I flag abuse?</p>
<p>You can report posts by clicking on the three-dot menu. You can also report an entire account by visiting their profile and clicking the three-dot menu there.</p>
<p>Where can I read more about your plans for moderation?</p>
<p>We wrote about our approach to composable moderation <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">here</a> and we’ll continue to publish more in the near future.</p>
 Custom Feeds 
<p>What are custom feeds?</p>
<p>Custom feeds is a feature on Bluesky that allows you to pick the algorithm that powers your social media experience. Imagine you want your timeline to only be posts from your mutuals, or only posts that have cat photos, or only posts related to sports — you can simply pick your feed of choice from an open marketplace.</p>
<p>For users, the ability to customize their feed returns control of their attention to themselves. For developers, an open marketplace of feeds provides the freedom to experiment and publish algorithms that anyone can use.</p>
<p>You can read more about custom feeds and algorithmic choice in our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">blog post here</a>.</p>
<p>How do I use custom feeds?</p>
<p>On Bluesky, click "My Feeds" on the left side of the app. From there, you can add and discover new feeds.</p>
<p>How can I create a custom feed?</p>
<p>Developers can use our <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator">feed generator starter kit</a> to create a custom feed. Eventually, we will provide better tooling such that anyone, including non-developers, can build custom feeds.</p>
 Invite codes 
<p>I don’t have access to Bluesky yet. How can I get an invite code?</p>
<p>We regularly send out invites to our waitlist, which you can sign up for <a href="https://bsky.app/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I have an invite code, how can I access Bluesky?</p>
<p>When you get an invite code, you can download Bluesky from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199">iOS App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play Store</a>. You can also use our web app at <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a>.</p>
<p>When do I get invite codes? Do they expire?</p>
<p>Most accounts receive invite codes after they’ve been on Bluesky for a while. We periodically send invites to existing users. These codes do not expire, unless we perform a security upgrade on all codes. In that case, a security upgrade will change each invite code’s combination of letters, but it will not affect the number of codes that you have.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when we take action to moderate an account, we may revoke invite codes from that account and other accounts in the same invite tree.</p>
<p>Why does Bluesky use an invite code system?</p>
<p>Invites helps us control growth of our beta as we finish building the tooling for moderation and curation. It also gives us visibility into the growing social graph. We will likely continue to use invite codes as we increase access to the app. At that time, each account will receive many more invite codes to hand out.</p>
<p>The code we use to distribute invites is open source and can be used by other server admins to grow their own communities over time as well.</p>
<p>How does the Bluesky server use the invite tree?</p>
<p>We reference the invite tree to track behavior on the social graph. For example, if we take action to moderate an account, we may revoke invite codes from other accounts in the same invite tree.</p>
 Security 
<p>How can I reset my password?</p>
<p>Click “Forgot” on the sign-in screen. You will receive an email with a reset code.</p>
<p>What if I didn’t get a password reset email?</p>
<p>If you didn’t receive a password reset email, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a>.</p>
<p>Will you implement two-factor authentication (2FA)?</p>
<p>Yes, implementing 2FA is on our short-term roadmap.</p>
 Bluesky, the AT Protocol, and Federation 
<p>What’s the difference between Bluesky and the AT Protocol?</p>
<p>Bluesky, the public benefit company, is developing two products: the <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a>, and the microblogging app Bluesky. Bluesky, the app, is meant to demonstrate the features of the underlying protocol. The AT Protocol is built to support an entire ecosystem of social apps that extends beyond microblogging.</p>
<p>You can read more about the differences between Bluesky and the AT Protocol in our general FAQ <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/faq">here</a>.</p>
<p>How does federation affect me, as a user of the Bluesky app?</p>
<p>We’re prioritizing user experience and want to make Bluesky as user-friendly as possible. Regardless of which server you join, you’ll be able to see posts from people on other servers and take your data with you if you choose to move servers.</p>
<p>Is Bluesky built on a blockchain? Does it use cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>No, and no.</p>

<p>Passkey support, our third passwordless developer option, has arrived for ODD SDK.</p> What are Passkeys? <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/">WebAuthn API</a>, or Passkeys, is a user authentication system that replaces passwords using cryptography. We'll dive more into passkeys, how they work, and how they differ from other passwordless options in this blog post, but first, let's review why developers should consider building passwordless apps.</p> The Benefits of Going Passwordless <p>There are several benefits to going passwordless for both users and developers.</p><p>1) Improved Security - This is a biggy! Machine learning is getting better at cracking passwords, and phishing attempts have gotten more sophisticated. Even the savviest users can fall prey to professional hackers. Data leaks jeopardize the exposed passwords and any accounts where users have re-used that password. App creators must have tight security when creating databases to store user passwords - the GDPR risks are enough to keep anyone up at night.</p><p>Passkeys cannot be guessed, and they are end-to-end encrypted. Phishing apps or websites created to steal users' keys won't work (unlike blockchain wallet keys) because these keys are inextricably linked to the user's device and verified by a special token (which we'll expand on in this post shortly).</p><p>2) Better User Experience - Unless a user has a subscription to a password manager (and even those can get <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/lastpass-breaches-cast-doubt-on-password-manager-safety/">compromised</a>), they have to either write down or memorize all their passwords. When they inevitably forget their password, they must go through an account recovery process that can be frustrating when the user is short on time.</p> Fission's Passwordless Options <p>App developers using <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD SDK</a> currently have two passwordless options - WebCrypto API and WalletAuth. </p><p>WebCrypto API gives the browser fairly low-level cryptographic building blocks, which include encryption and signatures. A user's private key is stored in their browser, and no one, not even the user, can extricate it. If they created their account on their laptop and want to access it on their mobile phone, they have to link their devices to do so (this is a simple process using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper/blob/5c1fba894a9fe51811e47865ed62d26e989a0807/accounts/login/awake.md#L4">AWAKE protocol</a>, also part of ODD SDK). </p><p>The upsides of WebCrypto API - it's highly secure and user-friendly. There are many tools built into it for developers to use. The downside - developers need to know what they want to build ahead of time. It's like getting a box of LEGO but no directions.</p><p>WalletAuth allows developers to integrate the Metamask browser extension wallet for user sign-in. When users connect to an ODD SDK app, they can access on-chain data as usual, as well as encrypted off-chain data storage features.</p><p>The upside - it's great for Web3 dapps and Web3 users who are comfortable with blockchain wallets and want to seamlessly work with both on and off-chain data. The downside - users who are not Web3 savvy will be very intimidated by this type of login option.</p> Under the Hood <p>At the beginning of this article, we learned that WebAuthn is a user authentication system that replaces passwords using cryptography. Instead of using a username and password, the user authenticates with a key stored on their device and signs some unique data with that key. </p><p>The unique data is divided into two parts: Client Data and Authenticator Data. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#dictdef-collectedclientdata">Client Data</a> includes contextual information about the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#webauthn-relying-party">WebAuthn Relying Party</a> and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#client">WebAuthn Client</a>. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-authenticator-data">Authenticator Data</a> includes contextual information that derives its trustworthiness from the WebAuthn Relying Party's assessment of the security of the authenticator. </p><p>In other words, the unique data seeks to understand the relationship between the app (or specifically, the WebAuthn Relying Party who created the app) and the user (specifically, the user agent - i.e. the browser or mobile app they are using) and determines whether the app can securely verify the user. On both sides, there is a layer of abstraction to ensure privacy and trustworthiness.</p><p>After the user signs the unique data, they embed that signature and unique data into a Public Key Credential. It uses the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/how-fido-works/">FIDO standard</a> and is a container just like JWT that formats the public key, signature, and unique data in a specific way according to the spec. </p> Passkeys in Action <p>Fission engineer Hugo Dias has spent months diving deep into the passkeys spec, learning what works across browsers and operating systems. As a result, he's put together a <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys">passkeys library</a> that developers can use to add passkeys support to their ODD apps. </p><p>Hugo has created two demos to demonstrate passkey syncing and sharing.</p><p>This first video shows passkeys syncing across devices with Google Password Manager. Using the Android emulator, we visit <a href="https://passkeys.fission.app/">https://passkeys.fission.app</a> (the version on Hugo's personal domain <code>hugodias.me</code>) and create a new user with a passkey-based login.</p><p>The user is now logged in on Android and can upload and access files.</p><p>Switching to Google Password Manager, we see that the passkey for <code>hugodias.me</code> has been saved and synced.</p><p>We can now switch to a desktop browser, visit the same app, and get a prompt to use a saved passkey. A pin is used to unlock.</p><p>Once logged in, we can see that the picture uploaded on mobile is accessible on a desktop web browser, synced through user WNFS files.</p><p>This second video demonstrates navigating to <a href="https://passkeys.fission.app/">https://passkeys.fission.app</a> using the Android Mobile emulator. <code>hugo-sharing</code> is logged in.</p><p>The website is a progressive web app that is installable on Android, so “Install app” is chosen from the Android Chrome browser menu.</p><p>Once installed, the ODD logo appears on the home screen. After launching, we see that <code>hugo-sharing</code> is still logged in, as it uses the same context as the website version.</p><p>Switching to the Google Photos app, the Android share function is used. Selecting the installed ODD app uploads the photo into the user’s WNFS.</p><p>The share button again uses Android native share functionality, and we can share from the installed ODD PWA app over to WhatsApp (or any other Android app). </p><p>View the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys/tree/main/examples/odd-passkeys-preact">GitHub source notes</a> for more information on these features.</p><p>You can start developing with passkeys in ODD SDK today. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys">ODD SDK Passkeys repo</a> to get started.</p>

<p>Are you wondering what it’s like to facilitate a remote design sprint? Are you searching for ways to make your sprint work? If yes, then this post is for you! If not, no problem; you can still enjoy the tales of a designer going through his first remote design sprint&nbsp;😀</p><p>I’m a Senior Product Designer at Onfido, an identity verification provider. We used a design sprint format to validate an idea that wasn’t part of our quarterly objectives. Going through the sprint process aligned stakeholders on the overall goal and made everyone part of the solution.</p><p>As you might know already, the design sprint process <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint">is well documented</a>, and you can find plenty of resources across the World Wide Web. So I decided that I would add up to the pile myself! I listed the most useful resources at the end. Suppose you’re searching for good material to prepare for your sprint. Hopefully, you find the following bits of advice and learnings useful for yourself.</p>Screenshot of the completed Miro board&nbsp;:D Preparation is&nbsp;key   Make it easy for yourself to facilitate. Prep in advance for every voting activity, timer, board, etc. You should be able to arrive at the activity and know the steps to follow just by seeing the board. I used this template made by Jake Knapp and Stéph Cruchon 👉 <a href="https://miro.com/miroverse/design-sprint-jake-knapp/">https://miro.com/miroverse/design-sprint-jake-knapp/</a>. I did modify it to include process information like timing and number of votes per&nbsp;person.  Remote means you’ll be on Zoom (video call) all day. PLAN LOTS OF BREAKS! I think it goes without saying, but a 10–15min break can save so much mental space and keep focus and attention from your sprint team. It can also give people space to answer some Slack messages, emails, you know&nbsp;… manage their “real work”. One every hour, give or take, is what we implemented and felt&nbsp;nice.  Keep the book near you! Or any activity reference on your computer. You don’t need to know everything because you will forget them anyway. Before each session, I would skim through the reference to refresh my memory. That helped me be more knowledgeable of the task and be able to give directives easily.  When the facilitator forgets the only material&nbsp;needed…<p>Quick fun fact: I only asked one thing for the team to prepare. Have A4 white paper and a black pen for the Sketching day. 15min before the sketching exercise, I realise… I don’t have A4 paper myself 🤦 So I ran to buy a block of 360 A4 paper… (sorry for the “ill”, I was “race walking” and typing on my phone). Told you you’re going to forget&nbsp;things!</p> Being adaptable is priceless   Problems will surely arise, and you need to be ok dealing with them. A debate that goes for too long, an unplanned drop-out, an unavailable expert/user,&nbsp;… the list goes on. Whatever you plan will be put to the test. Knowing things will change allows you to remove the pressure of perfection. Keep in mind that the sprint must go&nbsp;on!  It is fine to have a break in the middle of an activity to check things (I learned that from trying to be a dungeon master 😉). If you don’t know something, take a 5min break and check your reference or find a solution to the problem. No shame in saying, “Sorry, I don’t know how to proceed right now; let’s have a small break so that I can review the process.” Another solution is to ask your group! How would they prefer to solve the issue? How would they change the activity? What information do they need?&nbsp;…  <p>Not so-quick fact: On Wednesday, you decide many things, from the solution to the flow of the prototype itself. And be sure that your team members will try to modify the decision you made 30 minutes, 1 hour ago. During the storyboarding activity, our group was stuck on “what ifs” and “why not change that”, deep inside conversations about very specific and technical subjects. I was boiling inside as the decisions weren’t happening! Seeing that we were not going anywhere, I put a hard stop on conversations and gave a 10min break for everyone. It allowed me to take a breather, think and regain the lead of the conversation. Sometimes cutting short helps you move&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Time pressure is a stress you will experience. The best advice I can give is: “If you are in a hurry, then slow down.” (unsure where this quote comes from, either from a German or Chinese proverb if you ask&nbsp;Google)</p> The importance of the team you&nbsp;choose   As important as picking an impactful challenge, you need the right people in your team. A person who cares about the issue will show engagement and motivation. These are powerful drivers to have a successful sprint. Team members will stay focused, engage in conversations, and overall put energy into doing things&nbsp;well.  Perspective diversity should come with relevant team members. I’m glad that everyone in the sprint shared and learned something! Humans are curious by nature, so having different points of view will generate engagement through learning and rewards through&nbsp;sharing.  Having people with specific skills can help you design a feasible solution. Luckily we had 2–3 engineers in our team that helped us create a close-to-reality prototype! An interactive, half-coded prototype through Framer suited our use case. You shouldn’t base your choice on this,&nbsp;though.   Engage the team when you&nbsp;can   Within exercises, give them roles or ask them to do some tasks. <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/articles/remote-design-sprint-guide">The bible for remote design sprint</a> referenced below advises it. That was also the first feedback I received on the first day: “When you organise post-its or move things from one board to another, you can ask the group to help. You don’t have to do it by yourself! It’ll save time.” And they were right! I decided to involve them more in the day-to-day logistics. Involving them lowered my stress level and slightly improved their attention and engagement in the activity.  Make each person in the team shine during the week. Everyone has a skill or personality trait that can make the week easier or the work better! An engineer solving a problem? Give them a shout-out at the end of the day. Does a Product Manager have the best voice and temper for testing? Allow them to interview. A very knowledgeable team member? Give them 30min to expose their knowledge.  Let them shine even outside of activities! I used Chat GPT to create “inspirational sentences” for every day of the week. One in the morning within an automated Slack message and one at the end of the day in the meeting. This person in our group started to ask for a sentence written in a specific style (like pirate or medieval), which resulted in some excellent impressions and stylistic reading of these quotes. I started to ask them what style did they want each day as well as leaving this person have a little show. That was a great moment between the team and perfect to end each day on a positive&nbsp;note!  <p>Thursday’s end-of-the-day 🤖 chat GPT quote in an evangelist priest&nbsp;style:</p>ChatGPT conversation to create an inspirational sentence for my design sprint team on Thursday after finishing a prototype in one afternoon. TIPS: don’t use the word “quote” if you want something like this. Otherwise, it will get you a quote from someone, not “create&nbsp;one”.<blockquote>Hallelujah, my brothers and sisters! Let us gather ‘round and bear witness to the miracle that is about to unfold before us. For in this very afternoon, through our unwavering faith and tireless labor, we shall bring forth a prototype that shall reign supreme and conquer all doubters! So let us join our hearts and minds together, and let the power of our convictions guide our hands as we march towards glory!&nbsp;Amen!”</blockquote><p>Was our solution the perfect one? No. Did the week help us validate our idea? Mostly. Did we all learn something? Absolutely! This is a reminder that a design sprint is not a process in which you will end up with a fully ready-to-build product. Insights and learnings are the primary output. These will inform a product decision; iterating or building. In our case, we learned that our direction was good, but we needed to refine the solution&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Overall facilitating a design sprint is an excellent exercise for designers. The one we did was a one-off “bubble week” for me. By that, I meant facilitating a design sprint for a team I didn’t work in. This allowed a focus on the process and facilitation aspect of product&nbsp;design.</p><p>Ultimately you practice leading exercises, people and projects using lots of communication skills. Product design is about working with different people, so these skills are useful! I encourage everyone to try a design sprint; it’s a great experience! And obviously, have fun with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thanks for reading&nbsp;🙂</p><p>Sharing is caring!

In this role, my main duties include: developing social media and marketing strategies to drive engagement and increase followers; creating content and campaigns; analyzing social listening and monitoring data; and conducting internal and external communications, including but not limited to media, KOLs, partners, exchanges, and event organizers.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>What makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains is the fact that it has remained focused on Decentralized Identities (DID) and building the infrastructure and tools for Web3 for the past five years. We employ an exceptional tech team and a devoted marketing and business development team, who are dedicated to our overall&nbsp;vision.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Ontology offers individuals new opportunities, bringing awareness to DID and giving users back control in order to manage their own personal data and online identities.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>While I have reached many notable milestones throughout my time at Ontology, the most prominent is building our global community from 3 languages to over 30+ languages worldwide. Additionally, the creation of the Harbinger program is an important moment in my career to date. Essentially, it is a network of passionate blockchain and Web3 lovers and contributors. Launched in 2020, it has played a major part in helping us build a strong global community presence.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I’m most excited for more applications for DID and users owning and having complete control over their own data and identities.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In the future, I anticipate that Ontology will be leading Web3 when it comes to DID. For Web3 more generally, I expect to see mass adoption of Web3 technologies. Just like we witnessed with Web2 and the rapid growth of smartphones and social media, individuals will realize that it’s essential to adopt this technology and understand what it can&nbsp;offer.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-head-of-social-media-christina-lu-7db02fe1cad0">Meet the Team: Head of Social Media, Christina Lu</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The estimated global crypto ownership rate is around <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/#:~:text=As%20of%202023%2C%20we%20estimated,420%20million%20crypto%20users%20worldwide.">4.2%</a>, with more than 420 million crypto users worldwide. Although Hong Kong falls beyond the global average with an ownership percentage of 2.35%, more than 175,000 people own cryptocurrency there.</p><p>With the new regulations are set to come into place in June 2023. Industry experts, analysts, large investors, individual participants, and crypto enthusiasts — all are busy assessing potential challenges and opportunities that lie on this regulated road&nbsp;ahead.</p> Understanding the new&nbsp;climate <p>The new regulations come with the final guidelines for crypto exchanges looking to launch in Hong Kong this&nbsp;May.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://wp.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/20230427_Synopsis-CEO-at-Bloomberg-APAC-Policy-Series-English.pdf">regulatory synopsis</a> issued on 27th April 2023 by Ms. Julia Leung, the CEO of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, the SFC is “working with global counterparts to set baseline standards to regulate centralized virtual asset exchanges for adoption in major markets.”</p><p>The commission held public consultations on crypto exchange regulations last year to determine the best way for retail investors to access cryptocurrencies. It also wanted to test the feasibility of offering crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the geography. Indicating considerable buzz for the framework to come into place, the SFC received over 150 responses from the&nbsp;public.</p><p>The new regulations are also considered a milestone as they would let investors trade in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum from June 1st this&nbsp;year.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/hong-kongs-proposed-asset-regulation-sparks-industry-optimism">Hong Kong’s Proposed Asset Regulation Sparks Industry&nbsp;Optimism</a></p> Current crypto situation <p>The new regulations will considerably impact the crypto climate in Hong Kong, presenting a significant market opportunity for the crypto industry. According to Chainanalysis, cryptocurrency values received by internet addresses in Hong Kong were around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/hong-kongs-crypto-push-sets-up-race-bottom-2022-11-22/">US$70 billion</a> in the first half of 2022&nbsp;alone.</p> The New Regulations <p>The new regulations come under the legislative purview of the ‘Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill&nbsp;2022.”</p><p>According to its stated <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf">objectives</a>, the bill wants to amend the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinances (AMLO) to establish a licensing system for Virtual Asset Service Providers and apply the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under Schedule 2 to AMLO to&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges <p>Once the new regulations come into effect, crypto-related service providers will require an SFC license to operate in Hong Kong. And to obtain a license, they would have to furnish a detailed plan for combating money laundering risks and protecting their investors from such breaches and intrusions.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1656109508668653570?s=20">Image Source</a><p>In a broader sense, the new regulations would help set standards and benchmarks for crypto regulations in Hong Kong, a region actively pursuing the goal of becoming a crypto hub — not only in Asia but at a global scale — for some time&nbsp;now.</p><p>Numbers suggest that over<a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/over-80-web3-firms-set-up-shop-in-hk-ahead-crypto-regulations-take-effect-june/"> 80</a> foreign and Mainland China companies have already expressed interest in setting up their Web3 company through this licensing mechanism. The interest indicates positivity towards norms that advocate system regularization and protection of investor rights and interests.</p> Comparison With Previous Regulatory Frameworks <p>Many new regulations often come at the cost of destabilizing the traditional system, but that is not the case with the Hong Kong crypto licensing rules, as it would subject providers to the same AML and counter-terrorist financing legislation that traditional financial institutions follow. Hence, one can expect a seamless or at least considerably less friction in the transformative process when it becomes effective from June 1st&nbsp;onwards.</p> Implications for Cryptocurrency Exchanges <p>Although the new regime is set to come into effect from June 2023, at least <a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/over-80-web3-firms-set-up-shop-in-hk-ahead-crypto-regulations-take-effect-june/">23 businesses</a>, out of the 80 that expressed interest, according to Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and Treasury Christopher Hui, are already setting up their presence in Hong Kong. And these 23 not only include crypto exchanges but Web3 security companies, blockchain payment providers, blockchain infrastructure builders, and&nbsp;more.</p> Adaptation strategies of local exchanges <p>Adapting to the imminent regulatory shifts and challenges could be easy for local exchanges by fulfilling the core demand: exhibiting the capability to perform due diligence on their customers and meet Hong Kong’s AML and anti-terrorist financing standards. Only then would it become easier to receive a&nbsp;license!</p> Potential challenges and opportunities <p>The potential challenge may arise from something common to most of the transformative processes worldwide: arranging provisions for compliance and setting up a robust mechanism for conducting adequate due diligence. It involves upskilling the existing compliance team. The team needs to become aware and set up the system following what has been asked&nbsp;for.</p><p>What awaits providers at the end of the compliance and diligence tunnel are enhanced trust from consumers, increased transparency in the system, and the scope of a pumped-up audience&nbsp;base.</p><p>The Hong Kong authorities are also coming out with increased support for virtual asset service providers willing to pass through this regime. For instance, Hong Kong has allocated <a href="https://www.budget.gov.hk/2023/eng/budget10.html">HK$50 million</a> in its annual budget spending to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Comparative analysis with other jurisdictions <p>Similar to Hong Kong, a lot of adjacent and global jurisdictions are also proactively taking up the job of regulating virtual assets and the Web3 economy. And crypto entrepreneurs believe that when compared to Singapore and South Korea, Hong Kong’s new crypto regulations would be much similar to Singapore’s approach. Both are focused on protecting investors, institutional and retail&nbsp;alike.</p> Global and Asian Crypto&nbsp;Climate <p>Like Singapore and South Korea, being part of the Asia continent helps Hong Kong become a participant in the most thriving crypto market globally. Out of more than 420 million estimated crypto owners worldwide, more than 260 million are from the Asian market&nbsp;itself.</p> Key trends in global cryptocurrency adoption <p>It has to be kept in mind that Asia is also the most populous geographic region among continents in the world. However, other continents are also picking up speed in terms of gaining adoption and traction.</p><p>The number of owners in North America is more than 54 million, followed by Africa (38 million+), South America (33 million+), Europe (31 million+), and Oceania (15 million+).</p><p>In Asia, while regions like Singapore and Hong Kong are keen to encourage growth in the Web3 ecosystem, some countries like South Korea want to tread cautiously. Hong Kong, on the other hand, is moving forward in a structured way. The current exchange licensing system will be followed by stablecoin regulations in&nbsp;2024.</p> Influence of international regulations <p>Along with its Asian counterparts, there are many countries or regions which are considering introducing similar regulatory systems.</p><p>For instance, the European Parliament has already approved the first set of comprehensive rules to regulate cryptocurrency markets, known as MiCA or Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation.</p><p>Dubai has also set up the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority as a unique body regulating Virtual assets across&nbsp;Dubai.</p><p>All these international regulatory institutions are expected to duly influence the crypto market in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">EU Parliament Greenflags MiCA — Potential Impact on the Crypto Landscape</a></p> History of Cryptocurrency in Hong&nbsp;Kong <p>Hong Kong, for some time now, has been looked at as one of the most preferred crypto destinations in the world. In fact, the <a href="https://forexsuggest.com/worldwide-crypto-readiness-report/">Worldwide Crypto Readiness Report</a> termed Hong Kong as the most crypto-ready location in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>In 2022, Hong Kong topped the charts in all categories, including the number of blockchain startups per 100,000 people and the number of crypto ATMs proportional to the population. The region was ahead of some of the most thriving global economies, including the US and Switzerland.</p><p>Over the years, multiple local crypto companies have emerged in the region, such as Kikitrade, Saxo Crypto Products, MYETHSHOP, CoinUnited.io, and other cryptocurrency trading and educational platforms, hubs, and&nbsp;more.</p> Regulatory Framework and Government Initiatives <p>We have already discussed the form and potential use cases of the upcoming crypto licensing mechanism in Hong Kong. It is also to be noted that the region’s AMLO aligns with the global recommendations of FATF. It requires VASPs across countries to adhere to an anti-money laundering benchmark in countering fraud, breaches, and financing terrorism regulations.</p><p>The Securities and Futures Commission is the primary body looking after the execution of the imminent licensing regime in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) <p>Founded in 1989, the Commission’s job is to work as an independent statutory body to regulate Hong Kong’s securities and futures markets. Its principal responsibilities are to maintain and promote fairness, efficiency, competitiveness, transparency, and orderliness in the securities and futures industry.</p> Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) <p>One of the most crucial legislations that the SFC is bothered with in regulating the crypto industry is the <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf">AMLO</a>. In the Hong Kong special administrative region, the legislation comes with an ordinance. The ordinance amends the laws to apply customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements to virtual asset service providers.</p> Government support and initiatives <p>While regulations are set in place, the Hong Kong government is also keen to keep its support window open for the holistic growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>Cyberport came up with Web3@Cyberport in the early half of the 2023–24 financial year. According to the <a href="https://www.budget.gov.hk/2023/eng/budget10.html">official budget document</a>, HK$50 million was allocated to expedite the Web3 ecosystem development by “organizing major international seminars” and promoting “cross-sectoral business cooperation.”</p> Collaboration with Mainland&nbsp;China <p>When it comes to calibrating the region’s crypto strategies with that of Mainland China, Xiao Feng, the Chairman of the Hong Kong Crypto exchange HashKey, believes that the Hong Kong government’s emphasis is on practicing different laws from mainland China under the “One Country, Two Systems” framework.</p> Market Opportunities and Key&nbsp;Players <p>The<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/List-of-licensed-virtual-asset-trading-platforms"> SFC list</a> of licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong includes OSL Digital Securities Limited and Hash Blockchain Limited. Invariably the list of such exchanges is set to grow in the coming days, with local exchanges coming up in accordance with the regime and increasing their market share and accelerating growth.</p><p>Brands like Hex Trust, fully licensed, insured digital asset custodians, are also active in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>NUTS Finance is a blockchain development lab active in Hong Kong that focuses on building secure, composable, open-source technology to enable decentralized finance services. DTTD, another Hong Kong-based service, makes managing NFTs across multiple crypto wallets easy. Xversem, a Hong Kong-located service, aims at building effective Bitcoin wallets for Web3. Hong Kong-based Pictta is a mobile-first, gasless, and social-enabled NFT marketplace.</p><p>Such examples are many, and the bouquet of such service &amp; product companies is bound to grow in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> Challenges and&nbsp;Risks <p>It is evident that implementing the licensing mechanism will come with its share of challenges and&nbsp;risks.</p><p>Any new regulation introduced in an existing market is bound to create friction in the system. Companies will have to exhibit to the regulators and their consumers that they can do due diligence and protect the investor from potential hacks, attacks, breaches, laundering, and other possible mismanagement of funds. At the same time, they will have to comply with global benchmarks for protecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Necessarily, it would have to be a consistent effort, demanding a fixed cost to be incurred by businesses every quarter. There are chances that occasional volatility in an emergent market like crypto will take a toll on the company’s bottom line. It is essential to have efficient fund management practices in place so that companies do not lack in their compliance and diligence efforts.</p><p>The People’s Republic of China’s <a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/the-peoples-republic-of-chinas-digital-yuan-its-environment-design-and-implications">Digital Yuan</a> promised to achieve a “relatively high degree of financial inclusion” and aid in developing “various large-scale financial platforms” that reduce the cost of providing financial services. Its presence could also play a decisive role in shaping the future of crypto services in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Future Outlook and&nbsp;Trends <p>Despite all these potential challenges, Hong Kong is looking toward a brighter future in crypto services. Blockchain and DeFi are high-potential areas with a lot to offer to people who still lack access to traditional finance&nbsp;avenues.</p><p>Merging of blockchain and crypto services to the traditional finance functions of lending and borrowing, underwriting, etc., have already started. One only needs to be careful of promises made to promote the new economic order that Web3 has the power to introduce through the decentralization route.</p> Final Note <p>The imminent regulations and licensing regimes in Hong Kong present both risks and opportunities to the crypto investor and user communities.</p><p>While regulatory compliance may lower the speed of innovation and pump up costs, the investors stand to gain from a more protective atmosphere in general. There is also the scope for businesses to enjoy long-term premiums by offering enhanced trust and transparency.</p><p>Every stakeholder must stay updated on the shifts and changes happening in the regime. It always helps steer ahead in an evolving market with less friction and optimal cost-efficiency.</p> Mickey and the Hong Kong Crypto&nbsp;Quest  Additional Resources <p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/bills/b202206241.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/bills/b202206241.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-d47fcbd59076">The Shyft Perspective: Hong Kong’s New Crypto Climate</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			  Lautaro Giambroni is Product Owner&nbsp;at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hi there! I’m Lautaro Giambroni, a Product Owner at Tokeny. I’m 27 years old and was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I earned my engineering degree there and later pursued a master’s degree in financial markets in Spain.<br>
<br>
From a young age, I’ve been interested in how technology and digital products shape the world and improve people’s lives. It’s a passion that has driven me to continue my career in this field, and in recent years, I’ve been closely following the exciting developments in the blockchain space.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked in various companies related to the financial and banking sector. As a UX designer, product manager, and innovation consultant, I gained experience and insights into the industry. However, I couldn’t help but notice the outdated structures and practices that seemed to hinder innovation in the sector.<br>
<br>
Seeking to make a real impact, I came across Tokeny. What really stood out to me was the innovative approach to leveraging blockchain technology to transform financial operations in companies, as well as their commitment to bringing the benefits of blockchain to society.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Working here is an awesome experience. The best part is the team I get to work with, who are not only highly skilled but also share the same passion to make finance easy-to-access and efficient for everyone via our leading tokenization platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work we do is demanding, but it’s also highly rewarding. Our product is growing at a fast pace, and keeping up with the disruptive innovations in the DeFi industry can be a challenge. However, seeing the team’s hard work come to fruition after a release makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>Being part of a company that is driving real change in the industry is something I’m grateful for every day. The tech industry is an exciting place to be, and being part of a team that is leading the way is truly amazing.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>There are two things that really ignite my passion: meeting new cultures and learning new skills. I’ve had the opportunity to live in different countries, and that experience has fueled my desire to explore new places, try new foods, and meet people from all walks of life. In addition to that, I’m always looking to learn new skills. Whether it’s taking up a new hobby or improving my professional background, I’m eager to expand my knowledge and challenge myself. Lately, I’ve been getting into surfing, and I started practicing analogic photography.</p>
<p>Overall, I think it’s important to stay curious and keep pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. Life is all about growth and learning, and I’m passionate about embracing that journey and seeing where it takes me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Over the past decade, my home country has faced one of the worst financial crises in its recent history, marked by high unemployment rates, inflation, and a lack of economic stability. This has caused many young people, including myself, to leave in search of a better future. It’s a difficult reality that I would love to see change.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe that decentralized finance could have an impact. Especially in a country where the monetary policy has been mismanaged, and lack of transparency has led to a loss of trust in local currency. Ultimately, my dream is to contribute to creating better conditions for the people in my home country.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>As a future Tokeny employee, you will have the opportunity to learn and grow as a professional in a dynamic and innovative environment. We work hard to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of tokenization, and we’re constantly looking for new ways to innovate and make a difference.<br>
<br>
So, my advice to any prospective employee is simple: join the team and be prepared to work hard, learn a lot, and make a real difference in the world of tokenization. We will be excited to have you on board!<br>
</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>What excites me the most about Tokeny’s future is the tremendous potential for growth in the tokenization market. Over the past few years, we’ve seen significant growth in this space, and it’s estimated that the market will continue to grow at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>Being part of a company at the forefront of this market is truly amazing. Our platform is designed to empower firms seeking to digitize their operations and benefit from the latest advancements in technology.</p>
<p>I am proud to be part of a company that is driving real change in the industry, and I’m excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Decentralized Identities in all their facets have been a hot topic at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023 (EIC)</a>, which ran in Berlin last week. Just a few days before, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/12/linkedin-and-microsoft-entra-introduce-a-new-way-to-verify-your-workplace/">announced</a> their support for Verified Workplace in LinkedIn using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id">Microsoft Entra Verified ID</a>.</p>
<p>Verifying the workplace</p>
<p>What Microsoft announced is focused on a particular use case, the verification of workplaces of LinkedIn members. It builds on multi-step verification.</p>
<p>The entry level is workplace email verification. There is little friction in that. Organizations can verify the work mail of their employees based on a lightweight WebApp adding to the Microsoft Entra Verified ID service, which again requires a Microsoft Entra Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. Factually, this allows issuing verified credentials/IDs based on Azure AD or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Microsoft also will provide, together with its partner Clear, a government identity verification and binding to this. This adds another level of proof.</p>
<p>The third step then is a wallet for professionals that, in the first phase, can accept verified credentials. Enterprises can issue credentials to their employees that can be shared with LinkedIn or to Microsoft Authenticator for verification beyond LinkedIn. This thus integrates both the Microsoft Authenticator and LinkedIn – relying parties that are talking to the Authenticator also can talk to LinkedIn and the Authenticator can be used for extended verification scenarios.</p>
<p>Microsoft is basing this on the (still emerging set of) standards around decentralized identity, making it interoperable.</p>
<p>The first step into practice and towards critical mass</p>
<p>While the announcement is focused on a specific use case, it is an important step forward towards the ubiquitous use of decentralized identities:</p>
 
 It demonstrates a concrete, practical application of decentralized identities. 
 It builds on standards for interoperability. 
 It is supported by a growing partner ecosystem. 
 It neatly integrates with Microsoft Entra (including Azure Active Directory), LinkedIn, etc., and can be integrated with further solutions. 
 It provides concrete value to the users. 
 It helps in creating a critical mass of users. 
 
<p>At the EIC, I’ve illustrated my talk about decentralized identity in the enterprise with the employee and partner onboarding use case, where a verified government ID is used for initial onboarding and proofs of employment and job title/role are used for partner onboarding. In the public preview, Microsoft is demonstrating such a use case in combination with Entitlement Management, a feature within Microsoft Entra.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to seeing broader adoption of the Decentralized Identity model across the globe. Approaches such as the one announced by Microsoft can help it happen earlier.</p>

 A Step-by-Step Guide! <p>Embarking on your DeFi journey with Ontology just got easier! With the power of iZUMi Finance, you can now swap your ONG for ONT in a few simple steps. This guide will walk you through the process, helping you navigate the decentralized exchange (DEX) like a pro. So, whether you’re a seasoned DeFi enthusiast or a newcomer to the space, let’s get started and master the art of swapping!</p> Three steps on how to turn ONG into ONT via the&nbsp;DEX:  Step 1: Transfer ONG (Ontology) to ONG (ORC20) with Ontology&nbsp;Bridge   Go to: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">https://bridge.ont.io</a>, connect non-EVM wallet and EVM wallet. You should see your wallet address displayed once&nbsp;done.    Click the ONG Transfer button as shown in the figure&nbsp;below.  Choose Non-EVM from the Wallet column (Your native address will be recognized automatically then) and fill in the EVM address (To which ORC-20 ONG will be&nbsp;sent)  Click “Transfer” when everything is good, make sure you have enough ONG for the gas fee (0.05 ONG each transaction).   Step 2: Use iziSwap to swap ONG (ORC-20) to WONT&nbsp;(ORC-20)   Go to: <a href="https://izumi.finance/trade/swap">https://izumi.finance/trade/swap</a>, locate in the top right corner and click the “Connect Wallet” button to connect metamask wallet. Also, switch to “Ontology” in your wallet’s network settings.  Time to swap “ONG” into “WONT”. The top token or “from” placeholder depicts the token you own (ONG in this scenario), while the second token or “to” placeholder represents the token you receive (WONT in this scenario) after the successful swap.  Double check the amount you want to swap and make sure you prepare enough ORC-20 ONG for the gas fee (Around 0.5 ONG for each transaction).  Click swap and confirm the transaction. If the transaction is successful, a message will appear in the bottom right corner of the&nbsp;page.   Step 3: Bridge WONT (ORC20) to ONT (Ontology) with Ontology&nbsp;Bridge   Go to: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">https://bridge.ont.io</a> again.This time we should use Token&nbsp;Bridge.  Let’s choose “WONT” in the assets list and ensure the asset will be bridged from ORC-20 into Ontology&nbsp;native.  Double check the amount and make sure you have enough ORC-20 ONG for the gas fee (Around 0.15 ONG normally).  Click Swap and confirm the transaction. You ONT will be available in a short&nbsp;time.

<p>Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA), is a security measure used to verify a person’s identity by asking them to provide specific information that only they should know.<br>
How Does Knowledge-Based Authentication Work?<br>
The idea is that these questions serve as a block for other individuals who should not know the user’s private information but which the user has immediate knowledge of (and does not have to memorize).</p>
<p>KBA questions can be generated in two primary approaches: static and dynamic.</p>
<p>Static KBA<br>
Static approaches involve selecting a set of predetermined questions that users can choose from when setting up their KBA. These questions are often personal, referring to highly personalized experiences or preferences that would be difficult for an attacker to guess without directly knowing the user.</p>
<p>Examples of static KBA questions include:</p>
 
 What is your mother’s maiden name? 
 What was the name of your first pet? 
 In what city were you born? 
 What is your favorite book? 
 
<p>These questions are typically selected during user onboarding. Later, when the user accesses the account, they are asked to provide the answers to those same questions.</p>
<p>Dynamic KBA<br>
Dynamic approaches, as a form of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/adaptive-authentication/">adaptive authentication</a>, will generate questions based on information from various data sources tied to the user, such as public records, credit reports, or social media profiles. The system uses algorithms to select relevant, personalized questions only the user should know. Examples of dynamic KBA questions include:</p>
 
 Which of the following addresses have you lived at in the past? 
 What was the name of your elementary school? 
 Which of these phone numbers have you previously used? 
 What bank/financial institution/auto lender do you have a loan/bank account/credit account with? 
 
<p>The generation process for dynamic KBA questions typically involves data aggregation and analysis to create a set of potential questions.</p>
<p>Both static and dynamic KBA have their pros and cons, with static KBA being more straightforward to implement but potentially less secure due to the limited set of questions. Dynamic KBA is more secure since it generates personalized questions based on the user’s unique background. Still, it requires access to reliable data sources and can be more complex to implement.</p>
 How Effective Is Knowledge-Based Authentication? 
<p>KBA can provide a reasonable level of security in cases where it is used with other authentication methods. As a standalone method, however, it has some limitations.<br>
Some of the critical issues with KBA include:</p>
 
 Guessable Answers: Answers to static KBA questions may be easy to guess or research using publicly available information, such as social media profiles, online directories, or leaked data from breaches. This makes KBA more susceptible to attacks by determined adversaries. 
 Data Breaches: If an organization suffers a data breach, the answers to KBA questions may be compromised, rendering the KBA process ineffective for affected users. 
 Knowledge and Memory: Users might need to remember their answers, leading to account lockouts and frustration. Additionally, users might give easy-to-guess or common answers that are easier to guess. 
 Social Engineering: Attackers can use techniques like phishing or pretexting, to trick users into revealing the answers to their KBA questions. 
 
<p>Due to these limitations, KBA is generally considered less secure than other authentication methods like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) or biometrics. While it can still serve as an additional layer of security, organizations are increasingly adopting more advanced and secure authentication methods to protect user accounts and sensitive information better.</p>
 Is Knowledge-Based Authentication Used in Multi-Factor Authentication? 
<p>MFA requires users to present multiple factors to verify their identity before granting access to a system, application, or resource.</p>
<p>These factors are typically classified into three categories:</p>
 
 Knowledge: This factor includes information that only the user should know, such as passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), or answers to knowledge-based authentication (KBA) questions. 
 Possession: This factor involves something the user physically possesses, such as a hardware token, a one-time password (OTP) sent to a registered mobile device, or a software token generated by an authenticator app. 
 Inherence: This factor refers to biometric characteristics unique to the user, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, or iris/retina scans. 
 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication can fit into the knowledge category. But, broadly, KBA isn’t a replacement for passwords or PINs. However, and more appropriately, KBA can provide another, easy-to-implement layer on top of MFA.</p>
<p>So, for example, if a user attempts to access their credit report, the provider can ask for a password and a one-time password sent via email. Then, when the user logs in, the provider can use dynamic KBA to ask questions related to the credit report, adding another layer of security to an incredibly sensitive document.</p>
 What Are Some Alternatives to Knowledge-Based Authentication? 
<p>Several alternatives to Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) provide more secure and reliable methods for verifying a user’s identity. Some popular alternatives include:</p>
 
 Token-Based Authentication: One-time passwords are unique, time-sensitive codes generated by a dedicated hardware token, mobile device, or software application. The user must enter the OTP in addition to their standard password to authenticate their identity. Since OTPs expire after a short period or upon use, they offer a more secure alternative to KBA. 
 Device Authentication: Verification systems can use push notifications or apps to allow users the ability to authenticate via their device, typically a mobile device. While these devices can be compromised, they will, at minimum, greatly reduce the attack surface that could impact those users. 
 Biometrics: Biometric authentication relies on unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/what-is-behavioral-biometrics-authentication/">behavioral biometrics</a>, or facial scans, to verify a user’s identity. Biometric authentication is more secure than KBA because it is based on features unique to the individual, making it difficult for attackers to spoof. 
 
<p>These alternatives offer varying levels of security, usability, and implementation complexity, depending on the specific use case and the organization’s requirements. Many organizations opt for a combination of these methods to provide a more robust and secure authentication process.</p>
 Ground Your Security in Identity-Based Authentication with 1Kosmos 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication is a useful companion to other forms of identity verification but only a small part of it. Implementing such solutions can help add layers of security but don’t serve as a replacement for solid security techniques like identity verification, biometrics, and passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>1Kosmos provides these critical fundamentals through the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture, and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>This is the story of how we built an open source company that specializes in developing the identity, data, and compute protocols for the future of the Internet.</p>Poutine Meetup in Berlin<p>Fission’s co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@boris">Boris Mann</a>, has been on the Internet for a long time. As one of the first 1,000 bloggers in the world, Boris loved being able to publish content online but recognized the challenges to making self-publishing possible for everyone. Running a server under your desk at home, installing software on the command line, and generally having the necessary technical know-how is neither realistic nor equitable.</p><p>Discovering the Drupal open source content management system and its worldwide network of contributors was an eye-opener: here was software and more importantly community working on making it possible for anyone to publish online. Boris became an active contributor, including helping to organize events that grow from 40 people to 1000s of Drupalcon attendees, and helping to form the Drupal Association.</p><p>At the same time, large proprietary software companies, like Microsoft, were working hard to retain their market position. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents">They viewed open source software as a dangerous competitor</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">adopted internal policies</a> to thwart the advancement of FOSS. </p><p>Boris continues to advocate for and share open source code, data, and community principles. Building better together, so that people can have more control and agency of technology for better communication and collaboration online and off. </p> <p>Fission's co-founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, started studying music composition at the University of Calgary and doing graphic design projects on the side. She picked up Photoshop and Illustrator and eventually dropped out of music school and moved to Vancouver. About five years later, while doing graphic design professionally at a friend's startup, she was given a book on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and asked if she could learn a bit of web development. By the end of the year, Brooklyn had taught herself over 20 programming languages.</p><p>Brooklyn became deeply involved in the local meetup scene, running multiple communities across many topics. She became involved in international functional programming and distributed systems conferences after she ported the Haskell standard library to Elixir. (It later tuned out that functional data structures are a great fit for IPLD).</p><p>Eventually, Brooklyn decided she wanted to return to startups, and was hired by a company based out of San Francisco. She and her Vancouver co-worker rented a desk from Boris's <a href="https://fullstack.ca/">co-working space</a>, which is how they met!</p><p>Brooklyn went on to do consulting work for Facebook, Uber, Kickstarter, and many others. After writing the same boilerplate for the nth time and fighting with k8s, she started to feel that there must be a better way. She began early designs of things that would eventually find their way into Fission.</p><p>After a couple of years away travelling as a digital nomad, she she returned to Vancouver in 2017. She joined Boris as principal engineer at a company working on Ethereum-based, legally compliant infrastructure. Brooklyn then focused on writing a formally verifiable smart contract language that was also human-readable (so that a lawyer could review the code).</p>April 2019, RUN EVM event in Berlin<p>Excited by the potential of a backend as a service, aka the "world computer" of Ethereum, Boris and Brooklyn together founded a company called SPADE ("Special Projects and Decentralized Engineering") and received an important grant from the ConsenSys Tachyon program to work on Ethereum Status Codes, which were later renamed FISSION Codes. They were one of only two companies to receive an open-source grant (the other being WalletConnect).</p><p>While building FISSION Codes, both Boris and Brooklyn started to recognize that the real challenge for both Web2 and Web3 was the increasing complexity of putting together full stack applications – plus the devops needs of running such apps. Except now, these problems were compounded by complex security needs and a more fervent demand for user control and agency. Users had been burned by Web2 exploitation and were becoming more discerning and knowledgeable about how their privacy was being compromised.</p><p>While the Web3 of blockchain, decentralized web, and p2p components were new and everyone was learning, all of the same challenges of needing to gain all of the increasingly complex skills of full stack app development and deployment were there.</p><p>After spending time on core Ethereum development &amp; community building, our cofounders asked themselves:</p><p>What if some of the emerging concepts of &nbsp;Web3 – advances in distributed systems, cryptography, and self verifiable data structures – could make it dramatically easier for front end developers to build apps, without having to become full stack developers and devops experts.</p><p>And so Fission the company was born: building an edge stack with identity, data, and compute components that enables front-end developers to build local-first apps while respecting user privacy and agency. </p>The 2019 Diffusion Hackathon grand winners, Marco and Eugene, were gifted a 4L jug of maple syrup for using the first version of the Fission service in their winning entry<p>In a Web2 stack, to put an app online, you need to run a server to hold user data. All of this data is visible to the people that run the service, and the incentives are typically to lock the users' data into the service. Never mind scaling and devops server management.</p><p>In prototyping, front end developers use dummy data in the browser without having to worry about setting up a server.</p><p>What if they could make that much simpler prototype development capable of running the production data? It would make development much easier for developers, and data wouldn't have to leave the device! By default, it would have to respect user agency. </p><p>Fission (as it is now known) became a member of the <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs Network</a> and started to build on top of the IPFS protocol. This direction would lead to the inventions of UCAN (decentralized user auth) and WNFS (user file system on top of IPFS with encrypted private data).</p><p>Today <a href="https://odd.dev/">our front end developer SDK</a> has evolved its storage solution into an overall data solution. We are working on a far-edge database called <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">Rhizome</a> to be added to the mix. We continue to iterate and collaborate with others on UCAN and other decentralized identity tools and have done an initial release of the final piece of our edge stack: content-addressed computation on IPFS with the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipvm-computation-ipfs/">InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM</a>) specification.</p><p>Our commitment to community building and open-source development is unwavering, and we look forward to continuing to grow and collaborate within this robust and exciting ecosystem.</p>

<p>This is a guest blog by <a href="https://medium.com/u/49286d46d497">Abu Majid</a>, Storyteller at Story x&nbsp;Design</p><p>As a multimedia producer at Nairobi-based Story x Design, I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating on four Caribou Digital research projects since October 2020. When Caribou Digital reached out in February 2022 asking to expand our participatory video storytelling methodology to meet the needs of digital platform workers living with disabilities, we had the opportunity to rethink our processes, from training, to filming, to the accessibility of our final&nbsp;edits.</p><p>An <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/a-platform-of-their-own-our-experience-running-a-participatory-video-storytelling-project-e90075e3f69d">earlier blog</a> by Story x Design Director Miranda Grant outlines our original participatory storytelling methods and offers tips for those interested in this filmmaking process. This blog reflects on our experience of collaborating with persons living with disabilities to create short documentaries about their lives and how we adapted our methods to fit their needs. We recount our design process, learnings, successes, and contingencies to barriers encountered.</p><p>This research, co-led by <a href="https://inable.org/">InAble</a> and Caribou Digital and in partnership with Mastercard Foundation, aims to understand the experiences and challenges of young people living with disabilities and engaging on platforms for work. With the support of InAble and Caribou Digital, we designed open-ended questionnaires to elicit authentic reflections on the challenges faced and strategies employed by platform workers living with disabilities. Our agile approach allowed us to stay nimble, learn from participants, and adjust as required throughout the&nbsp;process.</p> Three key adjustments to our&nbsp;process   Adapting the project design to ensure access for all. In order to make our collaboration with persons living with disabilities beneficial to them, we tweaked some of our supporting tools (i.e., film practice manuals, questionnaires, film prompts) for ease of use to all participants.  Working with interpreters and aides to accommodate multiple abilities. With the great support of a sign language interpreter and individual aides, we were able to help each participant identify and express the stories most important to them through a mix of in-person and one-on-one narrative and technical skills training. This hybrid mentoring approach helped participants gain confidence in their abilities to self-direct their own&nbsp;stories.  Diversifying post-production. Our versatile post-production, leveraging WhatsApp video / voice calls / voice notes and regular carrier calls, but also importantly in-person training, enabled us to stay in close touch with the participants who faced different types of challenges creating their&nbsp;content.   Adapting the project&nbsp;design  1. Adapting resources <p>Our participatory self-shot video diaries approach was developed in 2020 as a countermeasure to the COVID-19 lockdown. The framework requires the deployment of equipment and intensive multimedia skills training to all participants, where success depends on participants’ comprehension and willingness to contribute on their own time. So this process can be time and resource intensive. However, even after the COVID-19 lockdown was lifted, we decided to carry on with the self-shot video approach as participants expressed their eagerness to tell their own stories and willingness to take up the role of self-directing.</p><p>As per our usual process, we distributed a small smartphone production kit to each participant. But made a few adjustments to accommodate those who took&nbsp;part.</p><p>The phones were preloaded with:</p>  Six instructional videos on the downloadable VLC phone application. These instructional videos were embedded with a voiceover (VO) feature that defined and detailed basic film terms and techniques. The VO not only navigated participants with visual impairment through the content but also offered relatable examples for all to try. See a sample Story x Design instructional video&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd3m6aJBzAs">here</a>.  A readable softcopy instructional manual for the native <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">TalkBack</a> assistive application for both the visually and hearing impaired.  An audio instructional manual for the visually impaired participants and their&nbsp;aides.  Hardcopy instructional manuals for&nbsp;all.  A softcopy questionnaire and prompt document readable with TalkBack apps for all participants.   2. Working with aides during skills training and&nbsp;filming <p>We gathered with five of the six participants and their aides in a conference room in Thika Town, 44 kilometers from Nairobi City, a central location for all in attendance.</p><p>Together with participants and aides, we explored the self-shot video diaries format, examining proper camera orientation, sound capture, lighting, framing, and many more good film practices. Ongoing virtual mentorship provided participants with the support necessary to overcome technical and creative challenges over the course of production.</p><p>The close collaboration with interpreters and aides was key to enabling transparent communication with participants, in particular about the use of participants’ images and published videos. With clearly drafted agreement and image release forms, participants with their aides as witnesses, read, understood and after being satisfied, signed onto contributing to the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Participants and aides were compensated for their work on this project. Participants received ongoing payments to purchase internet bundles for uploading large media files throughout production, as well as a one-time payment on project completion. Aides were provided with per diems for their efforts in supporting filming.</p> 3. Diversifying post-production <p>A key addition to this project was Monica Onyango, a sign language interpreter who helped translate footage submitted by the participants with hearing impairment. This enabled the post-production team to transcribe and edit subtitles to build a story that honored the contributors.</p><p>In one case where one of the visually impaired participants could not manage to find help in filming and sending more footage, we successfully sought her consent to use her voice notes as voice overs to missing segments in her story. This was in line with our desire to create a safe, accommodating space that offered an equal platform for expression.</p> Challenges and contingencies <p>We recognized that there would be challenges that we had not faced before. Although the six participants all come from one country and one time zone, and had experience navigating digital platforms, none had experience self-directing for video or taking part in a collaborative multimedia project of this&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Beyond the usual challenges in supporting the production of self-directed videos, here are some specific challenges people with disabilities faced.</p>  The need for in-person support. In addition to an initial in-person training, participants required one-on-one mentorship and refresher sessions throughout the duration of the project. When internet connections failed, team members needed to visit participants with visual impairment in person for troubleshooting and automatic upload restoration. Similarly, when capturing B-roll proved too challenging for participants, we traveled to support, while taking great care to follow participants’ self-direction and maintain the participatory project&nbsp;design.  The availability of aides. Even with per diems on offer, most aides were unavailable on occasion, particularly because most aides selected by participants were fellow students, and others had full-time jobs. Consequently, production was often halted as the visually impaired participants waited for&nbsp;help.  The authenticity of participants’ stories. We wanted to highlight participants’ authentic techniques of navigating the digital world to find work and understand their challenges. However, we refrained from asking questions beyond what participants revealed, allowing them to authentically share their successes and obstacles, instead of only emphasizing their disabilities.   Self-determination <p>The most gratifying measure of achievement for all of us is the fact that the expressions of all participants were not dictated, directed, or curtailed. At each stage of the project, participants had full control of their stories and authority on what to feature in their final&nbsp;videos.</p><p>All contributors stated that they felt liberated and supported throughout the projects, which made even the most difficult moments feel like blips in the project’s timeline.</p><p>To those looking to produce user-generated content in collaboration with people from all walks of life, we hope these learnings serve you well. There are many measures to evaluate a film, documentary, or piece of text, but no number can ever be placed on the impact of people feeling seen, listened to, and&nbsp;moved.</p><p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSJyLOKwzy5_ghJMy-gG50twQMN6TYKC3">Watch The Youth With Disabilities Digital Platform Experience videos&nbsp;here.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/persons-living-with-disabilities-self-directing-their-own-stories-93e2f5d4e8c">Persons Living With Disabilities Self-Directing Their Own Stories</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>IDENTOS rolls out Navigator 3.0, a new release of its digital front door product featuring simplified navigation for users and improved content management for administrators</p>
<p><a href="https://identos.com/">IDENTOS Inc</a>., a leader in digital identity and access management, has launched the latest version of its Community Navigator, Navigator 3.0. This new Navigator includes key updates that improve the end-user experience and offer greater ease in managing content.&nbsp; It enables organizations to launch modern user-centric digital front door services and integrate digital services seamlessly, including the ability to deliver a patient-centric digital health ecosystem.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.identos.com/community-navigator/">Community Navigator</a>: more than just a digital front door.</p>
<p>Navigator 3.0 (Nav 3.0) builds on the company’s previous Community Navigator version (Nav 2.0), a configurable digital front door, which leverages IDENTOS’ <a href="https://www.identos.com/federated-privacy-exchange/">FPX</a> standards based identity and consent APIs to safely share data across a set of trusted service partners. This facilitates a privacy respecting, secure, and personalized user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Community Navigator:</p>
<p>-Enables digital service discovery: an easily configurable app to support simple integrations or a complex marketplace of partners for your users to discover.</p>
<p>-Is built for trusted onboarding and digital identity services: facilitates onboarding of one or multiple digital services without requiring an organization to overhaul their existing/internal workflows.</p>
<p>-Allows for granular data sharing: <a href="https://www.identos.com/federated-privacy-exchange/">IDENTOS’ FPX</a> standards based identity and consent APIs allows for the safe sharing of data across a set of trusted service partners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Benefits/features of the updated Navigator</p>
<p>-A simplified end-user experience: enabled by a simplified navigation in the Navigator and its Wallet application through the introduction of user-friendly tabs and buttons – improving discoverability of content and integrated services.</p>
<p>-A modern web-based application that retains the benefits of a native iOS and Android application: facilitated by a web-based interface using open pervasive technology (html and css) that resides in a native application shell enabling IDENTOS to offer the benefits of both native and web apps.&nbsp; This allows for instantaneous content updates, without needing to re-submit to App stores.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Increased flexibility around adding, updating or removing content for administrators: resulting in improved efficiency surrounding content management.</p>
<p>These significant enhancements will benefit various institutions, including government, financial and health service providers. This also includes health teams and healthcare systems that operate with several EMRs/EHRs, ACOs, and entities accountable for ensuring seamless care delivery with a collaborative approach to healthcare.</p>
<p>Availability<br>IDENTOS’ Navigator 3.0 updates are available today to new and existing customers.</p>
