 Veriscope Weekly Recap — 25th July to 31st&nbsp;July  Country adoption is on the horizon, but it will be regulated. <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Weekly Recap. The crypto market was comparatively stable last week, with a majority of leading digital assets in green. That said, despite the recovering market, the digital assets regulatory landscape remained heated. So, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> The Central African Republic Requests the Bank of Central African States for Help Drafting Crypto Regulations <p>Recently, the Bank of Central African States, the regional financial regulator, claimed that the government of the Central African Republic requested its assistance in drafting crypto regulations.</p><p>This is a sign of cooling tensions between the regional Central Bank and the Bangui government over the latter’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as a legal&nbsp;tender.</p><p>The Bank of Central African States oversees the financial industry in six countries, combinedly known as “the Economic and Monetary Community of Central&nbsp;Africa.”</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-the-central-african-republic-requests-regional-central-banks-assistance-in-crafting-crypto-regulations/">https://news.bitcoin.com/report-the-central-african-republic-requests-regional-central-banks-assistance-in-crafting-crypto-regulations/</a></p> Philippines Central Bank Governor Says he is Against Banning Cryptocurrencies, but Cautions Investors of About Their Volatility <p>During an interview with Forkast Media, the Philippines Central Bank Governor Felipe Medalla shared his views on crypto regulation, noting that he doesn’t want to ban&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>While answering the question “What’s your take on cryptocurrency?” Medalla responded, “I don’t want it banned, but I don’t want to call it cryptocurrency.” Instead, the governor referred to cryptocurrencies as “crypto assets” to highlight their volatile&nbsp;nature.</p><p>The central bank governor further commented on the ongoing crypto winter and advised the investors not to invest money they could not afford to&nbsp;lose.</p><p>Medalla also emphasized from a policy aspect that crypto assets should not be utilized to dodge anti-money laundering and know your customer&nbsp;laws.</p><p>As for cryptocurrency exchanges, the governor said it’s the central bank’s policy to implement “all the rules that are needed to prevent money laundering, especially to finance&nbsp;crimes.”</p><p>Read more&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/philippine-central-bank-governor-explains-crypto-policy-i-dont-want-it-banned/">https://news.bitcoin.com/philippine-central-bank-governor-explains-crypto-policy-i-dont-want-it-banned/</a></p> Hong Kong Declared as the Most Crypto Ready Country in&nbsp;2022 <p>A Forex Suggest report declared Hong Kong as the most crypto-ready country in 2022 by examining the number of blockchain firms in each nation, the laws and tax regulations governing digital assets, the number of ATMs, and the interest in the industry per&nbsp;capita.</p><p>For starters, the Hong Kong government is pretty welcoming of the crypto industry and doesn’t charge investors or firms any taxes over their profits from trading digital currencies.</p><p>As for the density of crypto ATMs, Hong Kong had two machines per 100,000 people. Thus, Hong Kong came in the top position with 8.6 points out of&nbsp;10.</p><p>The United States, which had the crown previously, earned 7.7 points. There are ten machines for every 100,000 individuals in the United States, with a total number of crypto ATMs in the country over&nbsp;33,000.</p><p>Switzerland came in the third spot with a score of 7.5 points. The country has a large number of blockchain firms and does not tax cryptocurrency gains.</p><p>Read more&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/hong-kong-positioned-as-the-most-cryptoready-country-in-2022-2854593">https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/hong-kong-positioned-as-the-most-cryptoready-country-in-2022-2854593</a></p> UK Government Publishes the Financial Services and Markets&nbsp;Bill <p>The UK Government published the Financial Services and Market Bill, whose Section 22 will enable the UK Treasury to enforce laws governing cryptocurrency payments referred to as “digital settlement assets” in the proposed&nbsp;bill.</p><p>If implemented, it would enable the UK authorities to exert control over specific types of stablecoin as a means of payment in the United Kingdom, besides giving more powers to the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p><p>Read more&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://complyadvantage.com/insights/uk-government-publishes-financial-services-and-markets-bill/">https://complyadvantage.com/insights/uk-government-publishes-financial-services-and-markets-bill/</a></p><p>Amid the upward market movement last week, the investor sentiment has become much more positive than it was a week or two&nbsp;before.</p><p>Yet, it did not affect global regulators’ resolve to reign in the crypto industry, which is evident from the Philippines Central Bank governor’s statement on cryptocurrencies.</p><p>As such, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) will see more crypto regulations in the coming days. Thus, VASPs must comply with all the international and national digital assets to stay on the safe&nbsp;side.</p><p>Take the FATF’s Travel Rule, for instance, which only a few countries have adopted, such as South Korea and Singapore. The number of countries that have adopted the FATF Travel Rule may seem small now, but with the FATF urging countries to adopt the rule soon, the number will go up in the coming&nbsp;days.</p><p>And VASPs that do not have to comply with the Travel Rule now may have to begin doing so&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Thus, it’s better to stay prepared. There’s nothing to worry though. All VASPs need to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution (TRS), and none beats Veriscope.</p><p>Veriscope is the only solution to the much-dreaded “Sunrise Issue.” Check it out here: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">https://www.veriscope.network/</a> and reach out to our BizDev team for a discussion here: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/contact">https://www.veriscope.network/contact</a></p><p>Also, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShyftNetwork">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a> for regular updates on all things crypto regulations.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve been hearing recently is that decentralized identity is the "next cycle" to continue to drive the adoption of Web3. Decentralized identity is not “the next cycle” following the whole “DeFi season, NFT season, DAO season” narrative. Rather, it’s the continual catalyst that will unlock a new set of use-cases on top of those existing paradigms that were previously unavailable. </p><p>In short, decentralized identity adds the following in a trust-minimized and user-centric manner:</p>  Who you are - which is a core set of claims about a person or entity.  What you can do - which are any available actions based on those claims, which are verified and originated from a relevant source.   <p>We can illustrate this with our good friend Steve:</p>We like Steve<p>In this case, we have a core set of claims that unlock different things for the subject, including physical access, group memberships, and more. </p><p>With current technologies, we can have a user sign-in using their keys (e.g. <a href="https://login.xyz">Sign-In with Ethereum</a>), have <a href="https://spruceid.dev">credentials issued</a> to their identifier (and store them), and use capabilities to retrieve and present those credentials. In a future post, I’ll break down the core basics of decentralized identity – everything from DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, and more. The use-cases that these types of workflows empower will really be what drives the space to another level during the next cycle. </p><p>To start with the basics, we need to set the stage with how the web3 space operates now, and then how it can operate in the future.</p> The Future is Now Blockchain 1.0<p>Our current scope with no external verifiable data deals strictly with asset exchange. Two parties can trustlessly transfer assets with no intermediary, based on a particular time (whether immediate, within a certain amount of blocks), or confirmation thresholds (enough signers to send from a multisig). </p><p>We’ve been able to reinvent an entire set of financial interactions, making them trustless by using this type of exchange, and it’s quite incredible. But beyond that, it becomes difficult to have more meaningful interactions because the more we trust the other side of the trade without additional verifiable information, the more counterparty risk we incur. How do we know <code>0xaLiCe</code> is who they say they are? </p>Exclusively Available on OpenEden&nbsp;<p>Let’s take this a step further by now introducing a case where a form of authenticity is required in some way about one of the counterparties. </p><p>This wonderful painting of Steve requires a bit of provenance tracing in order to be sold, and with that, knowing that the artist is the seller, and was responsible for creating the work. This is because we want a first edition copy of Steve sold directly by the artist (who wouldn't). Adding additional information such as some basic facts about a counterparty reintroduces trust in the transaction. </p><p>This comes with the correlation risk that there is now a name attached to a public key. However, the seller here has taken on this risk because the asset in question is worth more than the cost of the trust portion of this transaction. </p><p>Now with the additional context we’ve added, this interaction becomes safer due to Bob knowing that he’s buying this original Steve from the artist. Bob in this case may or may not associate his name with his public key, as he doesn’t require any form of authenticity. The trust portion of the transaction typically falls on the originator. Alice just needs to know that Bob has the money to pay for the art. Other than that, she couldn't care less who the buyer is. </p><p>That’s the beauty of this space: both counterparties don’t necessarily need the same assurance levels.</p><p><a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/levels-assurance-loas#:~:text=A%20level%20of%20(identity)%20assurance,the%20claimant's%20%E2%80%9Ctrue%E2%80%9D%20identity.">Levels of assurance</a> (LOA) represent the trust cost based on the stakes of the transaction itself. For example, if Alice has a name and a few social media handles tied to a public key, she may be able to prove authenticity when it comes to selling NFTs – a low assurance use case. </p><p>We’ve introduced some risk with these forms of personally identifiable information (PII), but as we go up the chain in information sensitivity requirements, unfortunately, it requires much more risk on Alice who has to meet some criteria for the transaction and disclose information. </p><p>A case where a government-issued identifier might be required would be a scenario in which Alice wants to participate in a permissioned DeFi protocol with KYC [customer/counterparty] requirements. Thankfully are ways in which Alice can prove her identity without having to publicly disclose any of this information:</p>Blockchain 10.0<p>In the case above, Alice can have a credential issued for a particular purpose, store it in a personal data vault, and only authorize access to that credential when she consents to the interaction. Additionally, Alice controls this credential at all times and can present it to any requesting platform: it isn’t limited to a single platform because it’s a credential she owns and controls. </p> What Comes Next  <p>With these kinds of interactions now possible, there’s a lot more we can do in the space, and plenty of new avenues unlocked:</p> DeFi   Currently, lending in DeFi is mostly overcollateralized so there’s a backstop in case of any market uncertainty. With credentials gained from a variety of on-chain and off-chain sources, undercollateralized lending with richer credit histories used as evidence is now possible. With additional information, risk can now be accurately assessed.  Additionally, permissioned trading and lending pools in DeFi are now possible for institutions, as you can accurately identify counterparties with enough assurance through credentialing.   NFTs and DeSoc   Currently, you have limited assurance levels on who you’re interacting with when buying NFTs. By assembling just the right amount of information through credentialing (such as social media accounts and other art-related connections), you know exactly who you’re buying from without having to solely rely on centralized platform verification processes.  Decentralized knowledge bases are now possible, as you can accurately assess the fact that a reputable author or creator is the one producing specialized content.  Decentralized identity and data also open up the possibility of exporting one’s social graph, including all connections, followers, posts, and more that can be portable and travel with users from platform to platform. &nbsp;   DAOs   Decentralized Identity will dramatically change the way DAOs operate, especially in the context of delegation. Your steward won't just be a public key, but a mix of on and off-chain information that makes them both qualified and trustworthy to earn your voting power.  DAO members would now also be able to demonstrate skills and earned certifications that travel with them to different DAOs. For example, in the case of a worker collective, each worker can attest to certifications that they’ve earned in order to assert that they are the most qualified for a job to be done.   <p>Decentralized identity isn’t the next big thing - but instead, it’s the necessary component in order to power a new future. </p><p>However, the future is quite closer than it seems.</p> <p>If you want to chat about decentralized identity or any related use-cases, check out our Discord server:</p><a href="http://discord.gg/WjvuYqvm5Y"></a><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>Before delving into our newsletter, I would like to share with you a great announcement from our team:&nbsp;We are pleased to have integrated our solutions with Fireblocks&nbsp;– an enterprise-grade platform for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets, who serves over 1,300 financial institutions.&nbsp;This integration will enable Fireblocks to provide a turnkey tokenization solution for its customers&nbsp;with the ability to deploy and manage permissioned tokens such as digital securities, stablecoins and loyalty tokens.</p>
<p>We’re very excited about this partnership as tokenization continues to storm into the financial and business development strategies of financial institutions, and this kind of ready-to-use solutions will be the catalyst for the tokenization prosperity. However, while more financial instruments and real-world assets are being brought to blockchain,&nbsp;the full potential of tokenized securities lies post-tokenization.</p>
 Collateralization is currently the main DeFi use case 
<p>It allows users to easily obtain a loan with their cryptocurrency as a collateral from someone else in an investor pool. The whole process takes place on a DeFi platform, run via smart contracts, without any intermediary. However, the same can not be said for tokenized securities yet, due to compliance, valuation, and liquidity issues.</p>
<p>While the traditional finance concept of allowing borrowers to use something valuable as the guarantee to obtain a loan remains the same,&nbsp;in DeFi the trustee is replaced by smart contracts.&nbsp;Instead of middlemen performing manual operations, the codes themselves will execute actions when all conditions are met.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Collateralization of tokenized securities is coming<br>
 
<p>The pledge of tokenized assets is possible but more complicated, which explains why it is little used at the moment: These&nbsp;crypto-lending protocols work well because cryptos are very liquid, and the market prices are well known. It enables DeFi protocols to efficiently calculate the LTV (loan-to-value), and to automate liquidations in the event of nonpayment by the borrower or loss of value of the pledged asset. Indeed, even though cryptocurrencies have high liquidity, they are also volatile.</p>
<p>With security tokens, it is currently more difficult to determine the value of the token, and to get enough liquidity to reach the same automation level of the process. For sure, we have a type of token that is usually backed by the value of real-world assets, so they are less likely to fluctuate as much as they do with cryptos. As a result, liquidations should be less frequent. However, they will still need to be enforced if the borrower doesn’t pay back the debt.</p>
<p>Calculating net asset value (NAV) can be costly, lengthy, and difficult for issuers&nbsp;due to the nature of the underlying assets in general. Valuation service providers, such as our partner Inveniam, are needed in this case so that issuers can adequately and accurately assess their valuation and link this pricing data to their tokens. This will drastically help to use tokenized securities as collateral.</p>
<p>The other problem is the lack of liquidity. Liquidators will only guarantee that they will buy the assets if they get a good price, and if they can resell the tokenized asset on the secondary market. In the crypto market, these liquidations can be fully automated. For digital securities, there is no venue with enough liquidity yet. That is why&nbsp;Tokeny is working actively to interconnect liquidity providers, whether it is decentralized exchange protocols, regulated exchanges or digital trading desks.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Permissioned lending protocols to make DeFi compliant 
<p>Last but not least, it is mandatory for issuers to apply compliance rules in any operations with their tokens. As compliance rules are embedded in the token, the lending protocol will only work with eligible token holders and may also want to restrict its access to certain types of investors. For this, Tokeny already leverages the digital identity system&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_YIFjJk8kF0VZRWfj0LQ5EH-Ez9iFGtRmyvTvhmBYjKhoB-w0bszdfB9iSm4iD_ujP3Lh">ONCHAINID</a>&nbsp;to whitelist users. By using such a digital identity system, lending protocols can provide DeFi services to qualified users in a compliant manner, attract institutional investors, and increase the liquidity of tokenized securities.</p>
<p>The tokenization of assets is the first step in bringing more assets on-chain, leading to greater benefits and more use cases. Our vision is to see tokenized securities at the center of all value chains in the financial market. Isn’t it exciting?</p>

<p>Spring is a long-time friend to enterprise companies throughout the world. When Spring Boot came along in 2014, it greatly simplified configuring a Spring application. This led to widespread adoption and continued investment in related Spring projects.</p>
 
 
<p>One of my favorite Spring projects is Spring Security. In most cases, it simplifies web security to just a few lines of code. HTTP Basic, JDBC, JWT, OpenID Connect/OAuth 2.0, you name it—Spring Security does it!</p>
 
 
<p>You might notice I didn’t mention SAML as an authentication type. That’s because I don’t recommend it. The specification for SAML 2.0 was published in March 2005, before smartphones or smart devices even existed. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is much easier for developers to use and understand. Using SAML in 2022 is like implementing a web service using WS-* instead of REST.</p>
 
 
<p>My recommendation: just use OIDC.</p>
 
 
<p>If you must use SAML with Spring Boot, this tutorial should make it quick and easy.</p>

 What is SAML? 
 
 
<p>Security Assertion Markup Language is an XML-based way of doing web authentication and authorization. It works cross-domain, so SaaS applications and other enterprise software often support it.</p>
 
 
<p>Nick Gamb has an excellent overview in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-6QSEqDJPo">A Developer’s Guide to SAML</a>.</p>
 
 
            
         
 
<p>If you want to learn how Spring Security implements SAML, please read its <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/login/index.html">SAML 2.0 Login docs</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Add a SAML application on Okta 
 
 
<p>To begin, you’ll need an Okta developer account. You can create one at <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">developer.okta.com/signup</a> or install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Then, log in to your account and go to Applications &gt; Create App Integration. Select SAML 2.0 and click Next. Name your app something like <code>Spring Boot SAML</code> and click Next.</p>
 
 
<p>Use the following settings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Single sign on URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/saml2/sso/okta</code></p>
 
 
<p>Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL: ✅ (the default)</p>
 
 
<p>Audience URI: <code>http://localhost:8080/saml2/service-provider-metadata/okta</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Then click Next. Select the following options:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>I’m an Okta customer adding an internal app</p>
 
 
<p>This is an internal app that we have created</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Select Finish.</p>
 
 
<p>Okta will create your app, and you will be redirected to its Sign On tab. Scroll down to the SAML Signing Certificates and go to SHA-2 &gt; Actions &gt; View IdP Metadata. You can right-click and copy this menu item’s link or open its URL. Copy the resulting link to your clipboard. It should look something like the following:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>https://dev-13337.okta.com/app/&lt;random-characters&gt;/sso/saml/metadata</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Go to your app’s Assignment tab and assign access to the Everyone group.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Spring Boot app with SAML support 
 
 
<p>Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17. You can install it with SDKMAN:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 17-open</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The easiest way to do this tutorial is to clone the existing <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example">Spring Boot example application</a> I created.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example.git</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d rather start from scratch, you can create a brand-new Spring Boot app using <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a>. Select the following options:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Project: Gradle</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot: 3.0.0 (SNAPSHOT)</p>
 
 
<p>Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Security, Thymeleaf</p>
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also use <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=3.0.0-SNAPSHOT&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=17&amp;groupId=com.example&amp;artifactId=demo&amp;name=demo&amp;description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&amp;packageName=com.example.demo&amp;dependencies=web,security,thymeleaf">this URL</a> or HTTPie:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>https start.spring.io/starter.zip bootVersion==3.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
  dependencies==web,security,thymeleaf type==gradle-project \
  baseDir==spring-boot-saml | tar -xzvf -</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you created a brand-new app, you’ll need to complete the following steps:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Add <code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/HomeController.java</code> to populate the authenticated user’s information.</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.saml2.provider.service.authentication.Saml2AuthenticatedPrincipal;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal Saml2AuthenticatedPrincipal principal, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("name", principal.getName());
        model.addAttribute("emailAddress", principal.getFirstAttribute("email"));
        model.addAttribute("userAttributes", principal.getAttributes());
        return "home";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a <code>src/main/resources/templates/home.html</code> file to render the user’s information.</p>

    &lt;button id="logout" type="submit"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code> file to contain the metadata URI you copied in <a>Add a SAML application on Okta</a>. This value should end with <code>/sso/saml/metadata</code>.</p>
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          okta:
            assertingparty:
              metadata-uri: &lt;your-metadata-uri&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Then, change <code>build.gradle</code> to use <code>thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity6</code> instead of <code>thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5</code> and add Spring Security SAML’s dependency:</p>
 
 
 <code>implementation 'org.thymeleaf.extras:thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity6'
implementation 'org.springframework.security:spring-security-saml2-service-provider'</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>If you cloned from GitHub, you only need to update <code>application.yml</code> to include your metadata URI. You can remove the other properties as they may cause issues.</p>
 
 
 Run the app and authenticate 
 
<p>Run your Spring Boot app from your IDE or using the command line:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootRun</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Open <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favorite browser and log in with the credentials you used to create your account.</p>
 
 
<p>You should see a successful result in your browser.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you try to log out, it won’t work. Let’s fix that.</p>
 
 
 
 Add a logout feature 
 
<p>Spring Security’s SAML support has a <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/logout.html">logout feature</a> that takes a bit to configure. First, edit your application on Okta and navigate to General &gt; SAML Settings &gt; Edit.</p>
 
 
<p>Continue to the Configure SAML step and Show Advanced Settings. Select Enable Single Logout and use the following values:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Single Logout URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/logout/saml2/slo</code></p>
 
 
<p>SP Issuer: <code>http://localhost:8080/saml2/service-provider-metadata/okta</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll need to create a certificate to sign the outgoing logout request. You can create a private key and certificate using OpenSSL. Answer at least one of the questions with a value, and it should work.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout local.key -x509 -days 365 -out local.crt</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy the generated files to your app’s <code>src/main/resources</code> directory. Configure <code>signing</code> and <code>singlelogout</code> in <code>application.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          okta:
            assertingparty:
              ...
            signing:
              credentials:
                - private-key-location: classpath:local.key
                  certificate-location: classpath:local.crt
            singlelogout:
              binding: POST
              response-url: "{baseUrl}/logout/saml2/slo"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Upload the <code>local.crt</code> to your Okta app and finish its configuration. Restart and the logout button should work.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Customize authorities with Spring Security SAML 
 
<p>You might notice when you log in, the resulting page shows you have a <code>ROLE_USER</code> authority. However, when you assigned users to the app, you gave access to <code>Everyone</code>. You can configure your SAML app on Okta to send a user’s groups as an attribute. You can add other attributes like name and email too.</p>
 
 
<p>Edit your Okta app’s SAML settings and fill in the Group Attribute Statements section.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Name: <code>groups</code></p>
 
 
<p>Name format: <code>Unspecified</code></p>
 
 
<p>Filter: <code>Matches regex</code> and use <code>.*</code> for the value</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Just above, you can add other attribute statements. For instance:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>email &gt; <code>user.email</code></p>
 
 
<p>firstName &gt; <code>user.firstName</code></p>
 
 
<p>lastName &gt; <code>user.lastName</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Save these changes.</p>
 
 
<p>Then, create a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class that overrides the default configuration and uses a converter to translate the values in the <code>groups</code> attribute into Spring Security authorities.</p>

            }
            return new Saml2Authentication(principal, authentication.getSaml2Response(), authorities);
        };
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 






You might be able to remove <code>permitAll()</code> on the favicon because that was <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/11657">recently fixed in Spring Security</a>.



 
 
<p>Finally, modify your <code>build.gradle</code> file to force the latest version of Open SAML that works with Spring Security 6.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://build.shibboleth.net/nexus/content/repositories/releases/" }
}

dependencies {
    constraints {
        implementation "org.opensaml:opensaml-core:4.1.1"
        implementation "org.opensaml:opensaml-saml-api:4.1.1"
        implementation "org.opensaml:opensaml-saml-impl:4.1.1"
    }
    ...
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now, if you restart your app and log in, you should see your user’s groups as authorities. Huzzah!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Add support for Auth0 
 
 
<p>Did you know Auth0 provides support for SAML apps too? Auth0 makes it even easier to configure because its default web applications support OIDC and SAML.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/signup">Sign up for an Auth0 account</a> or <a href="https://auth0.com/api/auth/login?redirectTo=dashboard">log in</a> with your existing one. Navigate to Applications &gt; Create Application &gt; Regular Web Applications &gt; Create.</p>
 
 
<p>Select the Settings tab and change the name to <code>Spring Boot SAML</code>. Add <code>http://localhost:8080/login/saml2/sso/auth0</code> as an Allowed Callback URL.</p>
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom, expand Advanced Settings, and go to Endpoints. Copy the value of the SAML Metadata URL. You’ll need this soon. Select Save Changes.</p>
 
 
<p>If you configured your app to use these values, authentication would work, but you wouldn’t be able to log out. Scroll to the top of the page, select Addons, and enable SAML.</p>
 
 
<p>Select the Settings tab and change the (commented) JSON to be as follows:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
  "logout": {
    "callback": "http://localhost:8080/logout/saml2/slo",
    "slo_enabled": true
  }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom and click Enable.</p>
 
 
<p>Change your <code>application.yml</code> to use <code>auth0</code> instead of <code>okta</code> and copy your SAML Metadata URL into it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          auth0:
            assertingparty:
              metadata-uri: &lt;your-auth0-metadata-uri&gt;
            signing:
              credentials:
                - private-key-location: classpath:local.key
                  certificate-location: classpath:local.crt
            singlelogout:
              binding: POST
              response-url: "{baseUrl}/logout/saml2/slo"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your app, and you should be able to log in with Auth0.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You might notice that the email and authorities are not calculated correctly. This is because the claim names have changed with Auth0. Update <code>SecurityConfiguration#groupsConverter()</code> to allow both Okta and Auth0 names for groups.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>private Converter&lt;OpenSaml4AuthenticationProvider.ResponseToken, Saml2Authentication&gt; groupsConverter() {

    ...

    return (responseToken) -&gt; {
        ...
        List&lt;String&gt; groups = principal.getAttribute("groups");
        // if groups is not preset, try Auth0 attribute name
        if (groups == null) {
            groups = principal.getAttribute("http://schemas.auth0.com/roles");
        }
        ...
    };
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To make Auth0 populate a user’s groups, navigate to Auth Pipeline &gt; Rules and create a new Rule. Choose the Empty rule template. Provide a meaningful name like <code>Groups claim</code>, replace the <code>Script</code> content with the following, and Save.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>function(user, context, callback) {
  user.preferred_username = user.email;
  const roles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

  function prepareCustomClaimKey(claim) {
    return `${claim}`;
  }

  const rolesClaim = prepareCustomClaimKey('roles');

  if (context.idToken) {
    context.idToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  if (context.accessToken) {
    context.accessToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, modify <code>HomeController</code> to allow Auth0’s email attribute name.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>public class HomeController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal Saml2AuthenticatedPrincipal principal, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("name", principal.getName());
        String email = principal.getFirstAttribute("email");
        // if email is not preset, try Auth0 attribute name
        if (email == null) {
            email = principal.getFirstAttribute("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress");
        }
        model.addAttribute("emailAddress", email);
        model.addAttribute("userAttributes", principal.getAttributes());
        return "home";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your app, log in, and everything should work as expected.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Support Okta and Auth0 
 
 
<p>You can also support both Okta and Auth0! Modify your <code>application.yml</code> to be as follows, and Spring Security will prompt you for which one to log in with. The <code>&amp;name</code> and <code>*name</code> values are used to set and retrieve blocks of YAML to avoid repetition.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          auth0:
            assertingparty:
              metadata-uri: &lt;your-auth0-metadata-uri&gt;
            signing:
              credentials: &amp;signing-credentials
                - private-key-location: classpath:local.key
                  certificate-location: classpath:local.crt
            singlelogout: &amp;logout-settings
              binding: POST
              response-url: "{baseUrl}/logout/saml2/slo"
          okta:
            assertingparty:
              metadata-uri: &lt;your-okta-metadata-uri&gt;
            signing:
              credentials: *signing-credentials
            singlelogout: *logout-settings</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you restart your app with these settings, you’ll be prompted for both when you first hit <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Deploy to production 
 
 
<p>One quick way to see this app working in a production environment is to deploy it to Heroku. <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli">Install the Heroku CLI</a> and create an account to begin. Then, follow the steps below to prepare and deploy your app.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a new app on Heroku using <code>heroku create</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a <code>system.properties</code> file in the root directory of your app to force Java 17:</p>
 
 
 <code>java.runtime.version=17</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a <code>Procfile</code> that specifies how to run your app:</p>
 
 
 web: java -Xmx256m -jar build/libs/*.jar --server.port=$PORT 
 
 
 
 
<p>Commit your changes:</p>
 
 
 git add .
git commit -m "Add Heroku configuration" 
 
 
 
 
<p>Set the Gradle task to build your app:</p>
 
 
 <code>heroku config:set GRADLE_TASK="bootJar"</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Deploy to production using Git:</p>
 
 
 <code>git push heroku main</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>For authentication to work with SAML, you’ll need to update your Okta and Auth0 apps to use your Heroku app’s URL in place of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, wherever applicable.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn more about Spring Boot and Spring Security 
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning how to use Spring Security to add SAML authentication. Integration was as simple as configuring a metadata URI and only became more complicated when you added a logout feature. The ability to convert groups from your identity provider to authorities is pretty slick too!</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example">@oktadev/okta-spring-boot-example</a> repository. You can find the Auth0 example in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example/tree/auth0">auth0</a> branch. See the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example/tree/okta+auth0">okta+auth0</a> branch for the example that uses both identity providers.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>  Certificate fraud, fake credentials, slow verification processes, and data breaches are just some of the problems associated with our current digital identity systems that decentralized identity technology can solve.  Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that allows people to control their own digital identity without depending on a third party.  A decentralized identity system is made up of 3 pillars:    Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system.  Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification.  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Cryptographically verifiable identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. DIDs are stored on the blockchain, and contain no personal identifiable information.    Decentralized identity technology can be applied to a growing number of use cases including supply chain traceability, issuing fraud-proof certifications, and managing employee IDs.  Benefits of decentralized identity technology:  <p>Organizations</p><p>Individuals</p><p>Developers</p><p>Allows them to instantly verify information without having to contact the issuing party like a certification organization or university to ensure someone’s ID and credentials are valid</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Full ownership and control of their identity and credentials as there is no dependence on any party to prove their claims</p><p>Build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and inefficient authentication processes</p><p>Issuing organizations can provide Verifiable Credentials at a much lower cost while increasing efficiency</p><p>No party can take away people’s decentralized identity&nbsp;</p><p>Securely request data directly from users while maintaining their privacy</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People can decide which information they want to reveal to specific parties, such as a government or employer</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Easily manage their decentralized identity and credentials with a digital wallet app</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Not-so-fun facts: </p>  In 2021, almost 1 in 10 qualified nurses who were issued new licenses last year <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/10/1084897499/nurses-are-waiting-months-for-licenses-as-hospital-staffing-shortages-spread">waited six months or longer</a> before they could start working. More than a third of these 226,000 registered nurses and licensed practical nurses waited at least three months.  Supply chain fraud is an increasingly global business risk for organizations. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners say that <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/be/pdf/Markets/supply-chain-fraud.pdf">83.5% of fraud cases</a> it surveyed in 2016 featured asset misappropriation schemes including fraudulent billing and disbursements.  <a href="https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/">71.1 million people</a> fall victim to cyber crimes every year and individuals lose an average of US$4,476  <a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/hacking-statistics/">96% of baby boomers, 94% of Gen X, and 93% of Gen Z</a> don’t trust social media platforms to protect their data  <p>But don’t get too down because there’s hope! As decentralized identity technology gains more adoption, people and organizations will be able to share data securely.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>  What is a Decentralized Identity? <p>Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that allows people to control their own digital identity without depending on a specific service provider.</p><p>A digital identity is the body of information about an individual, organization, or electronic device that exists online. Data that form a digital identity include: </p>  User names and passwords  Search history  Social security number  Buying history  <p>How decentralized identity benefits organizations</p>  Allows organizations to verify information instantly without having to contact the issuing party, like a driver’s licensing organization or university for example, to ensure that IDs, certificates, or documents are valid. Traditional, manual verification processes take weeks to months which slows down recruitment and processing times while using a lot of financial and human resources. Imagine being able to instantly verify someone’s credentials in seconds by scanning a QR code or running it through a user-friendly <a href="https://verifier.dock.io/">credential verifier tool</a>.  Enables issuing organizations to conveniently provide Verifiable Credentials to people and prevent fraud in a way that greatly reduces costs and increases efficiency.   <p>How decentralized identity benefits individuals</p>  Because the user has full control and ownership of their identity and credentials, they are able to prove their claims without depending on any party.  People can decide which information they want to reveal to specific parties, such as a government or employer.  No party can take away people’s ID once they are stored on their mobile digital identity wallets.  People can easily create and manage their decentralized identity with user-friendly platforms like Dock.  <p>A verifiable proof of existence is often needed for us to exercise our right as citizens to access essential services like healthcare, banking, and education. Unfortunately, 1 billion people in the world <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">don’t have an official proof of identity</a>. With decentralized identity systems, all you need is an internet connection and a smart device which are becoming more accessible in emerging economies.</p> Issue Fraud-Proof Credentials Efficiently at Lower Costs <p>If an organization like a university or training program is issuing credentials, they can do so securely by making credentials fraud proof. Fake diplomas are a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/diploma-mills-marketplace-fake-degrees-1.4279513">billion-dollar industry</a> and it’s very easy for people to forge a certificate. This creates many risks for companies and impacts people’s safety as many people who get fake credentials work in health care or more risky field work operating heavy machinery. Even back in the 80s, there were approximately <a href="https://aaar.assembly.ca.gov/sites/aaar.assembly.ca.gov/files/reports/Intro%20to%20Degree%20Mills.pdf">5,000 fake doctors</a> in the US and it is now believed that there will be many more. </p><p>By using decentralized identity technology, organizations help prevent fraud to ensure that you are hiring qualified people with authentic credentials. Let’s say a company is looking for a project manager and they have a practice of hiring efficiently to get the best candidates. Many organizations take a long time to recruit and verify the credentials of candidates resulting in them losing out on great prospects as high-quality applicants often get multiple offers. </p><p>Here is how the company leverages decentralized identity technology to hire efficiently:</p>  Mary, the job applicant, manages her decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials on her phone with a Dock Wallet and wants to apply for the company looking for a project manager.  A school issues her a project management certificate as a Verifiable Credential that she stores on her digital wallet and this credential can’t be faked.  The company makes a job offer and they just need to check that her certificate is authentic.  The company requests her data and she is prompted on her phone to give authorization to the company to show her certificate  The company receives a QR code and simply scans it to instantly confirm that her program management certificate is authentic.  They offer Mary the job.  <p>The traditional, manual verification process would normally take weeks to even months.</p> What Is Self-Sovereign Identity? The three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) are Verifiable Credentials, Blockchain, and Decentralized Identifiers.<p>The term “decentralized identity” is used interchangeably with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is an approach to digital identity that gives individuals control of their digital identities. The three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity are: </p>  Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system.  Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification.  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Cryptographically verifiable identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. DIDs are stored on the blockchain, and contain no personal identifiable information.   <p>A growing number of organizations in government and in the private sector around the world are leveraging decentralized identity technology, including <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2663">the EU</a>. As the world moves more and more towards Web3, which is the next evolution of the internet, an increasing number of people will take back control of their data through decentralization and blockchain.</p><p>Problems and Risks With Centralized and Federated Digital Identity Systems</p>3 models of ID management: centralized identity, federated identity, and Self-Sovereign Identity<p>Centralized Identity Management: Administrative Control by a Single Authority or Hierarchy</p><p>Almost all of our digital identities are connected through services, devices, and apps.</p><p>Our personal information like our credit card, name, and address is being stored and shared on an increasing number of websites while our data is often used by websites to track people to display targeted content and advertise. As people access more websites and apps, the more accounts they have to create and manage, which creates a bad user experience. </p><p>Centralized systems often make digital identities vulnerable to cyber attacks and privacy breaches, including identity theft. Because so much user data is stored in one place, hackers could access a large amount of confidential information. </p><p>Federated Identity Management<br>Because of the problems that resulted from the centralized digital identity model, federated identity was developed. A federated identity allows authorized users to access multiple applications and domains with a single set of credentials like when people can use their Google or Facebook to sign into websites or apps. Signing in this way is also referred to as &nbsp;“single sign-on” tools.</p><p>While this method of signing in is more convenient for people because they don’t have to create a whole new account, the main downside is that if your password gets stolen, all of the other sites you used with that single sign-on account <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/single-sign-on-facebook-google-apple/">could be exposed</a>. You would have to trust both companies that offer single sign-on to protect your privacy and security as well as all of the third-party websites that offer these options to implement them correctly. In recent years, there have been several cases of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gk73/google-fired-dozens-for-data-misuse">Google</a> misusing information, including Facebook user data to manipulate people’s moods and Google employees leveraging their positions to steal, leak, or abuse data they may have access to. </p><p>More aspects of our lives require verification of our identities in order to apply for a mortgage, buy a car, or sign up for a new service. People have little to no choice but to surrender their privacy to use the things they want.</p><p>Thankfully, decentralized identity solutions can effectively solve many of these privacy and data breach problems. Decentralized identity gives people full ownership and control of their personal information and credentials.</p> Centralized Identity vs. Decentralized Identity Management <p>Centralized Identity Management</p><p>Decentralized Identity Management</p><p>Increased risk of data breaches from storing data in a centralized system</p><p>Data is decentralized and stored by users in their wallets, which reduces the risk of large scale data breaches</p><p>Data may be collected, stored, and shared with other parties without your knowledge</p><p>Data is only shared when you give authorization</p><p>Data is owned and controlled by organizations, apps, and services</p><p>Data is fully owned and controlled by the user</p> Establishing Standards for Decentralized Identity <p>There are many organizations working to standardize and shape the field of decentralized identity. These are the key organizations: </p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>: An engineering-driven organization focused on developing the foundational elements necessary to establish an open ecosystem for decentralized identity and ensure interoperability between all participants.  <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/web-standards/w3c/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>: The mission of the W3C Digital Identity Community Group is to identify and resolve real world identity issues, to explore and build a more secure trusted digital identity ecosystem on the internet for people, organizations, and things. Their work focuses on the ecosystem’s scalability, interoperability, mobility, security, and privacy.  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a>: An open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers working on the evolution of the Internet architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet.   Key Benefits of Decentralized Identity Solutions<br> You can sign in securely without a password for platforms that use Web3 ID technology.<p>These are the key advantages of decentralized identity for: </p><p>Organizations: Issue and verify fraud-proof credentials and documents instantly and reduce the risk of data breaches by storing less user information </p><p>Individuals: Own and control your digital identity with more privacy</p><p>Developers: Secure authentication sign-in for app users that eliminates the need for passwords and privacy-preserving user verification is used</p> Benefits for Organizations <p>Decentralized identity solutions come with many advantages for organizations including: </p>  Speed up the verification process at a much lower cost  Prevents credential fraud  Improved data security with public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt information safely  Reducing the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks by storing less user data  <p>Being able to verify credentials instantly is beneficial for a variety of use cases including speeding up the hiring process and reducing the risk of hiring someone without the appropriate credentials. </p><p>Many organizations around the world must follow regulations on how they collect, store, and use user data. If they don’t follow the regulations, they can face penalties and sanctions for breaking the rules or data breaches. </p><p>The impact of data breaches on organizations:</p>  The average cost of a data breach for a small business is <a href="https://go.kaspersky.com/rs/802-IJN-240/images/GL_Kaspersky_Report-IT-Security-Economics_report_2019.pdf">US$108,000 a year</a>  The average time to identify a data breach inside an organization is <a href="https://telecoms.com/498656/206-days-ibms-estimate-on-how-long-it-takes-to-find-a-security-breach/">206 days and another 73 days</a> to fix it  Small businesses are the victims of<a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/10-small-business-cyber-security-statistics-that-you-should-know-and-how-to-improve-them/#:~:text=43%25%20of%20all%20data%20breaches,attack%20during%20the%20previous%20year."> 43% of data breaches</a>  For large corporations, the average cost of a data breach is <a href="https://go.kaspersky.com/rs/802-IJN-240/images/GL_Kaspersky_Report-IT-Security-Economics_report_2019.pdf">US$204 per employee</a> while for SMBs it costs an average of US$3,533 per employee   Benefits for Individuals <p>Decentralized identities enable people to:</p>  Fully own and control their data  Prevent device and data tracking as they browse websites  Choose who they want to share their relevant information to  Prevent the spread of their data without their knowledge   <p>A decentralized digital wallet can be used on a phone to securely store your digital identity and credentials with encryption. This approach conceals data which greatly reduces the risk of credential tracking, hacks, and gaining unauthorized access to steal or monetize people’s data. With a decentralized identity, someone has to give authorization to share information when it is requested. </p><p>Verizon’s email hacking statistics show that phishing attempts are responsible <a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/hacking-statistics/">for 80% of malware infections and almost 95% of all espionage attacks.</a> Also, Facebook has had many data breaches since it was launched. In one instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/facebook-records-exposed-server/#:~:text=In%20the%20researchers'%20write%2Dup,anyone%20to%20access%20the%20data.">540 million records were exposed in a Facebook data leak</a>, which included Facebook IDs, passwords, Facebook friends, photos, and check-ins. This data is a gold mine for hackers planning phishing scams and social engineering attacks.</p><p>With a decentralized identity, passwords don’t exist. Rather cryptographic keys are used to authenticate users when they sign in. You could sign into a website with your Decentralized Identifier data instead of a user name. Basically, you only need to share the information that’s relevant and necessary to access each service. </p> Benefits for Developers <p>Decentralized identity solutions help developers by: </p>  Creating opportunities to build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and an inefficient authentication process that will enhance the user experience  Being able to safely request data directly from users while maintaining their privacy  <p>Imagine shopping on sites that don’t need to build up and store personal details including credit card information. Instead, your verified payment and shipping information is securely transmitted from your decentralized identity wallet. </p><p>Or if someone wants to apply for a loan application, instead of finding all the paperwork, they can give permission to the bank to instantly receive all of the relevant information to show that they are eligible for a loan, including their salary, address, and name. </p> How Decentralized Identity Works<br> <p>A decentralized identity system has these main elements: </p>  Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system. <br>  Decentralized Identity Wallet: An app that allows users to create their decentralized identifiers and manage their Verifiable Credentials.<br>  Decentralized Identifier (DID): A unique identifier on the blockchain made up of a string of letters and numbers that contains details like the public key and verification information. <br>  Verifiable Credential (VC): A digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. These are the main parties in the VC system:    Holder: A user who creates their decentralized identifier with a digital wallet app and receives the Verifiable Credential.  Issuer: The organization that signs a Verifiable Credential with their private key and issues it to the holder.   Verifier: A party that checks the credentials and can read the issuer’s public DID on the blockchain to verify if the Verifiable Credential the holder shared was signed by the issuer’s DID.  The main parties in the Verifiable Credentials system are the holders, issuers, and verifiers.<p>Let’s go into more detail about how each of these elements works individually and then how they all work together. </p> Decentralized Identity on Blockchain <p>Blockchain is a digitally distributed database that is shared among nodes, which are computers in the blockchain network, that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. Blockchain’s design allows everyone in the network to know that the information contained is true and valid. Each block has unique data and the blocks combine to complete a chain. The nodes execute functions like sending and receiving information. Blockchain technology is also referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p><p>Key Features of a Blockchain</p>  Decentralized: Public permissionless blockchains use a peer-to-peer network that anyone can join. No one can change or manipulate the way a blockchain should act. <br>  A blockchain acts as a distributed ledger: The digital database runs on a distributed network of computers around the world which makes it hard for someone or an organization to change or manipulate information. In contrast, centralized systems make it easier for someone to change or manipulate information without anyone else knowing because they are the only ones who have access to the records.   <p>But with blockchain technology, every node in the network gets a full copy of the blockchain and the information can be used to verify that it hasn’t been tampered with. When the data is verified, every node adds this information to its own blockchain. Everyone in the network creates consensus where they agree which blocks are valid and which aren’t. Tampered blocks will be rejected by nodes in the network.</p>  Immutable: Each block on a chain contains information from the previous block and the blocks can’t be tampered with or backdated. There is a hash on each block that acts like a digital fingerprint. If the hash changes, the network will know it has been tampered with.<br>  Robust security: The blockchain enables digital signatures and cryptographic hash functions to protect people’s identities from breaches and thefts.  <p>It’s important to note that anyone can join public permissionless blockchains. Permissioned blockchains don't allow anyone to join without authorization because some use cases require that only specific people should access the network. With a permissioned blockchain, a user would need permission from the network owner to become part of the network to access, read, and/or write information on the blockchain. </p><p>Here is how each party uses the blockchain in a decentralized identity system: </p>  Holder: Owner of the Verifiable Credential (e.g. driver’s license) has their public DID on the blockchain.  Issuer: The issuer’s public DID and associated public key is on the blockchain. When an issuer, like a licensing organization, provides a credential to a holder like a driver’s license, the issuer signs the credential with their private key.  Verifier: A verifier like an on-demand driving company can check the blockchain to ensure that the licensing department that they trust did in fact issue the license and who it was issued to. <br>  <p>The blockchain allows everyone in the network to have the same source of truth about which credentials are valid and who authenticated the validity of the data inside the credentials. The blockchain establishes a basis of trust by maintaining a verifiable registry (or records) of:</p>  All DIDs  Proof of credentials issued (if the credential is anchored to demonstrate proof of existence and authenticity)  Public cryptographic keys  Revocation registries  <p>The identity information is not stored on the blockchain but rather on the holder’s digital wallet. The credentials issued using the Dock blockchain are stored off-chain, usually in someone’s decentralized digital wallet app.</p> What Are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?<br> <p>Dock's Solutions Architect Mike Parkhill explains how decentralized identifiers (DIDs) work and their importance.</p><p>A Decentralized Identifier (DID): </p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is stored on the blockchain and independent of any organization  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over them  Comes with one or many private key and public key pairs  Does not contain personal data or wallet information  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Here is a decentralized identifier example that can be managed in a Dock wallet:</p><p>A DID can be used to find connected DID documents that contain relevant information to enable use cases like sign-in, data encryption, and communication. </p><p>Right now, most of us use information like emails, passwords, and user names as identifiers to access websites, apps, and services. But these identifiers have often resulted in: </p>  Our personal information being hacked  Identity theft  Our data being shared with other parties without our knowledge  Making it harder for someone to manage all of the logins  Being at the mercy of service providers who can revoke these identifiers at any time  <p>But DIDs solve many of these problems. They enable a universally accepted standard for exchanging and verifying digital credentials. A party, either an individual or organization, can make as many DIDs as they want for different relationships. DIDs are like different personas that people can create. </p><p>Right now, many people use LinkedIn to show their professional experience and information. But because they don’t want employers to see their personal photos and interests, they make a separate Facebook profile. A DID is similar in that you can make different profiles for different purposes.</p><p>For example, you can have a DID for: </p>  Your personal interests like signing in to shopping websites or showing you are of legal age to buy alcohol  Professional purposes where you can use this DID to show educational or professional credentials to an employer  Accessing different cryptocurrency-related apps and services that need to verify your identity for your trading and investment activities  You can create as many decentralized identifiers (DIDs) as you want and manage them in your digital identity wallet. How Do You Create Decentralized Identifiers? Mike explains how to use Dock Certs to create a DID and issue a Verifiable Credential.<p>With a Dock Wallet and Dock Certs, you can create a DID by following these steps:</p>  <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Create an account on Dock Certs and login</a>. If you’re just getting familiar with the platform, you can use Test mode.  <p>2. Click Create Verifiable Credential on the top right.</p><p>3. Create the issuer profile (a university for example) and you can leave the Key Type to the default setting. Then select Create a DID.</p><p>4. Choose among the basic template options, select the DID, click Continue on the top right. </p><p>5. You can add credential recipients manually one by one or in bulk with the Import CSV option.</p><p>6. If you add someone manually, you will enter details like this example below where we are identifying someone by their employee number. Once you fill in all of the details, click Add Recipient.</p><p>7. The information will appear like this:</p><p>8. If you want to do bulk issuance, you can also import a CSV file. Download the sample template, fill it in, and upload it.</p><p>9. The next option is to Persist the credential which means that Dock will securely store the credential on our database (but NOT on the blockchain).</p><p>If you persist the credential, there will be a QR code that shows up on the PDF where the recipient can simply scan the QR code with their Dock Wallet app to import the credential in their wallet.</p><p>10. There is an option to add a registry (record) on the blockchain allowing this credential to be revoked.</p><p>11. You can anchor the credential which will add a hash of the credential (like a digital fingerprint) you issue on the Dock blockchain. This allows someone to verify when and who created it. </p><p>12. &nbsp;Next click Issue Credentials on the top right and you will be able to download the credentials in JSON and PDF formats. A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format.</p><p>The Basic PDF credential will look like this:</p><p>It’s important to know that if you don’t persist or download the credential, you can’t get it back. </p><p>13. The issuer can email the PDF and JSON files to the recipient. Soon we will be releasing the Relay Service to automatically send the credential to the recipient's wallet.</p><p>14. If there is no QR code on the PDF file (because the credential wasn’t persisted), then the recipient has to download and import the JSON file. To do this select Credentials, click on the + sign on the top right corner, and select the JSON file.</p><p>15. The credential will immediately appear in the Dock Wallet.</p> Difference Between Public Key and Private Key Cryptography With an Example Every newly created DID comes with one or many private key and public keys.<p>Each DID comes with one or many private and public keys: </p>  Private key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that allows people to prove ownership, give consent to share selected data, and sign documents. It is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. As an analogy, a private key is like a master key that can access all of your information and the owner should never share their private key with anyone.  Public key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that can safely be shared with anyone you choose to give specific information to.   <p>You can have multiple private-public key pairs, and it’s good practice to generate new public keys when sharing information with a different party. This can be compared to using the same password for 10 different websites. It’s not safe to do this for security reasons. It’s better to have different and long complex passwords for all sites. Similarly, it’s better to generate a new public key for each party you share information with. </p><p>Example of how private and public keys would be used</p><p>Let’s say there’s a health and safety training organization that provides certification for construction safety and this course is a requirement for workers to get a job with a construction company. Here is how decentralized identity helps prevent fraud and enables organizations to save a lot of time and resources issuing and verifying credentials:</p>  Carl finishes the program and the training organization requests to connect with his digital identity wallet  When Carl authorizes the training organization to connect, the wallet shares his public DID in order for them to issue the credential.  The training organization signs the digital certificate of completion with their private key and issues the credential. Their public key is stored on the blockchain. The organization can easily and efficiently issue many credentials at the same time with a decentralized identity platform like Dock.  Carl would hold his credential on a digital wallet on his phone that he can bring everywhere.  Carl gives the construction company authorization to see his credentials without showing any unnecessary information about himself like his address and date of birth.  The company instantly verifies the authenticity of his credentials by scanning a QR code and not having to contact the issuer at all because the training organization’s public key is on the blockchain.  <p>Traditional certification verification processes would normally take a few weeks before he can start working because the construction company would have to manually contact the issuer. The previous verification process would be time-consuming and expensive. </p> Layers in the Decentralized Identity Ecosystem  Verifiable Credentials Nick explains the benefits of Verifiable Credentials.<p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. A few of many examples of information that can be issued as Verifiable Credentials:</p>  Driver’s licenses  Passports  Professional certifications  Employee status  <p>When digital credentials conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which is a standard established by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials.</p>An example of a university degree issued as a Verifiable Credential that is stored on a Dock wallet.<p>Examples of Decentralized Identity Verification</p><p>Maintaining privacy is a major benefit of Verifiable Credentials. Let’s say there’s an on-demand food delivery company that requires applicants to have a valid driver’s license. The company can instantly check the Verifiable Credential to confirm that an applicant has a valid driver’s license. A verifiable presentation would allow an applicant, the holder, to show their license number without sharing unnecessary information like their full name or address. </p><p>In another example, a club’s staff member can scan the QR code of the holder’s Verifiable Credential to ensure they are at least 18 years old. The public DID of the government’s licensing department is on the blockchain which allows the club to verify the authenticity of the Verifiable Credential because the club trusts the department that issued the credential. The Verifiable Credentials create trust between the parties and guarantee the authenticity of the data and claims without actually storing data on the blockchain. &nbsp;</p><p>In another situation, Sofia just moved to Canada without a physical copy of her university degree and she needs to prove her field of study to receive a job offer. Her university then issues her a Verifiable Credential, which is the degree, that is associated with her DID and she can store this in her digital wallet. Sofia then presents the credential to the employer who can instantly verify its authenticity.</p><p>4. Decentralized Digital Identity Web3 Wallet</p><p>A decentralized digital identity wallet enables people to securely store, manage, and share DIDs and Verifiable Credentials. It’s comparable to a physical wallet that holds various IDs and claims about yourself like service cards, bank cards, and licenses. The Web3 wallet will store verified credential details like citizenship, employment, name, and address to prove eligibility, identity, or complete a transaction.</p><p>A mobile identity wallet stores information on the phone rather than a browser’s storage or cloud. The digital wallet allows people to access apps and services without revealing personal information. DIDs also prevent your devices from being tracked and correlated (data may be traced back to someone's identity or online behavior). Verifiers can connect to the user’s Web3 wallet and request data while the user always chooses when to give permission to share data. </p><p>Let’s say Anna wants to sign up for a cryptocurrency trading platform that requires a legal ID to access the site. </p>  The trading platform uses <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Dock’s Web3 ID</a> which allows users to sign into the platform in a way that preserves their privacy  <p>2. Anna uses her decentralized identity wallet, Dock’s wallet, to sign in and the platform requests a credential</p><p>3. Anna scans a QR code and authorizes the website to instantly verify her credential</p><p>4. Once she is verified, Anna can simply sign in with Web3 ID rather than having to create a new account and save another user name and password</p><p>A decentralized identity wallet allows you to have full control over who can access your data without providing any more details than necessary.</p> Decentralized Identity Use Cases <p>Here are just a few of many examples of how decentralized identity technology can solve many problems that result from traditional verification processes and centralized identity management systems in a variety of industries. </p><p>Use case</p><p>Current problem</p><p>Decentralized identity solution</p><p>Health and safety training</p><p>People can easily make fake certificates and in many cases this puts other people and organizations at risk when you have workers in jobs that they aren’t qualified for, especially medical doctors or jobs where that require heavy machinery operation.</p><p>Certification organizations can conveniently issue fraud-proof digital credentials at a lower cost than current traditional, manual processes.&nbsp;</p><p>Enhancing traceability in the food source supply chain</p><p>There are recurring foodborne illnesses that are hard to contain when contaminated food can’t be traced back to its origin.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Regulators are requiring more and more proofs about the origin of products, carbon footprint, use of polluting materials, and not using slave labour, which is very difficult to do.</p><p>Improving traceability in the food supply chain with decentralized identity technology can help prevent the spread of foodborne illness as the data of the contaminated food batch is tracked on blockchain and can be easily traced back to its origin.</p><p>Reducing counterfeit products</p><p>Companies lose a lot of money from product knock-offs and many customers are unknowingly buying fake products&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors join a platform where product data are tracked on the blockchain.

This term is often used interchangeably with the term “decentralized identity.”</p><p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification.</p><p>Verifier: A party that checks the credentials and can read the issuer’s public DID on the blockchain to verify if the Verifiable Credential the holder shared was signed by the issuer’s DID.</p> Conclusion <p>Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that allows people to own, and control their own digital identity without depending on a specific service provider.

 The Central Bank of Ireland Publishes AML Bulletin, Highlighting the Mistakes VASPs Make While Registering  The Bulletin primarily covers the critical issues with VASP registrations in Ireland and the bank’s expectations with VASP applications. <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>- In its recent AML Bulletin, the Central Bank of Ireland highlighted several issues with the VASP registration applications.</blockquote><blockquote>- VASPS that are offering or planning to offer services to Irish customers, both individuals and institutions, have been required to register with the Central Bank of Ireland since April last&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>- The Central Bank also made it clear that it only ensures AML/CFT compliance among VASPs and plays no role in consumer protection.</blockquote><p>On July 11th, the Central Bank of Ireland <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/regulation/how-we-regulate/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-the-financing-of-terrorism/legislation/anti-money-laundering-bulletin-on-virtual-asset-service-providers-july-2022.pdf">issued a bulletin</a> outlining anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) rules for the virtual asset service providers (VASPs).</p> What’s the Bulletin all&nbsp;About? <p>The Bulletin primarily covers the critical issues with VASP registrations in Ireland and the bank’s expectations with VASP applications.</p> Guide firms <p>It is meant to guide firms to strengthen their VASP application by avoiding the common AML/CFT pitfalls.</p> Prevent financial crimes <p>The regulation set forth by the Central Bank aims to prevent financial crime while supporting innovation in the virtual assets&nbsp;market.</p><p>“We seek to regulate for a rapidly evolving financial system so that the opportunities presented by the current unprecedented period of change and innovation can be realized for citizens and the economy,” said Tommy Hannafin, Head of Anti-Money Laundering Division Central Bank of&nbsp;Ireland.</p> The Key&nbsp;Issues <p>Since April last year, VASPs wishing to offer services in Ireland must comply with the relevant AML/CFT obligations and apply to the Central Bank for registration.</p><p>Currently, the Bank assesses the registration application and provides feedback on the applicants’ proposed AML/CFT frameworks.</p><p>With the “Anti-Money Laundering Bulletin,” the Central Bank aims to assist VASPs in strengthening their applications and frameworks by outlining the critical issues identified during the assessment process.</p><p>The Central Bank identified that several VASP registration applications have insufficient information.</p><p>Meanwhile, the vast majority of applications had a lack of understanding and compliance with essential AML/CFT obligations.</p><p>This, coupled with significant control weaknesses, meant many applicants couldn’t meet their AML/CFT obligations.</p><p>And a firm will “only” be registered when the Bank is satisfied that the firm can meet its AML/CFT obligations on an ongoing&nbsp;basis.</p><p>The Bank also reminded that a failure to register by firms undertaking VASP activities might result in significant criminal and administrative sanctions.</p><p>Furthermore, registered VASPs will be subject to a supervisory levy, in line with what other financial institutions have to face in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>When it comes to developing AML/CFT policies, controls, and procedures, the Bank pointed to several recurring issues, including:</p><p>1. Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”)</p><p>2. Transaction Monitoring</p><p>3. Suspicious Transaction Reporting</p><p>4. Financial Sanctions</p><p>5. Record&nbsp;Keeping</p><p>6. Assurance Testing</p><p>According to Buletin, Customer Due Diligence involves more than just verifying a customer’s identity.</p><p>Firms are also required to collect and assess all relevant information to ensure they know their customers, if the customer is a Politically Exposed Person (“PEP”), and understands the purpose of their&nbsp;account.</p><p>However, the Central Bank clarified that it only supervises VASPs for AML/CFT purposes, and its mandate “does not extend to consumer protection.”</p> Gemini — First to Receive Authorization After Bulletin was Published <p>About a week after the Bulletin was released, the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini became the first VASP to receive approval from the&nbsp;bank.</p><p>The authorization allowed Gemini to offer crypto trading services in the Irish market to individuals and institutions.</p><p>The Bank’s approval means Gemini meets high compliance standards for AML and&nbsp;CFT.</p> Fight Against Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing <p>The Central Bank of Ireland is a gatekeeper in Ireland’s fight against money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF).</p><p>It seeks to ensure that regulated financial service providers have the necessary risk and control frameworks in place in order to minimize the risk of the use of their products or services by criminals for money laundering &amp; terrorism financing.</p>

<p>Grazie all’innovazione delle proprie soluzioni di firma, anche quest’anno InfoCert è stata riconosciuta fra i Representative Vendors nella “Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature” pubblicata a luglio 2022. Questa importante menzione consolida il posizionamento di InfoCert tra i leader internazionali nel segmento di Firma Digitale.</p>



<p>La firma elettronica si sta avvicinando sempre di più al concetto di Commodity ed è sempre più spesso offerta come funzionalità di base nelle piattaforme di gestione documentale e workflow approvativi. Molte organizzazioni che in passato hanno acquistato e implementato la firma elettronica all’interno dei loro processi stanno rivalutando l’investimento fatto a favore di soluzioni in grado di garantire maggiore affidabilità, sicurezza e compliance. </p>



<p>In Europa, l’adozione di questo tipo di soluzioni è stata maggiormente complessa, soprattutto tra il 2020 e il 2022, in quanto le organizzazioni sono diventate più sensibili ai requisiti legali e normativi per ridurre i rischi di frode e hanno avuto la necessità di integrare le applicazioni precedentemente implementate con fornitori di servizi fiduciari specifici per ogni Paese.</p>



<p>Tra le maggiori complessità va citata quella di avere la certezza rispetto all’identità degli interlocutori di business nei processi di approvazione e firma dei documenti: le funzioni legate all’identificazione degli utenti sono sempre più importanti in quanto spesso richieste dal punto di vista normativo nei casi d’uso B2C e per le transazioni ad alto rischio. Queste funzioni possono includere l’autenticazione forte degli utenti, la verifica dell’identità, l’integrazione di Digital Identity Wallet o l’uso di certificati digitali emessi dauna Certification Authority. In questo scenario la rilevanza strategica dei Qualified Trust Service Provider (qTSP) e delle piattaforme di onboarding è aumentata considerevolmente, rendendo player come InfoCert il naturale interlocutore per la realizzazione di progetti di digitalizzazione dei processi.</p>



<p><a href="https://infocert.digital/it/soluzioni/transazioni-e-flussi-approvativi-digitali/">GoSign</a>, la piattaforma di firma InfoCert ha, presentato nel 2022 numerose novità che hanno valso alla società il riconoscimento di “Representative Vendor” da parte di Gartner nel Global Market. In particolare, fra le innovazioni recenti è utile menzionare i processi di identificazione “On the Fly” di utenti esterni ad una organizzazione, che possono essere coinvolti in un processo di firma anche senza aver alcun certificato, e che vengono identificati in pochi minuti tramite VideoChat o SPID, e dotati di una firma digitale OTP che garantisce pieno valore legale alle transazioni.</p>



<p>Un altro elemento introdotto recentemente, che fa di GoSign una piattaforma sempre più scalabile e versatile a livello globale, è l’adeguamento agli standard della normativa descritta nel Titolo 21 CFR Parte 11 della Food and Drug Administration, la quale rende la soluzione competitiva per tutte le aziende e multinazionali del mondo Pharma che devono rispettare i requisiti della norma.</p>



<blockquote><p>Nonostante la proliferazione delle funzionalità di firma elettronica, i complessi requisiti normativi possono complicare alcuni casi d’uso. Security e Risk Manager devono trovare un equilibrio tra identità, conformità, sicurezza dei dati, strategia aziendale e IT nella scelta delle soluzioni.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Grazie alla Market Guide for Electronic Signature di Gartner, orientarsi fra le diverse soluzioni ed esplorare il mercato della firma elettronica è alla portata di tutti; Il report è ormai un punto di riferimento per professionisti e aziende del settore IT e soluzioni tecnologiche, con lo scopo di guidare professionisti e imprese nella valutazione delle soluzioni presenti sul mercato offerte dai diversi provider in ambito Firma Digitale e Servizi Fiduciari.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en">Gartner</a> è una società per azioni multinazionale che si occupa di consulenza strategica, ricerca e analisi nel campo della tecnologia dell’informazione con oltre 15.000 clienti nel mondo, opera da oltre 40 anni, e come IT Advisor anche quest’anno ha rilasciato la sua guida per il mercato della Firma Digitale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anche quest’anno, InfoCert è stata riconosciuta fra i Representative Vendors nella “Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature” uscita a luglio 2022, questa importante menzione consolida il posizionamento di InfoCert tra i leader del settore Firma Digitale.</p>

<p>Thanks to the innovation of its signature solutions, once again this year InfoCert has been recognized among the&nbsp;Representative Vendors&nbsp;in the July 2022 Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature. This important quote consolidates InfoCert as a leader in the Digital Signature market.</p>



<p>The market of electronic signature has become largely commoditized, and simple electronic signature is increasingly offered as a basic feature in most document management and approval workflow platforms. Many organizations that have integrated electronic signatures in their processes in the past are re-evaluating their investment in solutions that provide greater&nbsp;reliability, security, and compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Europe, the adoption of these kind of solutions was more complex, especially between 2020 and 2022, as organizations became more sensitive to legal and regulatory requirements to reduce fraud risks and needed to integrate applications previously implemented with local trust service providers for each country</p>



<p>One of the major complexities is to be sure of the identity of recipients within an approval workflow and signing process: these features are increasingly important as they are often required by regulations in B2C use cases and for high-risk transactions. Certainty of identity can include strong user authentication, identity verification, integration of Digital Identity Wallet, or the use of digital certificates issued by a Certification Authority. In this scenario, Qualified Trust Service Providers (qTSP) and onboarding platforms are becoming more and more important, and players like InfoCert are now the right partner to implement digitalization projects.</p>



<p><a href="https://infocert.digital/solutions/digital-transaction-and-approval/">GoSign</a>, the InfoCert signature platform, introduced in 2022 several innovations that made it possible for the company to be designated “Representative Vendor” by Gartner on the global market. Among these innovations, we can mention the&nbsp;“On the Fly”&nbsp;identification process of a stranger or external user, who can now be involved in a signing process even without any signature certificate: GoSign let these recipients be identified in a few minutes through Video Chat or eIdentity and provided with an OTP based e-signature that guarantees full legal value to transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this new version, GoSign became, even more, a scalable and versatile platform at a global level, thanks to the adaptation to the requirements described in Title 21 CFR Part 11 of the Food and Drug Administration, which makes the solution competitive for all Pharma companies at global level which must comply with the requirements of this regulation.</p>



<blockquote><p>Despite the proliferation of e-signature capabilities,&nbsp;complex regulatory requirements&nbsp;can increase the complexity of some use cases. Security and Risk Manager must reach a&nbsp;balance&nbsp;between identity, compliance, data security, business strategy, and IT in choosing solutions.</p></blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;The Gartner’s Market Guide for Electronic Signature, support you finding your way through the different solutions and exploring the electronic signature market ; The report is&nbsp;a point of reference for professionals and companies in the IT sector and technological solutions, with the aim of guiding professionals and companies in the evaluation of the solutions on the market offered by the various providers in the field of Digital Signature and Trust Services.</p>



<p>Gartner is a multinational joint-stock company that deals with strategic consulting, research and analysis in IT sector with over 15,000 customers worldwide, has been operating for over 40 years, and as IT Advisor also this year has released its guide for the Digital Signature market. InfoCert was named &nbsp;among the&nbsp;Representative Vendors in the “Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature” released in July 2022,&nbsp;this important mention consolidates infoCert’s positioning among the leaders in the Digital Signature sector.</p>

				  Big things are happening in the digital identity space, here we outline just a few recent articles we think everyone should hear about.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 By Tim Spring<p></p>
<p><a href="https://fcw.com/congress/2022/07/digital-id-bill-sees-action-house-and-senate/374552/&nbsp;">Digital ID bill sees action in the House and Senate</a></p>
<p>FCW reports that a bill focused on increasing federal government participation in the digital identity ecosystem has been reintroduced in&nbsp; the House and a counterpart has been&nbsp; created and introduced to the Senate. The goal of these bills is to “set up a task force on digital identity and establish a grant program at the Department of Homeland Security to support the creation of interoperable identity credentialing systems for digital identity verification on the state and local level.” The original bill was drafted in 2020, spurred by the increase in identity fraud that has occurred during the COVID 19 pandemic, but was never voted out of committee.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/will-eu-digital-identity-drop-the-unique-identifier&nbsp;">Will EU digital identity drop the unique identifier?</a></p>
<p>As reported by Biometric Update, the European Union has been working on a digital ID system that would allow member states to issue digital identification to their citizens for travel across borders or proving their identity in general across the EU. However, it appears that EU officials are having second thoughts on a key element of the proposed ID system — a mandate for all EU members to incorporate unique identifiers in their digital IDs. As privacy advocates have pointed out, a unique identifier for each person would mean they could be tracked across any government database.</p>
<p>Such a tracking device would be currently illegal in both the Netherlands and Austria, and unconstitutional in Germany. New language in a proposed amendment from the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy opens the door to technical solutions that secure personal data and ensure trust, such as “cryptographically verifiable identifiers, unique user-generated digital pseudonyms, self-sovereign identities and domain specific identifiers using state of the art encryption technology.”</p>
<p><a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2022/07/why-digital-identity-will-make-or-break-the-metaverse/&nbsp;">Why digital identity will make or break the Metaverse</a></p>
<p>In a comment piece in Engineering and Technology, Onfido’s Matt Peake argues that with marquee brands like Coke and Nike creating experiences in the metaverse, verified identities are critical to preventing fraud:</p>
<p>“Without verified identities in the Metaverse, anonymous bots can wreak havoc. For businesses, business people and celebrities, impersonators can cause damage to their brand and reputation, not to mention the new opportunities it creates for scammers and fraudsters. Ensuring trusted identity will therefore be fundamental to the safety and success of the Metaverse.”</p>
<p>While anonymity is ok, there must be a real person behind the avatar, says Peake. Age verification is critical too — in fact, all the problems we have with identity online are likely to cause havoc in this emerging virtual space. While Peake says the time to address this is now, as the Metaverse is being created, he is short on actual solutions to verify identities. Not so at Indicio, we’re working with Bonifii and Liquid Avatar Technologies to implement privacy-preserving verifiable credentials and decentralized identity in the Metaverse now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digit.fyi/young-people-at-greater-risk-of-falling-victim-to-identity-fraud/&nbsp;">Young people at greater risk of falling victim to identity fraud</a></p>
<p>GBG, a UK-based identity verification, location intelligence and fraud prevention company, has released its <a href="https://www.gbgplc.com/en/identity-verification/the-state-of-digital-identity-2022/">State of Digital Identities 2022 report</a>. Key findings: Mobile business is increasingly conducted through smart phones, with 67% of decision makers at companies saying that they conduct business this way. And — contrary to what one might expect — young people are more likely to be the victims of digital fraud than those aged over 55: 13% of people aged 18 to 24 across Europe have been victims in the past 12 months, 12% for 25 – 34, and 9% for 35-44, compared to only 4% for 55 and older. One possible reason—younger generations may expect security to be built into the tech they use, with only 62% of young adults responding that it’s their responsibility to protect their information (in contrast to the average of 76% that said it was the user’s responsibility across all age groups).</p>
<p>“Young adults are often labeled by businesses as the most tech-savvy demographic. But there is a large section of this age group who believe dealing with online security should be companies’ responsibility, rather than them looking after it themselves.”</p>

<p>Buy and sell data with H2O, a stable asset backed by&nbsp;OCEAN</p><p>H2O can now be used as a base token on Ocean Market, allowing data buyers and sellers to benefit from more price stability. Let’s dive deep into what H2O is and what benefits it brings to the whole Ocean ecosystem.</p> What is Ocean&nbsp;Market? <p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> is a decentralized data marketplace that enables publishers to monetize their data and/or algorithms through <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-architecture/">Compute-to-Data</a>, Ocean’s latest privacy-preserving approach.</p><p>Ocean Market allows access to data, algorithms, and compute services via datatokens and offers monetisation opportunities for stakers who provide veOCEAN to promising data assets. Every transaction in Ocean Market and Ocean backend generates transaction fees, some of which go to the community. 50% of the community fees will go to veOCEAN holders; the rest will go to OceanDAO&nbsp;grants.</p> What is&nbsp;H2O? <p><a href="https://www.h2odata.xyz/">H2O</a> is an OCEAN-backed, non-pegged stable asset, aiming to be the de facto medium of exchange within the entire Web3 Data ecosystem and based on the RAI stable asset by Reflexer Labs. Like RAI, H2O is decentralized, permissionless, and minimizes governance.</p><p>The H2O non-pegged stable asset is a friendly fork of RAI. Whereas RAI uses ether (ETH) as its asset for collateral, H2O uses OCEAN. Traditional stable assets are pegged to a price such as 1 USD. In contrast, RAI (and also H2O) are free-floating but typically settle around a price; for H2O this has been&nbsp;~$1.60.</p><p>One can get H2O by either (a) locking OCEAN to mint H2O, <a href="https://app.h2odata.xyz/#/">via the H2O dapp</a>, or (b) by buying H2O in an exchange such as the <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x0642026e7f0b6ccac5925b4e7fa61384250e1701&amp;outputCurrency=ETH&amp;chain=mainnet">Uniswap H2O-WETH&nbsp;pool</a>.</p> How is H2O Used in Ocean&nbsp;Market? <p>A “base token” in Ocean Market is a token that can be used to price data for buying and selling and to stake on data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Prior to this integration, only OCEAN was available as a base token in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>With this update/integration?, Ocean Market has added H2O as a base token. Upon publishing a data asset, the publisher can choose whether to use OCEAN or H2O&nbsp;[1].</p><p>This means that H2O can be used to price data in fixed-rate exchange.</p> What are the benefits? <p>Since data can be priced in H2O, and H2O fluctuates far less than OCEAN, then H2O in Ocean Market mitigates the volatility of the price of the data, since H2O fluctuates far less than&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>First, data sellers get more predictable revenue. Revenue is no longer dependent on OCEAN&nbsp;price.</p><p>Second, data buyers have more predictable costs. Costs are no longer dependent on OCEAN&nbsp;price</p> Conclusion <p>H2O, the OCEAN-backed stable asset, is now available in Ocean Market! This means better data pricing stability: data sellers get more predictable revenue, and buyers get more predictable costs.</p> Notes <p>Ocean Protocol backend components allow for any token as a base token, not just OCEAN or H2O. It’s the frontend — Ocean Market — that only explicitly supports the usage of OCEAN or&nbsp;H2O.</p><p>Builders of third-party marketplaces powered by Ocean (e.g. forks of Ocean Market) can readily pick other tokens for their market.

<p>In my last blog,<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/vlei-101/" title=" vLEI 101 – the Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier,"> vLEI 101 – the Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier,</a> I spoke about the potential of the vLEI. In the brief outline of the wider vLEI eco-system we saw that there were a number of types of Verifiable Credential:</p>
 
 LE-vLEI: a credential providing LEI data for the organisation 
 LE-OOR: a credential providing information about an individual holding a specific formal role within the organisation 
 LE-ECR: a credential providing information about an individual who has a ‘user defined’ role in relation to an organisation. 
 
<p>The credentials are issued by a Qualified vLEI Issuer, a QVI, and stored in a wallet. Let’s look at that in a bit more detail to understand what is going on.</p>
 The role of the QVI 
<p>We started off our last blog assuming a basic understanding of the LEI. The LEI is a 20 digit code that identifies a legal entity and can be used to look up data in real time from the GLEIS, a public database managed by the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en">GLEIF</a>. The LEI itself is issued by an ‘LEI Issuer’ known as an LOU. LOUs are entities that are accredited by the GLEIF and audited yearly to ensure they are perform inline with the defined frameworks.</p>
<p>It is very similar for vLEIs. vLEIs are issued by a ‘Qualified vLEI Issuer’, known as a QVI. An organisation wishing to become a QVI must define processes and systems that adhere to the vLEI governance framework and pass an initial qualification from the GLEIF, and then undertake yearly audits by the GLEIF.</p>
<p>The QVI has to follow a precise process to issue any of the previously listed credentials, which involve the checking of the LEI, the identity assurance of individuals involved and finally the technical issuance process itself.</p>
<p>The GLEIF is still finalising the process definitions but we expect to see initial QVIs launching within the next 6 months or so.</p>
 What does an issued credential look like? 
<p>As we discussed previously, credentials are designed to be understood by computers. This allows the holder of the credential to present the credential during a transaction to make a statement that can be understood by the ‘computer’ processing the request.</p>
<p>The issued credential is a machine readable format, typically in a json format. They are not meant to be directly read by the holder, instead credentials are accessed, displayed, and ‘used’ by an application, a ‘wallet’.</p>
<p>It should be noted there are a few different formats of credentials which means there are different wallets. On top of this, there are many different ways in which a computer can check the credential and so the wallet must present the credential in the right format for the intended end use, and this can mean a different wallet per use case.</p>
 The credential wallet 
<p>The various credentials, that you might have, are stored in a wallet. This is an application, often residing on your mobile device, that securely holds the credential data, provides a user interface so you can examine the contents of the wallet, and provides functionality for using the credentials stored within.</p>
<p>Wallets on mobile devices are not new, the iPhone provides a wallet for a variety of items, such as payment cards and boarding passes. The idea is the same, but the iPhone wallet is not a Verifiable Credential wallet.</p>
<p>The wallet residing on your mobile device is actually a significant concept. In ‘classical’ identity systems the claims about ‘you’ are held by an Identity Provider, and when someone wants to access one of those claims they contact that (central) identity provider for the details. This means that the identity provider knows who you are sharing claims with, and in many cases the level of data shared is greater than the need of the person asking. The typical example here is sharing your date of birth as proof you are over 18.</p>
<p>The alternative to this centralised identity is a system where you hold all the information about you and get to decide what information to share in response to any given request. This is known as Self Sovereign Identity and is enabled by the credential wallet.</p>
<p>When a service needs to know some information about ‘you’ it will generate something called a Presentation Request. This is often in the form of a QR code that you scan with the wallet app. The App will decide the request, see what claims are being asked for and then present you with that information and let you choose how to respond using the various items of information you have in the wallet. You are now in control of who is being told what, and you are the central store of the claims. Your bank might have generated the credential you will use, but it has no connection to whoever or whatever you are now sharing that information with, so the recipient cannot track your usage of that information.</p>
<p>All of this is well and good, however there is a challenge here. The credentials are all using strong cryptographic techniques to secure and protect the data, and to give service providers confidence that the claims are un-altered and issued by trusted parties. This strong cryptographic protection requires some complex management to take place, and in the wallet system, as described, this also falls to you, the user, as you are managing your attributes. There is a solution to this, the custodial wallet.</p>
 Custodial Wallet 
<p>A custodial wallet is where a third party provides a hosted wallet for you and takes care of the cryptographic management. Of course, this ease of maintenance comes with a slight reduction in overall security – another party is controlling your cryptographic keys, but in many instances that trade off is for the best.</p>
<p>This extra dimension increases the number of wallets available; not only do you have differing credential types, differing verification methods, but now also differing providers of wallets.</p>
 Wallets Everywhere 
<p>In the short term you should expect to see a number of wallets appearing, both on your mobile and through cloud services. Over time, the differences will be incorporated, and wallets will become more general purpose and there will be consolidation.</p>
 Wallets and vLEI 
<p>The vLEI is no different to any other credential and requires a wallet to be issued into. GLEIF are building the wallet capability following the pilot issuance project for the signing of the 2021 accounts. It is likely that the first wallets will be custodial (hosted) and provided by the QVIs to simplify the overall process for the legal entities who are obtaining vLEIs.</p>
<p>In my next blog we will look at how the wider issuance process for the vLEI credentials works.

</p><p>Paper-based IDs have long been a globally accepted standard mode of identity presentation. However, it is vulnerable to high risks of loss and fraud, in addition to being largely irrelevant in digital domains. With the recent digitization of many services, there are increasing number of opportunities for our personal identities to be used online in our daily lives. Personal identities and related information has importance in fintech platforms, healthcare systems, e-commerce, and social networking. To connect digitally, we must provide personal information such as our name, date of birth, address, credit card number, and other details.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is increasing concern about the privacy implications of using personally identifiable information online. The current digital identification architecture is primarily centralized, meaning identity information is stored on centralized servers owned by specific entities, resulting in an entirely different paradigm of concerns. By doing so, we are trusting external entities to maintain the privacy of our data.</p>



<p>Individuals do not have meaningful ownership of their credentials in the centralized model and have no security of their personal data. Although internet users can be confident that the websites they visit are legitimate, there is no reliable way of determining the identities of individuals, organizations, and other entities that govern those websites or with whom users interact and trade. Despite superior security, the use of centralized servers makes digital identity management systems vulnerable to multiple cyber attacks. Entities may be bound by legal agreements such as data privacy agreements but technically it is still possible for them to misuse information. . Also, there is a big question mark on the privacy of data stored on servers of the platforms. Planform can use this data for monetization by sharing it with others.</p>



<p>When it comes to making digital identities more secure, a global public utility approach is preferred. That's where Decentralize Identity comes into the picture. It is based on the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) means giving complete control to individuals over their identity and credentials without any dependency on the administrative body or third party. The SSI has the concept of verifiable credentials to store and share the identity and other data in which the individual is the ultimate owner of their identity and has complete control over its storage, distribution, and third-party access.&nbsp; SSI is not a new concept however combining it with blockchain brings transparency and trust in data ownership. Above all, the SSID ecosystem eliminates centralized storage, instead relying on Blockchain technology and cryptography to ensure trust, transparency, and integrity of data.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity implementation</p>



<p>There are three entities involved. The Issuer issues the verifiable credentials to the user via its own verification process, the User with an identity stored in the SSI Wallet APP, and the Verifier who verifies the presented credentials by the user. Users can acquire different credentials from different issuers using the keys stored in SSI wallet APP. These credentials can be securely shared while using platforms that trust the issuer. The features like selective disclosure, Zero-knowledge proof gives complete control of privacy to users over their data while sharing it with a verifier.</p>







<p>This solution can be utilized in various domains including Healthcare applications, Fintech, Educational records, Document management, and so on. SPARK has a decentralized identity solution &amp; various pluggable components ready to Whitelabel for businesses. Feel free to comment with your thoughts and reach out to us to know more.

It has two strong use&nbsp;cases</p>  To enable companies to buy and sell data over the blockchain  To enable companies to monetize data in a privacy-preserving manner.  <p>This is done by enabling data consumers to run algorithms on data behind a firewall without ever revealing the raw&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“Data availability and quality is important to scale enterprises, not just within Mercedes-Benz, but also in every enterprise out there. This is why we developed Acentrik, materializing the concept of digital assets representation on the Blockchain. Our aim is to build one horizontal technology across multiple different verticals that maintain data sovereignty. This means that the ownership and storage of the data stays with the data owners and not on the platform. The role of Acentrik, as a marketplace, is to enable the monetization of the data and ensure that data providers are easily connected with consumers in various industries while maintaining data sovereignty.”</blockquote><p>Enterprise data sharing: How can it be optimized?</p><blockquote>“There are multiple reasons and issues that prevent enterprises from sharing data. Enterprises have very different requirements around who should be able to publish, view or buy datasets. They fear the threat of losing control on their data or they chose not to monetise their data because of the value and sensitivity of that data (particularly in the context of GDPR). But these issues can be tackled with the right blockchain solution.”</blockquote><p>For instance, Acentrik veers away from the traditional centralized data management model of enterprises, providing more reasons for them to monetize data as they do not face the threat of losing control of their data. Monetization is now an option for enterprises, as in the past they held data without the consideration of unlocking the value of data in their data. With that, there is a potential loss of revenue for themselves and the industry. Secondly, Acentrik as a data marketplace is domain agnostic, which as part of data monetization, offers a strategic advantage to tap on data across industries, directly to the data&nbsp;sources.</p><blockquote>“Acentrik ensures data sovereignty with the Compute-to-Data feature. Privacy-preserving compute jobs run in the data owners’ premises behind a firewall, without ever revealing the raw data to the consumer. It is a win-win situation, data consumers get insights by running algorithms on the data, building towards a better business case for their enterprise, while data providers monetize their data and stay in control of their&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://acentrik.medium.com/acentriks-enterprise-release-new-features-revealed-20dac67825a">You can read more about Acentrik’s enterprise release and its new features&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>How Ocean Protocol is supporting Acentrik</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol,</a> has joined forces with <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a>, on its recently launched Enterprise Release. Acentrik is a fork of Ocean Market and makes use of the OceanONDA V4 smart contracts and libraries. As part of the collaboration, the most important Ocean features have been leveraged and integrated into Acentrik V1.0 and key adaptations for enterprise users.</p><p>Acentrik’s collaboration with Ocean Protocol began in 2020, with a proof of concept exploring decentralized data orchestration for Mercedes-Benz. The pilot project was successful and this led to further collaboration and development of Acentrik Version&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>How to make your blockchain solution enterprise-ready?</p><blockquote>“For enterprises, data often needs to be kept private. The Compute-to-Data feature means that private data isn’t directly shared but rather specific access to it is granted. Algorithms are able to be run on the data behind a firewall without the raw data ever being revealed.”</blockquote><p>By opening up this possibility, private data can now help enterprises in their research, leading to more significant innovation. For example, more data improves the predictive accuracy of modern AI models. Private data is also often considered the most valuable data because it’s so hard to discover, and using it can lead to potentially big&nbsp;payoffs.</p><p>Concepts like Compute-to-data, Asset Management Token and Fine-grained Permissions may appear abstract to enterprises who are new to the Web3 world — but it is important to ensure these concepts are broken down and translatable to applications in the business world. This is seen in use cases for enterprises across industries.</p><p>A case-in-point is a cross-domain use case of harnessing data from the healthcare and insurance industries to shape clinical research and care. Through data points from outpatient medical treatments, paired with algorithms derived from past insurance claims over a period of time, this presents analysis and derivations to precise medical supplies for pharmaceutical companies. This example by itself is achieved by Compute-to-Data, where data is kept on the premise of the hospitals, clinics and insurance companies. Algorithms are brought to the data and compute jobs run on the premise of the data&nbsp;owner.</p><blockquote>“Being enterprise-ready also meant that access and control to multiple users are important factors to actors on Acentrik. Through our tokens like our ERC20 datatoken, which represents the access to a particular asset on the marketplace and ERC721 token which is Acentrik Asset Management Token, representing the control of a specific asset on Acentrik. Fine-grained permissions are live at various levels such as at a role-level of publish and consume, and also at an asset-level of delegating roles such minter, editing, publishing etc. There are simply many combinations that can be configured for enterprises based on their permissions required for individual users”</blockquote><p>A large part of being enterprise-ready is to have the right level of access control and publishing restrictions within Acentrik. Datatokens primarily control access, but enterprises often need more precise ways to specify and manage access, and fine-grained permissions need to be introduced for these use cases. Fine-grained permissions mean that access can be controlled precisely at two levels: Marketplace-level permissions for browsing, consuming, or publishing within a marketplace frontend. This is handled by our role-based access control server. Asset-level permissions on a specific asset is controlled by two credentials, email domain and/or wallet address, to add to allow/deny lists, maintained in the asset’s metadata.</p><blockquote>“Blockchain will likely shift from concept to necessity — which is inevitable for enterprises to embrace this technology for systems and business models. The Web3 world is a community-focused one that enterprises will realize and contribute towards the same in different forms”</blockquote><p>What next?</p><p>Acentrik is now in Enterprise Release! Experience the new line-up of features on the marketplace, which are implemented to answer to pilot customers’ needs. Acentrik is now ready to onboard companies with data products, creating a supply and demand and implementing use cases. While this is being planned, further scaling of the product is ongoing, with plans to deploy to other blockchain networks and stabilize the whole production platform.

Digital ID&nbsp;Wallet<p>So far in the GlobaliD 101 series, we’ve explored:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">Part 1:</a> What a smart and humanistic approach to digital identity would&nbsp;like  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Part 2:</a> The Trust Triangle — the system of issuers, holders, and verifiers that illustrates how identity works (and how it’s broken,&nbsp;today)  <p>Now, we’re getting to the exciting part. We know identity is broken. We also know what great digital identity that works for you, the individual, looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>But how do we get&nbsp;there?</p><p>The first step is to make digital identity incredibly convenient, fun, and useful for end users. These are the people who will go out and interact with their communities, purchase goods and services, and build businesses.</p><p>In the physical world, we rely on identifying documentation. That might be your driver’s license, your insurance card, or your passport. In our daily lives, we’ll keep the most commonly used forms of ID in our&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>In the digital future, things won’t look all that different. You’ll keep digital forms of relevant documents in your digital ID&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>It’s easy to understand the benefits of digitization:</p>  It’s convenient. All your relevant documents are in one accessible place. The only thing you’ll need to keep in your actual wallet is cash. As the digital identity ecosystem develops, your interactions and transactions will become seamless.  It’s yours. This is your ID wallet. You own and control your identity and your&nbsp;data.  It’s secure. If you lose your wallet, it’s gone, and your information is out there. That’s not the case with a locked smartphone. Plus, you’ll have a backup. Another aspect is the ability to selectively share only relevant data. If you’re buying a bottle of wine, you don’t need to share your entire driver’s license. You don’t even need to share your actual date of birth. You only need to share the fact that you’re over 21 (for those in the&nbsp;U.S.).  <p>Big Tech companies like Apple are already making progress on this front, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/03/apple-launches-the-first-drivers-license-and-state-id-in-wallet-with-arizona/">piloting a program</a> that allows users to keep their driver’s license in their Apple Wallet. The difference with Apple’s approach, of course, is that their solution isn’t portable or interoperable. In regular person terms, it just means that you’re stuck on Apple’s closed ecosystem — no surprise.</p><p>While progress is being made, these are still early days. Apple’s pilot, for instance, will be rolled out in a limited number of&nbsp;states.</p><p>All of which means that people are still sending photos of their driver’s license to their AirBnb host for identity verification.</p><p>That’s crazy insecure!</p><p>What if instead, you could securely and selectively share your ID with an expiring link? Your name and photo will be visible but other private details will be blurred out. Your Airbnb now believes you are who you say you are because they also trust the issuer of your digital credential. Likewise, you don’t have to worry that a copy of your full license is on a stranger’s phone forever. Everyone rests easy, and you enjoy the heck out of your vacation.</p><p>Need to provide a copy of your ID to an AirBNB host? Just send them a link to your driver’s license which you’ve stored in your ID wallet. You can make your name and photo visible, while everything else is blurred out. That way the host only sees what you want them to. You can also set a time limit for how long your ID is available. That way nobody has a copy of your license indefinitely.</p><p>The same applies across all your online interactions and transactions. No more taking photos of your ID for each new platform or service. No more digging through the safe for your passport. No more calling the customer support because you lost your insurance card.</p><p>Life is just easier with a digital ID&nbsp;wallet.</p> Venture into the digital future confidently <p>What’s even more exciting is where we go from here. With people using a trusted ID wallet, businesses (verifiers) can rethink how they manage identity and trust in the context of their customers, an effort that costs businesses $592 trillion per&nbsp;day.</p><p>The World Wide Web Consortium (w3c) also reached <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/01/w3c_overrules_objections/">a major milestone</a> this month around digital identifier (DID) standards, which will become a formal recommendation despite pushback from Big Tech. Just like the internet, open and interoperable protocols will allow any company or project to easily integrate these digital identity standards, paving the way toward mainstream adoption and far-reaching accessibility.</p><p>Since your digital identity is built on open standards, your identity will also be portable like your mobile phone number is today. Rather than being stuck with a certain provider or platform, you’ll be able to easily transfer your identity from one ID wallet to another. Software developers will compete for your patronage by developing the best possible products.</p><p>Imagine a world where you own your identity and your data rather than corporations or the government. You finally hold the keys to your own destiny. You share only what you need to in a secure and private fashion. Rather than logging onto your Facebook account, you log on as&nbsp;you.</p><p>And unlike your Facebook account, which isn’t all that credible, you’ll be able to do important things with your digital identity, such as remotely opening up a bank account. Since digital formats are far more flexible in the context of expressing trust and reputation, this will have a profound impact on financial inclusion for the billions of people who lack traditional identifying documentation.</p><p>In the future, we’ll see a convergence between our physical and digital identities with everything easily managed in one place. With one identity, you’ll be able to purchase celebratory drinks with your friends or hang out in the Metaverse.</p><p>It all starts with your ID&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_GlobaliD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a> to learn more about GlobaliD.

<p>I have been working on an Android library project which didn’t have any unit tests implemented. It is quite a small library, with only five classes. However, some of those classes have vital roles and directly impact the library’s output, such as generating file metadata depending on another file by doing some mathematical operations. Changing a single line or even a single integer value might break the whole functionality. I was&nbsp;like:</p>Bubbles Girl, origin&nbsp;unknown<p>I wanted to implement unit tests for the library to mitigate the risk of breaking existing functionalities while adding new ones or fixing bugs. At first, it looked like an “easy job” since there was a limited number of classes, but once I started writing unit tests, I realised that the code was not testable.</p><p>In this article, you will read my experience on how I managed to refactor that library code so that it became testable and what my learnings were on this&nbsp;journey.</p> Prerequisite <p>This article doesn’t focus on a specific platform or a programming language but on concepts. However, I believe it is always helpful to provide some examples. That is why I added example code pieces in Kotlin. I tried to keep them as simple as possible, and I am pretty sure they are easy to understand, whether you are familiar with Kotlin or&nbsp;not.</p> Why unit&nbsp;testing? <p>Generally, testing helps software companies deliver quality software and reduce development costs. Specifically, unit testing helps to find the bugs easily in every stage of development in a fast and reliable way. Yet the most valuable benefit of writing unit tests is that it forces developers to write testable&nbsp;code.</p> Unit Testable&nbsp;Code <p>We usually don’t realise how bad the code is until we start writing unit tests. Even though the code is easy to understand, we might overlook its cyclomatic complexity as it might hide its dependencies. As a result, we fail to realise how complex the code&nbsp;is.</p><p>Writing unit tests forces us to refactor our code to have single-responsibility and dependency inversion. These are already two of the five SOLID principles. That is why having unit testable code makes writing tests painless and makes the codebase less complex, easier to understand and more maintainable.</p> Deterministic Code <p>Writing unit tests is pretty straightforward, but testing non-deterministic code is impractical. Functions should produce the same output for the same input every time so that the unit tests can test their behaviour correctly. Otherwise, you would have either no unit tests or non-deterministic ones, which are not ideal as tests should be deterministic by definition.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the example code below. “shuffleQueue” function takes one argument, a one-dimensional integer array and returns a shuffled&nbsp;version.</p><p>Testing it should be pretty straightforward, right? Not. Because each run would produce a different result for the same inputs. However, this is something expected. Given the shuffling nature, the function should create kind of random results. So then, how can you test it? The first thing that comes to mind is checking whether the output differs from the input, as shown&nbsp;below.</p><p>However, we don’t have control over the implementation of the “IntArray.shuffle” function, and technically the output might be the same as the input at a random time. This makes the test unstable and non-deterministic. Even worse, you can’t ensure that the “shuffleQueue” function shuffles the queue and does not just return a static value. You can try different approaches to unit test this function, such as running it for million times and then checking whether the results differ or not. It might work, but the test execution would take too much time. The other, probably better approach is delegating the non-deterministic part of the code to another component, which I will explain in the following sections.</p> Single-Responsibility <p>The process of unit testing is quite simple. First, you set the preconditions; then invoke the tested unit; last, check the generated output against the expected one. It sounds simple; however, complex functions require complex preconditions and inputs, and generate complex results. As a result, the complexity of the unit test grows exponentially as the tested unit’s complexity grows because unit tests have to check every possible use&nbsp;case.</p><p>There are many ways to determine a function’s complexity, such as nested block count, lines of code or cyclomatic complexity. Small functions with fewer lines of code usually result in a cleaner and more understandable codebase. However, it is possible to make a small function very complex by poisoning it with multiple responsibilities. And worse, the code gets unstable when it has multiple responsibilities because updating a single functionality might break another&nbsp;one.</p><p>Let’s imagine writing unit tests for “logToFile” function below. You need to test three different functionalities:</p>  Log line generation  Opening the correct log&nbsp;file  Writing the log line into the&nbsp;file  <p>While the output of the function changes regarding the inputs, the unit tests for the log function should test three different cases:</p>  With zero&nbsp;args  With only one&nbsp;arg  With multiple&nbsp;args  <p>However, for each case, the unit tests should also check if the function generates the correct log line, if it writes the log line into the correct log file, and if it appends the log line at the end of the log file. Imagine getting a change request about updating the timestamp in the log lines to include the minutes and seconds. The function changes as shown&nbsp;below.</p><p>The unit tests would now fail and should be updated to check the new format of the log lines. However, not one but three unit tests should be updated as we need three unit tests to test the log function, which costs time and money. This is an excellent example of the functions with multiple functionalities requiring more complex unit&nbsp;tests.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is not the biggest problem. As you might have noticed, changing the timestamp broke the log file names. Instead of creating a log file per hour, the function now creates a log file per second. If the existing unit tests don’t check the file names, your software will have an evil bug. If they check, you must also update those parts, which means spending more time and&nbsp;money.</p><p>A better way to reimplement this log function and make it easily testable is by distributing these three functionalities into different components; one for generating a log line, one for getting the log file, and one for appending the line into the file. So the function becomes as shown&nbsp;below.</p><p>We can now test the new implementation of the function with only one unit test. The unit test should&nbsp;check:</p>  If the function is passing its arguments to “logLineGenerator.generate” function to generate the log&nbsp;line  If it calls “logFileStorage.getCurrentLogFile” to get the current log&nbsp;file  If it calls “fileWriter.appendText” with the current log file and the generated log&nbsp;line.  <p>As we revisit the requirement of updating the timestamp in the log lines, it would be enough to update “logLineGenerator” class and its unit tests. There is no need to update the actual log function. Moreover, there is no risk of breaking another functionality while updating&nbsp;it.</p> Dependency Inversion <p>Let’s recall our log function. The latest version delegates some functionality to other components, such as generating the log line. We talked about how testing this function would be easy as we only need to check if the log function calls the others correctly. However, there is a technical challenge. We don’t know how the log function accesses “logLineGenerator”, “logFileStorage” and “fileWriter”. Moreover, we don’t have any control over them, so we can’t easily test whether the log function calls the other components correctly or&nbsp;not.</p><p>The class above is one of the possible implementations of the log class. It creates instances of subcomponents, and the log function uses them. However, if you want to test this function, there is no way to interact with those subcomponents. You can’t check whether the log function invokes the subcomponents correctly or not. Luckily, we can break the strong relation between the log class and its subcomponents by moving the instance creation somewhere else and sharing those instances with the log&nbsp;class.</p><p>The new version of the log class allows us to modify the implementation of subcomponents and inspect them effortlessly while running unit tests. We can mock subcomponents or replace them with the test implementations which produce predefined outputs. However, some of the subcomponents might be closed for inheritance, so you can’t create a test implementation class replacement. With the help of Dependency Inversion, we can overcome this problem. Dependency Inversion is one of the SOLID principles stating that modules shouldn’t depend on implementations but should depend on abstractions. Having abstraction lets us create whatever implementation we want for any subcomponent and use those implementations for unit&nbsp;tests.</p><p>Finally, the test for the log class is now all clear. It injects the test implementations of subcomponents and checks if the log function calls them with the correct parameters.</p><p>As the new log function requires us to provide the subcomponents, we need a pattern to do it conveniently in our code. Some software patterns, frameworks and libraries provide easy-to-use APIs to apply dependency inversion. For example, you can look up dependency injection and service locator patterns.</p> Sum up <p>The limitations of unit testing force us to write better code as we saw that making our code unit testable makes it easier to understand, more flexible, and more maintainable. That is why I believe in always thinking about testability and asking the question, “How can I test this?” while coding or following a test-centric process such as test-driven development helps us to have clear visibility of the code complexity and reduce&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/how-to-write-unit-testable-code-and-how-it-improves-code-quality-8c2e26bed55a">How to write unit testable code and how it improves code quality</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

XDAO users can now create a DAO on Ontology blockchain with convenient and intelligent tools.  Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to participate in Nasdaq’s <a href="https://twitter.com/TradeTalks/status/1544382285654507523?s=20&amp;t=wUrIdqIDs6_7hNn9yeajOg">TradeTalks</a>&nbsp;, which focuses on investment trends, market structure, and was interviewed by Nasdaq global markets reporter Jill Malandrino on “Should We Trust a Centralized Tech Superpower With Sensitive, Personal Data?”. He shared his views and detailed how Ontology’s decentralized identity (DID) solution solves the existing trust pain&nbsp;points.  The third OWNInsights “People, Platforms, Web3” was released, written by Ge Li, Ontology Business Development Manager. From the perspective of Web3 participants, it analyzes how individuals can control their own datasets to expand their influence through DID, and effective ways to build Web3 based on the OWN infrastructure. This article was first published on the well-known Chinese blockchain media Cointelegraph Chinese, and was recommended by the platform.  Ontology and the cross-chain Swap project StealthEX held an AMA event. While introducing the project and development to the community members, it also answered questions for the community members. The selected questions were rewarded with&nbsp;ONT.

<p>I came back from the Holochain &amp; Rust Developer Immersive to find a big pile of interesting things to write about. One, of course, was the Immersive itself, which I’ll share about next week. But for this week, here are the usual weekly release changelogs for the last six releases (there are some important changes in there) and notes from around the ecosystem.</p> Holochain 0.0.146: Zome IDs re-added to types <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139</p><p>As I mentioned in the Dev Pulse that introduced the HDI, zome IDs were removed from entry and link types (and their action headers) but would be reintroduced later. This is the release that reintroduces them, and we’ll have some ergonomics improvements to help you write more concise validation functions in the future. This has resulted in a number of changes (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1453">#1453</a>), some of which are very important and others of which are unlikely to be noticed unless you’re bypassing the HDI and HDK and creating your own interfaces to the host.</p>  Breaking: The <code>id</code> field has been added back to the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.11/holochain_integrity_types/action/struct.CreateLink.html"><code>CreateLink</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.11/holochain_integrity_types/action/struct.AppEntryType.html"><code>AppEntryType</code></a> action structs. This is what causes all the following changes.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.139/hdk/link/fn.create_link.html"><code>create_link</code></a> and path manipulation functions now take any link type value that implements <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.11/holochain_integrity_types/info/type.ScopedLinkType.html"><code>ScopedLinkType</code></a>.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.139/hdk/entry/fn.create_entry.html"><code>create_entry</code></a> similarly takes any entry type value that implements <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.11/holochain_integrity_types/info/type.ScopedEntryDefIndex.html"><code>ScopedEntryDefIndex</code></a>.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/struct.LinkTypeRanges.html"><code>LinkTypeRanges</code></a> is removed, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.139/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html"><code>get_links</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.139/hdk/link/fn.get_link_details.html"><code>get_link_details</code></a> take any filtering strategy that implements <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.139/hdk/link/trait.LinkTypeFilterExt.html"><code>LinkTypeFilterExt</code></a> rather than <code>TryInto&lt;LinkTypeRanges&gt;</code>. This allows you to <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.11/holochain_integrity_types/link/enum.LinkTypeFilter.html">filter</a> by individual or multiple link types across multiple zomes, or all link types from a single zome.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.10/holochain_deterministic_integrity/entry/trait.EntryTypesHelper.html#tymethod.try_from_local_type"><code>try_from_local_type</code></a> is removed, and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.10/holochain_deterministic_integrity/entry/trait.EntryTypesHelper.html#tymethod.try_from_global_type"><code>try_from_global_type</code></a> becomes <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.11/holochain_deterministic_integrity/entry/trait.EntryTypesHelper.html#tymethod.deserialize_from_type"><code>deserialize_from_type</code></a> with an extra parameter for zome ID.  Breaking: The <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.10/holochain_deterministic_integrity/link/trait.LinkTypesHelper.html"><code>LinkTypesHelper</code></a> trait is removed.  Breaking: <code>GlobalZomeTypeID</code> and <code>LocalZomeTypeID</code> are removed.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk_derive/0.0.37/hdk_derive/attr.hdk_to_global_link_types.html"><code>#[hdk_to_global_link_types]</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk_derive/0.0.37/hdk_derive/attr.hdk_to_global_entry_types.html"><code>#[hdk_to_global_entry_types]</code></a> are removed, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk_derive/0.0.37/hdk_derive/attr.hdk_to_local_types.html"><code>#[hdk_to_local_types]</code></a> is now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk_derive/0.0.38/hdk_derive/attr.hdk_to_coordinates.html"><code>#[hdk_to_coordinates]</code></a> with an added zome ID.  Breaking: Links from integrity zomes that are not part of a coordinator zome’s dependency list (specified in the DNA manifest) are no longer accessible to that zome when it calls <code>get_links</code>.  <p>There are other unrelated changes:</p>  Breaking/New: <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.11/holochain_deterministic_integrity/x_salsa20_poly1305/index.html"><code>x_salsa_poly1305_*</code></a> functions have been properly implemented! As a consequence, any <code>KeyRef</code>s previously stored in the Lair keystore will no longer work. This means that the conductor now uses Lair keystore 0.x.x (currently 0.2.0 at time of this release). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1446">#1446</a>)  Breaking/New: In preparation for rate limiting, the action structs that support app-defined weights now have a <code>weight</code> field. While the conductor doesn’t currently use this field, in the future you’ll be able to use it to write deterministic validation functions that turn DHT spam into a warrantable offense.  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220629012044">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.147: Quantised Gossip <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11, 0.0.12<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139, 0.0.140<br>Network protocol compatibility: Holochain 0.0.147</p><p>This Holochain release was a quiet rollout of a change we’ve been working on and getting excited about for a while: a new syncing strategy for rrDHT called Quantised Gossip. It promises to help DHTs reach consistency faster, with less network traffic. We think it’s an innovation in DHT design, so much so that we filed a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holohost/comments/vruaqb/todays_update_july_5_2022_new_quantized_gossip/">patent application</a> for it.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with how rrDHT works, it’s fairly straightforward. People and data both get an address that corresponds to their identity — public keys for people, hashes for data and metadata. These addresses live in the same space, a ring of numbers that starts at 0 and wraps around to meet its start at 2^32, or about 4.3 billion.</p><p>Each person claims responsibility for storing data and knowledge of their neighbours for a portion of that ring. When those ‘arcs’ of responsibility overlap (and they should), they create a ‘neighbourhood’ that keeps data resilient against loss. Holochain tries to maintain a lot of overlap, so that participants can come and go with reliable data availability.</p><p>But the traffic of people entering and leaving the network requires the existing peers to adjust their coverage, and new data is being created all the time. You can never be quite certain what your peers already know about and how big of an arc they're holding at any given moment, and it’d be costly to simply push everything you think they needed every minute or so.</p><p>So, in rrDHT, peers compare the list of data they’re each holding in their overlap and only send each other data when something has changed. You can read more about this in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/">intro to rrDHT</a>, the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/">Core Concepts article on the DHT</a>, and this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/developers-developers-developers-developers/#holochain-00132-unidirectional-arcs">small Dev Pulse section</a> about a recent change to arcs.</p><p>Previously, we were using something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a>. It’s like a compressed list of hashes, and it takes less data on the wire. But it turns out that it’s costly to calculate. And you can’t precalculate it; remember that you and your neighbours are regularly adjusting your arcs of responsibility to ensure that no portion of the ring is under- or over-replicated, thus changing the region of addresses in the overlap.</p><p>The new Quantised Gossip comparison algorithm speeds up rrDHT by ‘chunking’ up the DHT into a grid of regions. You see, data in a Holochain DHT could be said to exist in a two-dimensional spacetime — where space is the address of the data and time is, well, the time it was created. This lets peers line up their arcs of responsibility against a coarse grid and create a ‘fingerprint’ of the data inside each region. Then, all they need to do is compare the fingerprints of all the regions they have in common, and only share data for regions whose hashes differ.</p><p>Why is this faster? First, you can precompute the fingerprint for each region you’re storing and recompute it cheaply every time you receive new data. That means you’re ready for the next time you gossip with your neighbours, even if you or they have changed your arc of responsibility slightly. It’s easier to share ten precomputed fingerprints than to recompute a fingerprint for an arbitrary arc that’s 65,000 addresses wide every time you chat with a neighbour.</p><p>Second, when you chunk data into time-based regions, you can save bandwidth by making the older time regions larger and fewer, because they’re less likely to change. The dance with Quantised Gossip is to balance spending bandwidth on comparing regions versus actually transferring DHT data. Regions that are less likely to see updates can be larger, because the risk of them changing is lower.</p><p>[Ed: This paragraph has had some technical errors corrected since publication.] rrDHT already had two schedules for gossiping — ‘recent gossip’ for everything that's been created in the past 15 minutes, and‘historical gossip’ for everything else. This new algorithm replaces Bloom filters with Quantised Gossip for the historical gossip, making that process much more efficient. Even though we’re not yet doing optimisations like precomputing region fingerprints, we’re already seeing reductions in network traffic.</p><p>There are a lot of subtle details in here — for instance, peers estimate the data density in a region and the probability of discrepancies with their neighbours in order to balance region comparison bandwidth versus data transfer bandwidth. There’s plenty of room for future optimisations, and the general mechanism is built and ready to receive those optimisations.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://docs.rs/kitsune_p2p_dht/0.0.1/kitsune_p2p_dht/index.html">fantastic documentation on Quantised Gossip</a> and the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220701181019">changelog</a> (note: doesn’t contain any notes, just links to the list of versioned crates in the release).</p> Holochain 0.0.148: Enzymatic countersigning functional <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11, 0.0.12<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139, 0.0.140<br>Network protocol compatibility: Holochain 0.0.148 and above</p><p>Holochain 0.0.145 introduced changes to ‘enzymatic countersigning’ (explained below), including the ability to add optional signers. At that point it wasn’t yet operational — the required data structures were simply ready for future functionality — but now the networking layer fully supports it. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1472">#1472</a>)</p><p>So what are enzymatic countersigning and optional signers, and what are they used for? When you enter into a countersigning transaction with another party, normally you all send your countersigned entry along with your signatures to the DHT peers who claim responsibility for the entry’s hash, then wait for them to collect all your counterparties’ signatures and send them back to each one of you. In this scenario, the DHT peers are ‘driving’ the session — taking responsibility to help all the counterparties reach consistency and commit a transaction to their chains.</p><p>But because a distributed network isn’t always consistent, it’s possible for one party to think the transaction failed. This can happen because the DHT peers they’re communicating with failed to reach consistency in time, or they were slow in sending back the full signature list. Or maybe they all happen to be mailicious. The counterparty might then back out of the session and write another entry to their chain. This puts them in an inconsistent state, because to everyone else it looks like they agreed to the transaction but later ‘<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/glossary/#fork-source-chain">forked</a>’ their chain.</p><p>Enzymatic countersigning partially solves this problem. In this scenario, one of the counterparties (who could be a transacting party or simply a third-party witness) drives the session, collecting all signatures and sending them back to the other counterparties. As long as they’re honest and have good uptime, it’s a lot less likely that one counterparty will end up in an inconsistent state. The enzyme could still go offline or take time sending the message to one counterparty, but there’s never any inconsistency from the enzyme’s point of view. The other counterparties can double-check with the enzyme before they make their next move.</p><p>Optional signers lets you add a certain number of additional witnesses to a transaction. This is useful if you need a quorum of signers from a list of candidates but you don’t care which of them actually do the signing. Some signers can be offline and the session will still complete — as long as the enzyme is online. That’s because an enzyme is a necessary participant when optional signers are involved; they’re the one who determines exactly which optional signers get recorded as counterparties, so that everyone can validate the transaction in a consistent manner.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220706013407">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.149: Documentation <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11, 0.0.12, 0.0.13<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139, 0.0.140, 0.0.141</p><p>This release added top-level crate documentation for the HDI library <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.13/holochain_deterministic_integrity/"><code>holochain_deterministic_integrity</code></a> and a section on <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.141/hdk/#integrity-zomes-">integrity</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.141/hdk/#coordinator-zomes-">coordinator</a> zomes in the HDK documentation.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220710155915">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.150: holochain_deterministic_integrity → hdi <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11, 0.0.12, 0.0.13, 0.0.14<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139, 0.0.140, 0.0.141, 0.0.142</p><p>Breaking: The <code>holochain_deterministic_integrity</code> crate’s name has been shortened to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hdi"><code>hdi</code></a>. There are no internal changes in this crate besides the rename, a version number bump, and more documentation updates.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220713013021">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.151: Network seed, deterministic DNA bundling, Validation Ergonomics <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11, 0.0.12, 0.0.13, 0.0.14, 0.0.15<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139, 0.0.140, 0.0.141, 0.0.142, 0.0.143</p><p>There’s a small collection of important changes in this release:</p>  Breaking: The <code>uid</code> property in DNA manifests, which changes the DNA hash and ‘forks’ it into a separate network space without changing any of the DNA’s functionality, has been named to <code>network_seed</code>. This better reflects its purpose. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1493">#1493</a>)  New: The <code>genesis_self_check</code> callback now has access to <code>dna_info()</code> and <code>zome_info()</code>. As this callback is an opportunity to ‘prevalidate’ a membrane proof before trying to join a network, it’s crucial for it to have access to things like the DNA’s <code>properties</code> block which may have information necessary for membrane proof validation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1491">#1491</a>)  Breaking/New: The payloads of the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.13/holochain_integrity_types/op/enum.Op.html">Op</a></code> enum variants have changed; now they are all tuples that contain a single struct. There are also some new op helpers available in the HDI to make validation callbacks nicer to write — specifically, it gives access to the most common bits of an operation as well as your defined entry and link types, making it faster to get to the thing you actually want to validate. Check out the documentation for <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.0.15/hdi/op/trait.OpHelper.html">OpHelper</a></code> and <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.0.15/hdi/prelude/enum.OpType.html">OpType</a></code>, as well as the tests, to see how you can structure your match arms for ops. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1488">#1488</a>)  Bugfix: DNAs are now bundled deterministically, which means that a collection of zomes and a DNA manifest file will now always result in the same DNA hash when <code>hc dna pack</code> is run. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1479">#1479</a>)  As always, there are more documentation updates for the <code>hdi</code> and <code>hdk</code> crates. Dear reader, I know that I mention this in every release announcement and you may be getting bored, but the developer experience advocate in me gets a little thrill every time I see that a new component gets more thorough documentation.  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220728122329">changelog</a>.</p> Some notes on how we name and number our SDKs <p>Since we’ve changed the name of the HDI crate, I thought I’d review what the two core SDKs for writing hApps are about.</p>  Holochain Deterministic Integrity (HDI) is an SDK that lets integrity zomes interface with the conductor that hosts them. Integrity zomes are the packages of code that define rules of valid behaviour in an application’s network, including the shape of public DHT data. It only gives code access to purely deterministic functions — the minimum required to get the job of validation done.  Holochain Development Kit (HDK) is a more full-featured SDK that gives coordinator zomes access to everything in HDI plus functions that have side effects, such as writing to a source chain or pinging another participant, and non-deterministic functions, such as generating a random number or querying the DHT for a collection of links.  <p>I’ve always been a bit uncomfortable with the name HDK, because there’s already a perfectly good name for that sort of thing: an SDK (and besides, ‘HDK’ already means <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22hardware+development+kit%22&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">‘hardware development kit’</a>). So while the HDK’s crate will still be named <code>hdk</code>, we’re going to call it the Holochain SDK whenever we’re speaking about it to general audiences. That should make it clearer to new developers what it’s about and what it’s used for.</p><p>Additionally, some people have pointed out that we promised that HDI 0.1, the ‘Stable Validation’ milestone, was going to be ready in time for the Developer Immersive, and we’re still only at version 0.0.14. It is indeed true that we didn’t bump the version number to 0.1, but the core devs did meet their target: a stable, feature-complete, relatively frozen HDI ready for course participants to start hacking on and using long-term.</p><p>We still have some more changes to make (partly based on feedback from course participants), and then we’ll likely cut a 0.1 release. In the meantime, the HDI’s API isn’t likely to receive any breaking changes — only updates.</p> electron-holochain and holochain-runner updates: Holochain 0.0.149, Lair 0.2 <p>electron-holochain and holochain-runner, two projects from dev shop <a href="https://sprillow.com/">Sprillow</a> that bundle up the conductor, Lair keystore, and your hApp into a single binary, have received updates that bump the supported Holochain version to 0.0.149 and Lair 0.2.0. If you’re using either of these projects in your development workflow, you can now update to newer Holochain support.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain">electron-holochain on GitHub</a>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-runner">holochain-runner on GitHub</a>   Holochain Launcher: Two releases  0.4.9: Get your hApp into the hApp store! <p>This release updates the bundled version of the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas">DevHub</a> hApp, the “distributed app for distributing distributed apps”, to 0.7.1. In addition to various <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas/compare/v0.7.0...develop">data model changes</a>, this version sets the foundation for reviews, reactions, and ratings. And the Launcher now recognises when you tag your hApp release with the `app-store-ready` tag and will display it in its built-in App Library. The App Library already made it as easy to install a hApp as it is to install an app on your smartphone; now you can easily publish your production-ready hApps too!</p><p>Note: There are no new conductor, Lair, or HDK releases supported in this version.</p> 0.4.10: Bump Holochain support to 0.0.150 <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.4.10">This release</a> adds support for Holochain 0.0.150 / HDK 0.0.142, and removes support for everything older than Holochain 0.0.143 / HDK 0.0.136.</p> Q&amp;A with hREA project <p>This is a project I’m very excited about. It’s hard to explain exactly what it is, so I’ll just call it a toolkit for building applications that support cooperative economies that are rich with information beyond mere price. I think it has the capacity to redefine our view of the economic world, which could also shape our relationship with the world outside of economics and lead us into a more respectful, regenerative presence in this planet. (If you doubt that accounting systems can have an impact on the world, consider how double-entry bookkeeping, with its isolated entities receiving inputs and producing outputs — its rejection of every uninteresting effect as ‘externalities’ — has caused us to overshoot our planet’s capacity to sustain us.)</p><p>hREA is gearing up for a major milestone release, likely sometime this fall, so they’re deep in development. Their team is expanding and I’m seeing design and engineering discussions flying around left and right.</p><p>The hREA team recently invited the world to join them in a Q&amp;A session about the project. If you’re interested in using software for building sustainable marketplaces and economies, check out this video to learn what they’re about:</p> But what about the Developer Immersive? <p>It was amazing. Powerful instruction, rapid learning, wonderful people, beautiful scenery, good food. I’ll share a lot more next week.

			  Héctor Castro Mateos is a QA Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you?  
<p>I am Héctor. I was born in Cartagena, a small city in the south of Spain. My family and I moved to Sevilla when I was very young, so all my memories are from there. I grew up and studied in Sevilla, spent one year in Milan as an exchange student, and eventually decided to move to Barcelona.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Ever since I finished my studies, I have been working as a QA engineer. I worked for different companies, both large and small, with various working styles. For a long time, I have been interested in crypto and blockchain technologies, and after working at my last company, I felt that it was the right moment to join this industry. I truly believe that it has the potential to change the world in many ways. I soon found Tokeny and, in my opinion, it was a perfect match for me. I like the technology, the amazing team, and their vision for creating something tremendously innovative. Now that I’ve joined the team, I am very glad to have this great opportunity.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Definitely as the best place I have worked at until now. The team is truly amazing. Everyone is very committed and there is a strong sense of belonging to a community. I also highly appreciate the fact that we can work flexibly and remotely.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Sports! I’ve been learning about training and nutrition for years and I love going to the gym and pushing myself to my limits. Also, I like trying out all kinds of new sports. As a result, I can now proudly say that I am an amateur in a wide range of sports including skiing, surfing, and boxing (but I am not an expert in any of them yet!).</p>
<p>My second passion is traveling. I try to do one or two big trips every year to get to know new places and countries. I love exploring new cities as well as getting lost in nature.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To live a happy long life and be able to stay active and travel as much as possible. There are so many things to experience and places to explore. I want to look back at my life and feel that I had so many good experiences and that I made a positive impact on the ones around me.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>If you want to be part of the new blockchain era and contribute with your experience, this is your place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>I’m looking forward to seeing how we will grow together and become a leading company in this industry.&nbsp;</p>

Sovereign Wallet, expanding the CBDC business with key partners in the Nordic&nbsp;regions<p>Greetings all,</p><p>Sovereign Wallet(SW) has opened its subsidiary office, SWN Global Sweden, in Stockholm, Sweden, to expand the CBDC business and networks throughout the Nordic&nbsp;region.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet chose Sweden as a strategic base for expanding the CBDC business among other Nordic countries because Sweden is considered one of the world’s most innovative nations, especially for the first pioneer of developing its digital currency, ‘e-Krona.’ Also, last year,<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/16/bis-launches-innovation-hub-with-nordic-central-banks-focusing-on-cbdcs/"> the Bank for International Settlements(BIS) established a regional innovation hub in Stockholm with four Nordic central banks</a> (Danmarks Nationalbank, Central Bank of Iceland, Norges Bank, and Sveriges Riksbank) focusing on central bank digital currencies, so Sweden became one of the hottest and most attractive places for CBDC developing companies to open their CBDC research labs and business&nbsp;offices.</p><p>Since last year, SW has contacted and had many meetings with financial institutions, companies, and blockchain associations in the Nordic regions for CBDC cooperation. SW initiated <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/partnership-between-nordic-blockchain-association-and-sovereign-wallet-global-df7988066986">a partnership with Nordic Blockchain Association(NBA)</a> as the first partner and had another following <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/sovereign-wallet-metamui-partners-with-iamtn-to-revolutionize-cross-border-payments-cf25892cfda6">partnership recently with the International Association of Money Transfer Networks(IAMTN)</a> for collaborating business in&nbsp;Nordics.</p>Cizar Bachir Brahim, CSO of Sovereign Wallet, is doing a company presentation at Epicenter Stockholm<p>SW also started co-working with <a href="https://weareepicenter.com/stockholm/">Epicenter Stockholm</a>, one of the most vibrant and active accelerating companies in Sweden, and<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_se"> Ernst &amp; Young Sweden</a>, one of the world’s top four consulting firms, to set KPIs and goals for the Nordic CBDC business and other possible cooperations including Digital Stock Exchange and Digital Tokenization. SW has received regular consulting services from both of the companies since the end of last&nbsp;year.</p><p>During the consulting sessions, SW decided on market strategies and future road maps for the Nordic markets with the guidance of Ernst &amp; Young and Epicenter. For a smooth and flexible landing into the Nordic markets, <br>SW decided to establish a CBDC consortium with CBDC technology consultants and financial institutions to approach the Nordic central banks and commercial banks.</p><p>SW is now seeking partners, CBDC technology consulting companies, and financial institutions, who wish to work with us for CBDC and other business cooperation. SW started contacting some of the Nordic banks and financial institutions to showcase our CBDC demo in physical meetings this year. We are gradually upgrading our MetaMUI mainnet and CBDC platform to their needs and demands, and we are on the way to making the CBDC platform the final product&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>Please click the social channels below to catch up on our past and upcoming&nbsp;news.</p><p>More about&nbsp;us</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

Enterprises need a way of governing end users wherever they are working and protecting a growing number of endpoints.&nbsp;Join experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and ARCON as they discuss the security implications of hybrid IT and hybrid working, and how these risks can be mitigated. They will also explore the extent to which Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) solutions provide the capabilities required to manage privilege-related risk and improve IT security.</p>
<p>Paul Fischer, Lead Analysts at KuppingerCole Analysts will explain how modern compliance and security requirements demand that EPM should offer data governance capabilities and analysis in addition to traditional capabilities such as whitelisting and blocking file execution.&nbsp;Anil Bhandari of ARCON will explain the role of ARCON Endpoint Privilege Management in reinforcing endpoint security and how it uses User Behavior Analysis and Data Leakage Prevention features, including Data Intellect, to build a contextual security layer.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/security-benefits-endpoint-pam"></a>

She holds undergraduate degrees in psychology and gender studies, and a Masters in Business Administration.</p><p>Now, she is helping us deliver a positive customer experience to GlobaliD users and partners. During our chat, Meaghan discussed her passion for customer support, how she’s built the customer care team at GlobaliD, and why customers are everything to a business.</p> Introducing Meaghan&nbsp;Decorpo <p>I’m Meaghan Decorpo, Customer Care Manager. My team and I manage all customer-facing interactions at GlobaliD.</p><p>We’re responsible for all inbound customer queries and making sure they are set up for success. This includes things such as onboarding, restoration of account access, migrating accounts off the GlobaliD platform, and answering any other general questions customers may&nbsp;have.</p> What attracted her to&nbsp;GlobaliD <p>I chose to join the GlobaliD team because I wanted to be able to do more for customers than my previous position allowed me to do. I wanted to be able to have a direct impact on them and build foundational blocks for what the customer experience should be. I love being apart of the growth stage of a company and having the opportunity to build relationships directly with customers.</p><p>I also believe we have a truly impactful product. People want to be able to click a button and share their vaccine card or their insurance card. They don’t want to have to shuffle through their wallet or their purse. I can’t even tell you where my health insurance card is. Having something like the GlobaliD app when I go to the doctor’s office would be a monumental thing.</p><p>So the whole concept of identity that we’re building at GlobaliD, our values, and the ability for me to build from the ground up again in this role were the things that brought me&nbsp;here.</p> Why customers are everything <p>In my opinion, customers are everything to a business. Without the customers, we have nothing. So, it’s always been my goal to make sure that my support team or my customer success teams have put their best foot forward, because we are a reflection of the business and we need these customers. We need a backbone, and they are the backbone. That’s why I’ve always focused on building my teams around how we’re gonna best service our customers and their experience.</p> On the Customer Care team structure <p>Our team includes the solutions engineering team, which is responsible for our proof of concept post- or pre-implementation. Not only do we handle all of the outbound customer requests after they become a customer but before they become a customer, as&nbsp;well.</p><p>We’re in charge of the <a href="https://care.global.id/hc/en-us">GlobaliD Care Center</a>, which is a database of FAQs and articles, where our customers can find answers to common issues or requests. They can also submit a help ticket in the Care Center and receive support directly from one of our team&nbsp;members.</p><p>We also manage the GlobaliD Support Twitter account, where users can reach out to us directly with questions, concerns, and feedback.</p> The importance of community <p>I’m a huge proponent of being interactive within our user community. Connecting directly with the community gives us chances to drive home what GlobaliD is all about, provide real-time advice, and most importantly, truly understand what our customers’ needs&nbsp;are.</p><p>That was actually one of the driving factors behind us launching <a href="https://twitter.com/GlobalidSupport">our own support account on Twitter.</a> It gives us a way to promote some of the fun stuff that the support team is working on for them, and the community knows there is a specific place on Twitter where they can reach&nbsp;us.</p> Providing a human&nbsp;touch <p>Our customers love that they’re able to interact with a real person. They appreciate the fact they’re not talking to a bot and that we constantly follow up with them. We recently updated our application so that if somebody wants to discontinue their account, all they have to do is click a button, and then one of our team members reaches out to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Customers said, “Oh, I didn’t think I would get a response from someone.” Well, we’re real people. We manually take care of this for you, and we manually follow up to make sure everything is complete. For them — to know we’re doing the right thing as a company and as a team — it really drives home the fact that we’ve built a top tier customer experience.</p> Her education and early career background <p>I have undergraduate degrees in psychology and gender studies, and I have a Masters in Business Administration. While they seem kind of random to me now, everything I’ve learned has helped me become a better leader and customer advocate.</p><p>I’ve worked in technology for about twelve years in a variety of different industries. Around eight years ago, I joined the startup world and just fell in love with the chaos. I found that I really loved the ability to leave my mark and build a strong foundation for customer support teams and businesses. Customers make me happy. Whether they’re mad or happy, being able to make an impact on a customer base has always interested me.</p> Her hobbies and interests <p>I have a puppy who we call Turbo — although that is not her actual name. I spend a lot of my time with her, and I have a 13-year old French bulldog who thinks she rules the house, and pretty much does. That’s how I spend my&nbsp;days.</p><p>Due to how much time I spent pursuing education. my family tells me I’m a perpetual nerd and that I will always be a student. I can’t disagree with them because every time I take a new role at a different company, I like to learn as much as I possibly can in order to continue to&nbsp;grow.</p><p>Even though I love the people aspect of what I do, I’m very much a self-proclaimed introvert. So while I’m a people person on the outside, I definitely need to recharge after a week of interacting with customers and team members. Give me a book in a corner, and I’m happy as can&nbsp;be.</p> What she’s most excited about for GlobaliD moving&nbsp;forward <p>I’m just excited to continue working with the great team we’ve put together and making our customers feel welcome and satisfied. Our team has been called “The Dream Team” because we all are so focused on making things work. We’re really a powerhouse together.</p><p>I’m eager for the company to start rolling out more product features and updates because I feel like our team is ready to begin onboarding lots of new customers, and we look forward to making their customer experience as seamless as possible.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about GlobaliD, sign up for the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">GlobaliD Insider newsletter.</a> You’ll get monthly updates on digital identity, company news and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Also, ICYMI:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-todd-collins-head-of-design-d7a0ae062079">Meet the Team — Todd Collins, Head of&nbsp;Design</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-kevin-boehm-head-of-product-27e1f21cf580?source=collection_home---4------8-----------------------">Meet the Team — Kevin Boehm, Head of&nbsp;Product</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-erik-westra-head-of-globalid-labs-57fe63b5f1ba">Meet the Team — Erik Westra, Head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-meaghan-decorpo-191c9d6ba00b">Meet the Team: Meaghan Decorpo</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With the web in a constant state of flux, it’s important to differentiate between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 and prepare for the next web installation.</p>
<p>What is a Web 3.0 website? Web 3.0 is powered by artificial intelligence and uses blockchain technology to create a more secure, private, and decentralized web experience.&nbsp;</p>
 What Was Web 1.0?&nbsp; 
<p>The first and earliest stage of internet development is colloquially known as Web 1.0, although (obviously) it wasn’t referred to until the rapid and ubiquitous deployment of Web 2.0 technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web 1.0 covers the early days of dial-up connections, AOL, and the internet as new and emerging technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary Web 1.0 technologies include the following:</p>
 HyperText Markup Language 
<p>HTML is the descriptive foundation of a content as it is presented on the internet. “Markup” languages, in this context, are a form of metadata that define how a web browser should display content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the concept of nesting tags and document structure to standardize the presentation of content online, HTML allows web developers to format text, include different forms of media (video, images, or audio), and embed hyperlinks directly into text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hyperlinks are, in some respects, the backbone of content in the Web 1.0 paradigm. Links connect pages such that a reader can navigate through pages quickly and logically. Without links, web content would end up siloed on different servers, requiring users to know the direct URL address of that content to access it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequently, the use of links saw the rise of web portals and, eventually, search engines where users could easily navigate the rapidly increasing content available on the web.</p>
 HyperText Transfer Protocol 
<p>To facilitate the transfer of HTML documents from servers to users on their desktops, developers, like Tim Berners-Lee, began building a protocol to quickly and reliably exchange information like HTML.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the advent of HTTP, it was still common for computers to exchange information via file-sharing protocols like FTP. However, this approach wasn’t necessarily intuitive nor did it integrate seamlessly with the purpose of HTML—namely, to download and display content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTTP provided a way for servers to receive data requests from users that would navigate to that content via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), a string of characters specifying the domain location and directory of a document. Over time, evolutions of the HTTP protocol would introduce faster data transfer speeds, persistent connections and additional security through the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) extension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web 1.0 is denoted by static, persistent web pages, typically relying more on text information than graphics to convey messages. Some preliminary efforts towards eCommerce rose during this time as well.</p>
 What Is Web 2.0? 
<p>In the early 2000s, web developers began to look at the existing paradigm of web development as a limitation, rather than an expansion, of interactivity with and between users. While Web 1.0 utterly transformed communication for enterprises and users throughout the 1990s, specialists and engineers began to look into ways to replace bland web pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the technologies that emerged over the early 2000s and for the next 15-20 years include the following:</p>
 Databases and PHP 
<p>Databases weren’t new at the time—in fact, databases had been around, in one way or another, for decades. However, there was never an easy way to utilize database information to serve user requests as they were made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A major step towards developing such capabilities was the integration of the PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor scripting language. And yes, you read that correctly—the name is a recursive acronym that refers to itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PHP is a server-side language that bridged the gap between client-side web presentation (HTML) and server databases. Programmers could develop systems that take user input from HTML forms, process it as a formal request to a database through SQL, and return the results as a new web page formatted HTML.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development of PHP and database integration allowed for the development of more dynamic websites like blogs, the popularity of which signaled the start of Web 2.0.</p>
 Rich Media 
<p>The move from static web pages led to the integration and foregrounding of rich media. Web 1.0 content would often include images, audio, and in some cases, embedded video. Limitations in hardware and Internet infrastructure made moving large data files around harder, limiting how media could be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Web 2.0, visual media is just as important, if not more so, than text. Large, high-resolution images are much more common, and video is equally as common as a static image. More importantly, streamlining video, or video played instantaneously from a central server rather than necessitating a complete download, has changed how we consume media.&nbsp;</p>
 Interactivity 
<p>Early blogging relied on databases and PHP, but using a blog at home became much more accessible to users when they had more interactive tools to use to write in them—most users don’t have the technical skills to write text and store that text in a database, after all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the beginning, interactivity was relatively simple: client-side programming languages like JavaScript worked hand-in-hand with HTML to provide more robust interactivity for users, including user interfaces and dashboards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the expansion of REST APIs and AJAX introduced a new paradigm of real-time interaction. In the case of blogs, a user must refresh a page to get new updates—that is, to resend a request for content updates. Key developments in JavaScript and PHP APIs led to the emergence of websites where updates worked in real time. Following this innovation, website elements we take for granted today, like comment sections, became a reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most impactful development during this time, and of Web 2.0 broadly, was that of social media. Real-time updates, interactive media, and short, bite-sized pieces of content streamlined publishing and sharing. They ushered in the rise of media platforms like WordPress, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Google.</p>
 Peer-to-Peer 
<p>Platforms and major eCommerce sources often rely on large, centralized platforms to serve high bandwidth and provide high availability. However, many users have begun to raise concerns about this kind of decentralization, including issues around censorship, privacy, and the commercial use of personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some areas, decentralized infrastructure developments have become a major topic of interest. Technologies like BitTorrent have provided the initial stirrings of a decentralized network, even if it is a bit limited as a file-sharing tool. BitTorrent uses P2P transactions, where users share information directly without needing a centralized server.&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Web 3.0? 
<p>Moving to Web 3.0 is predicated on decentralizing the web, making the web more intelligent, more ubiquitous, and more device-agnostic.</p>
<p>Some of the major innovations in web 3.0 include the following:</p>
 Blockchain 
<p>Decentralization is a major part of the Web 3.0 approach, and nothing is pushing that concept further than the blockchain. Originally invented as a ledger for the Bitcoin network, blockchains are decentralized forms of record-keeping that rely on cryptography and various verification methods to ensure the ledger’s integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the broad, public chains of cryptocurrency aren’t quite ready for enterprise use, tailored, private chains are finding a home in enterprise data storage and record-keeping, particularly where security and immutability are required.&nbsp;</p>
 Artificial Intelligence 
<p>With the advent of massively-scalable cloud computing platforms and specialized artificial intelligence applications, modern web enterprises have turned online cloud platforms into intelligent systems that can perform advanced predictive analytics and drive autonomous machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While AI has a wide range of applications, it’s especially influential in online data-driven apps for human users and machine agents in different systems. This kind of user-machine and machine-machine interaction are radically changing how we interact with common forms of digital media like social media, online games, or other SaaS apps.&nbsp;</p>
 Semantic Web 
<p>Tim Berners-Lee hypothesized that Web 3.0 would be dominated by metadata—data about data that allows for richer machine-reading and interpretation. And in many cases, we see this emerge as the driving engine of this new paradigm.</p>
<p>It’s critical to understand that things like AI and powerful computing platforms rely on robust metadata to the extent that metadata becomes just as important, if not more so than the data itself. Accordingly, evolving standards in metadata, like XML, JSON, and other schemes, are driving data categorization.&nbsp;</p>
 Authentication and Identity in Web 3.0 with 1Kosmos 
<p>One of the most important parts of Web 3.0 is security. Information must be secure with millions of users (and all their data) plugged into public and enterprise systems. Web 3.0 technology like the blockchain and AI can power more robust identity management platforms and advanced biometrics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos BlockID, you get an authentication and identity solution built for the future of Web 3.0. This kind of future-looking technology comes with the implementation of specific features like the following:</p>
 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.&nbsp; 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime, and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user.&nbsp; 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.&nbsp; 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.&nbsp;

 IDnow’s recently-released ‘Crypto in KYC – Growth through trust’ ebook helps organizations to better understand the unstable market, and drive customer adoption while complying with regulations. 



 



<p>The unruly world of cryptocurrency could very well rewrite the future of global payments as we know it. As a still largely untapped market, it offers organizations an almost limitless number of opportunities to increase revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as an unpredictable frontier, cryptocurrency also offers its fair share of dangers and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">hurdles to overcome</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though there is no shortage of brands that are <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/what-brands-need-to-know-about-accepting-cryptocurrency-payments/">accepting payments in cryptocurrency</a> (Think the biggest: from Gucci to KFC), there are many more that are hesitant to enter the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But organizations that do not leave any room in their business strategies for launching a Crypto KYC solution are probably missing out on millions in revenue. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the uncertainty of the last few months, the global cryptocurrency market is still worth around <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/business/cryptocurrency-market-value-slumps-below-1-trillion-3062569">€2 trillion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although still in its infancy, the cryptocurrency market is already showing signs of rapid maturity. Download the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/crypto-in-kyc-growth-through-trust/">‘Crypto in KYC – Growth through trust’</a> ebook to learn what the emergence of new services like Staking (letting users earn rewards for verifying transactions) and Lending (collecting interest from borrowers) means for the future of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Regulating Opportunities&nbsp; 



<p>With mature markets comes regulations and laws to govern use. There are also significant differences in regulation across regions and countries, according to a country’s rate and approach to regulatory adoption. Some countries like USA, Canada, and Germany have already started to integrate cryptocurrencies and virtual assets into their financial and anti-money laundering regulations. There are many, such as Malta, which have neither regulations nor restrictions regarding crypto trading, that have not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>La transizione energetica ha portato a un forte aumento della produzione di energia elettrica distribuita proveniente da fonti rinnovabili.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per far fronte alla crescita di risorse distribuite e alla conseguente esigenza di una rete sicura e stabile, <a href="https://www.arera.it/it/index.htm">ARERA</a>, l’Autorità di Regolazione per Energia Reti e Ambiente ha stabilito con la delibera 540/2021/R/eel che tutti i produttori di energia connessi in Media Tensione e che hanno una potenza nominale d’impianto pari o superiore ad 1MW devono installare presso i propri impianti un Controllore Centrale di Impianto (CCI).&nbsp;</p>



 Cosa sono i controllori Centrali di Impianto?&nbsp; 



<p>I controllori centrali di impianto (CCI) sono dei dispositivi che consentono lo scambio di dati, nella fattispecie misure e stati dell’impianto, attraverso il protocollo IEC 61850, tra:&nbsp;</p>



  gli impianti di produzione elettrica&nbsp;  



  il DSO (Distribution Systems Operator – Azienda per la Distribuzione dell’Energia Elettrica) e il gestore di rete.&nbsp;  



<p>Come previsto dalla delibera i CCI devono essere installati sia su impianti già esistenti che impianti di nuova realizzazione:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“il CCI debba essere presente alla data di entrata in esercizio per gli impianti di produzione di nuova realizzazione, mentre, per gli impianti di produzione esistenti, sia definito un percorso di adeguamento ad hoc”&nbsp;</p>



 Contributo forfettario ARERA per l’adeguamento degli impianti, come funziona?&nbsp; 



<p>Mentre per gli impianti di nuova realizzazione non sono previsti contributi per l’adeguamento, per chi si trova ad adeguare un impianto di produzione esistente, e quindi entrato in esercizio entro il 30 novembre 2022, ARERA ha previsto l’erogazione di un contributo forfettario, che varia in base alle tempistiche di adeguamento. Il contributo è pari a:&nbsp;</p>



  10.000 €, nel caso di invio entro il 31 marzo 2023 della comunicazione di avvenuto adeguamento;&nbsp;  



  7.500 €, nel caso di invio entro il 30 giugno 2023 della comunicazione di avvenuto adeguamento;&nbsp;

 InfoCert MID PKI per abilitare comunicazioni certificate dei Controllori Centrali di Impianto&nbsp; 



<p>InfoCert, grazie al suo ruolo chiave nella definizione delle regole tecniche di comunicazione tra CCI, è in grado di offrire a tutti i produttori una soluzione già pronta e conforme ai requisiti di sicurezza descritti nell’allegato T (CEI 0-16; 2021-06) in grado di abilitare i dispositivi alle comunicazioni in rete: MID PKI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MID PKI è una soluzione basata su PKI che consente di emettere certificati a un’entità (persona fisica o macchina) dopo un’adeguata fase di identificazione anche automatica (utilizzando protocolli come EST e SCEP).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Utilizzando il certificato, l’entità può avviare un dialogo sicuro con qualsiasi sistema abilitato alla PKI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nel caso dei Controllori Centrali di Impianto, InfoCert è in grado di certificare gli apparati rilasciando loro una vera e propria identità digitale e abilitare comunicazioni sicure e certificate con la rete.&nbsp;</p>

 Balance, cooperation and opportunity <p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article from Raindy Lu, Head of Marketing at Ontology.</p><p>Web3, a familiar and unfamiliar word, has recently appeared repeatedly in major media reports and corporate publicity. However, how many people have really entered the world of Web3, and what are the things that are not accessible without&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>I believe that the first step for most people to enter Web3 is to use a CEX to create their first Bitcoin trading account, or to use the Metamask wallet to create their first Ethereum address, thereby opening their own BTC and ETH story. After that, they slowly touched more digital currencies, began to pay attention to their price movements and felt ready to hold them. We hope to realize the dream of financial freedom through such an emerging market. Some speculators who have tasted the sweetness have begun to publicize their belief in Web3, hoping to influence more people around them to join this “game”. However, this is by no means&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>If you want to explain Web3 in the simplest language, I think it is a decentralized collaboration model. This model completely subverts the traditional time rules and gameplay, enabling everyone to remove the shackles of centralized institutions and truly control their own data and identity, thereby promoting the development of a value-driven economy. Although many people still have reservations about the necessity of blockchain and Web3, it is undeniable that there are indeed many scenarios that cannot be separated from the necessary elements of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Decentralized storage ensures information security</p><p>Since the advent of the ARPANET in 1969, the Internet has enabled the interconnection of the global world. At the same time, tens of trillions of data information are also generated. It is increasingly difficult for personal PC devices to support the storage of these data, and hardware devices with powerful storage capabilities are often difficult to carry. Cloud storage emerged as the times required, providing a shared data storage platform for all kinds of users to manage and use their own data through uploading and downloading. Google Drive has reached 120 million users. Moreover, with the diversification of user needs, these cloud storage services have further expanded their business scope, such as Google Cloud, AWS, etc., by providing customized SaaS services to help enterprises achieve business transformation, improve agility, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation. While fully enjoying the convenience brought by these services to individuals and enterprises, various information leakage incidents are emerging one after another, and personal data trafficking has even become an industry.</p><p>The rise of major public chains in 2018 also stemmed from the awakening of this problem to a large extent. Unlike cloud storage, public chains refer to consensus blockchains that anyone can read, send transactions and obtain valid confirmations. The public chain is usually considered to be “completely decentralized”, all data is open and transparent, and no individual or institution can control or tamper with the reading and writing of data. It has the characteristics of protecting users from the influence of developers, low access threshold, and default disclosure of all&nbsp;data.</p><p>These are all impossible to achieve with traditional Internet services. With the development of the past five years, from the becoming of an Ethereum killer to today’s embrace of EVM, major public chains have gradually realized that it is unrealistic for one to dominate. Contention is the choice that is conducive to the development of the entire industry. On the basis of ensuring the security of node operation and optimizing TPS and other infrastructure, it has become a consensus to consider interoperability with other chains to the greatest extent possible. On this basis, each chain must also maintain a certain degree of focus. Whether it is DeFi on BSC, NFT on Flow, or DID on Ontology, they have gradually formed their own differentiated advantages and unique brand&nbsp;labels.</p><p>Decentralized identity protects personal&nbsp;privacy</p><p>In the traditional world, passports, ID cards and other documents are the certificates to prove our true identity, and they are issued by the authoritative institutions of the country. When we need to handle some specific business, we need to provide all our information to the institution as required. Take the matter of buying a ticket for example, we need to provide the airline with information such as our name, gender, date of birth, ID number, etc., and the ticketing process will only be entered after the airline has verified that the passenger meets all the boarding conditions. This information is often stored by airlines and used in other business scenarios of the company, which is why when you haven’t gotten off the plane, you will receive all kinds of airport shuttle services and travel advertisements on your mobile&nbsp;phones.</p><p>In fact, this is not a necessary operation. What they need to know is only important information such as whether the passenger is over 70 years old and whether there is a disease that is not suitable for the flight. So how to ensure the orderly progress of people’s daily life on the premise of protecting personal privacy? Decentralized identities offer a great solution.</p><p>Generally speaking, users can choose a public chain as the carrier for creating their own DIDs (such as creating ONT IDs on the Ontology chain) according to their own preferences, and then all the information uploaded by themselves will be recorded on this chain in a decentralized manner, to ensure that your information is safe and not leaked. For some chains that do not yet support DID, the wallet address on the chain can also be used as an identity identifier under its own specific dimension. Next, users can use zero-knowledge proof technology to authorize their on-chain and off-chain information to generate different verifiable credentials (VCs), which can be customized according to different business scenarios. As a result, users are no longer disclosing their naked personal information, but only large-scale VC results. If Alice originally filled in the airline’s information of being born on January 1, 1990, it can be converted into Alice’s age of&nbsp;18.</p><p>The scene is transferred to the world of a crypto native, and DID is also an excellent tool for users to manage various on-chain addresses, assets, applications, etc. in a unified manner. With the support of decentralized domain name services, everyone can create their own domain names on platforms such as ENS in a personalized way and bind their own wallet addresses. Some new Web3 projects have also begun to extend services to Mirror blog, various on-chain DeFi dApps, and the binding and invocation of traditional Web2 social applications such as Twitter and LinkedIn. They provide users with integrated management tools that integrate Web2 and Web3, and some of them also provide various data analysis functions on this basis to optimize user experience.</p><p>In addition, all on-chain behavior records of users can also form their own on-chain reputation, which can be applied to more scenarios through KYC to open up the off-chain world.</p><p>Web3 creates a new personal income&nbsp;model</p><p>Since Web3 is a new mode of collaboration, individual contributions to collaboration also require a new mode of giving back to incentivize continuous investment. For a single blockchain platform, the individual participation method can be to operate a node in the POS network and obtain a share of the platform transaction fee. These divisions are often based on parameters such as the number of platform coins on individual operating nodes, and the operating time. Another hot scene is decentralized finance. The DeFi Summer in 2020 once triggered a wave of mining for all people, by staking their own tokens to different DeFi protocols, or through ghostwriting operations to obtain project parties. The incentive tokens provided can realize the appreciation of their own digital assets at one&nbsp;time.</p><p>When DeFi faded from the short-lived bubble, it was replaced by NFTs as the new sweet and pastry. An important concept is introduced — the creator economy. Whether it is a writer, graphic designer, any type of creator can cast their works into NFT, set their own prices or release them to the NFT market in a way that allows public auctions, buyers can buy according to their own aesthetics and preferences, and choose whether to carry out secondary circulation. In this way, it provides creators with new revenue channels and accelerates transactions in a peer-to-peer manner. On this basis, creators can also gradually build their own fan community, and these loyal fans are likely to become their regular customers and continue to buy their&nbsp;art.</p><p>Various types of X-To-Earn, which were popular some time ago, have organically combined blockchain with online games or applications, and while fully ensuring playability, superimposed various token earning modes. Then it is extended to application scenarios such as item purchase and transaction, and builds its own independent ecosystem for each application. Through cooperation with major IPs, the user interface will be expanded to non-Web3 groups. Although I don’t know what blockchain is, I want to come and&nbsp;play.</p><p>Another personal income model scenario is in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Unlike the collaborative model of traditional organizations, the biggest advantage of DAOs is their permissionless nature. In the traditional world, to join a company, an individual must prove academic qualifications and relevant experience, and then go through multiple rounds of interviews. There is no restriction on joining a DAO, it requires you to find a suitable role in the DAO, and you can get corresponding rewards according to the rules of each DAO for completing specific tasks, and this collaboration is global, not subject to physical space limits. Furthermore, this collaborative model is “bottom-up”, which avoids authoritarian problems. Each DAO member can put forward his own suggestions on DAO’s governance rules and incentive distribution methods, and make decisions through community voting. This realizes the healthy iteration of DAO to a certain extent, and encourages DAO members to contribute ideas and suggestions to the organization.</p><p>The above parts are only part of the changes brought about by Web3. With the gradual improvement of modern people’s awareness of the security of their own identity and data, the need to control their own time and space is becoming more and more intense, and Web3 will be effectively applied to more scenarios. On the other hand, the supervision of data security and privacy in various countries is also becoming more and more sound, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), and the China Data Security Law, etc. The promulgation of the bill, the big Internet companies will also face more challenges, only by embracing Web3 can they find the balance of interests between themselves and their users and achieve sustainable development.</p><p>Web3 has arrived, Let’s BUIDL together!</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of general blockchain basic protocols and products provided by Ontology for Web3 applications. Basic components including data and reputation, etc., and general-purpose tools such as a Web3 wallet, etc. Web3 applications can choose different basic components according to different scenarios for easy integration. It saves Web3 applications from developing basic functions from scratch, and thus can quickly develop applications. Individual users can also quickly access Web3 applications by using OWN basic products.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/those-things-cannot-be-done-without-web3-4351efee3df">Those Things Cannot Be Done Without Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Penguins covered by oil, dozens of animals succumbed, more and more petroleum-yellow waves reaching the beaches. On January 15th 2022 around 40 km north from Lima the biggest ecological disaster in history of Peru happened, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/oil-spill-at-sea-who-will-pay-peru-worst-environmental-disaster">an oil spill</a>. These images caused us Peruvians indignation and I asked myself: “In 2022, why our lives still rely on extracting oil?”. This is clearly unsustainable and makes me wonder when we’ll see a world without oil.</p>
<p>Drawing a parallel with our digital lives, a lot is unsustainable too. Behind the scenes of our online shopping, digital tax declaration, chats with family across the ocean, and long hours watching videos, these delightful digital experiences can at any time turn into grey. In our digital lives such disaster is a data breach. &nbsp;The good news is that like oil spills, such misfortunes can and must be avoided.</p>
<p>Creators of digital services—which many of us are, directly or indirectly—must put their entire efforts into making our digital lives sustainable because it benefits everyone. Otherwise, we’ll see the oil spills within our digital lives.</p>
 The spill of data 
<p>From the 2010s when social networks and smartphones became ubiquitous, companies from all industries have been becoming increasingly greedy for data. With the view to gain as much data as possible from users, even if the data is not currently needed, it may be stored for later use. Many companies have followed <a href="https://usercentrics.com/knowledge-hub/data-is-the-new-gold-how-and-why-it-is-collected-and-sold/">this paradigm</a> without objections. Leaving users asking why an online store needs to collect users’ gender, marital status, photo, access to your social media feed, and your location, just to name a few. With some services still collecting such data from customers today.</p>
<p>In light of this, what is the most disastrous event that happen in a company just by having stored an enormous amount of people’s data?</p>
<p>As you can now guess, the answer is simple: a data breach. A data breach is a security incident in which unauthorized people accesses sensitive, confidential, protected information stored in company’s data repositories. In practice, such information could be a person’s name, credit card information, medical records, passwords, etc.</p>
<p>A data breach is the oil spill of our digital lives. It will inevitably harm both the individuals whose personal data is now exposed, and the company that collected the data.</p>
<p>Not a single company can claim to be secure enough that a data breach will never happen within its domain. The more data a company stores and the more sensitive such data is, the bigger the disaster can become.</p>
<p>In the very recent years, you might have heard how <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3651489/ransomware-is-top-cyberattack-type-as-manufacturing-gets-hit-hardest.html">ransomware</a> has risen to the top of cybersecurity threats for organisations, but reports of data breaches have also continued growing every year. The damage for a company hit by a data breach can be devastating; both in loss of reputation and in fines paid to state regulators or as indemnification to the affected users. It’s sad to see that <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/cybersecurity-pandemic-lisa-forte/" title="healthcare institutions">healthcare institutions</a> are currently the top victim of data breaches.</p>
 How do data breaches occur? 
<p>Several aspects can go wrong and be the ignition factor for a data breach. From cloud misconfiguration to exploits in third-party software. Nevertheless, compromised credentials (mostly passwords) and phishing are the top factors for data breaches. Remote work has also increased the time to identify and contain a breach, as well as its total cost.</p>
 A broader view to prevent data breaches 
<p>Most of today’s techniques to prevent data breaches focus on advanced cybersecurity solutions, such as using artificial intelligence and endpoint protection. However, is this the first point to tackle? What if companies widen their perspective and give the individual a way to take part in the solution.</p>
<p>If we move our focus out of protecting the perimeter, how can we minimise the impact of a data breach?</p>
<p>The principle is simple: the less data, the less devastating the breach. Stop collecting unnecessary data, especially sensitive data. Eliminate the dirty practices of collecting too much data. These days any well-informed CIO would feel relieved after knowing that the organisation has stopped such practices.</p>
<p>Secondly, give people the power of self-service. Regardless of what your business calls them; customers, citizens, patients, partners, users, give them simple tools to edit their own data. Encourage them to use the tools, instead of hiding them behind dark patterns. Exercising the right to be erased should be as simple and quick as your nifty user registration process.</p>
<p>Myself I’ve collaborated with identity professionals worldwide and contributed to the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/data-protection/what-is-consent-receipt/" title="Consent Receipt specification">Consent Receipt specification</a> by Kantara Initiative. Put it in short: today every time you accept privacy settings and terms, you don’t have a tool to modify those settings in the future. With consent receipts, you will be able to know exactly which consent you gave to whom, under which terms of use, and of course you will be able to revoke consent at any time. We need tools like these in people’s hands to make our digital lives sustainable.</p>
 How your company will benefit by embracing this 
<p>If your company builds great products and services that make our digital lives sustainable, you are the leaders leaving the skin in the game, and the rewards will come.</p>
<p>Benefits to companies:</p>
 
 More customers’ trust. There is no single week without the news showing that a web service has misused people’s data, whether comes from Facebook, Google, smaller tech players or from public services from across the globe. Thus, it’s not a surprise if individuals are sceptical of using a new app that the local government is launching. At the other side of the spectrum there are the services getting awarded, KBC in Belgium has been voted the most trusted brand in Belgium for the last five years, in part due to the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/data-minimisation-meeco-katryna-dow/" title="bank giving their customers a greater sense of that trust, privacy and control.">bank giving their customers a greater sense of that trust, privacy and control.</a> 
 More compliance. The new wave of data protection and privacy regulations led by EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is helping companies to set a higher bar for building their digital services. Your company will surf these waves no matter how high the sea rises. 
 Huge savings. What could be the biggest cost of doing this wrong? Naturally, the costs of recovering from a data breach. As you know, a data breach can have huge economic impact and even cause a company’s bankruptcy, like Finland’s <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252496227/Hacked-Finnish-therapy-business-collapses">Vastaamo</a> in 2021. 
 
<p>Finally, your employees want it too. There’s nothing more motivating for an employee, than to feel part of an organisation that cares about the human impact of its products and services. While also feeling that their own personal data as employee is well protected.</p>
<p>We can avoid oil spills, both the ones that affect our sea life and the ones that affect our digital lives.</p>
<p>Preventing a data breach—the oil spill of our digital lives—is better and less costly than trying to recover from such disaster. The fate is in our hands.</p>
<p>We can build better technology, we must do it, and we will do it.</p>

 Veriscope Weekly Regulatory Recap (July 18 — July&nbsp;24)  Thailand, Japan, UK and India take strides towards crypto regulation. <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s weekly regulatory recap. Authorities continued stressing the need for tough regulatory measures against digital assets amid a considerable fall in the global crypto market cap last week, too. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> Thailand Planning Stricter Crypto Regulations <p>Thailand’s Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking to tighten the supervision of crypto asset companies after a significant sell-off in the crypto market resulted in the failure of businesses, leaving retail investors with substantial losses.</p><p>Thus, the country’s financial regulator aims to modify the current rules governing the crypto industry, originally passed in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>“The extreme volatility of digital-asset prices has spurred the urgent need for improved supervision,” said Secretary-General Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol. “Our main focus will be to provide more protection for small investors, some of whom are putting most of their savings into these&nbsp;assets.”</p><p>Plans to increase crypto oversight come as the SEC looks into potential losses among the public following Zipmex Ltd., one of the country’s regulated crypto exchanges, and its regional parent’s announcement of halting withdrawals.</p><p>Amidst the talks around the tougher stance of the country’s financial regulator towards digital assets, Thailand’s oldest lender and Siam Commercial Bank’s parent company SCB X has indefinitely delayed a $487 million bid to acquire a 51% stake in the country’s largest local crypto exchange&nbsp;Bitkub.</p><p>Visit here to read more: <a

Japanese Authorities are Seemingly Dissatisfied with Country’s Crypto Self-regulation Body <p>The Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), the self-regulatory body for the country’s crypto industry, is coming under fire from Japan’s financial market regulator, the Financial Services Agency&nbsp;(FSA).</p><p>JVCEA is reportedly criticized for poor governance, lack of skilled staff, and slow implementation of crucial Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.</p><p>The FSA recently held a meeting with the association where it raised questions on JVCEA’s decision-making process and the responsibility of the board&nbsp;members.</p><p>Not long ago, JVCEA, founded in 2018 during the bear market, also came under pressure from the Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, who required the body to review its token listing screening criteria.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-s-crypto-self-regulation-experiment-not-working">https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-s-crypto-self-regulation-experiment-not-working</a></p> The UK to Boost Crypto Regulation <p>The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is set out to strengthen cross-border crypto asset regulation and use a data-led strategy to mitigate the risks of digital platforms.</p><p>Nikhil Rathi, the chief executive of the UK’s financial regulatory body, pointed to the FCA’s Digital Regulators Cooperation Forum, which plans to take a more proactive stance and intervene swiftly whenever risks related to financial crime are identified.</p><p>FCA plans to “deepen ties on crypto regulation and market developments” with US regulators as part of its regulatory approach to&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>The comments came after the UK, US, and Singapore launched the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) taskforce on DeFi and crypto market integrity risks earlier this&nbsp;month.</p><p>“We are demonstrably supporting responsible use cases for the underlying technology while ensuring it is not at the expense of appropriate consumer protection or market integrity,” said&nbsp;Rathi.</p><p>Since 2020, the FCA has only approved 35 crypto firms out of 273 that applied for registration with the agency under AML regulations.</p><p>Read more here: <a

India’s FM Calls for a Global Framework on Exchange of Information Around Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>Nirmala Sitharaman, India’s Finance Minister, called for a worldwide framework for crypto and urged the other G20 nations to integrate crypto into the “Automatic Exchange of Information” (AEOI).</p><p>During her speech at the G20 Ministerial Symposium on Tax and Development in Indonesia, Sitharaman urged nations to look into additional non-monetary resources other than those covered by Common Reporting Standard (CRS) in the AEOI at this&nbsp;time.</p><p>She further highlighted a study by the Ministry of Finance that revealed that “tax evaders often set up numerous layers of entities to conceal their unaccounted assets.”</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://bfsi.eletsonline.com/sitharaman-calls-for-bringing-crypto-under-the-automatic-exchange-of-information-structure/">https://bfsi.eletsonline.com/sitharaman-calls-for-bringing-crypto-under-the-automatic-exchange-of-information-structure/</a></p><p>Although the crypto market was experiencing a rebound of sorts last week, surpassing one trillion market cap once again, the surge was a short-lived one as the market started reacting negatively to Tesla’s decision to offload 75% of its Bitcoin holdings, among other&nbsp;factors.</p><p>The regulatory landscape remained heated, too, with India and Thailand joining the action. This makes it clear that there’s no stopping the regulatory onslaught. Thus, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) must remain prepared to comply with various regulations, starting with the FATF’s Travel Rule. It is the first piece of global regulation aimed at the digital assets&nbsp;market.</p><p>All that CASPs need to begin complying with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution (TRS), and Veriscope is an undisputed leader in this&nbsp;market.</p><p>Check Veriscope out here: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">https://www.veriscope.network/</a></p><p>Contact our Business Development team for a discussion here: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/contact">https://www.veriscope.network/contact</a></p><p>Also, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShyftNetwork">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a> for regular updates on the evolving crypto regulatory landscape.</p>

<p>Experts globally agree on one key point about decentralized identity: it will be essential to the evolving metaverse and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a>&nbsp;world. We’ll all be using personal keys, blockchains and decentralized applications to limit the amount of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;we expose to data brokers, data breaches and dodgy business practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts also say brands that go fast to market with this new technology will see huge&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-4-benefits-to-enterprises-from-proactively-adopting-decentralized-identity/">competitive advantages</a>. We agree.&nbsp;Discover how you can rapidly put decentralized identity solutions into your customers’ hands with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">Sudo Platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Brands should embrace decentralized identity now 



<p>We’ve been singing the praises of decentralized identity for a long time and a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/decentralized-identity-management-is-essential">Nasdaq</a>&nbsp;article backs up our view, saying companies should walk away from metaverse and Web3 vendors who don’t&nbsp;offer “a solid strategy for exploiting broadly adopted, decentralized, identity management standards and technology.”</p>



<p>Put simply, decentralized identity is the future of identity management on the internet. It&nbsp;gives a strong foundation for better user privacy, and it’s considered the most important privacy innovation of this decade.&nbsp;It’s also one of the most&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">important use cases for blockchain</a>, as our co-CEO and CTO Dr. Paul Ashley told a recent blockchain convention in Australia. Everywhere you look,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/12/10/how-decentralized-identity-is-reshaping-privacy-for-digital-identities/?sh=3ce8374a3226">experts</a>&nbsp;agree it’s time to get on board with decentralized identity.</p>



 Decentralized identity finally gives people control over their personal data 



<p>Decentralized identity is essential because, finally, it gives people a way to&nbsp;control what personal information they share online. It’s the answer to the greatest challenge consumers and businesses face today. Consumers are sick of trading their personal information for access, and companies are burdened by having to collect, store and protect customer data and fulfil complex data compliance obligations across jurisdictions.</p>



 Decentralized identity drives&nbsp;a new digital identity that is universal, trustworthy, and respects privacy.&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralized identity puts the user in sole control of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;that forms their identity. It’s&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;because there’s no central authority or single issuing agent.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity allows a fully digital, universally accepted way of identifying ourselves online (e.g. to a web site or app) and in real life (e.g. at a bar or a border crossing) so:</p>



  We don’t have to use email or usernames and passwords to login, carry paper or plastic versions of our IDs, or give out our personal information to every organization we want to access.  No central authority (e.g. bank, airline, Instagram, Netflix) needs to collect and store our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal ID information</a>&nbsp;(e.g. name, DOB, SSN, address, phone number etc.) and abuse it or&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">risk losing it</a>.  We can take back control of our own IDs and personal information.  



<p>At the core of decentralized identity is the identity wallet and what’s known as verifiable credentials. The user stores their credentials and other personal information in their wallet, which is a digital app on their device. They don’t use a password for access; instead they have cryptographic keys which transparently authenticate who they are to businesses they want to interact with, and which secure their communications with those businesses.</p>



<p>The verifiable credentials are like digitally signed, digital ID documents. The digital ID documents establish trust, prove the user’s identity, and complete transactions. A trusted authority (e.g. the DMV) will sign the verifiable credential to prove its validity, and the user then stores and controls who sees their verifiable credential or part thereof, such as name, age, DOB, credit card numbers, employer, citizenship status and so on. When the user offers their verifiable credential to a business they want to interact with, that business verifies the credential to check the person is who they say they are. This signing by the initial authority and the checking by the verifying authority goes through the blockchain. Since the user is in total control of their ID information, you’ll hear DI referred to as self-sovereign identity.</p>



 Anonyome Labs is developing a wallet app and can help enterprise customers integrate the technology into their own apps.&nbsp; 







<p>So, what’s the takeaway message from experts on this new technology? This is the future and it’s time to act!&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Nasdaq&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/decentralized-identity-management-is-essential">author</a>&nbsp;puts it: “Thanks to advancements in technology like virtual reality headsets and mobile devices, we are at the cusp of the “fourth generation” of cyberspace – the cyberspace of our dreams (and nightmares). Alongside this technology refresh, we have an opportunity to a return to authenticity. As more people work, play, and hang out in virtual worlds, the digital identity management solutions of the past will no longer suffice. We’ll need new ways to ensure that identities are immutable and verifiable across the intersection of the virtual worlds of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">metaverse</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a>.”</p>



<p>We’re here for it. Talk to us today about how you can build&nbsp;digital products that let customers&nbsp;communicate privately&nbsp;and&nbsp;transact securely&nbsp;in an increasingly&nbsp;connected world.</p>

<p>With online gambling the preferred method for gaming in today’s society, both operators and players want to feel safe as the popularity of online betting continues to increase. However, with that comes certain responsibilities from both the operator and the player. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market">With 2022’s global online gambling market valued at $63.53 billion</a>, online casinos want to guarantee that their players are practicing responsible gaming through developing information solutions that support and assist gamblers, safeguard the authenticity of gambling activities, and prevent fraudulent activities, thus giving players the assurance of using a safe online gambling site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there might come reservations from both parties that their time and efforts must be sacrificed in order to practice safe gaming, but that’s quite the contrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What is responsible gaming and why does it matter?&nbsp; 



<p>Responsible gaming is all about prevention. Players want to enjoy themselves, but sometimes things can go too far, or individuals might take advantage of the system. Instead, responsible gaming is a concept that encompasses several policies and requirements which apply to gambling stakeholders. These policies and requirements make sure operators adhere to the highest standards of quality, while offering a safe user experience that protects people from the potential negative consequences of online gambling.</p>



<p>The creation and maintenance of a socially responsible gambling environment and the provision of tools to support gamblers with their gambling behavior lays at the core of the <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2022/02/Consumer-Protection-in-Online-Gambling-Regulation-Jan31-EGBA-Final.pdf">European Commision’s Recommendation</a> principles. Although it is up to the individual players to take advantage of the tools being offered, it is up to the Member States to ensure that appropriate tools that facilitate safer gambling practices are available. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, ”the Recommendation specifies that online gambling operators should be required to allow players to set their own financial and temporal limits, to offer time-outs, temporary breaks and long-term self-exclusion schemes, to provide gamblers with information regarding their playing and expenditure patterns, and to initiate engagement with any customers whose playing patterns give indication of the potential development of gambling problems.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, it is suggested that gambling websites should display links to relevant support helplines and other details of support organizations in order to ensure responsible gambling. Furthermore, Member States are urged to&nbsp;create national self-exclusion registers that would enable players to exclude themselves from all online gambling operators licensed in that jurisdiction and to ensure that all operators have access to such registers.&nbsp;Through this encouragement, the number of Member States that offer national self-exclusion registers has actually increased over the past three years&nbsp;to a total number of 16. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus,&nbsp;gambling operators have the opportunity to give their customers all the tools they need to practice responsible gambling. However, it isn’t only through self-exclusion and monitoring gambling behavior that this will be achieved. It&nbsp;also&nbsp;entails a few more aspects on the side of the stakeholder. Here is a list that operators should be aware of and implement in order to establish responsible gaming:&nbsp;</p>



  Protecting vulnerable gamblers with responsible gaming tools and self-exclusion lists&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">Preventing underage gambling</a>&nbsp;  Incorporating safety measures to fight criminal activities&nbsp;&nbsp;  Providing an information policy&nbsp;  Having an online payment protection&nbsp;  Maintaining a secure online environment&nbsp;  Complying with ethical and responsible marketing&nbsp;  



<p>The importance is therefore driven home through the above practices. Thus, companies in the online gambling sector who implement the above measures act as role models when it comes to this importance of responsible gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







 Underage Gambling and Fraud Prevention &nbsp; 



<p>Not only are vulnerable gamblers protected, as well as underage gamblers, but by having a safe online gambling site it allows the operator to fight criminal activities, which put not only the company in jeopardy, but also its players. With underage gambling becoming more popular, with <a href="https://www.roulettesites.org/blog/responsible-gambling/underage-gambling.php">nearly 40% of 11-16 year-olds wagering their own money</a> in the UK, this is one of the many reasons why countries such as Germany place heavy restrictions on online gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, in the case of criminal activities, fraud is a serious problem in many aspects of the online world, not excluding online gaming. This is particularly the case when big sports events occur and operators see an increase in user activity. <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2022/04/29/62427-digital-gambling-fraud-rate-grows-50--in-q1-industry-marks-secondhighest-increase">Just in the first quarter of 2022, the global online gambling fraud rate grew to 50%</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In consequence, safe online gambling sites are required to verify the identity of their players in order to prevent such cases, both fraud and underage gambling alike, from happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How ID Verification can assist in responsible gaming&nbsp; 



<p>When it comes to online gambling and identity verification, many companies and players are turned off by the requirements. However, this need not be the case. Businesses can incorporate responsible gaming while keeping player conversions, even during bigger sporting events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to such success is through a user-friendly verification process that also prohibits fraud. By providing such an experience, huge sporting events, such as EURO 2020, can become perfect examples and opportunities for operators to showcase what they are able to do for their players.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Planning for such events includes encouraging players to verify themselves before the event. Plus, by giving players options on how to identify themselves, as seen with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a> options provided by IDnow during the EURO 2020, it takes into consideration background checks that take place before the ID verification, and what browsers and devices might be used by the players to meet customer demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/nfc-technology-for-id-verification/">through the use of NFC</a>, operators are able to quickly scan an NFC document which requires less human intervention, thus improving gross margins for the company and more convenience for the end-users. And not only that, it provides a higher level of security for the company through the reading of the chip, with more regulators accepting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This in turn uncovers a new wave of sophisticated crime that is only detected through ID verification. For example, during the EURO 2020, IDnow discovered that fraudsters were utilizing very well forged ID cards. The visual security features, like holograms and watermarks, were forged to perfection. And when an ID document is forged to perfection, it requires verification solutions that look beyond visual security features, like with NFC. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the end, ID verification is a win-win for both the gaming operators and sports fans alike by providing high levels of security for the company and a fast and convenient onboarding process for customers. In fact, <a href="https://www.transunion.co.uk/blog/2021-igaming-fraud-report">83% of operators believe smooth digital transactions have become essential to business survival</a>. Trust is consequently forged between the operator and its players.&nbsp;</p>



 







 



 Preparing for the FIFA Qatar World Cup&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>With EURO 2020 having experienced high viewing figures as well as skyrocketing bets, the 2022 FIFA World Cup should be no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As was the case with the EURO 2020, operators need to be aware of increased activity and potential fraud with the prospective of increased player verifications. In order to handle such spikes in big sporting events, operators need to provide a streamlined onboarding process for players in order to smooth out the user experience and catch potential fraud risks. Focusing on fraud is vital during these busy periods because with the increase of players, comes the increase of underage gamblers and fraudsters alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking back at the 2018 World Cup, <a href="https://www.casino.org/news/2018-world-cup-generated-e136-billion-in-bets-worldwide-fifa-says/">which saw an estimated €136 Billion in bets</a>, it should come as no surprise that 2022’s World Cup will be any different. The UK saw a 50% increase in betting from the 2014 to 2018 World Cup, and an average match in 2018 saw a betting turnover of €2.1 billion. With online betting rising in popularity, operators can expect rising numbers in player verifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By having a trusted digital identity verification partner, that has experience with player spikes and fraud attempts during big sporting events, online gambling operators can have full confidence in preventing such cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in order to prepare ahead of time, operators should encourage users to register early, just like with EURO 2020, providing their players with a more pleasant experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, with the FIFA World Cup taking place in Qatar, it is important to keep in mind that gambling is strictly prohibited in the country, but online gambling is still allowed since operators are based outside of the country. This may also have an effect on the increase of online betting, due to gambling being illegal in the hosting country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, this year’s World Cup is taking place during the winter months, instead of the summer months. Despite this change in schedule, gambling operators can still expect large numbers in players, since most people will already be indoors. Gambling online becomes even more comfortable during the winter months. </p>



<p>Plus, the Premier League season is set to start at the beginning of August and end right before the World Cup. It then picks up again right after the World Cup ends. For players, fans, and operators in the UK, it’s a continuous stretch of football mania.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Leveraging IDV and KYC for Big Sports events &nbsp; 



<p>With the FIFA World Cup on the horizon, this provides a huge opportunity for gambling operators to prepare for the incoming wave. The key to this preparation is leveraging identity verification platforms, such as IDnow, and implementing robust KYC processes that don’t harm the player onboarding experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By leveraging such solutions as IDnow’s AutoIdent and VideoIdent, which use artificial intelligence to check security features on ID documents and have the potential to cover more than 7 billion customers from 195 different countries, you can be sure that the identity and age of your customers is verified. </p>



<p>Our solutions are focused around security and uncomplicated application for the customer, making the process as simple as following on-screen prompts and completing verification within minutes, boasting a conversion rate of 90%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This makes big sporting events such as the upcoming FIFA World Cup, not only attractive for gaming operators, but also for their customers. Security is not sacrificed when it comes to customer onboarding, but rather enhanced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">IDnow platform</a> covers a wide range of use cases both in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">regulated sectors in Europe</a>, as well as for entirely new digital business models worldwide and allows the identity flow to adapt to different, regional, legal, and business requirements on a per use case basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through leveraging such robust KYC processes, like those at IDnow, online gaming operators can rest assured that responsible gaming is taken seriously at IDnow through the use of our identity verification solutions. You can trust the IDnow team and their experience to fulfill all of the key factors and excel as a gaming identity verification partner.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In the face of today's uncertain world events, cybersecurity has never been more critical. With growing sophistication, cybercrime aimed at gathering consumer information continues to escalate at unprecedented levels.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/2022-consumer-identity-breach-report">ForgeRock 2022 Consumer Identity Breach Report</a> highlights that 2 billion data records containing usernames and passwords were compromised in 2021, a 35% increase over 2020<a>1</a>. And, in just the first quarter of 2022 alone, it is estimated that more than 75 million records were breached.<a>2</a>, This includes the following cases:</p>

  Hackers breached systems belonging to the International Committee of the Red Cross. They gained access to data that exceeds 500,000 people and disrupted the organization's services around the world<a>3</a>. 
	
	 A security breach at the Washington State Department of Licensing affected at least 650,000 professionals. Authorities believe Social Security numbers and some personal data were compromised<a>4</a>. 
	
	 Crypto.com incurred a breach that targeted nearly 500 people's cryptocurrency wallets. The thieves circumvented the site's two-factor authentication and stole $18 million of Bitcoin and $15 million of Ethereum. Crypto.com said it plans to move away from two-factor authentication to true multi-factor authentication<a>5</a>, <a>6</a>. 
	
	 A breach at FlexBooker, an appointment management business, affected approximately 3 million users. Confidential data, including personally identifiable information (PII), drivers license data, and passwords, was stolen by hackers and then offered for sale on popular cybercrime message boards<a>7</a>. 
 <p>Fraud is also on the rise and is extremely costly. According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission data, "[U.S.] consumers reported losing more than $5.8 billion to fraud in 2021, an increase of more than 70 percent over the previous year<a>8</a>." In the United Kingdom, the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) reports that between November 2020 and 2021, residents and businesses were victims of approximately 40,586 cases of fraud and cybercrime per month, totalling £2.5 billion<a>9</a>.</p>

<p>Statistics like these have cybersecurity professionals asking "What is our weakest security link?" and, "How can I best protect our customers and my organization?"</p>

 Traditional Digital Identity Is the Weakest Cybersecurity Link 

<p>In an effort to mitigate costs, many organizations have tried modifying their current employee identity and access management (IAM) systems to meet trends and demands rather than invest in a purpose-built, enterprise-grade customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution. Unfortunately, these retooled traditional digital identity systems are failing to protect consumers against the sophistication of cybercriminals and fraudsters.</p>

<p>For example, Experian states: "Our research shows that companies earning consumer trust leverage automated solutions to identify and protect customers across their online journey…" Yet, legacy IAM uses static rules to make decisions. For instance, it was not designed to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to analyze and adjust access based on risk signals or a user's behavior. Nor was it built to scale and manage billions of consumer and internet of things (IoT) identities, and thousands of concurrent sessions without incident.</p>

<p>The consequences of organizations continuing to use traditional IAM has resulted in digital identity emerging as the weakest cybersecurity link.</p>

<p>A survey of 488 IT and cybersecurity leaders by Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) shows that 45% of organizations have suffered a breach due to identity-related threats<a>10</a>. This is largely due to the fact that, for the fourth consecutive year, unauthorized access is the leading gateway for criminals to enter an organization. As detailed in the ForgeRock 2022 Consumer Identity Breach Report, unauthorized access accounted for 50% of all records breached — up from 45% in 2020.</p>

 Enterprise CIAM Is Purpose-Built to Protect Your Consumers Against Today's Cybercrime 

<p>When it comes to implementing cybersecurity that protects your consumers and your organization, it is time to be proactive.</p>

<p>The good news is that modernizing your digital identity infrastructure with enterprise-grade CIAM results in greater security for your consumers and your organization. It also improves experiences and reduces your overall costs. For example, a Forrester Consulting <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-total-economic-impact">Total Economic Impact™ study</a> of ForgeRock CIAM showed a 40% reduction in security-related call center volume, resulting in a benefit of $24 million.</p>

<p>How are such benefits achieved? Enterprise-grade CIAM includes modern capabilities such as passwordless and multi-factor authentication (MFA), AI-powered user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), and secure impersonation (a best practice for help desk and call center security). These and much more help you support a Zero Trust security model that significantly mitigates risk and reduces the cost of fraud. In fact, thanks to ForgeRock, a large global financial services organization reduced credit card fraud by 67%.</p>

<p>With a purpose-built CIAM platform at the ready, the security risks caused by your legacy digital identity systems can quickly be a thing of the past.</p>

 Overview concepts 

<p>This section quickly covers a few key concepts.</p>

 Org URL 

<p>When you’re starting out with Okta, you’re provided an Org URL. This is what you’ll use to set up all of your applications. Think of it as a reference ID that lets Okta figure out who you are and which projects are yours. If you want to learn more about the complexities of the Org URL (it has many more features than what we’ve just described and it’s possible to have more than one depending on your needs), you can read about it here: <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/okta-organizations/#org-features">Org URL features</a>.</p>

 Tokens, client ID, and client secret 

<p>You’re also provided some information for authentication. It can get a bit confusing as there are tokens, client IDs, and client secrets. You need to use all three for the Okta application we’re working on today. Let’s quickly go over what each thing does for you.</p>
 
   Tokens - these are like an API key. You’re going to provide the token so that you can authenticate with the API. You use this for every request and it contains details about what you can and can’t access. Tokens are presented to you only once, and never shown again. However, if you forget your token but you authenticate with the CLI, you can retrieve it. We’ll go over that in a bit. 
   Client ID - this is a way to say which application you’re working with. 
   Client secret - a password that goes with your client ID and gives you permission to access a particular application. 
 

<p>Not every project needs all three of these things. You will generally need a token, you may not always need the other items. Sometimes you may require additional credentials when integrating with third party applications.</p>

 Configure the Okta CLI 

<p>Let’s get the Okta CLI installed. Okta has a great <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">resource page</a> about the CLI and it contains installation instructions. We’re going to do ours slightly differently from the instructions, so be sure to follow the steps here.</p>

 
   Install the CLI with the provided command:
       <code>brew install –cask oktadeveloper/tap/okta
</code>       
   
   Check and see if the CLI is accessible by trying out a command. If everything’s working you’ll see some information about how to use the CLI presented.
       <code>okta –help
</code>       
   
   Next, we need to log in. We already have our Okta developer account, so in the Terminal, type:
       <code>okta login
</code>       
   
   
    <p>Now we want to provide the credentials we are asked for. When asked for your organization, this is the URL that appears in your developer account in the upper right corner. Type out the entire URL, if the format is different the CLI will make you enter it again. You’ll also need an API token. In your developer dashboard, from the choices on the left, click Security and choose API.</p>
   
   
    <p>On the API screen you can see your organization URL(s) and a tab called Tokens. Click the Tokens tab.</p>
   
   
    <p>On the Token page, you can manage and see all the tokens you’ve created. You can’t see the token’s value after creating it, so save the token information somewhere secure. Click Create Token.</p>
   
   Follow the Create Token wizard to make your new token, and save the value to put in the CLI when prompted for credentials. 
 

<p>After you’ve done this, you will have a developer account associated with the CLI. If you want to change it you can wipe the file and log in with a different Org URL and credentials. For now, let’s leave it set up.</p>

 Configure the project 

<p>If you download the CLI, you can type <code>okta start flask</code> and follow the provided instructions to get the project set up. The <a href="https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-flask-sample">GitHub repository</a> will be downloaded for you and the environment variables will be configured in the <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>

<p>NOTE: You need to enter the URIs you want to use to redirect. In the CLI these are referred to as Redirect URIs. In your developer dashboard, they’re called Sign-in redirect URIs. For this walkthrough, we’ll use: <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code>. You can use other localhost ports, just be sure to write out the link with the <code>/authorization-code/callback</code> added at the end. You also need to add your Post Logout Redirect URIs. In the developer dashboard, these are called Sign-out redirect URIs. Since we used localhost:3000, the URI will be: <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>.</p>

 Create an application (optional) 

<p>This section goes over how you can create an Okta application yourself instead of having it automatically configured for you. You might want to learn this process for other projects, or if something goes wrong when you configure the CLI and set up the project. There’s a variety of ways to do this, since we’re using the CLI let’s create an application there.</p>

<p>NOTE: The CLI doesn’t allow you to make all kinds of applications, only some, so it is important to learn to create apps in the developer dashboard too.</p>

 
   In the terminal type:
       <code>okta apps create
</code>       
   
   
    <p>You’re prompted to name your new application. Name it.</p>
   
   
    <p>Next you’re asked what kind of application you want to make. We are making a web application, so choose 1.</p>
   
   
    <p>For framework, choose 1.</p>
   
   
    <p>You need to enter the URIs you want to use to redirect. In the CLI these are referred to as Redirect URIs. In your developer dashboard, they’re called Sign-in redirect URIs. For this walkthrough, we’ll use: <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code>. You can use other localhost ports, just be sure to write out the link with the <code>/authorization-code/callback</code> added at the end.</p>
   
   You also need to add your Post Logout Redirect URIs. In the developer dashboard, these are called Sign-out redirect URIs. Since we used localhost:3000, the URI will be: <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. 
 

 Run the project 

<p>You can run the project now. Type:</p>

   <code>python3 -m flask run --port=3000
</code>   

<p>And try walking through hosted authentication with Okta! If all goes well, you’ll see this screen to start with:</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you click the Login button, you’re then taken to a form where you can enter your email and password:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will know you’ve successfully logged in when you see a screen displaying some information about your profile:</p>

<p></p>

 Troubleshooting - Help, it’s not working! 

<p>Never fear, the troubleshooting section is here to help you figure out what’s going wrong with your application. Look for the item that matches your problem and read on to learn how to fix it.</p>

 It says I’m not authorized to view localhost:5000 

<p>If your Mac runs Monterey or later, it uses port 5000 for the AirPlay Receiver. If you have access to the Sharing folder on your computer, you may be able to shut it off and run the application at that point. If you want to try that, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-off-airplay">follow these instructions</a> to turn off the AirPlay Receiver.</p>

<p>You should then be able to use <code>localhost:5000</code> again.</p>

 I tried everything and I still can’t view localhost:5000 

<p>If you cannot access the Sharing folder on your Mac due to permissions, or you tried shutting off AirPlay Receiver and it still isn’t letting you see <code>localhost:5000</code>, then change the project to use <code>localhost:3000</code>. You’ll need to do these things for that to work:</p>

 
   In your copy of the project, navigate to app.py. Change:
       <code>app.run(host="localhost", port=5000, debug=True)
</code>       
    <p>To:</p>
       <code>app.run(host="localhost", port=3000, debug=True)
</code>       
   
   
    <p>In app.py, go to where it says # get request params and in the json for query_params change the redirect_uri from <code>http://localhost:5000/authorization-code/callback</code> to <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code>.</p>
   
   
    <p>Log in as an administrator to your Okta developer account. Your login URL for this will be your Organization URL, with a tweak to show you’re logging in as the administrator. The URL takes the form of <code>https://dev-assignednumber-admin.okta.com</code>.</p>
   
   
    <p>From the left panel, choose Applications.</p>
   
   
    <p>Click on the application you are using for the sample.</p>
   
   At the top of the General Settings section, click Edit. Then scroll down to the Login section. For Sign-in redirect URIs make sure it says <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code>. For Sign-out redirect URIs make sure it says <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. 
 

<p>That should solve the issue.</p>

 My application says I can’t authenticate 

<p>Sometimes, the <code>.okta.env</code> file does not populate with the information you need. If this is the case, you will need to navigate to your developer dashboard and grab the information manually from your application. To do that, take the following steps:</p>

 
   
    <p>Log in to your dashboard.</p>
   
   
    <p>From the left panel, click Applications.</p>
   
   
    <p>Choose your application. If you used the CLI to create the app as instructed, it should be called okta-flask-sample.</p>
   
   
    <p>Get the Client ID and the Client Secret. These map respectively to CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET in your <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>
   
   
    <p>If you need your Organization URL, that’s up in the right corner of your dashboard under your email address. Grab that URL and put it in the <code>.okta.env</code> file for ORG_URL.</p>
   
 

 I have the wrong credentials in the Okta CLI 

<p>If there’s something wrong with your credentials in the Okta CLI, you can try changing them in the Okta CLI. If that doesn’t work, you might need to delete your <code>okta.yaml</code> file. It’s in a hidden directory. This file is added by the CLI, and it’s usually at <code>Users/yourname/.okta/okta.yaml</code>. Delete the entire folder and try what you were doing again with the CLI.</p>

 I forgot my API token, do I HAVE to make a new one? 

<p>If you configured your CLI correctly, you can actually retrieve your API token! The CLI stores this in a yaml file that’s hidden in the <code>.okta</code> folder. Navigate to <code>Users/yourname/.okta/okta.yaml</code>. Copy the token from there.</p>

 Brainstem leverages wearable devices to collect medical-grade data, provide analytics and allow users to monetise their&nbsp;data <p>Ocean Shipyard, the $2M grants program to fund entrepreneurs looking to build open-source Web3 solutions on Ocean, is introducing a new grantee for 2022: Brainstem Digital Health. With the goal to facilitate access to large quantities of data collected by consumer wearable devices, Brainstem has the potential to revolutionise the provision of healthcare and promote research that will lead to new discoveries which will improve health and wellbeing.</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/j6FKyTFZQJ">Brainstem Digital Health</a> provides a scalable, decentralised platform for collecting medical grade data through wearable devices, including heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, and SpO2 through inexpensive wearable devices. Its users will benefit from data analytics and monetisation opportunities via Ocean Protocol.</p><blockquote>Sheridan Johns, Ecosystem &amp; Partnerships, said:</blockquote><blockquote>“Aggregating vital health data collected by consumer wearables promise to unlock considerable value across the entire healthcare value chain. What’s so exciting about Brainstem’s decentralized approach using Ocean, is that much of the value that Brainstem aims to unlock will be shared directly with individuals who contribute their&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><blockquote>Max Campbell, Founder of Brainstem Digital Health,&nbsp;said:</blockquote><blockquote>“The Brainstem ecosystem is building the next generation of wearable health insights through the creation of the largest and highest quality wearable health data set available for all to leverage. We seek to redefine the way in which users interact with wearable technology so that as opposed to being a part of the product, you own the end&nbsp;product”</blockquote><p>In addition to a unique set of monitoring and therapeutic features within the Brainstem application, users will be able to publish their own data to an Ocean Protocol-powered data union in collaboration with DataUnion.app. Subscribers, including but not limited to medical researchers will, for example, be able to access data using Compute-to-Data methods that support AI modelling.</p><p>Brainstem will promote the alignment of incentives that are needed for open data collaboration. This will be done through a Data Union that will enable data providers to publish their data in an anonymised, GDPR-compliant manner and receive both economic and social rewards, which will incentivise the growth of the ecosystem. Open APIs coupled with the recycling of network revenues through a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) will help drive additional 3rd party software and hardware integrations, which we hope will drive a virtuous cycle of insight generation that will promote research and yield new discoveries.</p><p>Thanks to a $30,000 $OCEAN grant by Ocean Shipyard, Brainstem will have the initial resources to commit to transparent and clear deliverables:</p><p>By the beginning of October 2022, Brainstem will create the data union backend and have it integrated within their App for data collection, along with the Compute-to-Data functionality. They will also have their datatoken and the necessary Ethereum integration for wallet authentication and rewards distribution.</p><p>Brainstem aims to complete testing of the end-to-end application, from running algorithms via compute-to-data on the dataset to supplying data and claiming rewards for it, by the first week of November&nbsp;2022.</p><p>If you are a passionate individual or team looking to build something valuable on Ocean Protocol, this is your best chance to kickstart your dream project and be a pioneer of the new data economy.

<p>Two of the leading identity technologies go head to head in our post: Okta and Auth0. Which one is better for your business? Keep reading to find out.</p>
<p>Does Okta now own Auth0? Yes, Auth0 is now owned by Okta, but they are still two separate technologies that will continue to work towards bettering the identity industry.</p>
 What Is Identity as a Service? 
<p>In a long line of products that have moved to service models in the past decade, identity as a service (IDaaS) provides cloud-based subscription models for <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-management-identity-management/">identity management</a> (IdM) purposes. Like other subscription models, such as software as a service, infrastructure as a service, or platform as a service, IDaaS gives organizations a way to implement identity management in their systems without having to field on-premise solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IDaaS allows third-party vendors to manage identities and associated features for clients from a centralized cloud environment. This includes critical features of an IdM service such as the following:</p>
 
 Identity Governance and Administration: Somewhat similar to identity and access management (IAM), IGA helps administrators control aspects of identity like integrity, compliance, user permissions, and privileges. An IDaaS will have technologies in place to control elements of IdM that pertain to these topics.&nbsp; 
 Authentication and Access: The bread and butter of IDaaS, a platform will almost always provide methods for user authentication, user authorization (based on IGA policies), support for identity federation and SSO through SAML or OAuth (or other protocols) and, ideally, integration with multi-factor authentication features like biometrics. 
 Audits and Monitoring: This category includes the ability to log user events, including login and access events, and generate compliance-ready reports.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>IDaaS, like other services, has moved from on premises to cloud implementation specifically because of the benefits that come with a cloud approach. These benefits include the following:</p>
 
 Centralized Security and Compliance: With cloud implementations of IdM, vendors can take control of security and compliance for their clients. This means that those clients do not have to worry about managing their security (and all the hard work and expertise that entails). Likewise, compliant IdM systems can be used to help companies maintain their own compliance without sacrificing usability.&nbsp; 
 Cost: From financial costs to work hours and system upgrades, IDaaS outsources these unfortunate but necessary costs to a vendor, who then distributes them across a client base. That means scalable and inexpensive services. 
 Integration: Part of an enterprise IDaaS is interoperability, and as such, these systems will almost always include single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication , role-based permission controls, and more features to federate identity management and provide streamlined access across multiple platforms.&nbsp; 
 
 Who Are Okta and Auth0? 
 Okta 
<p>Founded in 2009, Okta is a major player in IAM services offered through SAML but expanded into integrations with OAuth 2.0, OpenID, and Kerberos. Started by two former Salesforce employees, the company went public in 2017 and was given a total initial valuation of $1.2 billion in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their stated goal is to offer secure authentication and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-solution/">identity solutions</a> to protect user information in enterprise contexts. It provides streamlined authentication services that connect multiple services across a business without adding extra responsibility to end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, Okta offers several services:</p>
 
 Single Sign-On (SSO) 
 Universal Directory 
 Advanced Server Access, API Access Management 
 Authentication 
 User Management 
 Business-to-Business (B2B) Integration 
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
 Lifecycle Management 
 Access Gateway 
 Workflows 
 
<p>While Okta has been in the IdM and IDaaS market for over a decade, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 and shift to remote working has boosted the potential business market for the company. More enterprise organizations turn to Okta and competitors to secure their IAM systems.&nbsp;</p>
 Auth0 
<p>Auth0, in a similar vein, focused on authentication and authorization for back-end user management for applications. Auth0 had already developed several integrations with platforms that would make onboarding users easy. It offered many of the same features that Okta does, and the two companies were considered direct competitors in the IAM and IDaaS markets.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Differences Between the Two? 
<p>Concretely, Okta provides IDaaS services while Auth0 serves as an authentication platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okta is a large and well-known brand. They speak to large enterprise customers, providing comprehensive solutions that speak to business and logistic leaders in an organization. Okta is better known for user-friendly applications and modular component development geared towards business customers. Okta covers SSO through the cloud and can work with third-party platforms like Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auth0, on the other hand, is geared towards low-level application programmers managing authentication. Auth0 helps programmers create apps to link their code (no matter the language) to authentication APIs to facilitate authentication and identity management internally in the program. It doesn’t support enterprise features like identity management, onboarding, or automation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither is better per se, but in terms of making decisions about what to purchase, the general consensus is that Okta is better for broad business applications and Auth0 for development purposes.&nbsp;</p>
 Why Did Okta Acquire Auth0? 
<p>Many observers raised questions when Okta acquired Auth0 in 2021 for $6.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some observers suggest that the buyout was inevitable. Not only would it help Okta consolidate its hold on market share, but it would also allow them to better control product pricing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, acquiring Auth0 kept other companies from making the same move. Salesforce, for example, had recently acquired Slack and MuleSoft to round out its CRM and productivity suite. The addition of a robust and established IDaaS could drive even more business to a holistic Salesforce platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, the two products are complimentary. Both offer IDaaS, although Auth0 seemed to focus more on back-end integrations, whereas Okta focused more on enterprise front-end integration. Combining the two will position Okta to build product integrations and IdM across both ends of the spectrum for a comprehensive identity management solution.&nbsp;</p>
 Why Should You Choose 1Kosmos BlockID? 
<p>The IDaaS and IAM markets are growing. It signals an increasingly centralized provider market through which users and organizations will have to manage their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1Kosmos wants to push back against this trend. We believe that ownership of identity and a focus on customer onboarding can happen without ignoring the features that Okta or Auth0 provide. Our BlockID platform offers passwordless solutions on a private, distributed blockchain ledger (something Okta does not do) to place ownership of identity in the hands of users. Furthermore, BlockID comes with several advanced features that you won’t find together on the same platform. These features include the following:</p>
 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification.<br>
 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user.&nbsp;

<p>As long as identity verification mechanisms exist, fraudsters will always find ways to circumvent these barriers. Among those techniques is facial spoofing (also known as face spoofing attacks), in which a fraudster tries to bypass a facial recognition system into misidentifying him by presenting a fake face (e.g. photograph, 3D-rendered models, 3D-printed mask) to the camera. Scammers can also use AI-assisted methods like deepfakes, presenting the biggest challenges for face recognition solution providers.</p>



<p>To protect against such threats, face spoofing detection systems such as liveness checks have evolved to mitigate emerging risks. For example, looking at the texture of the face, the density of features, and the relationship between features can all help to determine whether a face is real or not. Such technologies allow operators to gain time during the onboarding process by having a higher confidence in the true identity of their users.</p>



<p>As businesses in the EU and beyond continue to digitize and shift their customer identification methods towards remote <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-institution-kyc-process-running/">KYC processes</a>, anti-spoofing as part of facial recognition plays a crucial part in the KYC mix.</p>



<p>Let’s take two graphic examples to illustrate how big facial recognition is going to be:</p>



  More and more services involved in customer-facing activities such as finance operators, iGaming websites or public entities, have started using facial recognition systems to verify their users’ identities.  By 2023, <a href="https://www.reservations.com/blog/resources/facial-recognition-airports-survey/">97% of airports plan to roll out facial recognition technology</a>. In the U.S., 100% of the top 20 airports use facial recognition to identify international passengers, including U.S. citizens;  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/09/19/the-future-of-biometric-facial-recognition/#7d246fc73c74">And by 2025, </a>72% of hotel operators may use facial recognition systems to interact with their guests.  



<p>Unfortunately, the widespread use of facial recognition and the fact that sensitive businesses rely more and more on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/biometrics/">face biometrics</a> for customer authentication led to a further increase in facial fraud attacks involving sophisticated techniques.</p>



<p>It is therefore even more important to understand how fraudsters operate, what methods they use, and how sophisticated and multi-layered KYC processes can minimize facial fraud.</p>



 Facial Verification methods under heavy fraud attacks 



<p>As a human paradigm, protection mechanisms are always meant to be broken.</p>



<p>As such, fraudsters are now looking at ways to walk-through facial identification systems by spoofing other people’s faces. For the time being, one must admit that they are talented and creative. Between static 2D or 3D attacks, deepfakes or AI-aided attacks, facial verification mechanisms are under heavy fire.</p>



<p>However, identification service operators also started to develop counter-measures. This cat-and-mouse game led to growing research work on machine learning techniques to solve anti-spoofing and liveness checks.</p>



 What are the most common facial recognition spoofing methods? 



<p>There can be various approaches for fraudsters looking to trick identity verification systems such as:</p>



  Accessing buildings equipped with facial identification systems, hence potentially stealing sensitive corporate information located in those premises;  Creating synthetic identities to register onto a service and commit other frauds (insurance scams, iGaming fraud, etc…);  Impersonating someone’s identity (impersonation attacks);  Avoiding screening and KYC checks or more generally, avoid being recognized by the system (obfuscation attacks)  



<p>In some cases, we observed some sort of collaboration between the “victim” and the “attacker”. Thus, while being live checked, the owner of the account who did not originate the face recognition sequence let the person through.</p>



<p>In order to get past facial recognition mechanisms, scammers will use face spoofing, also called presentation attacks, which can be conducted in two ways:</p>



  Static 2D: Attackers will use any two-dimensional objects with a flat surface, like a photo or a mask, to try to impersonate a genuine user. Although the static 2D method is the most commonly used, it is also the less sophisticated, even if it is proving on a daily basis its efficiency against low-grade systems. Moreover, some found a way to mimic live movements through a sequence of pictures displayed through smartphones or tablets, and added another layer of sophistication to this attack;  Static 3D: Attacks using 3D props such as 3D-printed masks, facial reproduction, or sculptures also found out how to tackle anti-spoofing mechanisms appealing to liveness detection of data points. Yet, there are simpler methods than others. For example, the simplest method would be to print a photograph of someone, then apply it to a deformable structure. On the other hand, the most sophisticated way would be to conduct a 3D capture of someone’s face to guarantee the highest level of details and 3D acquisition. However, rest assured that such methods request specific equipment and are very hard to setup on the fly.  



<p>In both cases, fraudsters conducting these attacks will most often use biometric publicly available data such as pictures from social networks. As people now share their pictures online more easily, fraudsters can now easily collect samples to initiate presentation attacks. In some cases, biometric data is illegally acquired on specific marketplaces.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, anti-spoofing mechanisms exist and can deter most of these attacks.</p>



 What mechanisms exist to tackle facial spoofing? 



<p>While spoofers deploy massive efforts to get past facial identification systems, service providers also developed an array of methods to identify presentation attacks.</p>



<p>The basic solution to detect these attacks is to compare the face of the user against the identity document he’s submitting. However, this mechanism can be easily spoofed and more sophisticated solutions are needed.</p>



<p>Thus, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">liveness detection</a> provides better results to detect fraudsters. Liveness detection is the computer’s ability to determine if he is interacting with a physical person, or any other prop/video or photo presentation.</p>



<p>Two main domains can be drawn from liveness detection:</p>



  Motion: motion-based methods are traditional ways to easily detect static face presentation attacks, and one of the most common methods to deter dynamic attacks.  



<p>They are divided into two sub-categories:</p>



<p>a. Non-intrusive: One efficient anti-spoofing technique is to detect any specific physiological sign of life from the person submitting his identity. Whether it is eye-blinking detection, facial expression changes or mouth movements, those elements provide good results, especially against static attacks;</p>



<p>b. Intrusive-interactive: A simple liveness detection method is to also ask the user to perform an action and to verify if it has been done in a natural way that resembles a human pattern. This method is based on the challenge-response mechanism, and is efficient against both static and dynamic attacks.</p>



<p>2. RPPg(PhotoPlethysmoGraphy): This methodology differs from motion-based methods, as it will not look for facial movement or expression but intensity changes in the facial skin, characteristic of pulsation in blood vessels. This method can determine blood flow only using RGB images from a distance. It can deter most attacks, although one reported weakness would be high-quality video replay attacks, because of their ability to capture periodic variation of a face’s skin light absorption.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, some of the liveness checks are not bulletproof, as security researchers depicted. Weaknesses have been observed during liveness detection checks, while fraudsters used high resolution monitors to present videos to low resolution cameras and fooled the identification mechanism. Therefore, it is important to carefully select a vendor complying to the highest security standards in the market.</p>



<p>With that in mind, more complex and robust methods reinforce the anti-spoofing toolbox.</p>



<p>LBP-GPM (Local Binary Pattern-Gradient Boosting Machine) and LBP-SVM (Support Vector Machine) methods can work through complex algorithms, luminance and chrominance information in order to compare two inputs. The LBP visual descriptor can also used with SVM as a classifier for quality measurement to discern between live and spoof.</p>



<p>Other mechanisms based on <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/anti-spoofing-mechanisms-in-face-recognition-based-on-dnn-586011ccc416">Deep Neural Network (DNN) models</a>, involve neural networks and several neural layers to process an image, and determine if it’s real or fake.<br><br>In recent studies, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01562.pdf">researchers started exploring video-based transformers</a> (type of DNN) for face presentation attack detection, and showed promising results. Although most approaches are binary, recent research tends to look for spoof traces by quantitatively evaluating them and reconstructing live faces. Moreover, newest trends are not focused towards presentation attacks, but are now leaning towards machine learning technologies such as Neural Architecture Search, few/zero-shot learning or domain adaptation.</p>



 How do fraudsters try to fool the most robust recognition technologies? 



<p>If you have not heard about deepfakes, now is as good a time as any. Deepfakes have become increasingly publicized as concerns have conversely grown over their usage to create fake news. Deepfakes often refer to videos where a celebrity’s face is swapped onto someone else’s body.</p>



<p>They are now making their way into the identification game thanks to the progress of machine learning and availability of large-scale face databases. Identification service providers are having a hard time developing countermeasures against deepfakes, given their fast-paced evolution and sophistication level growing each day.</p>



<p>However, most actors from the identification services ecosystem are working and developing solutions to better detect deepfakes. Whether it is through ground-breaking methods like the one from the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-michigan-state-develop-deepfake-detection-technique-11623859200?mod=article_inline">Facebook-Michigan State team</a>, or through comprehensive frameworks composed of different security layers, technologies and modules, it’s always possible to prevent  deepfakes.</p>



 Why biometrics solutions should be certified via FIDO 



<p>When testing against facial recognition systems, two main protocols are commonly selected: ISO 30107 or FIDO.</p>



<p>While both are international recognized security standards, they do not conduct security testing in the same fashion. While ISO compliance testing follows a liveness-only and a full-system mode aiming at evaluating the biometric system in different settings and against different presentation attack instruments, FIDO testing aims to test systems in laboratory settings, but also against mass population in real world conditions.</p>



<p>In addition, testing through ISO standards do not offer a set of metrics that would allow to obtain a “certification”, in contrast to the FIDO Alliance Biometric Component Certification. The latter presents 15 subjects to the system tested, 14 types of attack, and a total of 2100 presentations.</p>

 Acentrik, a decentralized data marketplace for enterprises, built on Ocean Protocol — is now in Enterprise Release <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol,</a> the Web3 platform to unlock data services for AI and business innovation, has joined forces with <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a>, the decentralized data marketplace by Mercedes-Benz, on its recently launched Enterprise Release. Acentrik is a fork of Ocean Market and makes use of the OceanONDA V4 smart contracts and libraries. As part of the collaboration, the most important Ocean features have been leveraged and integrated into Acentrik V1.0 as well as key adaptations for enterprise users.</p><p>Acentrik’s collaboration with Ocean Protocol began in 2020, with a proof of concept exploring decentralized data orchestration for Mercedes-Benz. The pilot project was successful and this led to further collaboration and development of Acentrik Version&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>Ocean founder, Bruce&nbsp;Pon:</p><blockquote>“Acentrik is the result of two years of collaboration to help launch an enterprise data marketplace built on Ocean technology. We look forward to continuing to support Mercedes-Benz as they take ambitious steps to lead the pack and kickstart a Data Economy”.</blockquote><p>Srikanth Kaja, General Manager of Emerging Technologies at Daimler South East&nbsp;Asia:</p><blockquote>“Acentrik and Ocean have come a long way together — both teams have fostered a dynamic working relationship, which contributed to this successful collaboration. I’m excited to see what is in store in the near future, as we drive further topics to bring a much-needed decentralized data marketplace to enterprises today.”</blockquote><p>Built on the foundation of Ocean’s state-of-the-art technology, Acentrik’s mission is to make it easier for enterprises to unlock the value of decentralized data and enable greater data sharing in the community with the principle of data sovereignty at the core. The focus will be on developing two strong use&nbsp;cases:</p><p>1. To enable companies to buy and sell data over the blockchain</p><p>2. To enable companies to monetize data in a privacy-preserving manner.</p><p>With Acentrik’s V1.0, enterprises can now publish datasets with parameters. By setting such API parameters, they can ensure more specific data is fetched from the endpoint. This allows for greater flexibility in publishing a dataset with Acentrik and setting boundaries accordingly — made possible by Ocean’s smart contracts, Compute-to-Data functionality and fine-grained permissions to better define access&nbsp;control.</p><p>Let’s dive into each of&nbsp;them.</p> Compute-to-Data <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Compute-to-Data</a> is a core feature of the Ocean toolset that enables Acentrik to meet the needs of enterprises interested in sharing and monetising their data on its marketplace. Enterprises want their IP to be protected, Compute-to-Data allows this by generating a secure environment for data to be analyzed — algorithms can run on the data without the raw data being exposed. This feature resolves the tradeoff between using private data and the risks of exposing it whilst creating new revenue streams. By running privacy-preserving compute jobs, enterprises can benefit from data transformation across industries, with data sovereignty intact in the Acentrik marketplace.</p> Fine-Grained Permissions <p>A large part of Ocean is about access control, of the decentralized variety. Enterprises and other users often need more precise ways to specify and manage access and to address that, Ocean introduced <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/fine-grained-permissions">fine-grained permissions</a>. Acentrik leverages this feature on two main levels to establish a secure access control setup for enterprise-grade use cases on its marketplace:</p><p>1. Marketplace level restriction using role-based access controls — enterprises are empowered to grant different roles to multiple users belonging to the same enterprise to manage their assets well. There are three defined roles — user, provider and consumer. Roles are attached to both the user profile and the wallet connected. Depending on the preference of the enterprise administrator, a user can be granted multiple roles to satisfy their enterprise’s objectives.</p><p>2. Asset level restrictions using allow and deny lists — enterprises can manage access controls for each asset published. Data owners have the flexibility to allow or deny access to their assets through their email domain and wallet&nbsp;address.</p> Asset Management Token <p>Fungible ERC20 <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/data-nfts-and-data-tokens">datatokens</a> previously integrated on the Acentrik marketplace were built on Ocean’s data sharing infrastructure that represent a license to consume datasets on the marketplace. With the launch of OceanONDA V4 and the introduction of ERC721 <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/what-is-a-data-nft-5804a2d88671">data NFTs</a>, data management on Acentrik V1.0 has been made easier. Based on Ocean’s data NFTs, the Acentrik Asset Management Token functions to represent the ownership of an asset in the marketplace and support different licenses for the same base intellectual property.</p> Smart Contracts <p>The Acentrik Marketplace is driven by the OceanONDA V4 smart contracts and libraries that make it possible to publish data services, deploy and mint datatokens and Acentrik Asset Management Token, and consume data services by spending them. Acentrik V1.0 is launching on the Polygon network to ensure that customers experience cheap gas fees and fast transactions, this is one of the many EVM-compatible networks that the Ocean smart contracts are deployed&nbsp;to.</p><p>Now live in Enterprise Release, companies can onboard with Acentrik and experience the features of the marketplace.</p><p>To reach out to Acentrik’s team for collaboration opportunities, or to be involved in the product, you can reach their team&nbsp;<a href="https://acentrik.io/contact-us/">here</a>.</p><p>Explore more and register on <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a>.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> &amp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/"> Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements and chat directly with other developers on<a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">&nbsp;Discord</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/acentrik-a-decentralized-data-marketplace-for-enterprises-built-on-ocean-protocol-is-now-in-7fb7371e57d4">Acentrik, a decentralized data marketplace for enterprises, built on Ocean Protocol — is now in…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Christopher Schütze</a></p><p>During my studies and the subsequent first years of my career, I was already always someone who liked to share knowledge with others and present interesting topics. This is not the only reason why my profession has developed in the direction of IT consulting. In fact, in consulting, "being on stage" is part of the daily work. You present results in front of smaller and larger groups, you become more and more of an expert on a topic, and then at some point, you slide onto the bigger stage at small and large conferences. 3,5 years ago, I joined KuppingerCole and there, giving speeches on big stages is part of the job title. It is so much fun to share and discuss exciting topics at our conferences.</p>
 My personal speaking stand-out moment 
<p>A simultaneously good and bad memory for me remains a manufacturer event in Nice. A colleague and I presented our customer project at this event. Unfortunately, at the beginning, it didn't go as smoothly as one would imagine presentations to go. The clicker didn't work properly, and we had a lot of graphics with many individual elements to them. At some point, you start slipping into a certain inner turmoil. True to the motto "The show must go on", we made the best of it, and in the end managed to still win a prize with our project. Certainly, it wasn't my best presentation, but I learned a lot from it, and I would say that since then I'm much more relaxed on stage.</p>
 That one speaker that lives rent-free in my head 
<p>Of course, there are plenty of well-known personalities in the field of TED Talks. Perhaps I'll start by defining what makes a good talk for me: It's the art of presenting supposedly ‘boring’ topics in an authentic and entertaining way. This does not mean that you have to put on a show, rather that you primarily have to get away from completely overloaded PowerPoint slides. A few years ago, I had the honor of being on stage with such a person: Veit Etzold. Besides being an author of exciting thrillers, he is also an expert in storytelling. That's exactly what you notice. He can completely take over a stage with a FlipChart and his personal presentation style. Sure, it doesn't work for every IT topic, but it's still an impressive way to get your points across.</p>
 Many personal and professional advantages 
<p>Being a speaker means wanting to share knowledge and experience with others. To transport new perspectives, and to want to enter into an engaging dialogue with others. This is exactly what it means to be a speaker. This ranges from an impulse lecture for a subsequent discussion, to the presentation of the latest results from concrete technical problems. The great advantage of being a speaker is, of course, that as a technical expert you get a feeling for how interesting the topic is, whether you were able to convey it well and, of course, you very often get additional perspectives that can complete the picture in the following questions from the audience or in the subsequent conversations over coffee.</p>
 Moving Towards #CSLS2022 
<p>At CSLS, I'm looking forward to exactly what it takes to be a speaker. Meeting the cybersecurity family again, friends, colleagues, and the special opportunity to share knowledge and learn many new things in exciting workshops, talks and discussion panels. There is nothing better than being a speaker at a conference like CSLS and being able to share new trends, great solutions, and experiences with like-minded people. Only the Cybersecurity Leadership Summit in Berlin can do that.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a> is an ORM (object–relational mapping) tool for Node.js using TypeScript.  The software integrates with many of the most popular databases today, including MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, and MongoDB, and emphasizes a human-readable schema with a type-safe database client.  Prisma also includes other features such as migrations, seed data, and a virtual database browser.</p>

<p>In this project, you will use Prisma to connect your <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> application to a database server.  You will build a schema to model a workout tracker application.  Then you’ll create some seed data and use Prisma to run migrations and seed your database.  Finally, you’ll create the web application using <a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html">Pug</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> to build the application frontend.</p>

   <a>Learn more about Node, authentication, and Okta</a> 
 

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>This tutorial uses the following technologies but doesn’t require any prior experience:</p>

 
   An IDE for JavaScript.  I will use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> but you can use Webstorm, or any other IDE you prefer. 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> 
   A database, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, or MongoDB.  In this tutorial we’ll use SQLite. 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
 

<p>If you’d like to skip the tutorial and check out the fully built project, you can go <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-express-prisma-tailwind-example">view it on GitHub</a>.</p>

 Create your OAuth2 authorization server 

<p>Create a new directory for your application.  Use the <code>cd</code> command to navigate to that folder.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Other. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code> and use <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>



 Create your Express application 

<p>Next, you will use the <code>express-generator</code> application generator tool to quickly scaffold your application.  Run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx express-generator@4.16 --view=pug
</code>   

<p>Now you can install your packages.</p>

   <code>npm i @prisma/client@3.13.0
npm i dotenv@16.0.0
npm i passport@0.5.2
npm i passport-openidconnect@0.1.1
npm i express-session@1.17
npm i -D tailwindcss@3.0.24
npm i -D prisma@3.13.0
</code>   

 
   <code>@prisma/client</code> is used to access the database from your server code. 
   <code>dotenv</code> reads configuration settings from <code>.env</code> files like the one produced by the Okta CLI. 
   <code>passport</code> is a middleware for Node.js that is flexible enough to handle most authentication scenarios, including Okta.  <code>passport-openidconnect</code> is a module for passport that lets you authenticate with OpenID Connect. 
   <code>express-session</code> is required for passport.  Express apps use this package for session support.  Your application must intiialize session support to use passport. 
   <code>Tailwind CSS</code> is the CSS framework you will use.  If you’ve never used Tailwind before, you may wonder why it’s a development dependency.  This is because Tailwind will dynamically build your CSS files from your views and configuration.  More on that later. 
   <code>prisma</code> is the ORM you are using.  This is a dev dependency because the Prisma library handles the migrations, seed data, etc., while the <code>@prisma/client</code> package is used in your application at runtime. 
 

<p>At this point, you will initialize Tailwind CSS and Prisma. You will configure them for usage later on.</p>

<p>Start with Prisma and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx prisma init
</code>   

<p>This command will add a new folder named <code>prisma</code> to your application. It also adds a file called <code>.env</code> to your project with some default configuration. Replace the contents of that file with the code below.</p>

   <code># Environment variables declared in this file are automatically made available to Prisma.
# See the documentation for more detail: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema#accessing-environment-variables-from-the-schema

# Prisma supports the native connection string format for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB, and CockroachDB (Preview).
# See the documentation for all the connection string options: https://pris.ly/d/connection-strings

DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
SEED_USER_NAME={yourOktaUserName}
</code>   

<p>In this example, I used SQLite because it’s easy and compact.  But one of the cool things about Prisma and most ORMs is that they can support many databases.  The boilerplate code includes comments about configuring your application for other database servers.  Feel free to use what you feel most comfortable with and use the appropriate connection string.</p>

<p>Your seed data will use the <code>SEED_USER_NAME</code> setting.  You want to ensure that it’s the same as the Okta username with which you sign in.  This will allow the application to associate your logged-in user with the data you will seed into your database.</p>

<p>Next, update your <code>package.json</code> file with the following code.</p>

 <code>{
  "name": "workout-app",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "prisma": {
    "seed": "node prisma/seed.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@prisma/client": "^3.13.0",
    "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.0",
    "express": "~4.16.1",
    "http-errors": "~1.6.3",
    "morgan": "~1.9.1",
    "passport": "^0.5.2",
    "passport-openidconnect": "^0.1.1",
    "pug": "2.0.0-beta11"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "prisma": "^3.13.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.0.24"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This will add the <code>prisma seed</code> command you need later.</p>

<p>Now you can initialize Tailwind CSS.</p>

   <code>npx tailwindcss init
</code>   

<p>You’ve now added a new file called <code>tailwind.config.js</code> to the root of your application.  Replace the contents of that file with the code below.</p>

   <code>module.exports = {
  content: ["./views/**/*.pug"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
</code>   

<p>In this step, you tell Tailwind CSS where to find the classes you used in your application.  You want Tailwind to look in the <code>.pug</code> files in your <code>views</code> directory.  Tailwind CSS is highly extensible, as seen by the configuration object’s <code>theme</code> and <code>plugins</code> settings.  A deep dive into this is out of the scope of this article, but I encourage you to look into Tailwind CSS’s site for more information.</p>

 Use Prisma to create your database 

<p>The next task is to create the database for your application.  Steps will involve writing the schema, writing some seed data, creating the migration, and applying the migration, which will also seed your data.</p>

<p>The <code>prisma init</code> task from above should have added a file called <code>schema.prisma</code> to your <code>prisma</code> directory.  Replace the code there with the code below.</p>

   <code>generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "{yourDatabaseProvider}"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model WorkoutLog {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId    Int
  exercise  String
  amount    Decimal
  units     String
  date      DateTime
  minutes   Int
  calories  Int
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

model User {
  id          Int          @id @default(autoincrement())
  username    String       @unique
  workoutLogs WorkoutLog[]
}
</code>   

<p>Make sure you replace <code>{yourDatabaseProvider}</code> with <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource">the provider you are using</a>.  As you can see, this file defines the <code>User</code> and <code>WorkoutLog</code> objects that you will store in the database.  The <code>WorkoutLog</code> has basic information about the user’s workout on a specific day and then associates that record with the <code>User</code> object.  You can also define keys, constraints, and indices from this file.  Note the <code>user</code> property on the <code>WorkoutLog</code> has a relation defined by the <code>userId</code> to the <code>id</code> of the <code>User</code> table.</p>

<p>Add a file to the <code>prisma</code> directory named <code>seed.js</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>const { PrismaClient } = require("@prisma/client");
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

require("dotenv").config();

async function main() {
  const user = await prisma.user.upsert({
    where: { username: process.env.SEED_USER_NAME },
    update: {},
    create: {
      username: process.env.SEED_USER_NAME,
      workoutLogs: {

</code>   

<p>Prisma knows to use the <code>seed.js</code> file from the command you added to <code>package.json</code>.  This file will insert the data when you run that command.</p>

<p>You can now add and apply the migration using the Prisma CLI. From the root of your application directory, run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx prisma migrate dev --name init
</code>   

<p>The CLI has several ways to add and apply migrations.  I suggest you understand the best way to manage migrations for your environment.  The method above is the easiest and fastest way to prepare your database.  As part of the migration process, this command will look for the <code>seed</code> command from your <code>package.json</code> and run that as well.  Once complete, your database should be ready with a database full of seed data to work with.</p>

 Add OIDC authentication 

<p>Now that your database is ready, you can turn your attention to the core of your application.</p>

<p>First, add a new file in the root of your application called <code>ensureLoggedIn.js</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>function ensureLoggedIn(req, res, next) {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        return next();
    }
    res.redirect('/login')
}

module.exports = ensureLoggedIn;
</code>   

<p>This little piece of middleware will make sure the user is authenticated.  If they aren’t, you will redirect them to the <code>login</code> route, which you will configure to use Okta.  Otherwise, you will allow the user to reach the next screen.</p>

<p>Next, you can update your routes in the <code>routes</code> directory.  First, remove <code>users.js</code> as you won’t be using that.  Replace the code in <code>index.js</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'The Workout Tracker - Home', isAuthenticated: req.isAuthenticated() });
});

module.exports = router;
</code>   

<p>Here you will pass a property for <code>isAuthenticated</code> so your layout page can properly display a login or logout button.</p>

<p>Next, add a file in the <code>routes</code> directory for <code>dashboard.js</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>var express = require("express");
var router = express.Router();

const { PrismaClient } = require("@prisma/client");
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const ensureLoggedIn = require("../ensureLoggedIn");

/* GET home page. */
router.get("/", ensureLoggedIn, async function (req, res) {
  const username = req.user.username;

  const dbUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: {
      username: username,
    },
    include: {
      workoutLogs: true,
    },
  });

  res.render("dashboard", {
    title: "The Workout Tracker - Dashboard",
    isAuthenticated: req.isAuthenticated(),
    user: dbUser
  });
});

module.exports = router;
</code>   

<p>There’s a lot of magic in this route.  First, you are using the <code>ensureLoggedIn</code> middleware to protect the route.  Then you can extract the username from the request and look up the user in the database using the Prisma client.  Since the user has a property for its workout logs, you can pass the user as the model and parse the logs on the pug view you will create.  This will give view access to the user’s name as well.  Of course, you could query the <code>workoutLogs</code> table directly and include features such as pagination and search if this approach better fits your workflow.</p>

<p>Now, replace the code in <code>app.js</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>var createError = require('http-errors');
var express = require('express');
var path = require('path');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var logger = require('morgan');

var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');
var dashboardRouter = require('./routes/dashboard');

const session = require('express-session');
const passport = require('passport');
const { Strategy } = require('passport-openidconnect');

var app = express();

const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

require('dotenv').config({path:'./.okta.env'});

// view engine setup
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'pug');

app.use(session({
  secret: 'CanYouLookTheOtherWay',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true
}));

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());


const {OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID, OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET, OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER} = process.env;

// set up passport
passport.use('oidc', new Strategy({
  issuer: OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER,
  authorizationURL: `${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}/v1/authorize`,
  tokenURL: `${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}/v1/token`,
  userInfoURL: `${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}/v1/userinfo`,
  clientID: OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET,
  callbackURL: 'http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback',
  scope: 'openid profile'
}, (issuer, profile, done) =&gt; {
  return done(null, profile);
}));

passport.serializeUser((user, next) =&gt; {
  next(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser((obj, next) =&gt; {
  next(null, obj);
});

app.use(logger('dev'));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.use('/login', passport.authenticate('oidc'));

app.use('/authorization-code/callback',
  passport.authenticate('oidc', { failureRedirect: '/error' }),
  (req, res, next) =&gt; {
    res.redirect('/dashboard');
  }
);

app.post('/logout', (req, res) =&gt; {
  req.logout();
  req.session.destroy();
  res.redirect('/');
});

app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/dashboard', dashboardRouter);

// catch 404 and forward to error handler
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  next(createError(404));
});

// error handler
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  // set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get('env') === 'development' ? err : {};

  // render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render('error');
});

module.exports = app;
</code>   

<p>You updated your routes to properly use the <code>dashboard</code> routes as well as any login or logout routes that Okta will use.  You also set up passport to use Okta using the values the Okta CLI produced in the <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>

 Add views to your Express application 

<p>By default, <code>express-generator</code> will add a few views for you.  You will need to edit them and add a new one of your own.  Start by opening the <code>layout.pug</code> file in the <code>views</code> directory and replacing the code there with the following.</p>

 <code>doctype html
html
  head
    title= title
    link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/output.css')
  body
    nav.flex.items-center.justify-between.flex-wrap.bg-teal-500.p-6.flex.items-center.flex-shrink-0.text-white.mr-6
      span.font-semibold.text-xl.tracking-tight.pr-2 The Workout Tracker
      .w-full.block.flex-grow(class='lg:flex lg:items-center lg:w-auto')
        .text-sm(class='lg:flex-grow')
        div
          if(isAuthenticated)
            form(action="logout" method="POST") 
              button(type="submit").inline-block.text-sm.px-4.py-2.leading-none.border.rounded.text-white.border-white.mt-4 Logout
          else 
            a.inline-block.text-sm.px-4.py-2.leading-none.border.rounded.text-white.border-white.mt-4(href='Login' class='hover:border-transparent hover:text-teal-500 hover:bg-white lg:mt-0') Login
    
    block content
</code> 

<p>You’ll notice a couple of things about this file.  First, the classes are very specific and plentiful.  This is typical of Tailwind CSS.  Rather than defining how a specific element looks, Tailwind CSS strives to define how a particular style looks, then you can add and remove styles from elements to fit the desired look.</p>

<p>The other thing you’ll see is the Login/Logout button that will change based on the <code>isAuthenticated</code> property.</p>

<p>Next, your can update <code>index.pug</code> with the following.</p>

 <code>extends layout

block content
  .py-12.bg-white
    .max-w-7xl.mx-auto.px-4(class='sm:px-6 lg:px-8')

          | for its ORM.  
</code> 

<p>There’s not much to talk about here.  Just a splash page with some more Tailwind CSS and some links to the technologies used.</p>

<p>Finally, add a file for <code>dashboard.pug</code> with the following code.</p>

 <code>extends layout

<p>As you saw before, this page is protected.  Therefore, it requires that you have a user to access this page.  The application will pull the user details and workout logs and form them into a summary at the top of the page with a couple of tables of the logs based on the exercises the user has performed.</p>

 Create the CSS file using Tailwind CSS 

<p>The last part of this process is to create the actual CSS file that your application will use.  In your <code>public/stylesheets</code> directory, you’ll see a file called <code>style.css</code>.  Replace the code in that file with the code below.</p>

   <code>@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

body {
  padding: 50px;
  font: 14px "Lucida Grande", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}

a {
  color: #00B7FF;
}
</code>   

<p>This is largely the same. However, you are importing the directives for each of Tailwind’s layers.</p>

<p>Next, you can compile the classes you used in your pug files and the style sheet you just modified to create a new CSS file. Run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx tailwindcss -i ./public/stylesheets/style.css -o ./public/stylesheets/output.css --watch
</code>   

<p>Now you can open the <code>output.css</code> file and see the complete Tailwind CSS code.  The <code>--watch</code> parameter here is helpful for local development.  This will rebuild the <code>output.css</code> file each time you change one of your layouts.  You can disregard that parameter if you do not want to make any changes.</p>

 Test your application 

<p>You’re now ready to start your application.  Run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm run start
</code>   

<p>Once your application is started you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and see your home page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Use the login button at the top of the screen and navigate out to the Okta login page.  Once you’ve logged in you will be redirected back to your website where you will be able to see your dashboard page.</p>

Image Source: <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/financial-superintendence-of-colombia-presents-project-to-regulate-crypto-service-providers/">Bitcoin.com</a> The proposal indirectly mentions the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel&nbsp;Rule. <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>The Financial Superintendence of Colombia published the country’s crypto draft regulation for public comments.</blockquote><blockquote>The proposal will remain open for public comments until August&nbsp;12.</blockquote><blockquote>If implemented, VASPs will have to stay connected with Colombia’s financial intelligence authority, the&nbsp;UIAF.</blockquote><p>Amidst the increased regulatory scrutiny globally, the financial regulator of Colombia has released a draft of rules for the cryptocurrency industry. With this move, Colombia joins the likes of the United States and the European Union in regulating digital assets amid a crypto market downturn.</p><p>The Financial Superintendence of Colombia, the country’s financial regulator, has presented the proposed regulations to the public and is seeking their comments. Currently, in the discussion stages, the proposal is open to receive suggestions until August&nbsp;12.</p> The Proposed Regulation <p>With its proposed regulations, the Colombian government seeks to clarify the definition of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and determine a set of prerequisites that banks need to verify before accepting cryptocurrency exchanges and custody providers as customers.</p><p>The rules also cover general cybersecurity guidelines and set the ground for tracing crypto transactions and risk management systems to prevent the use of digital assets for money laundering and terrorism financing. And for this, the authorities will make it mandatory for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to be connected to the financial intelligence office of Colombia, the&nbsp;UIAF.</p> The Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The proposal also indirectly mentions the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule and states that VASPs must obtain, preserve, and transmit the information of both the originator and the beneficiary of crypto transactions.</p><p>Additionally, the proposal establishes that the VASPs must present clear information to their customers about the services they offer, the costs and risks associated with these services, and the virtual assets on their platforms.</p><p>These rules come following the launch of a regulatory sandbox (LaArenera) last year that helps crypto companies that want to operate in the country with the regulatory aspects and implementation of the technology.</p> The Popularity of Crypto Assets in&nbsp;Colombia <p>This latest move from the South American government isn’t surprising given the high interest in the asset class in the country. After all, 6.1% of Colombians own crypto, while 80% have reportedly shown a willingness to invest in digital assets. The country is also ranked fourth in the world in terms of Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin trading&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Thus, regulating this burgeoning sector will ensure that Colombian investors are protected and that no illicit activities are facilitated using&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>Speaking of the Travel Rule, any VASPs that plan to offer services in Colombia must prepare for compliance beforehand. All that a VASP requires to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution (TRS), and we have an excellent suggestion: Veriscope. Interestingly, Veriscope is also the only solution against the “Sunrise Issue,” a significant problem that VASPs face during the Travel Rule compliance.</p><p>Read more about Veriscope here: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">https://www.veriscope.network/</a></p><p>If you are a VASP and want more information on Veriscope, please contact the BizDev team here: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/contact">https://www.veriscope.network/contact</a>.</p><p>Also, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a> to remain up-to-date on all things crypto regulations.</p>

			<p>Product Focus</p>
 ERC3643 Onchain Factory 
<p>One of the key principles we follow that makes our products and the blockchain ecosystem better, as a whole, is efficiency. Although the main purpose of the blockchain is to be able to share data and transact between parties without intermediaries, the speed and volume of the interactions are crucial to having successful blockchain applications via smart contracts.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in July 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>At Tokeny, we already automated a lot of operations by providing a complete system and APIs. The&nbsp;<a href="https://csqny04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VWBdWP1fdDKbW5KPKWk7FBtkSW2NZxg54MMPx6N5bb0hG3q8_QV1-WJV7CgFTgW4Q5jB21JQpBhW225Kfd4YHk6nN3rcD4bYgrFSW1q2x6D7WxH6fW194wMD3ykmyLW8tw9C87Hk-57N8HtQ2K3SzPzW5WBDjx8tz_JsW7RBfhc8D4KyvW20HWfR4zckQFVD7qYF5TqFdxVFrXqW7scdySW7wvhhD6BQCqRF3h52-B-QgmW1_RM3Z7zFClWW7Yc9hy41J_1hW6ngV2R8_hZL4N3YFY5YnKLbcN2wBLxdSK4K_W5hSWmh3ZvtqJW3YH9Pz3HQBZTV_GnZ48fC-3q39Fj1">T-REX Factory</a>, a module of our software, triggers the right blockchain transactions at the right time, manages operations queues, etc. And for a few years already, it works great. But, it forces a wallet that Tokeny controls to be used for the deployment, and then to transfer the ownership to the issuer. Our goal at Tokeny is to empower our users and not to be a middleman.</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp;with the new ERC3643 Onchain Factory, the wallet of the issuer can directly be used as a parameter in the deployment. The Onchain Factory is a smart contract that provides the automated completion of our entire ERC3643 suite. This program allows its users to deploy and configure everything from their tokens in only one blockchain transaction,&nbsp;without the need of additional configuration post-deployment.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Deployment of all smart contracts with a single transaction&nbsp; 
<p>Normally, in order to deploy the full suite of contracts of ERC3643 and configure them, at least 15 transactions (deploying the 6 main contracts and then configure them to fit the requirements of the token issuer) are required. In addition to that, there are also some transactions that can happen only after previous transactions are added in a block, as the output of previous transactions has to be consumed as an input for the next.&nbsp;Thanks to the Onchain Factory, you can have all tasks done at the same time under one transaction.&nbsp;Having the deployment process this way saves plenty of time and reduces the cost of gas fees.</p>
<p>Also, the Onchain Factory is a unique product because it&nbsp;allows the creation of the token smart contracts at predetermined addresses.&nbsp;This means that the Onchain Factory’s deployed smart contracts can have the&nbsp;same address on every EVM compatible blockchain. Thus, cross chain interoperability is possible under the Onchain Factory’s deployment. For example, if you switch from the Ethereum blockchain to Polygon’s, you can keep the same token address and be able to view all future transactions on Polygonscan. Without the Onchain Factory, you would normally have two separate token addresses, so this feature allows you to view all transactions under one address.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We are very proud of this deployment, with continuous updates and improvements along the way thanks to the hard work from our entire team.</p>

<p>Hackers attack passwords systematically, and it’s only a matter of time before they crack your login. What best practices can help secure your account?</p>
<p>What are best practices for creating a password?</p>
<p>Best practices for creating a password include the following:</p>
 
 Enforce complex passwords 
 
 
 Change passwords when compromised 
 
 
 Deploy anti-phishing measures 
 
 
 Use multi-factor authentication 
 
 
 Go passwordless 
 Use privileged access management 
 
 What Are the Challenges of Password Authentication? 
<p>Password authentication is one of the oldest forms of security, and that’s both a good and bad thing. On the positive side, passwords are simple to implement and ubiquitous, and good password hygiene can stand as a good first line of defense. On the other hand, passwords are often the easiest form of authentication to compromise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are passwords so easy to get past in a security system?</p>
 
 Hacking: Passwords can be hacked at the point of use (like an authentication portal or sign-in page) or in storage in the database. While passwords are easily changed, they can also get lost in the hack of major platform databases.&nbsp; 
 Password Hygiene: Many users simply don’t use good password hygiene. Using the same passwords across multiple platforms or weak passwords that are easy to guess can provide hackers easy access to private data and systems.&nbsp; 
 Social Engineering: It’s often acknowledged that users are the weakest link to security, and crafty hackers can use email, SMS, and other platforms to trick them into turning over their passwords under false pretenses.&nbsp; 
 
<p>So why, exactly, do we still use passwords? Passwords are a specific type of authentication that, mixed with other types, can provide a good basis for account security. Passwords aren’t challenging to implement (at least, not on the surface) and are somewhat easy to manage.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are Some Potential Attacks Against Passwords? 
<p>Passwords invite several different types of hacks or attacks, many of which can be combined for devastating results. These attacks are evolving every day, and some (like phishing) of the most common forms of hacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the potential attacks that threaten password systems include the following:</p>
 
 Brute-Force Attacks: Some of the bluntest attacks are tied to <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-spraying/">password spraying</a>, brute-force attacks, and dictionary attacks. These types of hacksattempt to use tens of thousands of password combinations against security systems in hopes of guessing the correct one. Some attacks will also attempt to use collections of known default passwords in the hopes that administrators haven’t changed basic settings.&nbsp; 
 Database Hacks: Some hackers bypass the passwords altogether and attack databases in the hopes of gaining thousands of passwords at a time. Some hackers can get access to databases specifically through flaws in password hygiene, but others can use methods like SQL injection or insider threats to gain access to these systems.&nbsp; 
 Phishing: One of the most prevalent forms of attack, phishing, uses a combination of somewhat sophisticated false messaging and the realities of a distracted user base to gain access to user passwords. The numbers are on the side of phishing attacks—even one or two compromised accounts can provide massive returns in terms of system access.&nbsp; 
 Poor Password Practices: An issue that extends across all of these challenges is poor password practices. Users who don’t pick complex passwords, reuse passwords, or fail to secure those passwords can not only cost themselves access to their accounts but also compromise their accounts on several other platforms.&nbsp; 
 
 What Are Best Practices for Passwords? 
<p>When it comes to enterprise <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/password-management">password management</a>, it’s up to the business to implement and enforce best practices around security. These companies cannot count on their employees to manage that level of security on their own. This isn’t a negative comment on users overall but rather an acknowledgment that security is a systemic challenge, not just one for end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some best practices that you can start at your organization include the following:</p>
 Enforce Complex Passwords 
<p>No matter what kind of account users work with, ask them to create a password with a minimum length and complexity. This can include long passwords with some combination of alphanumeric characters (upper and lowercase) and special characters. More comprehensive and advanced password systems will disallow users to use common phrases or default passwords.&nbsp;</p>
 Force Password Resets After Compromise 
<p>Changing passwords has a few benefits. First, it can protect systems against ongoing compromise—if an account has been hacked, and the user changes their password, then the hacker loses access and has to try again. Second, by forcing users to change their passwords, you can discourage using identical passwords across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make this approach more effective, implement controls that disallow users to reuse the same password for an account.</p>
 Deploy Anti-Phishing Measures 
<p>If tricked by a phishing attack, users may give away their passwords. Of course, once this happens, the attacker can wreak havoc within minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way to minimize potential phishing attacks is to warn users. For example, if a seemingly legitimate email appears to come from inside the organization, a warning can be automatically inserted into the body of that email, alerting the reader that it is not from a company address and encouraging them to ignore or report that email.&nbsp;</p>
 Use Multi-Factor Authentication 
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">Multi-factor authentication</a> is one of the most necessary pieces of authentication security on the market. In fact, most legitimate regulations and security frameworks, like those published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Payment Card Industry (PCI DSS), and the financial industry, require some form of MFA.</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication should include at least two of the following categories of authentication methods:</p>
 
 Knowledge: The user knows a username and password combination, or a PIN, associated with their account.&nbsp; 
 Ownership: The user owns an email account or device from which they can receive and provide a onetime password that’s dynamically generated over regular short intervals.&nbsp; 
 Inherence: The user provides biometric information like a fingerprint, iris signature, or facial scan. 
 
<p>These days, most platforms either offer or require some form of MFA, usually through a biometric scan or OTP delivered to an email account or mobile device.&nbsp;</p>
 Go Passwordless 
<p>While it might seem counterintuitive (since we are so used to having passwords), a passwordless system can mitigate most password security issues. <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/biometric-authentication/biometric-password">Biometric passwords</a> or pure <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> systems can essentially remove the obligation for users to manage complex login credentials and eliminate the issue of phishing attacks. If there isn’t a password to give away, there is much less risk of attack.</p>
 Use Privileged Access Management 
<p>While it was common to ask users to change passwords regularly, NIST recently recommended against this except in cases of breach or privileged accounts. In the latter case, the recommendation is to use passwordless authentication, change passwords regularly, and use heightened security around these credentials.</p>
 Get Rid of Your Passwords with 1Kosmos 
<p>Strong password security starts with advanced technology and best practices around authentication and cyber defense. With advanced biometrics, passwordless authentication, and multi-factor authentication, you can protect password information, avoid social engineering attacks, and secure privileged accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID provides the tools and features necessary to protect systems against password attacks:</p>
 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities in secure enclaves only accessible through advanced biometric verification. Our ledger is immutable, secure, and private, so there are no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.&nbsp; 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID includes Identity Assurance Level 2 (NIST 800-63A IAL2), detects fraudulent or duplicate identities, and establishes or reestablishes credential verification.<br>
 
 Streamlined User Experience: The distributed ledger makes it easier for users to onboard digital IDs. It’s as simple as installing the app, providing biometric information and any required identity proofing documents, and entering any information required under ID creation. The blockchain allows users more control over their <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-management/">digital identity</a> while making authentication much easier.&nbsp; 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through identity credential triangulation and validation. 
 Interoperability: BlockID and its distributed ledger readily integrate with a standard-based API to operating systems, applications, and MFA infrastructure at AAL2. BlockID is also FIDO2 certified, protecting against attacks that attempt to circumvent multi-factor authentication.&nbsp; 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API, including private blockchains.

<p>By Dr Paul Ashley, co-CEO and CTO, Anonyome Labs</p>



<p>This article was originally published in Michael Bazzell’s Unredacted magazine, June 2022. To learn more, view the&nbsp;<a href="https://unredactedmagazine.com/download.html">latest issue</a>.</p>



<p>Over the past year or so, interest in decentralized identity (also called self-sovereign identity) has surged. We’ve seen new decentralized identity blockchains created, decentralized identity companies acquired, and various real-world decentralized identity-based projects progressed.</p>



<p>You might ask then, what is decentralized identity? Definitions vary, but this is a good one:</p>



<p>Decentralized identity is an approach to identity and access management (IAM) that seeks ways to allow individuals to manage their own personally identifiable information (PII) instead of using a central authority. An important goal of decentralized identity is to create standards that will allow internet users to control which applications and services can have access to specific types of PII.</p>



<p>Let’s break it down. This definition has three important concepts:</p>



  Identity and access management (IAM)  User control of their personal information (PII)  Standards  



<p></p>



 Identity and Access Management (IAM)&nbsp; 







<p>Identity and access management refers to the way you access an online service, such as a website or social media site. The first type of IAM model implemented, and the most common, is centralized. We all know this approach since it involves creating an account on a service. Typically, when you create an account you give the site a username, password, perhaps set up two-factor authentication (2FA) and give other personal information such as your mobile phone number, email address, and credit card information. When I look into my own 1Password app, I see I have more than 200 accounts that fit this model.</p>



<p>The second type of IAM model implemented is also a centralized model but is called federated. In a federated model, you create an account at a central site, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or one of the other big sites. When you go to other websites, you might be offered the option of doing a social login such as “Login with Facebook”, where you use your Facebook login to access the third-party site. This type of model relies on sophisticated federation protocols such as OpenIDConnect. The advantage for you is convenience.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity flips these centralized IAM models on their head. With decentralized identity technology, instead of entering a username and password or doing a social login, you would&nbsp;create your own identity in an identity wallet. You would bring that identity to the website or service and create a peer (also called a pairwise) connection with that service. The advantage of creating the connection is that it allows for end-to-end encrypted communication, strong authentication and so on.</p>



<p>Now let’s consider the second part of the definition:&nbsp;user control of their personal information (PII). In my view, the two centralized IAM models are designed to behave exactly opposite to this goal. Those models encourage you to disclose as much of your personal information as possible and collect even more by surveilling your activities covertly. This is particularly bad with social login, where you are actually helping the central site (e.g. Google) to get a broader view of your behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it’s tempting to hit the social login button to save the bother of creating yet another account and remembering or storing yet another username and password, when you do, you’re really trading your personal information for access and convenience. Unless you carefully consider and agree to the information that the third-party site is asking to access from your social profile (during the initial permissions process, which many people rush through), you can easily expose your personal data, including your gender, age, email address, phone number, relationship status, interests, and even your full list of connections. Almost everything you’ve put into your social accounts could be available to the third-party site owner. This obviously has privacy and security implications.</p>



<p>So decentralized identity also flips this broad-ranging data gathering on its head. With decentralized identity technology, you would initially disclose one of your decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to the service to set up a connection. This allows the service to identify you for subsequent accesses and authenticate you using public key cryptography. You no longer need a password.&nbsp;You then negotiate with the service what additional personal information you consent to give to the service. Technology called verifiable credentials (digital documents issued with digital signatures) makes this possible.</p>



<p>Let’s now look at the third important concept in the definition:&nbsp;standards. Arguably the most important goal of the decentralized identity community is to define a set of standards to allow interoperability for users and services—essentially, an interoperable decentralized identity ecosystem. The standards being defined are at standards bodies such as World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Linux Foundation (Hyperledger and TrustoverIP), and Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).</p>



<p>Now we have touched on the high level concepts, let’s dig a bit deeper into the decentralized identity technology.</p>



<p></p>



 Identity Wallet 







<p>As the user, your view into decentralized identity is via an identity wallet. The wallet allows you to create your decentralized identities and connections with other users and services, and to receive, hold and present verifiable credentials (your digitally signed digital documents).</p>



<p>First, you need to get an identity wallet. There are a few different ones out there; one example is the Lissi wallet (lissi.id/mobile), which is a mobile application purposely built to allow the user to participate in a decentralized identity world.</p>



<p>The wallet is designed to hide much of the complexity of decentralized identity, but let’s cover some detail here. When you create your first decentralized identity, you are in fact creating a private/public key pair (usually based on Elliptic Curves, e.g. ec25519) and a unique identifier called a DID. A DID is a simple text string consisting of multiple parts:</p>



<p>did:indy:sovrin:7Tqg6BwSSWapxgUDm9KKgg</p>



<p>The string above has this meaning: “I am creating my decentralized identity following the Indy DID method, and the identity is anchored on the Sovrin mainnet blockchain.” If you were to provide that DID to a service or another user, it would be resolvable to an address on the Sovrin mainnet where the DIDDoc could be returned. The DIDDoc contains your public key and an address where to reach you.</p>



<p>There is a lot to unpack in that paragraph. Sovrin is a Hyperledger Indy-based blockchain specifically built for decentralized identity. Being a permissioned blockchain, it is a network of validator nodes (twenty four for each of the three Sovrin networks: mainnet, staging, test). It is designed to support decentralized identity-based applications. Anonyome Labs is one of the founding stewards of Sovrin, meaning we have been running a validator node on the Sovrin network for over three years now. Think of a validator like a bitcoin miner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A blockchain is used for decentralized identity because it provides an anchor for trust. Not only can you write your DIDs to the blockchain, but other parties, such as verifiable credential issuers, can write credentials definitions and their own DIDs (unique identifiers) as well. Because the blockchain is immutable (can never be altered, only added to), there is no way for a hacker to modify the information on the blockchain.</p>



<p>DIDDoc is also important. The DID points to a location on a blockchain so that a DIDDoc can be retrieved. The DIDDoc gives the decentralized identity’s public key (for establishing connections) and an address that can be used to reach you as the user. A well-designed identity wallet shields you from the complex technical information I’ve described. From your perspective, you create your decentralized identity and take it out and use it. Complexities around cryptography, endpoints, and blockchains are not that interesting to the everyday user.</p>



<p>So, to answer the question we started with: can decentralized identity give you greater control of your online identity? Clearly&nbsp;yes.</p>



<p>I’ll leave it there for now. This is the first in a series of articles on decentralized identity from Anonyome Labs. In future articles I’ll discuss:</p>



  Decentralized identity focused blockchains  Decentralized identity verifiable credentials  Identity (data) hub concept  Real world projects leveraging decentralized identity  The key decentralized identity standards, and more.  



<p>Update:<br>Anonyome Labs is building a set of SDKs for&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;so our enterprise customers can quickly create their own digital identity wallet. We also plan on building an unbranded identity wallet app if an enterprise customer wants to get to market faster.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">the first part of the GlobaliD 101 series</a>, we gave an overview of how our identity systems haven’t caught up to the modern world. We also provided suggestions of how digital identity should&nbsp;work.</p><p>The thing is, identity isn’t something your average person thinks about much. Typically, it’s a means to an end. If you want to take a trip to Europe, you need to bring your passport. Want to celebrate with a bottle of wine? You need to show your driver’s&nbsp;license.</p><p>In part 2 of the GlobaliD 101 series, we’re going to explain how the process of identity actually works, and we’re going to do it with a really nifty concept we call the Trust Triangle.</p><p>Here’s how the Trust Triangle works: Any identity framework is built on three pillars — issuers, holders, and verifiers. Together, these three pillars form the Trust Triangle.</p><p>Consider a real life example: The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) issues you your driver’s license. You are now the holder of that credential. After your big promotion, you go to the store to pick up a moderately expensive bottle of wine. The store then verifies that you are of age by checking your license. Now, it’s time to celebrate.</p><p>Let’s break it&nbsp;down:</p> Issuers <p>Issuers are simply organizations that are authorized to issue credentials. They confirm that a piece of information is accurate and then issue a credential authenticating that information. They are typically trusted authorities who want to ensure compliance and enforce standards.</p><p>The Department of Motor Vehicles is an issuer. They issue a driver’s license credential that enables you to legally operate a&nbsp;car.</p> Holders <p>A holder is the owner of a credential. They can be individuals or organizations. They are trying to do something, but need some sort of credential to do it. They also need a place to store the credentials they already have and new ones they will&nbsp;acquire.</p><p>If you want to drive a car then you would go to the DMV (the issuer), and they would issue you a driver’s license credential which would enable you (the holder) to&nbsp;drive.</p> Verifiers <p>Verifiers are entities that receive a credential presented to them from a holder, confirm the credential comes from a trusted issuer, and then use that credential to perform a service or sell a good to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>If a cop pulls you over while driving the first thing they are going to do is verify you are legally allowed to drive. To do this, the cop (the verifier) will ask you (the holder) to present your driver’s license credential that you received from the DMV (the&nbsp;issuer).</p> The Trust Triangle breaks down&nbsp;online <p>So far, everything has been pretty straightforward as this is how identity has always worked in the real world. But once we get online, things get a bit&nbsp;messy.</p><p>Consider the context of the Trust Triangle for a typical online transaction such as ordering food or&nbsp;drinks.</p><p>When ordering alcohol from a food delivery service such as Doordash, they will require you to upload a photo of your driver’s license in order to verify your age. Your ID is then kept and “stored securely by DoorDash for future alcohol purchases.”</p><p>The same problem occurs when booking a stay on the online marketplace Airbnb. In order to secure a place, hosts will often ask you to submit a photo of your government ID in order to verify you are who you claim to&nbsp;be.</p><p>This setup results in a slew of security and ownership. On the one hand, verifiers must now manage the security and privacy concerns of holding personal user information, which is now vulnerable to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach">data breaches</a>. On the other hand, individuals lose control of their identity once their identifying documentation is out in the&nbsp;wild.</p><p>In both scenarios, DoorDash and Airbnb hosts don’t need to hold your driver’s license. The former does it out of convenience (but with consequences). The latter does it because of the lack of a better alternative.</p><p>This breakdown of the Trust Triangle is taken to logical extremes in the context of Big&nbsp;Tech.</p><p>Consider how identity with Facebook&nbsp;works:</p><p>Facebook issues you an account, one of many fragmented identities we have online, after signing up with your email address. Facebook also holds all of your social data and personal information (username, password, first and last name, email, etc.) on their own servers.

<p>Is Web3 just hype or will it be integral to our day-to-day life in the future? Here’s a brief history of the web to put Web3 in&nbsp;context.</p><p>Web3 is often described in idealistic terms with the promise of freedom, democracy and a fairer internet for all. However, some users of the internet may be put off by Web3’s connection to cryptocurrencies and complicated blockchain technology. Others think it’s only for tech users or specialized use cases such as gaming, the metaverse, NFTs, or decentralized finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p>But Web3 offers more practical and economical advantages than that. The new protocol layer expands the existing protocols of the internet, bringing innovation back to the web and increasing value creation — the process of turning resources into something of value for others. A look at how the web has developed so far shows how it has evolved, and puts current developments in perspective.</p> Web1 <p>The web is such an integral part of life nowadays it’s hard to imagine life without&nbsp;it.</p><p>The internet made its first appearance in 1978, when it was developed for and financed by the military. The infrastructure consisted of several protocols such as IP, TCP, UDP, and SMTP, most of which are still being used today. Although these were free and unregulated, adoption was slow. It took until 1991 for the World Wide Web (www) to appear, invented by Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN scientific research center <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/1991/08/art-6484.txt">“to allow links to be made to any information anywhere”</a>. Two years later this version of the web became freely available for the public to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Value creation was low in Web1, which was mainly used to send data from A to B or create static websites that weren’t much more than a digital brochure. Anyone who remembers the painfully slow and pay-per-minute dial-up connection needed to connect to the internet could hardly have imagined its widespread use&nbsp;today!</p><p>Several years after its launch, many were still <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2016/08/25-years-here-are-worst-ever-predictions-about-internet">critical of the web</a>, exemplified by the statement in 1995 by AT&amp;T’s vice president of multimedia strategy that “<a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/04/bell-labs/">most things that succeed don’t require retraining 250 million&nbsp;people</a>”.</p> Web2 <p>But things were changing. The first <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=1654&amp;__cf_chl_tk=AeRRa5iXfwSLRqVXBhqnMeENfnfAp3UjoCKel.dVjNI-1657099045-0-gaNycGzNCOU">Web 2.0 conference</a> in 2004 highlighted developments that had started a few years previously to harness the potential of Web1. These began with the introduction of more interactive websites. Value creation increased as an explosion of useful applications was built on top of the original protocols, offering storage and computation, easy ways to search, social media platforms, and ways to buy, sell and pay for&nbsp;things.</p><p>This is the point where large monopolies began. While previously companies had a fairer playing field, in Web2 human psychology kicked in in the form of the <a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1221425">Schelling point</a>, a game theory concept. The original Schelling point experiment asked participants where and when they would meet a stranger in New York, given no further instructions. The most common answer was noon at Grand Central Station. On the web, some companies started becoming the “noon at Grand Central Station” of their field. Gaining even more users with the arrival of the <a href="https://www.govtech.com/products/how-smartphones-revolutionized-society-in-less-than-a-decade.html">smartphone</a> in 2007 as increasing numbers of people started accessing the internet daily, these companies became Schelling points.</p><p>A Schelling point is a monopoly, which is very hard to replace. If it is replaced, the result automatically becomes the new Schelling point, creating a new monopoly. This monopolistic landscape of Web2 killed innovation, as it’s not enough for a new company to develop a better product, they also need significant funding and marketing to compete. In the meantime, established companies don’t need to innovate to survive as they already own the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Additionally, although Web2 services are generally “free” to use, the user pays indirectly with their data, which is often sold for targeted advertising. A company with a lot of data has a lot of control. And large companies with huge data silos are a honeypot for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>Web3 evolved to address these&nbsp;issues.</p> Web3 <p>Thanks to blockchain technology, new “fat” protocols (so-called because they have much more functionality than the historical “thin” protocols, such as HTTP, IP, etc.) were added to the protocol layer of the internet.</p><p>These protocols were developed to create the infrastructure required to provide vital services needed by web users, in areas such as identity, payment, ownership, storage and computation. These new services are not companies; they are networks, usually decentralized, run on blockchain technology, and fueled by utility coins, also known as tokens or cryptocurrencies. Anyone can buy the coin and use it to pay for the transaction provided by the blockchain service. By owning the coin, the user also owns part of the network. In this way, blockchain provides the possibility to build protocols not as a company, but in a decentralized way that combines ownership and utility. These blockchain protocols can replace the Schelling points that provided vital services for web users and developers.</p><p>As these protocols are open source and permissionless, this opens the field for competition, innovation and an explosion in value creation. Once again there is huge potential for development. When essential services like payment, ownership, identity, computation and storage are provided by a decentralized network, this provides a level playing field for developers of new and useful services on top of these essentials. Web3 protocols also provide easy to use interfaces (APIs), which greatly accelerate development speed and thus lower entry barriers for creative new companies. This setting will lead to a Cambrian explosion of decentralized applications (dapps) which provide additional utility to the Web and an enormous boost in value creation, which will easily be bigger than in Web2. Decentralized applications (dapps) are being built to create new valuable services, while the protocol level breaks the Schelling point&nbsp;circle.</p><p>Just as adoption hurdles were overcome with former incarnations of the web, challenges to Web3 adoption will decrease as the newer dapps, wallets, and interfaces become more intuitive, user-friendly, and as easy to use as any other app on your phone or browser. Dapps can be created for specific projects and services, and those protocols that provide utility to the services will thrive.. And with a level playing field, dapp developers will need to keep innovating and improving to keep their market share, providing even more value for web&nbsp;users.</p> Moving forward <p>In the same way that Web1 was seamlessly absorbed into Web2, many Web2 elements will still exist in the future, running alongside a multi-chain network of Web3 decentralized services.</p><p>Even at this early stage of development, several Web3 protocols and dapps are already up and running. Along with wallets, recent years have seen real-world innovation and decentralized services grow in many areas, such as storage (<a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>), finance (DeFi and decentralized exchanges), and identity — including dapps <a href="https://www.kilt.io/built-on-kilt/">built on KILT</a> such as <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">SocialKYC credentials</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-didsign-a-new-application-built-on-kilt-e4896ffffb44">DIDsign</a> (by <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/">B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity&nbsp;GmbH</a>).</p><p>The typical internet user is not concerned with what protocols the app they are using is based on. They are just interested in the value the app adds to their life and digital experience. As decentralization in Web3 creates value with practical things such as creating a digital identity and returning control of data to its owner, alongside newer offerings like NFTs and the metaverse, adoption will continue to grow as it has throughout Web1 and Web2. As in previous iterations of the web, the only limit is our imagination!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-history-of-web3-in-a-nutshell-68ef20df3c2f">The History of Web3 in a Nutshell</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

A Communications Problem? 
 
 
 
 
<p>Misinformation is as a growing societal topic. And in fact is a cyber security risk. </p>
<p>Over the past two years, we’ve all had the chance to witness worldwide manifestations against covid-19-related government mandates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was (and still exists) a strong rhetoric around governments implementing programs in order to increase their surveillance on citizens (e.g., vaccine passports).</p>
<p>We’ve now started seeing similar rhetorics around digital identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>Government attempts to impose digital IDs &amp; other intrusive tracking and surveillance methods are an attack on our freedom.<a href="https://t.co/0PJRw8JOoF">https://t.co/0PJRw8JOoF</a><br><br>I will end them.<br><br>Join to vote if you agree: <a href="https://t.co/fSIdr4SUbt">https://t.co/fSIdr4SUbt</a></p>— Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre) <a href="https://twitter.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1528885198980452353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2022</a></blockquote> 
 
<p><br>
 And there are more examples </p>
<p>In the past months, some petitions (<a href="https://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-9695/index.html">1</a>, <a href="https://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-9473/index.html">2</a>) against government-based digital wallets were signed at the Quebec National Assembly by tens of thousands of people:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
Anyone familiar with the Canadian public sector digital ID landscape knows about the Saskatchewan Digital ID program being halted in early 2022 (<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-digital-id-1.6405362">3</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This came soon after a podcast episode of the Joe Rogan Experience (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ugbn7cuab3mNgKbo81ajM">4</a>), in which his guest Maajid Nawaz talked about governments not always having pure intentions when it comes to protecting the privacy rights of citizens.</p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say that us folks in the user-centric digital identity space know the efforts being put into place to ensure that digital ID is a freedom-enhancing tool for citizens.</p>
<p>Digital IDs are also a choice. And when issued by governments, they’re an optional public good – just like roads are an optional public good. If you don’t like to take the highway,&nbsp; you can always take the side road to get to where you need to.</p>
<p>As a digital identity community, I’d claim that we’re very proficient at explaining all of this to ourselves, but we have difficulties explaining the benefits to the broader public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this isn’t the government’s task to do so. It’s all of our roles to educate the broader public on the pros and cons of Digital ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the core, if done correctly, we are further <a href="https://northernblock.io/insecm-cis2022-are-we-really-committed-to-protecting-the-rights-of-people-and-democratic-societies/">protecting the rights of people and democratic societies</a>.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>This conversation is meant to generate some suggestions on how to avoid the big brother rhetoric when it comes to digital ID programs.</p>
 
<p>Some of the key topics covered during this episode with Imraan are:</p>
 
 The rise of Misinformation&nbsp; 
 How to “pre-bunking” certain ideas? 
 Misconceptions on Zero Trust 
 What is Canada doing better/worse in digital ID related to other national programs? 
 How can digital ID go wrong? 
 Biometrics and facial recognition 
 Centralization and selling of data to private sector 
 How can we as an industry do a better job at educating the general population about digital ID?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Richard Hill</a></p><p>Software Bill of Material (SBOM) tools have come sharply into focus as a foundational component of any <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-software-supply-chain-security">Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS)</a> strategy, spurred on by the U.S. Executive Order to improve the security of the software supply chain. This was in response to a number of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/blog/software-supply-chain-risks-and-the-kaspersky-ban">highly visible attacks</a> on the software supply chain of some well knows software products and services, such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/the-next-level-of-zero-trust-software-security-and-cyber-supply-chain-risk-management">SolarWinds</a> in 2020, as well as compromised open-source code and other backdoors embedded in routine maintenance updates. As part of the overall enhancement to SSCS, the Executive Order specifically calls out the documentation of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each software product. An SBOM creates a machine-readable inventory of the software components that make up a given software product. Software products are often a mix of custom-developed code leveraging open source and other commercially available software components, which <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/devsecops-sodas-secure-operations-development-of-agile-services">DevSecOps</a> should maintain and monitor. Having a Bill of Materials is nothing new in the traditional Supply Chain Management (SCM) process, and it shouldn’t be any surprise and makes perfect sense to apply this same concept to software.</p>
 Transparency benefits all stakeholders in the software supply chain 
<p>Transparency in the software supply chain benefits all stakeholders, from software suppliers to the software products' consumers and the providers in between, such as Managed Service Providers (MSP). It helps the software supplier to have a clear understanding of what software components make up their software product. It can also assist in monitoring software risks in their DevOps pipeline and prove software competency in case of company acquisitions or mergers. Suppliers of software products need to be assured that the software provided as an MSP is secure and can meet regulatory compliance requirements. Software consumers want to know that the software they use won't make them a target of a software attack.</p>
 Microsoft makes its own SBOM tool publicly available 
<p>Recently, Microsoft contributed its own internally used Salus tool for generating SBOMs to open source, which is publicly available on GitHub – a Microsoft company. The GitHub SBOM project page describes the tool as being enterprise-ready, highly scalable, and working across platforms including Windows, Linux, and Mac, which can be integrated into build workflows. Another benefit of the tool is that it’s Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX) 2.2 compatible, which is essential for companies supplying U.S. government software given its SBOM format requirements. Having an enterprise grade SBOM freely available should make it easier to meet the SSCS bar that is being raised leaving little excuse for organizations from taking a step in this direction.</p>
 Don’t stop at SBOM, take the next step in the SSCS process 
<p>Inventorying all of the pieces in a software product is a good and essential part of SSCS, but It should not stop there. For example, security must be put into place on the source control management (SCM) system and associated software repositories to ensure source integrity. Software code and other artifacts also need to be scanned for vulnerabilities. The build integrity processes must verify the build artifact's provenance and that the code has been signed and validated to detect tampering. Container artifacts such as Docker images must also be checked for vulnerabilities and compliance issues. Other vulnerability and misconfiguration scans, such as API scans, can occur along the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline. In short, when securing the Software Supply Chain, the journey starts at the security and privacy by design phase when creating the software system architecture and coding of the design begins and continues throughout software deployment and lifecycle.</p>

 The KJM confirms that IDnow’s solutions IDnow Wallet and IDnow eID are officially suitable for age verification in accordance with the youth protection treaty (JMStV) in Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, July 21, 2022, IDnow, a leading European provider in the field of identity proofing and digital identities, is pleased to announce that two further solutions, specifically the IDnow Wallet and IDnow eID, have been positively assessed by the German Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media (KJM) for the use of age verification. This means that there are now five solutions from IDnow group among the <a href="https://www.kjm-online.de/aufsicht/technischer-jugendmedienschutz/unzulaessige-angebote/altersverifikationssysteme">age verification systems rated as positive by the KJM.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IDnow Wallet, in particular, will allow users to confirm their age faster than ever before. With its Digital Identity Wallet, IDnow offers an innovative way to safely and securely store a person’s digital identity on their own smartphone to reuse it later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The identity is verified once – in just a few steps – using one of the IDnow identification methods. The data is saved exclusively on the user’s smartphone and encrypted with the help of the Secure Element. The data is not stored centrally. Once verified, users can then reuse their stored identity within the IDnow ecosystem for many different use cases. This saves users of the IDnow Wallet from having to repeatedly verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With its IDnow Wallet and IDnow eID, the company is pleased to offer two more solutions for online age verification, which have been rated positively by the KJM. With its broad range of identification methods, IDnow becomes a significantly stronger partner for the protection of minors in Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Background: Protection of minors from harmful media&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the German Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors in the Media (JMStV), certain content harmful to minors, such as gambling or pornography, may only be distributed online if the provider ensures access through closed, adults-only user groups. So-called age verification systems (AV systems) are used to ensure such closed, adults-only user groups. In order to provide legal and planning security, the KJM publishes a list of evaluated age verification systems that meet the legal requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Ankaa partners with identity proofing platform to offer digital verification for seafaring roles&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Manchester and London, July 21, 2022: Leading European provider for identity proofing, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, has announced <a href="https://ankaa.com/">Ankaa</a> as its latest UK channel partner. As one of the first fully automated solution in the maritime sector, the partnership will enable Ankaa to quickly and efficiently confirm the identities of candidates applying for jobs at sea providing comfort to operators, owners and financial compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entirely automated processes offered by Ankaa, now including identity proofing, have significantly reduced the amount of time it takes to onboard a candidate by 60%. For example, onboarding a new candidate used to take 45-50 minutes per crew member, using Ankaa this has been reduced to just 11 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with IDnow, Ankaa can now offer a holistic, end-to-end digital onboarding solution to its maritime customers, enabling them to meet the various legislative requirements and streamline typically complex processes including job advertising, documentation collation and now identity proofing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ian Livingstone, Founder and Managing Director at Ankaa, comments: “Ankaa has offered significant savings in manual administration and vastly improved data flows between clients, recruitment team and the employer. In recent years, the regulatory focus has widened and all entities across the maritime sector and the related supply chains, including crew providers, have been advised by regulators across the world to significantly improve their due diligence and compliance programmes to avoid breaching global sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The new feature ensures maritime employers can further enhance their substantive employment decision, whilst ensuring fiscal compliance with banks and fiduciary authorities is maintained. The feature incorporates compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF), as well as Anti-Bribery and Corruption legislation of the various jurisdictions in which our clients operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When searching for a company to partner with, we looked across the market and found that IDnow had a superior interface. The ease of use was a high priority for us to ensure a smooth user experience, and IDnow’s AutoIdent system delivered,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Via Ankaa’s platform, candidates are directed to a portal which streamlines the entire recruitment and onboarding processes; from there, they upload their locational documents, certificates and information about previous assignments needed to successfully apply for a role, which often involves more than 30 pieces of documentation. Using IDnow’s AutoIdent with an AML screening solution, Ankaa can then verify the candidate is who they say they are. These checks are also vital in order to confirm the identity of any beneficiaries of a seafarer’s pay, which can often be a spouse or family member. Via IDnow’s AML and KYC technology, Ankaa is now able to show who is on-board a vessel and where their payment is sent to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Hudson-Dale, Partnerships Manager at IDnow, adds: “We’re delighted to be partnering with Ankaa at such a pivotal time for the maritime industry as it looks to set the benchmark for digital recruitment and onboarding. Previously, recruiters would engage in complex and lengthy processes including scanning, email exchanges and paper documentation; however, Ankaa is disrupting this standard by delivering all aspects via a simple tech platform.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection 

<p>In the <a>second post of this series</a>, we presented an overview of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). In summary, you learned that XSS occurs when code pollutes data and your application doesn’t provide safeguards to prevent the code from running.</p>

<p>Let’s recap the example attack vector.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine an overly dramatic but otherwise innocent scenario like this:</p>
   
     A website allows you to add comments about your favorite K-Drama. 
     An agitator adds the comment <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('Crash Landing on You stinks!');&lt;/script&gt;</code>. 
     That terrible comment saves as is to the database. 
     A K-Drama fan opens the website. 
     The terrible comment is added to the website, appending the <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag to the DOM. 
     The K-Drama fan is outraged by the JavaScript alert saying their favorite K-Drama, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10850932/">Crash Landing on You</a>, stinks. 
   
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, we have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element and glossed over the steps for appending the element to the DOM. In reality, polluted data gets pulled into the application in various ways. Adding untrusted data in an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#injection_sinks">injection sink</a> - a Web API function that allows us to add dynamic content to our applications - is a major culprit. Examples of sinks include, but aren’t limited to:</p>
 
   methods to append to the DOM such as  <code>innerHTML</code>, <code>outerHTML</code> 
   approaches that load external resources or navigate to external sites via a URL, such as <code>src</code> or <code>href</code> for HTML elements and <code>url</code> property on styles 
   event handlers, such as <code>onmouseover</code> and <code>onerror</code> with an invalid <code>src</code> value 
   global functions that evaluate and/or run code, such as <code>eval()</code>, <code>setTimeout()</code> 
 

<p>As you can see, there are many vectors for the vulnerability. Many of these sinks have legitimate use cases when building dynamic web applications. Since the sinks are necessary for web app functionality, we must use trusted data by escaping and sanitizing it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is still a high-level summary. The fine print is that XSS vulnerabilities can be pretty sneaky in the different ways the attack can occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are different XSS attacks, each with a slightly different attack vector. We’ll briefly cover how three attacks work.</p>

 Stored XSS 

<p>In this flavor of XSS, the attack is persisted somewhere, like in a database. We recapped stored XSS in the example above, where an agitator’s terrible comment with the <code>script</code> tag persists in the database and ruins someone else’s day by showing the unfriendly comment in an alert.</p>

 Reflected XSS 

<p>In this attack, the malicious code sneaks in through the HTTP request, usually through URL parameters. Suppose the K-Drama site takes a search term via a URL parameter, such as:</p>

   <code>https://myfavekdramas.com/dramas?search=crash+landing+on+you
</code>   

<p>The site then takes the search terms and displays them back to the user while calling out to the backend to run the search.</p>

<p>But what if an agitator constructs a URL like this?</p>

   <code>https://myfavekdramas.com/dramas?search=&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert('Doh!')"/&gt;
</code>   

<p>You may think that you’d never navigate to a link like that! Who would?! But let’s remember, in a previous post, you did click the link in your spam email to send money to your high school sweetheart. This isn’t meant as a judgment; no one is immune to clicking fishy links. Also, agitators are pretty tricksy. They might use URL shorteners to obscure the risk.</p>

 DOM-based XSS 

<p>In this attack, the agitator takes advantage of Web APIs. The attack occurs entirely within the SPA, and it’s pretty much identical to reflected XSS.</p>

<p>Let’s say our application depends on an external resource—the app embeds an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> for showing trailers for the K-Dramas and sets the <code>iframe</code>’s <code>src</code> attribute to an external site. So our code might look like this.</p>

   <code>&lt;iframe src="{resourceURL}" /&gt;
</code>   

<p>We usually call out to the third-party service to get the URLs for the source, but agitators have infiltrated this third-party service and now control the resource URLs returned, making our code look like this.</p>

   <code>&lt;iframe src="javascript:alert('Boo!')" /&gt;
</code>   

<p>Well, darn it, we’ve got some problems.</p>

 XSS support in Angular 

<p>Fortunately, Angular has a lot of built-in security protections. It treats all values as suspicious and untrusted by default, which is incredibly helpful because the framework automatically guards us against unintentionally creating vulnerabilities in our applications. Angular automatically removes any <code>script</code> tags so we won’t have to worry about the original hypothetical example.</p>

<p>Let’s see some examples of how Angular protects us against XSS.</p>

 Angular automatically escapes values 

<p>Web applications implement comment features like in the Stored XSS example by calling an API to get a list of comments, then add the comments to the template. In Angular, an extremely simplified comments component might look something like this:</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-comments'
  template: `
    &lt;p *ngFor="let comment of comments | async"&gt;
      {{comment}}
    &lt;p&gt;
  `
})
export class CommentsComponent implements OnInit {
  public comments: Observable&lt;string[]&gt;;
  
  constructor(private commentsService: CommentsService) { }

  public ngOnInit(): void {
    this.comments = this.commentsService.getComments();
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The XSS attack vector works only if the web app treats all values as trustworthy and appends them directly to the template, such as when the web app doesn’t escape or sanitize values first. Luckily, Angular automatically does both.</p>

<p>When you add values through interpolation in templates (using the <code>{{}}</code> syntax), Angular automatically escapes the data. So the comment:</p>

   <code>&lt;a href="javascript:alert(\'Crash Landing on You stinks!\')"&gt;Click to win a free prize!&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>displays exactly like what’s written above as text. It’s still a terrible comment and unfriendly to “Crash Landing on You” fans, but it doesn’t add the anchor element to the app. This is awesome because even if the attack were more malicious, it still wouldn’t perform any actions.</p>

 Angular automatically sanitizes values 

<p>Let’s say we want to display the comments preserving any safe markup a user enters. We already have two malicious comments to start us off on shaky ground:</p>
 
   <code>&lt;a href="javascript:alert(\'Crash Landing on You stinks!\')"&gt;Click to win a free prize!&lt;/a&gt;</code> 
   <code>&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert('Doh!')"/&gt;</code> 
 

<p>Then a K-Drama fan adds a new comment with safe markup.</p>

   <code>&lt;strong&gt;It's a wonderful drama! The best!&lt;/strong&gt;
</code>   

<p>Because the <code>CommentsComponent</code> uses interpolation to populate the comments, the comments will display in the browser in text like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>That’s not what we want! We want to interpret the HTML and allow the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> text, so we change our component template to bind it to the HTML <code>innerHTML</code> property.</p>

   <code>&lt;p 
  *ngFor="let comment of comments | async" 
  [innerHTML]="comment"
&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now, the site displays only the second comment correctly formatted like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The first comment with the <code>anchor</code> tag doesn’t display the alert when clicked! The second comment with the attack in the <code>onerror</code> handler only shows the broken image and doesn’t run the error code! Angular doesn’t publish a list of unsafe tags. Still, we can sneak a peek into the codebase to see Angular considers tags such as <code>form</code>, <code>textarea</code>, <code>button</code>, <code>embed</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>style</code>, <code>template</code> as suspicious and may altogether remove the tag or remove specific attributes/child elements.</p>

<p>As we learned earlier, sanitizing removes suspicious code while keeping safe code. Angular automatically strips out unsafe attributes from safe elements. You will see a warning in the console letting you know Angular cleaned the content up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>By handling values “the Angular way,” our application is well protected against security woes! Success!</p>

<p></p>

 Bypassing Angular’s security checks 

<blockquote>
  <p>🚨 Here be dragons! 🚨</p>

  <p>Be careful about bypassing the built-in security mechanism; if you need to, read this section carefully:</p>

<p>What if you need to bind trusted values that Angular thinks are unsafe? You can mark values as trusted and bypass the security checks.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the example of the image with an error handler. Instead of the value coming from an agitator, let’s say there’s a legitimate need to bind the image with dynamic error handling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sidenote - there are better ways to handle images with error handling in Angular if your application doesn’t need to be quite so dynamic. Consider using an image element and bind to <code>(error)</code> instead, or even <code>HostListener</code>. Or, there are many tutorial examples of handling it cleanly using a Directive. Indeed, there are lots of better options. You should always prefer the standard Angular way using Angular building blocks. The code will be way easier to support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to the example, then. In the example above, we saw that the error handler didn’t run. Angular stripped it out. We need to mark the code as trusted for the error code to run.</p>

<p>Your component code might look like this.</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-trustworthy-image',
  template: `
    &lt;section [innerHTML]="html"
  `
})
export class TrustworthyImageComponent {
  public html = `&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert('Doh!')"/&gt;`;
}
</code>   

<p>You see the broken image in the browser, and no alert pops up.</p>

<p>We can use the <code>DomSanitzer</code> class in <code>@angular/platform-browser</code>, to mark values as safe. The <code>DomSanitizer</code> class has built-in sanitization methods for four types of contexts:</p>
 
   HTML - binding to add more content like this <code>innerHTML</code> image example 
   Style - binding styles to add more flair to the site 
   URL - binding URLs like when you want to navigate to an external site in an anchor tag 
   Resource URL - binding URLs that load and run as code 
 

<p>To mark the value as trusted and safe to use, you can inject <code>DomSanitizer</code> and use one of the following methods appropriate for the security context to return a value marked as safe.</p>
 
   <code>bypassSecurityHTML</code> 
   <code>bypassSecurityScript</code> 
   <code>bypassSecurityTrustStyle</code> 
   <code>bypassSecurityTrustUrl</code> 
   <code>bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl</code> 
 

<p>These methods return the same input but are marked as trusted by wrapping it in a safe equivalent of the sanitization type.</p>

<p>Let’s see what this component looks like when we mark the HTML value as trusted.</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-trustworthy-image',
  template: `
    &lt;section [innerHTML]="html"
  `
})
export class TrustworthyImageComponent {
  public html = `&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert('Doh!')"/&gt;`;
  public safeHtml: SafeHtml;

  constructor(sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {
    this.safeHtml = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(this.html);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now, if you view this in the browser, you’ll see the broken image and an alert pop up. Success?? Maybe…</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s look at an example with a resource URL, such as the DOM-based XSS example where we bind the URL of the <code>iframe</code> source.</p>

<p>Your component code might look like this</p>
   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-video',
  template: `
    &lt;iframe [src]="linky" width="800px" height="450px"
  `
})
export class VideoComponent {

  // pretend this is from an external source
  public linky = '//videolink/embed/12345';
}
</code>   

<p>Angular will stop you right there. 🛑</p>

<p>You’ll see an error in the console saying unsafe values can’t be used in a resource URL. Angular recognizes you’re trying to add a resource URL and is alarmed you’re doing something dangerous. Resource URLs can contain legitimate code, so Angular can’t sanitize it, unlike the comments we had above.</p>

<p>If we are sure our link is safe and trustworthy (highly debatable in this example, but we’ll ignore that for a moment), we can mark the resource as trusted after we do some cleanup to make the resource URL safer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember, we should only use the <code>bypassSecurityTrust...</code> methods if we know the value is trustworthy. You bypass the built-in security mechanisms and open yourself to security vulnerabilities!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of using the entire video URL based on the external party’s API response, we’ll construct the URL by defining the video host URL within our app and appending the video’s ID that we get back from the external party’s API response. This way, we aren’t entirely reliant on a potentially untrustworthy value from a third party. Instead, we’ll have some measure of ensuring we’re not injecting malicious code into the URL.</p>

<p>Then we’ll mark the video URL as trusted and bind it in the template. Your <code>VideoComponent</code> changes to this:</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-video',
  template: `
    &lt;iframe [src]="safeLinky" width="800px" height="450px"
  `
})
export class VideoComponent {

  // pretend this is from an external source
  public videoId = '12345';
  public safeLinky!: SafeResourceUrl;

  constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {
    this.safeLinky = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(`//videolink/embed/${this.videoId}`)
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now you’ll be able to show trailers of the K-Dramas on your site in an <code>iframe</code> in a much safer way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can’t be stressed enough. Ensure you trust the values before bypassing the out-of-the-box security protections you get from Angular!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great! So we’re done? Not quite. There are a couple of things to note.</p>

 Use ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation for extra security 

<p>Angular’s AOT compilation has extra security measures for injection attacks like XSS. AOT compilation is highly recommended for production code and has been the default compilation method since Angular v9. Not only is it more secure, but it also improves performance.</p>

<p>On the flip side, the other form of compilation is Just-in-time (JIT). JIT was the default for older versions of Angular. JIT compiles code for the browser on the fly, and this process skips Angular’s built-in security protection, so stick with using AOT.</p>

 Don’t concatenate strings to construct templates 

<p>Angular trusts template code and only escapes values defined in the template using interpolation. So if you attempt something clever to circumvent the more common forms of defining the template for a component, you won’t be protected.</p>

<p>For example, you won’t have Angular’s built-in protections if you try to dynamically construct templates combining HTML with data using string concatenation or have an API whip up a payload with a template you somehow inject into the app. Your clever hacks with dynamic components might cause you security woes.</p>

 Beware of constructing DOM elements without using Angular templates 

<p>Any funny business you might try using <code>ElementRef</code> or <code>Renderer2</code> is the perfect way to cause security issues. For example, you can pwn yourself if you try to do something like this.</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-yikes',
  template: `
    &lt;div #whydothis&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  `
})
export class YikesComponent implements AfterViewInit {

  @ViewChild('whydothis') public el!: ElementRef&lt;HTMLElement&gt;;
  
  // pretend this is from an external source
  public attack = '&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert(\'YIKES!\')"';

  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2) { }

  public ngAfterViewInit(): void {
    
    // danger below!
    this.el.nativeElement.innerHTML = this.attack;
    this.renderer.setProperty(this.el.nativeElement, 'innerHTML', this.attack);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Something like this might be tempting in a fancy custom directive, but think again! Besides, interacting directly with the DOM like this isn’t the best practice in Angular, even beyond any security issues it might have. It’s always wise to prefer creating and using Angular templates.</p>

 Explicitly sanitize data 

<p>The <code>DomSanitizer</code> class also has a method to sanitize values explicitly.</p>

<p>Let’s say you cook up a legitimate need to use <code>ElementRef</code> or <code>Render2</code> to build out the DOM in code. You can sanitize the value you add to the DOM using the method <code>sanitize()</code>. The <code>sanitize()</code> method takes two parameters, the security context for the sanitization and the value. The security context is an enumeration matching the security context listed previously.</p>

<p>If we redo the <code>YikesComponent</code> to explicitly sanitize, the code looks like this.</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-way-better',
  template: `
    &lt;div #waybetter&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  `
})
export class WayBetterComponent implements AfterViewInit {

  @ViewChild('waybetter') public el!: ElementRef&lt;HTMLElement&gt;;
  
  // pretend this is from an external source
  public attack = '&lt;img src=1 onerror="alert(\'YIKES!\')"';

  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) { }

  public ngAfterViewInit(): void {
    
    const cleaned = this.sanitizer.sanitize(SecurityContext.HTML, this.attack);
    this.renderer.setProperty(this.el.nativeElement, 'innerHTML', cleaned);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now you’ll have the image without the potentially dangerous code tagging along for the ride.</p>

 Consider Trusted Types 

<p>One more built-in security mechanism in Angular is setting up and using a Content Security Policy (CSP). CSPs are a specific HTTP security header we covered in the <a>first post</a> to help set up foundational security mechanisms.</p>

<p>Angular has built-in support for defining policies for a CSP called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/trusted-types">Trusted Types</a>. Trusted Types are a great way to add extra XSS security guards to your Angular app but isn’t supported across all the major browsers yet. If you are interested in learning more about setting up the Trusted Types CSP for SPAs, check out this great post from the Auth0 blog - <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/securing-spa-with-trusted-types/">Securing SPAs with Trusted Types</a>.</p>

<p>NIST compliance provides security standards for businesses handling federal information, but how do you meet these compliance regulations?</p>
<p>What is NIST compliance? NIST compliance is the National Institute of Standards and Technology regulations required for anyone handling sensitive information for government agencies.</p>
 What Is NIST? 
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is a nonregulatory body within the U.S. Department of Commerce that supplies standards and frameworks used by federal agencies and their partners to ensure sensible standards in IT infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, itself an amended version of the original FISMA law of 2002, was passed by Congress in order to define the rules and requirements for federal agencies (and contractors working with those agencies) related to managing data and securing IT systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support the efforts of the several regulatory organizations in charge of monitoring these agencies, NIST provides guidelines, requirements, and best practices over an entire landscape of security, risk management, and IT maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being “compliant” with NIST guidelines essentially means that your organization is complying with another set of requirements, of which NIST guidelines are the driving force. While there are some exceptions to this (for example, NIST 800-53), many compliance contexts will stem from highly specific situations related to different types of data and technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, NIST compliance overall can broadly be conceived as a cross section of three critical factors:</p>
 
 Types of Data: Compliance requirements will almost always apply to the types of data your organization will handle. NIST requirements will, under any circumstances, include guidance on different tiers of data sensitivity.&nbsp; 
 Types of Technology: For the most part, NIST regulations can apply across technology and only change depending on the use (for example, protecting data in transit versus data at rest in a server). However, some technologies, like cloud infrastructure, will have dedicated compliance frameworks.&nbsp; 
 Types of Service: Depending on the organization under consideration, regulations change. For example, a contractor handling sensitive data for an agency in the Department of Defense supply chain will have different requirements than a cloud service provider starting a contract with a nondefense federal agency. 
 
<p>Accordingly, maintaining NIST compliance for an organization will rely on understanding which NIST guidelines apply to the current context and technology.</p>
 What Are Common NIST Publications? 
<p>To support agencies and enterprises with regulatory requirements, NIST releases “Special Publications”, with each publication addressing a specific context, technology, or security need. Furthermore, many of these SPs are built around more robust expectations, like risk management or supply chain security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of overall cybersecurity and IT protection, there are a few major special publications:</p>
 NIST SP 800-53 
<p><a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf">NIST SP 800-53</a>, “Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations,” is a significant component of almost all federal (and many state) security standards. Essentially, this document serves as a large inventory of security and privacy controls, organized into several control families that include the following:</p>
 
 Access Control 
 Awareness and Training 
 Audit and Accountability 
 Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring 
 Configuration Management 
 Contingency Planning 
 Identification and Authentication 
 Incident Response 
 Maintenance 
 Media Protection 
 Physical and Environmental Protection 
 Planning 
 Program Management 
 Personnel Security 
 PII Processing and Transparency 
 Risk Assessment 
 System and Services Acquisition 
 System and Communications Protection 
 System and Information Integrity 
 Supply Chain Risk Management 
 
<p>Compliance with NIST 800-53 is often a prerequisite for other security frameworks in the federal space, including FedRAMP and FISMA.</p>
 NIST SP 800-63 
<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST 800-63</a>, “Digital Identity Guidelines,” defines guidelines for identity verification, authentication processes, and identity federation security. Generally speaking, these components will fall under three categories:</p>
 
 Identity Assurance Level (IAL): This defines requirements for government agencies and contractors who need to implement identity proofing processes, including live or virtual confirmation or official document proofing.<br>
 
 Authentication Assurance Level (AAL): This defines requirements for appropriate authentication levels, including necessary authentication types and technologies for single- and multi-factor authentication. 
 Federation Assurance Level (FAL): This defines required protocols and assertion types that may be used for compliant identity federation technologies.&nbsp; 
 
 NIST SP 800-171 
<p><a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r2.pdf">NIST 800-171</a>, “Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations,” is a particular NIST document that applies to Controlled Unclassified Information. CUI relates specifically to contract work within the Department of Defense supply chain and represents data that, while unclassified, is deemed sufficiently sensitive enough to warrant protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much like NIST SP 800-53, NIST 800-171 provides a list of security controls across different families like access control, maintenance, or risk assessment. These controls are slightly different, however, due to a different application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NIST 800-171, and an expanded document of additional controls titled <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-172/final">NIST SP 800-172</a>, are the core of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification.</p>
 Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-3 
<p>FIPS 140, “Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules,” defines the encryption and hashing algorithms acceptable for implementation in compliant systems.&nbsp;</p>
 FIPS 199 and 200 
<p><a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.199.pdf">FIPS 199</a>, “Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems,” defines three individual impact levels that serve as categorization methods for data sensitivity and IT systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three impact levels are as follows:</p>
 
 Low: The system’s loss of confidentiality or integrity of data would have limited adverse effects, including an agency losing capabilities to accomplish its mission, minimal financial loss, or minor bodily harm. 
 Moderate: The loss of confidentiality or integrity of data in the system would seriously impact stakeholders, including serious degradation of an agency’s capabilities, significant harm to individuals or assets, and financial loss.&nbsp; 
 High: The loss of confidentiality or integrity of data has a catastrophic effect on agencies and stakeholders, including the inability to operate, major or complete financial loss, and serious bodily harm, including loss of life.&nbsp; 
 
<p>FIPS 200, “Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems,” draws from FIPS 199 and provides guidelines on applying impact levels across different types of systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there are hundreds of NIST documents, these are generally documents cited by other publications. Other documents will help agencies and contractors apply general security (the Cybersecurity Framework) and risk management (the Risk Management Framework) practices, secure healthcare systems, and cloud infrastructure (FedRAMP).&nbsp;</p>
 What Is CMMC? 
<p><a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/about-us.html">CMMC</a>, mentioned earlier, is a security framework intended to protect CUI in DoD contractor systems. This information is not classified as Secret in any form, but it is considered mission critical and as such, should be protected from loss or corruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help contractors better address CUI security, the CMMC Authorization Board, as part of the DoD, manages the CMMC standard. This model organizes controls found in NIST SP 800-171 and NIST SP 800-172 as a path of “maturity,” where organizations can have different levels of sufficient security for different purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest version of this standard, dubbed CMMC 2.0, has a few overarching requirements:</p>
 
 Maturity Levels: CMMC 2.0 is organized into three maturity levels.
 
 Level 1 calls for contractors to implement 17 controls from NIST 800-171.&nbsp; 
 Level 2 calls for a complete implementation of all 110 controls found in NIST 800-171 and serves as the minimum level for an organization to handle CUI.&nbsp; 
 Level 3 introduces select controls of NIST 800-172 on top of Level 2 requirements and stands as a broad category for contractors handling major security issues like advanced persistent threats.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Third-Party Assessment: CMMC requires most organizations to undergo audits via certified third-party assessment organizations, all listed in a central directory called the <a href="https://cmmcab.org/c3pao-lp/">C3PAO Marketplace</a>. Level 1 (and select Level 2) contractors can waive the requirement for C3PAO audit in lieu of an annual self-assessment.&nbsp; 
 Plan of Action and Milestones: Earlier versions of CMMC disallowed contingent certification—that is, at the time of audit, a company was either compliant or not. Version 2.0 allows organizations, under approval from the CMMC-AB, to provide a POA&amp;M of corrective measures, including timelines for remediation, if it is deemed that they can feasibly become compliant within a specific time window.&nbsp; 
 
 Maintaining Security and Compliance with 1Kosmos 
<p>These standards or regulations call for some form of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-management/">identity management</a> and authentication security, often using MFA and biometrics. Businesses working with federal or defense agencies must have a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/secure-authentication">secure authentication</a> platform that can provide security, accessibility, and reliability without compromising usability in your organization.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID provides the following features:</p>
 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities in secure enclaves only accessible through advanced biometric verification. Our ledger is immutable, secure, and private, so there are no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

				  Indicio launches its marketplace solution to using and scaling verifiable digital credentials using open source technology.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Today, we launch Proven™ — a complete, decentralized ecosystem for using verifiable credentials to create, share, and verify data of any kind while preserving privacy and enhancing security.</p>
<p>It means the future’s here.</p>
<p>Sometimes called “self-sovereign identity,” or “user-centric identity,” or “reusable identity,” the open source technology behind Proven provides an authoritative way to authenticate any data without having to check in with the source of that data — or go through a third party.</p>
<p>“Verifiable credentials are a new foundation for trust in digital interaction,” says Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “They are a simple, powerful solution to the internet’s missing verification layer for people — but they go way beyond that. They can be used to verify the identity of devices and digital objects; they can verify any kind of data associated with an identity. And they deliver breakthrough privacy and security features. This technology does so much that we say it creates “Trusted Digital Ecosystems.”</p>
<p>Proven is designed to be a complete starter kit for creating your own Trusted Digital Ecosystem. It contains all the components needed to create, share, and verify data through verifiable credentials, along with continuous upgrades and customer support from Indicio’s experienced engineering team from integration through implementation.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make it easy to start using verifiable credentials by giving people an off-the-shelf solution,” says Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio. “To do that the product had to be complete. It couldn’t leave the customer searching for components and struggling with compatibility. It couldn’t leave the customer dependent on proprietary tech or struggling to master open source codebases. As leaders in the open source community, we believe open source is critical for adoption, scale, and innovation, but an unfamiliar codebase is still going to be a heavy lift for any development team. Proven removes this obstacle, while remaining fully open source so a customer can develop on it to meet their needs.”</p>
<p>“We all believe in the power of this technology to solve chronic problems in digital interaction,” says Dahl, “but we also see Proven as a gateway to opportunity. We’ve seen our customers win awards for building Trusted Digital Ecosystems. Now, we want to seed that innovation as widely as possible. With our experience as market leaders in decentralized identity, we know what works. We know what’s needed. Proven is it.”</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — July 11th to July&nbsp;17th  Global and local regulators taking action towards a regulated crypto industry. <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s weekly recap. The crypto regulatory landscape continued buzzing last week, with global regulators &amp; financial bodies announcing their intention to reign in the digital assets market. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> South Africa to Implement Crypto asset Rules by&nbsp;2023 <p>Africa’s third-largest economy, South Africa, will regulate cryptocurrencies as financial assets by 2023, with Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA) overseeing the crypto sector in the country. This announcement was made by South African Reserve Bank Deputy Gov. Kuben during the PSG-hosted online series on July&nbsp;12.</p><p>Experts consider this decision a masterstroke because of the growing popularity of crypto assets among South Africans. For instance, with crypto regulation, the South African government will finally put an end to the use of digital assets for financing illicit activities, such as terrorism financing, money laundering, and tax&nbsp;evasion.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/south-africa-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies-as-financial-assets-by-2023-d95ed18aa4da">https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/south-africa-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies-as-financial-assets-by-2023-d95ed18aa4da</a>.</p> Financial Stability Board (FSB) to Present Crypto Regulatory Framework at G20 Meet in October This&nbsp;Year <p>A global regulatory body that tracks &amp; recommends measures for the global financial ecosystem, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), recently published a report titled “FSB Statement on International Regulation and Supervision of Crypto-asset Activities.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1547642186421792771?s=20&amp;t=Sxhz_PJWtiH0RJIwxyQ6TQ">Image Source</a>)<p>In the report, FSB highlighted the current crypto market turmoil to point out the vulnerability and volatility of digital assets, including stablecoins. The financial regulator also stressed that the fallout from the crypto market could also extend to the broader financial industry, i.e., short-term funding&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Thus, a robust and effective regulatory framework is a must to offset the negative impact of crypto assets and simultaneously encourage the underlying technology’s growth. This is why the FSB is currently preparing a crypto regulatory framework, which it will present during the G20 finance ministers &amp; central bank governors meet in October this&nbsp;year.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P110722.pdf">https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P110722.pdf</a>.</p> International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSC) Forms two Working Groups to Prepare Recommendations Over Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>A global group of securities regulators, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSC), recently published a roadmap for crypto policy recommendations.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1547975803970826241?s=20&amp;t=Sxhz_PJWtiH0RJIwxyQ6TQ">Image Source</a>)<p>The document states that the Fintech Task Force, a group within IOSC, will work on preparing crypto asset policy recommendations over the next 12–24 months. Their focus will be on market integrity and investor protection.</p><p>There will be two subgroups within the Fintech Task Force, with the U.S. SEC heading the Crypto and Digital Assets group and the U.K. FCA heading the Decentralized Finance&nbsp;group.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD705.pdf">https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD705.pdf</a>.</p> European Central Bank Raises Alarm Over Stablecoin &amp; Decentralized Finance <p>The European Central Bank published a Macroprudential Bulletin titled “A Deep Dive Into Crypto Financial Risks: Stablecoins, DeFi, and Climate Transition Risk” on 11 July. The bulletin underlines the need for robust regulation and oversight over DeFi &amp; stablecoins.</p><p>The authors argue that robust regulations are a must before the interdependence of the crypto industry and the traditional financial sector grows further. They also point out the TerraUSD debacle saying that stablecoins may not be as stable as they were made out to be. In fact, “Stablecoin” may just be a misnomer.</p><p>That said, there’s no denying that stablecoins play a central role in the global crypto trade. Thus, a possible impact of a broader stablecoin market crash could not be rolled out, as it could destabilize the global financial stability.</p><p>As for the DeFi, the authors call it a novel approach to offering financial services. But they also state that there’s nothing new about it as it’s just an improvised version of traditional financial players with technology at its core. Thus, the authors bat for the “Same Business, Same Risk, Same Rule” approach for DeFi, demanding effective supervision and regulations over&nbsp;it.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_1~750842714e.en.html">https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_1~750842714e.en.html</a>.</p><p>The regulatory fire continues to spread wider, with many international bodies calling for robust crypto regulations amid the increasing intertwining of the digital assets market with the traditional financial sector. Interestingly, international financial watchdogs, such as the FATF, are leading the&nbsp;charge.</p><p>For instance, FATF has urged countries to implement the Travel Rule urgently. Thus, sooner or later, all countries will have to adopt it. And at that point, all Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) will have to strictly comply with the Travel Rule provisions. Thus, VASPs should stay prepared.</p><p>All that VASPs need to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution (TRS). And we have the best solution to suggest: Veriscope. It is the only solution against the much-dreaded sunrise issue, thanks to Veriscope’s historic look-back feature.

Earn rewards by participating with ONTO. Follow the <a href="https://t.me/ONTOAnnouncement">@ONTO Wallet Official Announcement</a> on Telegram for more&nbsp;details.   On-Chain Activity   147 total dApps on MainNet as of July 18th,&nbsp;2022.  7,097,560 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 3,925 from last&nbsp;week.  17,747,183 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 21,700 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1547649632074858496?s=20">weekly Community Call</a>, discussing why the integration of multi-chain and multi-application wallets has become the mainstream trend. It was concluded that wallets will become the gateway for Web3. ONTO Wallet is considered able to stand on its own due to the deployment of its DID and reputation system, providing security for users and projects.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion led by Benny, an Asian community Harbinger. While introducing Ontology’s fourth Carnival event, he discussed with community members the role and meaning of decentralized identity: it can help users control their digital identity without the intervention of third parties, and create a seamless, accessible and verifiable ecosystem that solves many problems in fields such as NFTs and&nbsp;DAOs.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   The Ontology 4th MainNet Anniversary Carnival is still in progress. The current activities include the staking event and the joint celebration activities. Celer Network, Unifi Protocol, and Wing Finance are celebrating the 4th anniversary with Ontology, inviting global users to experience cBridge, uTrade, and the Wing FlashPool (Ontology EVM) to earn a share of the&nbsp;rewards.  The third OWNInsights “People, Platforms, Web3” was released, written by Ge Li, Ontology Business Development Manager. From the perspective of Web3 participants, it analyzes how individuals can control their own datasets to expand their influence through DID, and effective ways to build Web3 based on the OWN infrastructure. This article was first published on the well-known Chinese blockchain media Cointelegraph Chinese, and was recommended by the platform.  Ontology and the cross-chain Swap project StealthEX held an AMA event. While introducing the project and development to the community members, it also answered questions for the community members. The selected questions were rewarded with&nbsp;ONT.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Cointelegraph — “<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-will-help-realize-the-true-vision-the-metaverse-hopes-to-achieve">AI will help realize the true vision the Metaverse hopes to&nbsp;achieve</a>”</p><p>“Many of the metaverse projects that have been launched are in the world of gaming. However, more often than not, these projects simply consist of standard gaming features combined with virtual reality and NFTs. A true metaverse, in the sense of a digital parallel universe to our analog world, a digital simulated reality in which participants can take part in diverse social, economic, entertainment and artistic activities in a variety of self-organized groupings and environments, has yet to be realized.”</p><p>Achieving this full vision requires easy portability for users, a large and diverse set of metaverse fragments, and simple user construction of new locations and spaces. Decentralized Identity (DID) technology is considered to be a more suitable technology to provide digital identity for the Metaverse — users with DID will be able to flexibly (one-stop) log in to different Metaverse scenarios without creating different identity accounts; at the same time the personal data recorded in the DID can be seamlessly ported in different scenarios without worrying about data collection or&nbsp;leakage.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-july-12-18-2022-1620cce989c1">Ontology Weekly Report (July 12–18, 2022)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Kizuna empowers people to message each other completely privately, without the involvement of a central server. The app is open-source and is being developed by a non-profit group called the <a href="https://www.hcij.org/en/">Holochain Institute of Japan</a>.</p><p>This is the first article in a series of mini-spotlights on projects using Holochain. Many of these projects, like Kizuna, are quietly but busily working away towards a public product. They’re actively building, testing, and refining their prototypes as they get ready for Holochain’s beta release. You may not hear much from them, which is one reason I’ve chosen to write these updates.</p> Kizuna at a glance <p>Description: Kizuna is a messaging application for one-on-one or group conversations. Messages are kept private by high-strength encryption.</p>  GitHub: https://github.com/hc-institute-japan/kizuna  Demo videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcCJmnU5ryA">1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqdTac7J9s8">2</a>  Website: https://kizuna.foundation/en/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn/  Newsletter: https://kizuna.foundation/en/newsletter/  <p>We asked the Kizuna development team a few questions about their project, and the answers were intriguing.</p> Why is Kizuna being built? <p>You might ask, why another private messenger? There are a lot of them out there already — Telegram, Matrix, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Signal, Viber, and so on, all give you various promises of message privacy. What’s different about Kizuna? What does it hope to contribute?</p><p>Well, all of these services have one common feature: you connect with your contacts through central servers. (<a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is somewhat of an exception; their software is open-source and you can run your own server if you like.) Sure, the server may not be able to read your encrypted messages, but it can still see who’s connecting with whom, who belongs to what group, how often you send messages, and other bits of extra information about you. This sort of data is candy for companies who build their businesses on selling insights about your behaviour to advertisers.</p><p>You may not be worried about this, but advertisers aren’t the only customers. If you live in an oppressive regime that’s secured the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat#State_surveillance_and_intelligence_gathering">cooperation</a> of one of these messenger services, your privacy could be a matter of survival.</p><p>But maybe you’ve found a messenger service that you trust. They’ve promised not to reveal your private metadata to anybody, and you believe them. But they can still go out of business, suffer a server crash, get hacked, or get bought up by a less honest company (along with all your data). What happens to the connections you’ve made then?</p><p>To the developers who came up with Kizuna, these compromises were unacceptable. They believed that we ought to be able to simply talk to each other. Form our own connections and take care of them ourselves. Without someone in the middle.</p><p>As Tatsuya Sato, lead developer and a faithful Holochain supporter who’s translated many of our articles into Japanese, explained to us:</p><blockquote>We believe that the conversations we have with others reflect our private lives. Messaging applications built in the last two decades allowed us to make hundreds of those conversations instantaneously. However, the messages we send in those conversations are being used as a tool for companies to sell our data, serve ads, and influence our choices. We've also seen an increase in messaging and social media applications getting hacked by attackers since they have an incentive to target applications that store millions of people's data in one place. Kizuna is a Japanese word that roughly translates in English to "deep bond" (there really is no direct translation that catches the full nuance of the word Kizuna in English) among people. We believe that humans have the innate desire to build and nourish this deep bond with others. A belief that this bond that we nurture with others should never be capitalized on.</blockquote><p>He and his colleague Nicko Pangarungan go on to say that “without the fear of data compromise, we can share our deep and intimate selves with others — which is the very nature of kizuna”. And that’s their ultimate goal — to enable deep bonds online.</p><p>On the practical level, here’s a feature-by-feature comparison to other popular private messengers.</p> Why did they choose Holochain? <p>Because the Kizuna team were committed so deeply to putting users in control, it made sense to build the service on peer-to-peer networking technology. This kind of internet communication doesn’t need servers, except in limited cases to punch through home firewalls and help people discover each other.</p><p>They could’ve designed from scratch, but that would have been a lot of work. If there were already a set of basic building blocks they could use for the networking layer, that would let them focus on the things that matter most to them — giving people a simple, reliable, private way of talking to each other. Fortunately, Sato had already been introduced to Holochain by his colleagues, and it seemed to be an appropriate starting point.</p> So, why is Holochain important for the Kizuna team? <p>Perhaps most importantly, it embodies the very principles they’re building into their product. I’ll let Sato and Pangarungan explain it themselves:</p><blockquote>Holochain is not just another development framework for making things easier (in some ways it does not 😅). But what makes us root for Holochain are the very principles it represents and the ideals of an online community that strives to realize – agent centricity, data security, peer-to-peer networks. These principles align themselves with what we believe are essential for a messaging app or any online application.</blockquote><blockquote>To put it simply, they chose Holochain because it puts users first by design.</blockquote><p>In particular, they like the fact that applications and their data are hosted by the people who use them, which means that your ability to access them can never be restricted by someone else. You and your group are in charge.</p><p>As they hinted at the beginning of that quote, it has come with its challenges. As a young technology, Holochain is still changing rapidly, which means they've had to rewrite pieces of their code. And a lot of the things that make Holochain work—for instance, the 'deterministic validation' that forms the foundation of an application's 'immune system'—have been quite a learning journey.</p><p>But through all this, they're still committed. Besides all the reasons Holochain was the right fit for their needs, they say there are other benefits. The learning they've invested in has paid off in new ways of thinking about problems. And they love the supportiveness of the community, core dev team, and learning materials (something Mike Gamble of RedGrid also mentioned in a previous article). They also love the Rust programming language and WebAssembly, and feel that they're both a good bet for future-proofing their work.</p> How are they using Holochain? <p>There are a few specific Holochain features that they're putting to good use in the design of Kizuna.</p>  As part of its deterministic validation rules, a Holochain application can add a 'membrane' that controls who can join its network and communicate with other members. The team uses this to restrict access to messages—each group conversation is a separate copy of the core messaging code with its own isolated, encrypted network. This is what lets Kizuna claim it has 'spy-proof group messaging' --- if you can't join the network, you can't access its messages. And unlike server-based private messengers, even your metadata (group membership, for instance) is safe from prying eyes.  Holochain exposes best-practice cryptographic functions to applications for further security. You may wonder, if each group's messages are encrypted as they travel, why does this matter? Well, in spite of the fact that Holochain encrypts network messages with TLS (the same protocol that secures your banking and online shopping), there's a slim chance that a session could be compromised. Kizuna uses Holochain's crypto functions as an extra layer of protection. Additionally, they plan to use Holo hosting to support web and mobile users, and this prevents hosts from reading users' stored messages.  The team appreciate how well Holochain supports inter-application interoperability. As long as the application is designed to support it, a user can access the functionality and data of any application they have installed from any of their other applications. This means that Kizuna's core could be embedded into other Holochain applications, and it also means that it could gain surprising new features thanks to the creativity of other developers.   How can I get involved? <p>If you're interested in supporting the team, the best thing to do right now is <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/newsletter/">sign up for their mailing list</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn/">follow them on Twitter</a>. They did public release of their app in 2021 but Holochain has advanced sine then and their codebase has followed. They are preparing for a public release soon!</p><p>In the meantime, you can also check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/rqdTac7J9s8">public demos</a> they've given during <a href="https://youtu.be/OcCJmnU5ryA">Holochain Ecosystem Sessions videos</a>, or take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/hc-institute-japan/kizuna">codebase on GitHub</a>.</p><p>And of course, you can go to their <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/">website</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn/">Twitter</a> to get a better picture of what they've got planned and what motivates them.</p>

 85,000 USD in OCEAN available for Web3 data economy projects! And, retroactive grants are&nbsp;coming:)  1. Introduction <p>Hello, Ocean Community! <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the&nbsp;month.</p><p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. Section 2 first describes key numbers and dates for round 20. Section 3 describes significant design changes to OceanDAO, including a move to retroactive grants only. Section 4 describes the rest of the OceanDAO structure, such as how voting&nbsp;works.</p> 2. Key Info for Round&nbsp;20 <p>Funding available. Round 20 has 85K USD worth of OCEAN, or 200K OCEAN available, whichever is larger in USD terms. (Calculation is on August 8th, 2022, midnight UTC.) 75K USD is available via the regular grants program, and 10K USD via a new micro-grants allocation.</p><p>Round 20&nbsp;Dates</p>  Proposals Submission Deadline is August 2 at midnight&nbsp;UTC  Add OCEAN to Voting Wallet by Proposal Submission Deadline.  Two-day proposal Due Diligence Period ends August&nbsp;4  Voting Starts on August 4, and Voting Ends on August&nbsp;8  Funding Deadline on August&nbsp;22  <p>All times are midnight&nbsp;UTC.</p> 3. Improvements to&nbsp;OceanDAO <p>This section describes some significant changes in OceanDAO, as of round 20 and&nbsp;21.</p> Goals in Improving OceanDAO <p>In round 20 and 21, we are tuning OceanDAO towards these&nbsp;goals:</p>  A culture of contributing. Biasing to those who engage for the love of doing it. An engaged, diverse community.  Quality outcomes. Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results.  Improve DAO efficiency. More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking&nbsp;overhead   Approaches in Improving OceanDAO <p>Towards these goals, we have received feedback from the community on possible approaches. After many iterations of discussion and design, we have arrived at the following.</p><p>The main pillar will be: for R21, retroactive grants only. Here, you can only ask for a (retroactive) grant for some outcome you’ve already achieved. It’s a philosophy of “show don’t tell”: show us what you did, rather than tell what you’re going to do. Community voting then is about choosing how much they’d like to reward you for the outcome. We’re doing this for R21 not R20 to give opportunity for the community to prepare. <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c">Here’s a great post</a> to learn more about the “why” of retroactive grants.</p><p>Second, we have come to see that OceanDAO is better suited to earlier-stage funding of projects. As projects get stronger, they are in better shape to seek funding from <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Ocean Shipyard</a> grants program, complementary ecosystem grants programs, investors (angels, VCs), and potentially launching their own token. Given this, we have tuned OceanDAO to give more space to earlier-stage projects compared to experienced projects, by capping total funding amount for a project or&nbsp;team.</p><p>There is a category of experienced teams that has been using its funds to dole out micro-grants to their own sub-community. It doesn’t fit Shipyard because it’s not building-oriented; it isn’t appealing to investors because it’s grants; yet it’s of value to the Ocean ecosystem and we want to encourage this. So, we have earmarked 10K USD to the first recipient of this: Algovera.</p><p>Between retroactive grants (which help for DAO efficiency) and shifting experienced projects to Ocean Shipyard and other sources, we feel comfortable reducing the total amount available per month, from 100K USD to 85K USD (including the 10K micro-grants). We tuned the funding ceilings per tier accordingly.</p><p>The final change aims to give more breathing time to proposals, to voting, and to reduce OceanDAO ops overhead. Some related numbers are tuned accordingly.</p><p>We now summarize the changes for R20 and&nbsp;R21.</p> Round 20&nbsp;Changes   Total funding of 85K USD, including 10K micro-grants  100K USD max. per project in lifetime, and 100K USD max. per team in lifetime (not including Advisors). There may be rare exceptions for long-serving teams that aren’t meant to be investable; this includes Ocean Ambassadors and Ocean&nbsp;Pearl.  The max funding that a project can request for this round is: New project tier 3K USD, existing projects tier 7.5K USD, and experienced projects tier 15K USD. “Tier” details are&nbsp;below.  We encourage everyone to start building proactively (compare Round 21&nbsp;updates)   Round 21&nbsp;Changes <p>R21 starts August 8th,&nbsp;2022.</p>  Retroactive Grants only. That is: projects apply for grants that fund outcomes of work they did, not plan to do. Projects will still submit their work via the Proposal Portal; demo videos are encouraged! Voting is still by OCEAN holders. Projects can still demo their work in Town Halls to receive voter support. We recognize no project is the same and expect Deliverables to vary across Project Categories.  Total funding of 170K USD available  The max funding that a project can request for this round is: New project tier 5K USD, existing projects tier 10K USD, and experienced projects tier 20K USD. “Tier” details are&nbsp;below.   Discussion on&nbsp;Changes <p>By implementing these changes we hope to improve OceanDAO’s culture and values towards a more collaborative web3 data ecosystem. This includes helping steward and supporting projects that are actively building rather than promising future&nbsp;results.</p><p>We also want to support projects that want to build fun, constructive products around Ocean, whether that is a DeFi protocol, or a collection of t-shirts. By focusing on the work and presenting it to the DAO before entering the voting period, we hope to steward good practices for creating value in any environment.</p> 4. OceanDAO Grants Structure <p>The rest of this article describes other aspects of in round 20, with respect to the DAO’s structure and related parameters. We always include these in each round’s “announcement” blog post, for thoroughness.</p> Grant Funding Categories <p>OceanDAO provides grants for a variety of project&nbsp;types.</p>  Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself   Submitting Proposals <p>We encourage you to submit proposals early. Please, reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016658239610920">here</a> for guidance.</p><p>To submit proposals, use the <a href="https://seed.oceandao.org/">Proposal Portal</a>. A tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Write-Proposal">here</a>.</p><p>Please do not submit proposals through Ocean Port directly anymore, as you will run the risk of not having your proposal accepted.</p><p>Proposals will then be published on Ocean <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-16/76">Port</a>. Port is also where voters can read proposal details.and ask questions.</p><p>All proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO voters receive funding, shortly after voting concludes.</p> Project Standing <p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing, to stay eligible in future Funding Rounds. The <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> has&nbsp;details.</p> Funding Tiers <p>Teams start in the tier of “new project”, and then can achieve higher tiers by delivering on their grant promises. The higher the tier, the more funding that a team can&nbsp;request.</p><p>The Funding Tiers&nbsp;are:</p><p>1. New&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN&nbsp;token.</p> Earmarks <p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 6K USD available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  6K USD for New Teams (non-outreach category)  3K USD for New Teams (outreach category)  17.5K USD for 2nd/3rd Time&nbsp;Teams  13K USD for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  35.5K USD for General (all projects)  <p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>There are specific tech that the core team and Ocean technical community would love to see built. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Round-20-Tech-Earmarks">Here’s the list for R20</a>. It’s earmarked, therefore building towards it gives you “air cover” wrt competition.</p><p>Note that R20 has earmarks for integration with Chainlink, TheGraph, Filecoin, and Arweave. (Ocean Shipyard specs for these are not quite ready&nbsp;yet.)</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech WG discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p> Other OceanDAO&nbsp;Features <p>Quadratic Funding: Instead of projects receiving a binary grant (either 100% or 0% of what they asked for), all proposals will receive grant amounts relative to how much engagement they received, while still abiding by other rules such as Earmarks and Funding Ceilings.</p><p>Minimum USD amount: Projects can set a minimum they are willing to accept, and return the funds if they are insufficient. This drastically increases probability for receiving a grant, on top of Quadratic Funding. (You can reduce your Deliverables commenting in Port, if you only receive a minor part of your overall requested budget.</p><p>Voting Boosts: Quadratic Voting helps distribute voting power better. The more projects you vote on, the higher your overall voting power becomes. In addition, you can now visit the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">Web3 Portal</a>, register yourself with BrightID and receive a 400% voting&nbsp;boost.</p><p>Voter Delegation: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/delegate">Voter Delegation</a> allows participants to delegate their decision making to ecosystem members they trust, easily assigning their voting power to other addresses. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-voting-improvements-qv-delegation-multi-chain-c393afc7f5e6">More info&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>Funds recycling: Any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the treasury.</p> Working Groups <p>Here are the&nbsp;WGs:</p>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ouW4oxKEgyaBeiZew4bd9HFwbNUiwReK0A2Ww7jmAik/edit#">Core Tech WG</a>.

   The 2022 ForgeRock Consumer Identity Breach Report shows that identity-based breaches are up. Again. 

 More stolen credentials, more unauthorized access, more breaches, more, more, more 

<p>Would it surprise you to know that breaches due to unauthorized access rose last year? Probably not, but I'll spare you the suspense: they did, and they now account for half of all breaches. But numbers and percentages on their own can only tell us so much. As we dug into the data, a story began to emerge that we can all learn from. And the story is exactly why we spend months each year compiling research from around the world to create these reports.</p>

<p>By the start of 2021, consumers had become accustomed to conducting much of their personal business online, from shopping and banking to paying taxes, taking classes, holding family gatherings, and conducting tele-health visits with their doctors. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, retail e-commerce alone grew 18.3% in 2021<a>1</a>, even after the massive, pandemic-fueled growth of 31.8% in 2020<a>2</a>. Each of these activities involves an online account that may contain a vast amount of sensitive information that is at risk of exposure or theft in the event of a breach.</p>

<p>Today, the average consumer has 100 online accounts, and, in a perfect world, each account would have unique and complex usernames and passwords. But that is not reality. Many people use simple (easy to guess) passwords and many more reuse passwords on multiple sites. To make matters worse, most people rarely change their passwords. All these practices present a huge challenge to IT and security professionals trying to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Stolen username and password combinations are regularly bought and sold on the black market. Attackers can use these stolen credentials to attempt new attacks. How many are we talking about? In 2021, more than 2 billion records containing usernames and passwords were stolen. These stolen credentials may very well be the source of new breaches that we'll have the unfortunate task of reporting on next year.</p>

<p>What else did the report reveal?</p>


			
			  The average cost of a breach in the U.S. was $9.5 million. 
				 Unauthorized access was the top vector in 2021, accounting for 50% of all breaches. 
				 In the U.S. retail sector, the average cost of a single breach rose by nearly two-thirds to $3.27 million. 
				 There was a 297% increase in breaches due to third-party or supply-chain attacks. 
			 
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

 If we had no passwords, there'd be no passwords to steal 

<p>The report contains several "best practices" sections for mitigating the types of risks the report exposed. But one practice stands out in light of the relentless rise in crimes involving login credentials: Making passwordless authentication part of your MFA strategy.</p>

<p>Passwordless authentication improves both the security and the ease of use for online access, while greatly diminishing the usefulness of credentials stolen by cybercriminals. Phishing and other social engineering attacks rely on users to enter their login credentials, but in a passwordless world, such attacks are fruitless. Same with keylogging, which records a user's keystrokes as a way to get account numbers and login information. And, because no credentials are sent over the internet, they can't be intercepted or subject to man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks.</p>

<p>The industry's biggest players — Apple, Microsoft, and Google — have announced plans to enable passwordless authentication across multiple devices, browsers, and platforms. We believe the time for passwordless is now, so we can eliminate the threat of stolen credentials. We look forward to seeing the number and severity of breaches retreat, and going passwordless is a great way to start that trend.</p>

<p>Now, I want to dive a little deeper into the vulnerabilities. In this short post, we’ll dive into Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and look at the built-in help you get when using Angular.</p>

 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection 

<p>In the <a>previous post</a>, you learned how an attack for CSRF occurs when an agitator uses your active session for a trusted site to perform unauthorized actions. We also learned there’s built-in support from browsers to mitigate attacks with <code>SameSite</code> attributes on cookies, validating the authenticity of the request on the backend, and potentially having the frontend send a CSRF token to the backend for every request.</p>

<p>The mitigation strategies primarily require server-side work, except for that game of CSRF token sending, where the client needs to send the token back in a way the backend can validate.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When using CSRF tokens, it’s essential to tie the token to the user’s session so that the backend can validate the request. The most common ways are through the patterns called <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#synchronizer-token-pattern">Synchronizer Token Pattern</a> and <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#double-submit-cookie">Double Submit Cookie</a>.</p>

 Synchronizer Token Pattern 

<p>The Synchronizer Token Pattern requires the backend to store the user’s session information and match it up with the CSRF token for validity. This pattern can be used with SPAs but is a better match for web apps that use forms with post methods for requests, such as:</p>

   <code>&lt;form action="https://myfavekdramas.com/fave-form" method="POST"&gt;
  &lt;label for="name"&gt;What is your favorite K-Drama?&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name"&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Save my favorite K-Drama&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt; 
</code>   

<p>Submitting this form POSTs to <code>https://myfavekdramas.com/fave-form</code> using the <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> content type. CSRF is especially susceptible when using non-JSON data.</p>

 Double Submit Cookie Pattern 

<p>Sadly, this pattern doesn’t involve double the cookies—it’s a dual submission. Sad news indeed for chocolate-chip cookie fans. 🍪🍪 😢 But the good news is the Double Submit Cookie Pattern doesn’t require the backend to track the user’s session to the CSRF token.</p>

<p>In this pattern, the CSRF token is a separate cookie from the user’s session identifier. The client sends the CSRF token in every request, and the backend validates that the CSRF token cookie and the token in the request values match. This pattern is more common for SPAs.</p>

 CSRF support in Angular 

<p>Angular has built-in support for a flavor of the Double Submit Cookie Pattern, where the CSRF token is automatically added as an HTTP header for every backend request once you have a CSRF token in a cookie. Nice!</p>

<p>The <code>HttpClientXsrfModule</code> automatically adds an interceptor for your HTTP requests. The interceptor grabs the CSRF token from a session cookie named <code>XSRF-TOKEN</code> and adds the token value to outgoing requests in the HTTP header named <code>X-XSRF-TOKEN</code>. Then your backend is responsible for verifying the values for the cookie and HTTP header match.</p>

<p>To add this handy helper, add <code>HttpClientModule</code> and the <a href="https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpClientXsrfModule"><code>HttpClientXsrfModule</code></a> to your module’s <code>imports</code> array.</p>

<p>If you don’t like the default names, you have the option of configuring the names of the cookie and HTTP header like this:</p>

   <code>imports: [
  HttpClientModule,
  HttpClientXsrfModule.withOptions({
    cookieName: 'Pecan-Sandies',
    headerName: 'Top-Of-Page'
  })
]
</code>

<p>Congratulations to W3C on the ratification of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID v1.0</a> as a W3C standard!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Though Blockchain Commons has only lightly touched upon DIDs to date, they nonetheless are a crucial part of our history. In addition, their ratification today as an international standard demonstrates the ability of a cooperative commons to incubate ideas that will eventually be adopted as standards to be used widely by governments, corporations, and individuals.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen began experiments with decentralized identifiers in late 2014 when he built on his previous work as the co-author of the TLS spec by suggesting a <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherA/revocable-self-signed-tls-certificates-hack">hack to TLS</a> that associated X.509 certificates with Bitcoin addresses and then allowed revocation of those certs by spending the Bitcoin. It was a decentralized solution to the centralized problem of certificate authorities. Around the same time, Dave Longley and Manu Sporny were exploring similar ideas around identifiers and decentralization in the <a href="https://web-payments.org/minutes/2014-05-07/">W3C Web Payments Community Group</a>. Then, in 2015, Christopher began work with Drummond Reed and others from Respect Network as part of the XDI Registry Working Group, whose goal was to explore possibilities for a decentralized and rootless registry of identifiers; a strawman was presented at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/A_Registry_Directory_~_based_on_BLOCKCHAIN_that_is_ROOTless_%26_NOT_Centralized">IIW 21</a>.</p>

<p>That presentation led to interest from Anil John of the Science and Technical Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, who was looking for alternative identifiers to the US Social Security Number that also provided clear differentiation between identifier and authenticator functions. Christopher helped to coordinate a community effort that led to both Drummond Reed at Respect Network and Manu Sporny at Digital Bazaar submitting proposals to the Identity Management and Data Privacy R&amp;D Program. The goal was to show wide community interest in decentralized identity. Not only did both companies receive a grant, but they also both received additional funds through round two of the program.</p>

<p>Much of the community’s support for DIDs then occurred through the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop</a> that Christopher founded in November 2015 to mark the upcoming 25th anniversary of PGP. One of the five papers that were published following that first workshop was the massive <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure paper</a>, which included as one of its design principles that “each principal must be in complete control of their current identifier/public-key binding”, but had not yet settled on questions such as whether decentralized identifiers should be usernames or UUIDs.</p>

<p>DIDs themselves saw their first major workshopping at RWOT 2, which was run in conjunction with the <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-holds-inaugural-summit-at-the-united-nations-7112014add5e">ID2020 conference</a> at the United Nations in May 2016. Drummond Reed and Les Chasen of Respect Network produced the initial paper on the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/blob/master/final-documents/requirements-for-dids.pdf">Requirements for DIDs</a>, supported by that US Department of Homeland Security grant. That was also the workshop that brought in Manu Sporny’s work on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, which required an identifier to work with, and so was quickly dovetailed into the project.</p>

<p>Christopher has been constantly involved with the iterations of the DID specification that followed, beginning with the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/did-implementer-draft-10.pdf">DID Data Model and Generic Syntax Implementer’s Draft 01</a> that was written at RWOT 3 in San Francisco, where he worked with Drummond and Les as well as Ryan Grant. More designs followed across the subsequent Rebooting the Web of Trust events, including a massive DID breakout room at RWOT 5 in Boston, which spent the length of the conference refining the growing spec. Many, many more people contributed to the evolution of the design, among them: Daniel Buchner, who spearheaded Microsoft’s support of DIDs and with Microsoft’s backing created the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF); and Joe Andrieu, who led the work on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/">DID Method Rubric</a>, a way to evaluate DID methods, as well as foundational use cases and engagement models for decentralized identity such as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/joram-engagement-model.pdf">Joram</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers document</a>.</p>

<p>As part of his work on the preliminary DID spec, Christopher became one of the co-chairs of the W3C Credentials Community Group alongside Joe Andrieu and Kim Hamilton Duffy. There, he co-authored and co-architected the DID spec to be presented to the W3C. He has also been an invited expert at the DID Working Group since its advent in September 2019. Today, July 19, 2022, that Working Group’s work became a “W3C Recommendation” and thus an official international standard. Our congratulations to DID Working Group chairs Daniel Burnett and Brent Zundel, to DID editors Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, Markus Sabadello, and Drummond Reed, and to everyone who has spent the last seven years working on turning the ideas incubated in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and elsewhere into a real specification that can change the world by giving people control over their digital identifiers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Besides his work on the DID spec itself, Christopher is also one of the architects alongside Kim Hamilton Duffy, Ryan Grant, and Dan Pape, behind <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">the BTCR DID method</a>, which has been dubbed the <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/podcasts/23899/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids-didbtcr">“granddaddy of DIDs”</a>. This DID method anchors decentralized identifiers on the Bitcoin blockchain, very similar to the X.509 cert revocation that Christopher was advocating back in 2014.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons was founded in 2018 to support the ideas and community that came out of Rebooting the Web of Trust. Though Blockchain Commons proper has not published much on DIDs, except as an educational topic for our interns, it continues to be a future focus for us, with the idea of decentralized identifiers being a crucial assumption for our Gordian architecture. Christopher also continues to be an invited expert on Verifiable Credentials 2.0 and has advocated for the DID spec throughout its ratification process. Our expertise with DIDs and with BTCR leaves this all as an open opportunity for Blockchain Commons. If you’ve considered becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor</a> of Blockchain Commons and are interested in DID work, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a> to discuss the topic!</p>

Kuben announced the government’s plans to regulate cryptocurrencies as financial assets by 2023 while attending a PSG-hosted online series on July&nbsp;12.</blockquote><blockquote>- Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA) will oversee the crypto industry in South&nbsp;Africa.</blockquote><blockquote>- Experts believe crypto asset regulation will end the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering, terrorism financing, and tax evasion in the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><p>A move that could be defined as a big moment for the crypto assets industry in the African region, the regional economic powerhouse, South Africa, may soon regulate cryptocurrencies as a financial asset in the country. The rainbow nation’s central bank, South African Reserve Bank, recently announced that it will legalize digital currencies as financial assets by&nbsp;2023.</p> The Fact of the&nbsp;Matter <p>Attending a PSG-hosted online series on July 12, South African Reserve Bank Deputy Gov. Kuben announced plans on crypto legislation with the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA) overseeing the nascent sector as a regulator.</p><p>With this move, the South African central bank plans to put an end to the use of digital assets in funding illicit activities, such as terrorism financing and money laundering, among other&nbsp;things.</p><p>Speaking of the popularity of digital assets in the rainbow nation, recent statistics prove that crypto assets are slowly becoming a popular investment option among South Africans. For instance, Punchng’s latest report states that 22% of South African adults hold cryptocurrencies, which puts the number of crypto users in the country at around 7.6&nbsp;million.</p><p>Thus, it was about the time when the country’s central bank took concrete steps to regulate the industry to support innovation &amp; protect investors at the same time. And there couldn’t have been a better time, as global regulators have begun coordination to draft international regulations considering the borderless nature of crypto transactions.</p> What Changes for Virtual Asset Service Providers Such as Exchanges? <p>Once the proposal is implemented, virtual assets service providers will have to collect personal information from their users under the compulsory Know Your Customer (KYC) clause. Besides this, exchanges will also have to highlight the risks of trading digital assets to its&nbsp;users.</p><p>__________________________________</p><p>South Africa’s digital assets regulation is just one of many recent regulatory changes to come for South African Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). For instance, the adoption of FATF’s Travel Rule could be next. After all, FATF has been urging countries to fasten up the adoption of the Travel Rule, and South Africa being a FATF member since 2003, could very well be the next country to enforce it. That is why South African VASPs must begin preparing for it beforehand.</p><p>All VASPs need to begin complying with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Service Provider (TRSP).

We are excited to support their work on this through Shipyard and look forward to bringing the results to the community.”</blockquote><p>Timothy Carter, Chief Executive Officer, commented:</p><blockquote>“Ocean Protocol Foundation and the Shipyard program go above and beyond to support the work we do to bridge the gap between the blockchain and the real world. Our tools and services will add credibility to data assets on Ocean Market, unlocking altogether new use cases like ESG asset verification and more. Shipyards support allows us to move ahead with confidence in our development.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.athena.tech/">Athena Protocol</a> is building IoT and edge computing infrastructure solutions for bridging the gap between the offline world and the blockchain world to ensure transparency, equity and algorithmic accountability in automated data collection and verification processes.</p><p>To facilitate the ethical collection of data on a global scale, Athena Protocol leverages on SolarPunk Network (SPN). The SPN provides an alternative to current architectures in that it facilitates near real-time monitoring without sacrificing privacy; securely bridging the gap between stakeholders and the decision-making processes that affect their lives, their communities, and their ecosystems.</p><p>Athena Protocol will enable data verification on Ocean Protocol and, thanks to the $50,000 in $OCEAN granted by Ocean Shipyard, they will be able to commit to transparent and clear deliverables.</p><p>By the end of September 2022, Athena will develop an interface for proposing data assets and managing asset portfolios. This will allow the team to focus on processes and procedures for Social Credentials &amp; data NFTs. On top of this, the first ESG asset verification suite v1 will be accredited and published, allowing for multi-token contracts for algorithmic consensus. The Athena team is also ready to launch 2 pilots with full-scale ESG MRV project proponents to quantify ecosystem services.</p><p>By the end of December 2022, it’s envisaged that the design and token model for $ATHENA will be finalized, and the ESG verification suite v2 will be built and deployed.</p><p>If you are a passionate individual or team looking to build something valuable on Ocean Protocol, this is your best chance to kickstart your dream project and be a pioneer of the new data economy.

 Hire of Mike Kiely signals major growth plans in UK and beyond 



<p></p>



<p>Manchester and London, 18 July, 2022 <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow group</a>, a leading European provider of identity proofing and digital identities, has appointed Mike Kiely as its Sales Director for Financial Services. Based in IDnow’s Manchester office, Kiely brings with him decades of experience in data and biometrics, most recently heading up Identity and Biometric sales at GBG, and will drive the firm’s substantial growth ambitions in the financial sector in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kiely’s appointment represents the firm’s ongoing investment into the UK market, with ambitions to become a leader in the UK’s financial services industry, and a global leader in the sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenting on his appointment, Mike Kiely said: “As a German business, IDnow has built a platform that meets some of the world’s strictest compliance and regulation requirements, while offering the broadest portfolio of identity proofing methods. As such, it is in an incredibly unique position, able to support businesses in their identity proofing needs who are looking to scale beyond their UK territory, and into geographies that are inherently difficult to penetrate such as France and Germany.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For me, this represents a hugely exciting opportunity to work with a talented team; I am able to help drive growth here in the UK thanks to the market-leading identity proofing platform IDnow offers while supporting the business to reach its global growth ambitions with a particular focus on financial services.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kiely’s appointment comes after IDnow reported a significant rise in order intake for the first quarter of 2022 of 95%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow group offers the broadest identity proofing portfolio on the continent via a single platform, from automated to human-assisted, from purely online to point-of-sale. This mirrors the trend towards the acceleration of advanced digital business models from single-product identity verification towards comprehensive identity proofing platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benjamin Haas, Senior Sales Director at IDnow, added: “Since we acquired ARIADNEXT and IdentityTM last year, we have been immersed in our growth plans and in bolstering our position as one of the strongest identity verification and document signing players in Europe. Mike’s appointment signifies our continued efforts to establish a substantial foothold, particularly in the UK’s flourishing financial services sector. Mike’s experience will help ensure our expansion ambitions become a reality, so we’re really excited to welcome him to the team.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Thales, a global provider of advanced technology solutions, with more than 80,000 employees worldwide, and an established business unit for Digital Identity and Security, has announced the acquisition of OneWelcome, one of the leading European providers of CIAM (Consumer IAM).</p>
<p>While the acquisition will provide OneWelcome with a go-to-market capability on a global scale, there are interesting options beyond that. OneWelcome delivers CIAM and B2B management capabilities, consent management, authentication support, and policy-based access control. Thales, on the other hand, has a variety of cybersecurity and identity technologies in its portfolio, including biometrics and identity verification, digital wallets, and data security and data protection.</p>
<p>The combination of authentication of customers with strong authentication technologies such as biometrics and identity verification, and consent management with data protection and data security, brings the potential for leveraging the strengths of both vendors for delivering innovations to the market.</p>
<p>As for every acquisition, there is the question about the potential impact on existing customers. Due to the fact that the portfolios of both companies are complementary, but with almost no overlaps, the risk for existing customers of products becoming end-of-life as a consequence of this acquisition, appears to be negligible. &nbsp;On the other hand, there is a strong potential for customers to benefit from improvements provided by joining the forces of these two vendors. This will depend on Thales effectively leveraging the strong potential that this acquisition holds.</p>
<p>For more information on OneWelcome’s CIAM and consent management capabilities, have a look at this Executive View report on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev80945/onewelcome-customer-identity-and-b2b-identity">OneWelcome Customer Identity and B2B identity</a> and this Leadership Compass report on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80532/privacy-and-consent-management-2022">Privacy and Consent Management 2022</a>.</p>

 Supercharge your Job Search with Next-gen&nbsp;Tech <p>Many people are wary of looking for and applying to jobs online, and rightly so, as job scammers are on the rise, targeting their prey more creatively than&nbsp;before.</p><p>So, how can we help people quickly ascertain genuine opportunities while matching their skills and experience to suitable roles? About 70 students from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore attempted to answer this question during the LemmaTree x NTU POCathon.</p><p>They came up with impressive submissions, ranging from job portals showcasing verified jobs and companies to scam alert verification features. The 17 teams that participated in this event wowed the judges with their amazing POCs, created in less than four weeks. The top 6 teams were shortlisted for an in-person demonstration in NTU, where all four judges cracked their heads to select the top 3 winning&nbsp;teams.</p><p>Here are the great ideas of the top&nbsp;6:</p><p>1235</p><p>1235 proposed a verified and optimized human resources platform for companies and applicants to create verified customizable profiles. Their POC, powered by Affinidi’s APIs, strives to help companies verify their job applicants’ backgrounds and vice versa. It was awe-inspiring for the judges to see a product coded within such a short&nbsp;time.</p><p>BYTEMASTERS</p><p>BYTEMASTERS’ proposed solution grants access only to verified companies, ensuring that job-seekers do not have to deal with any job scams while receiving a curated list of suitable roles powered by AI technologies. Although they did not manage to create a fully functional application, they made an interesting comparison of current solutions and their loopholes before crafting an all-rounded solution.

<p>TL;DR</p>  Dock launches <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Web3 ID</a>, a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first  Organizations can request private user data in a privacy-preserving way that users can trust based on the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity while leveraging the security of cryptography  Developers can build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and authenticate people securely with Web3 ID  <p>Table of Contents</p>  Fully Own and Control Your Web3 Identity <p>Our team has been working diligently to keep building robust decentralized identity solutions and we are excited to announce the launch of Dock’s Web3 ID. Web3 ID is a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first. It allows organizations to securely request private user data and the user has the option to give permission to reveal the information or confirm it without revealing the data at all. Web3 ID enables people to fully own and control their digital identity. </p><p>Centralized digital identity management systems are broken. Organizations storing all their users' data on centralized servers are putting it at greater risk by creating a "honey pot" where a hacker can breach and access all that information at once. These systems use centralized identifiers, like email addresses and phone numbers, that can be used to track users online, correlate their data (data can be traced back to someone's identity), and share that information with third parties without people's knowledge. Cybercrimes cost victims <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cybercrime-victims-318-billion/">$318 billion annually</a> and <a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/new-research-most-people-have-70-80-passwords-21103705">the average person manages between 70 to 80 passwords</a>, which creates a bad and unsecure user experience. Web3 ID solves many of these problems.</p><p>“Web3 ID is essential in fulfilling the vision of Self-Sovereign Identity that gives people full control and ownership over their digital identity. We’ve developed game-changing technology that enhances security, efficiency, and privacy for individuals, developers, and organizations.”–Nick Lambert, CEO at Dock</p> Key Benefits of Web3 ID <p>Individuals</p><p>Organizations</p><p>Developers</p><p>Sign in to websites and apps securely with blockchain-based authentication while fully owning and controlling your digital identity</p><p>Can request and instantly verify private and personal data from their users without the need to store it</p><p>Build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords</p><p>Create as many Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as you want for different relationships and interactions to prevent user tracking and correlation (your data can be traced back to your identity by signing in to websites and apps with Google for example)&nbsp;</p><br><p>Creates more trust between organizations as users know that Web3 ID preserves their privacy and they are always in control of their data. Dock, as an auth provider, does not store any user data.</p><p>Removes inefficient authentication processes&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Prevent account takeover through the security of cryptography</p><p>Less stored data can help reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks</p><br><p>Easy integration with OAuth</p><br><p>Privacy is protected with the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (proving something about yourself without revealing the data that supports the proof) and selective disclosure (choosing only a specific part of a credential to share) technology</p><p>Improved security with public-key cryptography</p><br><p>Request data directly from users</p><p>People store their digital identity credentials in a non-custodial identity wallet (you have sole control of your private keys)</p><br><p></p><br><p>With crypto wallets, developers can verify publicly available data on the blockchain. With Web3 ID, developers can verify private user data.</p> What is Web3? These are the ways people sign in to Web1, Web2, and Web3.<p>Before we dive into the details of Web3 ID, it’s important to understand what Web3 is. </p><p>The term “Web3” (often called Web 3.0) was coined by Gavin Wood, a computer scientist who is the co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot, and Kusama. Web3 is the next evolution of a decentralized internet where platforms and apps will be built on blockchain and provide increased data security, scalability, and privacy for people. A key part of Web3 is that users should own and control their online identity and reveal parts of their identity only when they choose to do so. </p> The Evolution of the Internet These are the key characteristics of Web1, Web2, and Web3. Key Differences Between Each Phase of the Internet <p>Web1</p><p>Web2 (dominant form of the internet now)</p><p>Web3</p><p>Creators were usually developers&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive and social web</p><p>Smart applications</p><p>Read-only, static websites that mainly had text or image content without much interactivity</p><p>Era of centralization where a large share of communication happens on platforms owned by a handful of corporations like Amazon and Facebook&nbsp;</p><p>Decentralized internet where Web3 applications and websites run on blockchain&nbsp;</p><br><p>Anyone can be a creator with platforms like YouTube and interact with the content</p><p>People can own and prove the ownership of digital assets</p><br><p>Data is owned, shared, and controlled by third parties</p><p>People can interact with content without needing authorization from a centralized platform like Facebook that can remove content and responses posted on a platform</p><br><p>Read-write websites&nbsp;</p><p>You own your data that is securely stored in a non-custodial identity wallet&nbsp;</p><br><p>Computers retrieve and show searched information but don’t understand the meaning behind the websites</p><p>Semantic web that makes internet data machine-readable, which provides richer and more accurate search results based on someone’s intent and meaning rather than keywords alone</p> Centralized vs. Decentralized Digital Identity Management <p>A digital identity is a way of verifying who we are online and the body of information about an individual or organization that exists online. A digital identity is an extension of current physical ID documents like passports, bank cards, and driver’s licenses. </p><p>The data that forms a digital identity includes: </p>  User names and passwords  Search history  Social security number  Buying history  Social media profiles  <p>Problems With Web2</p><p>Web3 Solutions</p><p>Never-ending data breaches (when information is stolen, viewed, transmitted, copied, or used by an unauthorized person)</p><p>Data is decentralized and stored by users in their wallets which reduces the risk of large scale data breaches</p><p>Platforms and apps are owned by a central gatekeeper</p><p>Platforms and apps are owned by users&nbsp;</p><p>Monetization of apps incentivize companies to sell information based on personal data</p><p>People are rewarded for using, building, and maintaining Web3 projects without sharing data unless the user allows it</p><p>Companies own your data and you have no control over how it is used</p><p>Full ownership and control of your data</p><p>Companies often track, store, and share user data</p><p>Prevents tracking and information is only shared when you give consent</p><p>Organizations can remove access to data and services any time&nbsp;</p><p>No central authority can take away your control over your digital identity</p> How Web3 ID Works <p>In Web2, people authenticating their identity have to manage an endless number of emails, passwords, and other login information, all of which are centralized digital identifiers, while data is being spread more on the internet. And when people log in with Google or Facebook that don’t require someone to create a new account, they are still sacrificing their privacy. But with Web3 ID, people can create their own Decentralized Identifiers to securely prove their identities and credentials to sign in to apps and websites without compromising their privacy.</p><p>Web3 ID is:</p>  A collection of the user's Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)  Blockchain-based authentication and authorization system  <p>How people can sign in with Web3 ID:</p>  An app or website uses a QR code to request cryptographically verifiable digital identity or credential data that is securely stored in someone’s digital identity wallet app  The user scans the QR code and is prompted to confirm the specific data needed to access or use an app or website  Coming soon to Web3 ID: People will be able to use privacy techniques like Selective Disclosure (only share a specific part of a credential) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (prove something about themselves without revealing the data that supports the proof)   The Role of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) in Web3 Identity Management <p>With Web3 authentication, a Decentralized Identifier is used. A DID is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is stored and managed in a digital wallet. </p><p>Here is an example of different DIDs on a Dock Wallet:</p>With Dock's Web3 identity wallet, you can create and manage as many DIDs as you want for different interactions.<p>A DID: </p>  Doesn’t contain personal data or wallet information  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Transferable across apps and websites  Can connect to multiple Verifiable Credentials that contain cryptographically secured user data  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Someone can have as many DIDs as they want which prevents correlation and tracking. Correlation and tracking are when companies like Google and Facebook track data back to a user because the same centralized identifier is used to sign in to multiple websites and apps. To enhance data security, someone can create a DID for professional purposes where they give permission to share their educational credentials while applying for a job and use another DID that’s only used to access online gaming websites.</p> The Role of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in Web3 Identity Management Conveniently manage your Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in your Dock Wallet.<p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. For example identity documents, certifications, licenses, and degrees can be issued as Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Key points:</p>  Personal user data is securely stored as Verifiable Credentials which are kept in a digital wallet app  Multiple Verifiable Credentials can be attached to a DID  Verifiable Credentials are not stored on the blockchain   Web3 Identity Benefits For Individuals, Organizations, and Developers <p></p> Web3 ID Benefits For Individuals   Enhanced user experience: Secure sign-in with blockchain-based authentication with one digital wallet by simply scanning a QR code rather than storing an endless number of logins and passwords   Full control and ownership of your Web3 identity: People can store all of their digital identity credentials in a non-custodial mobile wallet (you have sole control of your keys)  Portability: Your digital identity can be verified anywhere, any time  Privacy and security: Prevent account takeover with cryptography and privacy is protected with the use of Zero-Knowledge Proof and Selective Disclosure technology  Security: Data is only shared when you give permission and is protected with cryptography &nbsp;   Web3 ID Benefits For Organizations   Request private data from users while protecting their privacy: Securely request private data to access your service, or verify eligibility  Create trust between organizations and users: Authenticate users securely with the use of DIDs to prevent tracking and data correlation that traces data back to a user  Reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks: Because user data is not stored on a centralized database, organizations are less exposed to hacks and data breaches   High security: Data is protected with public-key cryptography   Improves efficiency in the verification process: Credentials can be verified instantly which reduces the cost and resources of managing digital identities   Web3 ID Benefits For Developers   Authenticate users securely and efficiently: Eliminates the need for user passwords and prevents account takeovers  Easy to integrate with OAuth: Just use your favorite OAuth library and update the domain/URLs in the configs  Open source and open standards: Web3 ID is <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/auth-server">open-source</a> and it uses the Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials W3C open standard   Industry-Leading Decentralized Identity Technology Solutions <p></p> Pioneers in Web3 Identity <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> has been a pioneer in the revolutionary Web3 space since 2017 and our team has some of the brightest minds in the blockchain industry. Our mission is to solve universal problems with data solutions and we have been building cutting-edge <a href="https://dock.io/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity</a> and <a href="https://dock.io/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> technology that will act as a gateway to Web3 in the future. </p><p>We work with organizations to adapt and innovate the Web3 ecosystem by helping them make documents, certificates, and credentials become digital, tamper-proof, and instantly verifiable. </p> Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Web3 Authentication (coming soon) <p>Private user data should never be on a public blockchain. In Web3 authentication, Zero-Knowledge Proofs are a cryptographic method where no passwords or identity data are exchanged. ZKPs basically allow you to prove information or identity without revealing the actual data itself, which greatly enhances online privacy and security. </p><p>Examples of how ZKPs are used: </p>  If you want to buy alcohol, you can confirm to the cashier that you are at least 18 years old without revealing your birth date by presenting the credential on the digital wallet app  Rather than typing your password to log in to a website, you can send a proof that you “know your password”  You can prove that you have a certain number of tokens without disclosing your full wallet balance   Conclusion  <p>Dock has launched Web3 ID, a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first. Web3 ID is a collection of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). A DID is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is stored and managed in a non-custodial digital identity wallet. Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. </p><p>Web3 is the next evolution of a decentralized internet where platforms and apps will be built on blockchain and provide more data security, scalability, and privacy for people. Web3 enables people to fully control and own their digital identity. </p><p>Key Benefits of Web 3 ID: </p>  For individuals: Enables secure sign in to websites and apps, full control and ownership of their digital identity, prevents user tracking, and prohibits account takeover  Organizations: Safely request private user data from users while maintaining their privacy, operate with improved security with public-key cryptography, and reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks by storing less data  Developers: Enables developers to build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords, easy OAuth integration, and remove inefficient authentication processes<br>  <p><br></p><p><br></p>

There's a lot in this release, so we've broken it down into five ways its new capabilities can help solve some of your most pressing business challenges.</p>

  
    <p>Elevate the Customer Experience. This is really the name of the game. By providing a seamless omnichannel experience, your customers can get what they need when they need it. To this end, we extended our commitment to open standards. We've enabled extensions on top of the OAuth2 standard so you can configure more ways to authorize per application. This means users can get to what they need within their applications quickly, post login. </p>
   
 <p>Another cool feature in 7.2 is what we refer to as circuit breakers. In a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">hybrid world</a>, network latency between cloud and legacy or on-premises applications could result in a poor experience. With circuit breakers, you can reduce traffic to applications and also let users know if an application is slow or unavailable. The ability to push out a simple message, "We're running a bit slow today, be right with you," can help to reduce user abandonment and churn.</p>

  
    <p>Save Time and Improve Efficiency. Administrator time is valuable. As you scale up to support your ongoing digital transformation initiatives, it's important to ensure your IT administrators have tools that help them efficiently optimize the overall health and success of your IAM solution. To this end, we've added a couple of nodes to our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access</a> drag-and-drop orchestration engine. The Set Custom Cookie Node and Dynamic Scripting Node help to pass along stored attributes to clients and applications, easing the integration of legacy applications. Another, the Identity Management Groups (IDM Groups) Node uses group membership information to make smarter decisions about user journeys.</p>
   
   Improve Security. Everyone wants greater security, but in the identity world, security needs to be balanced and nuanced. Financial-grade API, or FAPI, has become the de-facto high-grade security and privacy standard for financial use cases, and many organizations beyond financial services are adopting FAPI. We already supported the standard, but with 7.2, we are delivering Enhanced FAPI Support, which is increasingly required with open banking standards.

   
   
    <p>Enhance Scalability, Performance, and Resiliency. IAM needs to perform at internet-scale. Users who experience slow returns due to sluggish retrieval of identity-related information will drop out of an enrollment or a transaction. For 7.2, we have optimized Big Indexes with our Directory Services. This means that as your directory grows to millions (or even billions) of consumer, workforce, and IoT identities and attributes, you can rest assured that your users and applications won't be left hanging when a big data search is required.</p>
   
   
    <p>Platform Extensibility/Low-Code/No-Code. Drag-and-drop orchestration is a game-changer. There are just too many use cases and changing business roles for developers to be intensively coding and testing every user journey. With 7.2, new nodes such as Dynamic Scripted Configuration Node, Set Custom Cookie Node, and Passthrough Authentication Node appear like magic in the orchestration library and deliver new capabilities with just a few clicks.</p>
   
 <p>In addition to those outlined here, there are many, many more features in the 7.2 release.

<p>Amid tumultuous world markets, the crypto community <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/06/crypto-losses-hit-670m-in-q2-up-52-from-year-ago-period/">took losses of $670M in Q2</a>, up 52% from one year ago. Even through these strong headwinds, many companies doubled-down on building break-out products, including Civic. And, on the last day of the quarter, European Union regulators agreed on the long-debated Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/30/eu-agrees-on-landmark-crypto-authorization-law-mica/">landmark crypto authorization law</a> aimed at protecting investors and setting up stricter standards for stablecoin issuers. On their coattails, US regulators released the <a href="https://blockworks.co/us-regulators-release-first-of-many-reports-on-crypto-following-exec-order/">first of many reports on crypto</a> following the Biden administration’s executive order. As regulatory momentum gains speed, Web3 identity that is secure, private, reusable and verifiable on-chain becomes more important daily. Civic is ready to answer that call!</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>In Q2 of 2022, Civic introduced a new tool, called uniqueness verification, that determines user individuality in order to build diverse communities. When a project uses Civic Pass for uniqueness verification, each user is limited to using one wallet, making NFT drops or any other Web3 use cases a more fair and controllable experience across the board. The Ocean Explorers NFT project will be <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-bot-protection-for-oceans-explorers-drop/">the first project to use</a> uniqueness verification, and NFT buyers can <a href="https://civic.me/#oe-get-civic-pass">sign up for their uniqueness verification now</a>, in advance of the mint.</p>



<p>In other product news, Civic also launched a <a href="https://docs.civic.com/integrations/dao-governance">Civic Pass integration for Realms</a>, the preeminent DAO governance platform on Solana, during a hackathon for AthensDAO. Civic Pass for DAO governance adds a host of new features for DAOs, including Sybil resistance, one-person-one-vote systems and quadratic voting systems. It also allows for bot resistance, and age and location restrictions. For DAOs to be successful in the real world, they must have a broader and more nuanced toolset for managing their communities. Civic Pass is designed to give DAOs the tools they need without sacrificing user privacy.</p>



<p>In partnership with the Solana Foundation, Binance.US and others, <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-trm-labs-partner-against-crypto-fraud-with-chainabuse/">Civic partnered with TRM Labs</a> to support Chainabuse, a multi-chain reporting tool that allows crypto users to report illicit activity to a public forum. Our goal with TRM Labs is to advance fraud detection capabilities.</p>



<p>We also partnered with Anchorage Digital, which provides a best-in-class custody framework. We selected Anchorage to <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-taps-anchorage-digital-for-custody-of-cvc-utility-token/">help us scale</a> our growing business. We are also excited that Anchorage now offers CVC token support for any interested CVC institutional holders.</p>



<p>Civic joined the NFT community at NFT NYC with the announcement of our new uniqueness pass for the Ocean Explorers project and with the launch of Civic.me, a new consumer product for displaying digital assets, currently in alpha. Our leaders spoke at event conference panels about stopping mint meltdowns (Chris Hart, CEO) and evolving standards for NFT 2.0 (JP Bedoya, CPO). We also sponsored the <a href="https://twitter.com/MonkeDAO/status/1534581058641055745?s=20&amp;t=2m6NW9rw3c9JAUHiOw4ZqQ">MonkeDAO event</a> and the Superchief Gallery / Snowcrash event while we were in town. Finally, we made our entrance to the event sporting new colors, including Civic Orange, which was part of a greater rebranding effort, <a href="https://hookooekoo.co/magazine/nft-nyc-preview">in collaboration with Hoo Koo E Koo</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, we were proud to collaborate with our non-profit partner, Identity.com, on a white paper about <a href="https://github.com/identity-com/gateway-whitepaper/blob/main/gateway-whitepaper.pdf">The Gateway Protocol</a>, which outlines the technology underlying Civic Pass.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>In the second quarter, Civic accumulated a total online readership of more than 130 million viewers, as a result of press releases and news media coverage about <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-bot-protection-for-oceans-explorers-drop/">uniqueness verification</a> and our partnerships with <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/announcing-the-launch-of-chainabuse-the-multi-chain-scam-reporting-tool-that-empowers-crypto-users-against-fraud">TRM Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/civic_taps_anchorage_digital_for_custody_of_cvc_utility_token/prweb18751345.htm">Anchorage Digital</a>, in publications such as Yahoo! Finance, MarketWatch and Benzinga. Stories about the TRM Labs partnership appeared in <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/147601/trm-labs-unveils-community-driven-scam-reporting-platform">The Block</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-giants-co-launch-chainabuse-platform-to-water-down-rising-scams">Cointelegraph</a>.</p>



<p>In Q2, our leaders penned several op-eds for Cointelegraph and Newsweek. Our CEO, Chris Hart, opined about <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/what-makes-company-web3-1718220">what makes a company Web3</a> and how to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/metaverseweek/2022/05/26/how-to-prevent-the-metaverse-from-becoming-a-nightmare/">prevent the metaverse from becoming a nightmare</a>. And, our CPO, JP Bedoya, shared a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/metaverseweek/2022/05/27/who-are-we-in-the-metaverse-and-how-do-we-prove-it/">vision of digital identity in the metaverse</a>. Our VP of Engineering, Dan Kelleher, commented on <a href="https://blockworks.co/house-of-sempronias-departure-from-dao-sparks-further-concerns-over-dao-governance/">ways that DAOs can be more successful</a>.</p>



<p>Coming Soon</p>



<p>Though we’re barely into Q3, we’re already racing ahead toward our next product announcements. We are looking forward to the Ocean Explorers mint, which will use our uniqueness verification to diversify its community membership and protect against bots. And, you can also expect to see more announcements related to civic.me, which allows you to privately manage your Web3 identity, presence and reputation, including your NFTs.</p>

 Dragonfly Fintech named Finalist of G20 TechSprint CBDC challenge by BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia <p>BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia have officially announced the finalists for this year’s G20 TechSprint CBDC challenge and we are delighted that Dragonfly Fintech, an innovative fintech solution provider utilizing ProximaX’s blockchain protocol, has been shortlisted as one of the finalists.</p><p>The full <a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p220712a.htm">press release</a> is as&nbsp;follows:</p> BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia announce finalists of G20 TechSprint CBDC challenge   Twenty-one teams have been shortlisted, out of almost 100 teams worldwide.  Competition attracted proposals from a diverse range of competing organisations and&nbsp;teams.  Winners to be announced in October ahead of G20&nbsp;Summit.  <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Bank Indonesia, under the Indonesian G20 Presidency, today announced the shortlisted finalists for the G20 TechSprint challenge on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p><p>The 2022 competition <a href="https://www.bis.org/hub/2022_g20_techsprint.htm">was launched in April</a>. The BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia published three operational challenges and invited a wide range of stakeholders, including innovators, entrepreneurs, developers, data scientists and telecommunications experts worldwide to develop innovative technological solutions to them. The problem statements prompted participants to develop solutions to build effective and robust means to issue, distribute and transfer CBDCs; to enable financial inclusion; and to improve interoperability and better connect payment&nbsp;systems.</p><p>As part of the Indonesia Digital Economy and Finance Festival ahead of the meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, the shortlisted teams demonstrated their solutions to Bank Indonesia, the BIS and experts invited from central banks around the world. They also participated in a CBDC Masterclass to glean practical insights into some of the CBDC experiments under way at the BIS Innovation Hub.</p><p>The shortlisted teams now have until the end of August to complete their prototypes, which will then be judged by an independent expert panel convened by Bank Indonesia. Winners for each of the three categories will be announced in October ahead of the G20&nbsp;Summit.</p><p>The 21 finalists were selected from around 100 participating teams from more than 15 countries and jurisdictions. The shortlisted teams range from large global corporations to more specialised fintechs.</p><p>“CBDCs have been attracting strong interest from central banks around the world. The proposals from the finalists offer unique and innovative technology solutions that could allow CBDCs to be widely adopted. This highlights the G20 TechSprint’s role in bringing together innovators and the central banking and regulatory community. We look forward to seeing the fully developed solutions,” said Ross Leckow, Acting Head of the BIS Innovation Hub.</p><p>“While the need to explore CBDC is inevitably high for central banks, design choices are still unresolved. In practice, we need to understand how policy goals, practical issues and technology intersect. The best way for central banks to prepare for this future of payments is to explore, experiment, conduct proofs of concept, pilot and develop CBDCs. With this in mind, the G20 TechSprint Initiative is a great opportunity for bright and ambitious young individuals as well as mature and well-established firms to show off their best potential and bring the most innovative and applicable solutions in CBDCs,” said Juda Agung, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor.</p><p>For more details about TechSprint, see <a href="http://www.g20techsprint.id/">www.g20techsprint.id</a>.</p> Shortlisted teams <p>Problem statement 1: Building effective and robust means to issue, distribute and transfer&nbsp;CBDCs</p>  BitMint  Dragonfly Fintech Pte.&nbsp;Ltd.

  <p>Data is widely recognized as the lifeblood of the modern enterprise. However, the exponential rate at which it is being generated means that it is crucial that organizations have the capability to manage it effectively to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.&nbsp;These requirements are instantly recognizable as the three principles of information security, which means that in the modern business context, data and security are inextricably linked. But businesses can only use and protect the data they know about, which is why Data Catalogs are becoming increasingly important in the context of optimizing the value&nbsp; of business data.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at the emerging role of Data Catalogs for a variety of use cases, with specific emphasis on Data Governance and Data Privacy. He will list and explain core capabilities he expects to see in such solutions, and will talk about the trends in the market.&nbsp;Sam Gillespie, Data Governance Offering Manager at OneTrust will explain the business benefits of trust in data, how to achieve that, and how to use it to build an enduring relationship with consumers. He will also discuss why strong collaboration between data, privacy, marketing, and ethics teams is essential to building trustworthy data-driven practices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/protect-govern-data-you-know"></a>

 Stakers can claim DF4 rewards. DF5 will start when veOCEAN&nbsp;ships.  1. Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to data asset stakers for higher data consume volume (DCV) and&nbsp;stake.</p><p>DF Round 4 (DF4) is part of DF Alpha phase. DF4 counting started 12:01am Thu Jul 7, 2022, and ended 12:01am Jul 12, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were available. LPs can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>Catalyzed by recent events, veOCEAN will replace pools as the DF staking mechanism. DF will resume when veOCEAN is launched, within 3&nbsp;months.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, details on DF4, and plans going&nbsp;forward.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As an LP (staker), here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  For each network with rewards (where you staked): select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)  <p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF4 Input Parameters <p>DF4 is the fourth week of DF overall, and fourth week of DF Alpha. DF Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>DF4 parameters were the same as DF1. The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included these parameters.</p> 4. Changes to Ocean Market and DF&nbsp;Schedule <p>Over the past weekend, Ocean pools encountered a new attack vector, where a malicious actor found a way to drain OCEAN from pools. The Ocean core team did near-term triage action to mitigate further attacks. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-changes-3384fd7e113c">This blog post</a> has details. Because of this, DF counting was paused after 5 days, not the usual&nbsp;7.</p><p>Beyond triage, the team updated its plans: Going forward, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a> will be the main mechanism for staking OCEAN, for curation of datasets, and for Data Farming. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools to achieve similar functionality for staking and curation.</p><p>Pool functionality will be removed from Ocean Market. Data Farming is on pause, and will resume when veOCEAN launches, within 3 months. DF will pick up where it left off: in DF5, the first week of DF&nbsp;Beta.</p> 4. DF4 Output&nbsp;Stats <p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid 1), Polygon (137), Binance Smart Chain (BSC: 56), Energy Web Chain (EWC: 246), and Moonriver (1285).</p><p>Only Polygon had nonzero DCV in DF1, so we focus on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Due to the attacks over days, volume and stake were winding down. Polygon stake averaged 1,090,424 OCEAN across many pools.

<p>Permissionless and permissioned blockchains are being used every day, but how do you figure out which one you should use?</p>
<p>What does permissionless mean? Permissionless means that it does not require authorization. In most cases, this refers to permissionless blockchains that are open to anyone, where users can remain anonymous and no one entity controls the blockchain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Blockchain and How Does It Work? 
<p>A blockchain is an immutable ledger, a record within a system of transactions that represents the activity on that network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the desire for a distributed transaction system has been around for a few years. The invention of Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency more broadly, brought this technology into the limelight. Discussing Bitcoin can help explain how a blockchain will typically operate.</p>
<p>Generally, a blockchain in a cryptocurrency network will work through the following processes:</p>
 
 Transaction: A user exchanges a token (in this case, a bitcoin) with another user. At the heart of any blockchain, rooted in the exchange of immutable tokens, is the notion that the record of this exchange is available to the governing mechanisms of the exchange network. In the case of Bitcoin, this is a public ledger, but in private systems, this may function differently.&nbsp; 
 Peer-to-Peer Network Transmission: The security and function of a crypto network operate through advanced encryption (hence the name “crypto”). Transaction information is encrypted, organized into “blocks” of collected transactions unique to that transaction and signed with a complex key as a block signature.&nbsp; 
 Validation: To ensure that the entries in the chain are legitimate, the network will employ a validation mechanism. In the case of public blockchains, this includes a “proof-of-work” (POW) process (where other nodes perform reversed cryptographic operations on the signature to verify it) or “proof-of-stake” (POS) systems (where nodes put up tokens as a “stake” as a part of the verification process).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Block Clusters and Ledger Commit: Blocks that have been validated are then placed at the end of the ledger, committed and immutable. At this point, the extension of the ledger record is unchangeable without a dramatic effort, including forking the entire chain.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While Bitcoin serves as the origin point for blockchains, the core technology has rapidly evolved to find application in specialized and enterprise systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Permissionless Blockchain? 
<p>The biggest change from the original conception of a blockchain was to try and fit the technology into modern, security-oriented contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public form of the blockchain was technically secure because it was resistant to brute-force attacks and double-spending. However, it’s not a technology you could trade sensitive information on because that information would become visible to everyone on the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address these issues, there has been a general split between two types of blockchain organizations:</p>
 
 Permissioned Systems: Pseudo-decentralized blockchains that operate in private enterprise contexts for data management. 
 Permissionless Systems: Public, radically decentralized blockchains. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Permissionless Blockchains 
<p>Permissionless blockchain ledgers are notable for their radical decentralization. This includes mechanisms for full transparency of transactions, open-source development models, and a lack of central authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permissionless blockchains have a few key benefits:</p>
 
 Open Architecture: Permissionless blockchains do not rely on a central authority to manage the network. This means that any user can add a node, and this node can participate in the network.&nbsp; 
 Transparency: Every transaction is open and visible to any node on the network—a critical part of maintaining auditable transactions. Conversely, however, this also means that any sensitive data put into a transaction is also completely visible. 
 Pseudo-Anonymity: Users on permissionless systems can remain semi-anonymous. That is, the user can participate through the use of an alphanumeric ID, and so long as no real connection is drawn between that ID and the user, it’s difficult to trace one from the other.&nbsp; 
 Radical Decentralization: The decentralization of user activity and transaction verification means that the network can grow quickly without the central authority to manage it. Everything operates via peer-to-peer mechanisms.&nbsp; 
 Network Resilience: While transaction data isn’t very secure, the network is resilient to attack. Hackers can only overwhelm the network by controlling 51% or more of the nodes, which is prohibitively difficult in a massive network.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Permissioned Blockchain 
<p>Permissioned blockchains are closed versions of their permissionless counterparts. While this changes the landscape of what they can do, it also empowers them to serve in many different roles that can bolster decentralized enterprise applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At its heart, a permissioned blockchain is one where a central authority controls aspects of the network, from user access to data encryption and access, typically through making the blockchain private.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of permissionless blockchains include the following:</p>
 
 Security for Sensitive Data: While permissionless systems provide robust network resilience, the trade off is that all data is transparent. Permissioned blockchains trade radical decentralization for more security around private information. This makes a permission system viable for storing personal data, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-on-blockchain/">login and identity credentials on the blockchain</a>, etc. 
 Customization: Permissionless systems are simple and overarching in their scope, meaning that they usually provide a baseline of functionality that can work over a huge scope of work. Permissioned systems, on the other hand, provide central operators more control over how that ledger works, what it stores, and who can use it.&nbsp; 
 Faster: Permissionless systems, especially those that rely on proof-of-work verification systems, are painfully slow with any appreciable scaling. Permissioned systems, on the other hand, can scale readily and with the need of their organization.&nbsp; 
 Decentralization: While the decentralizing capabilities of a permissioned blockchain aren’t as vast as those for their permissionless counterparts, they are still decentralized. This means that they don’t provide the same honeypot that, say, a database system might.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In general, enterprise permissioned blockchains, while less public and decentralized than their counterparts, are more secure, scalable, and configurable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1Kosmos: Permissioned Blockchain Service for Identity Management 
<p>Private blockchains are quickly becoming a potential successor to traditional databases. They are more resilient to attack, provide better ownership mechanisms for end users, and provide a stable platform for decentralizing <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/blockchain-authentication/">blockchain authentication</a> across a variety of devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1Kosmos is on the forefront of advanced permissioned blockchain technology in the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/decentralized-identity-did/">decentralized identity</a> management and authentication space. Features of our BlockID platform include the following:</p>

 Enjoy the latest OWN insights, by our Business Development Manager, Ge&nbsp;Li. <p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article from Ge Li, Business Development Manager at Ontology.</p><p>In the previous article, we made an in-depth analysis of blockchains, systems, and production relations. Which one contributes more to our real physical world, the production motivation promoted by the institution or the production efficiency accelerated by technological development, will be an ongoing topic. And such thinking can help us better understand the relationship between individuals, social organizations, and technological networks in the development of today’s world. It further illustrates the importance of identity and data-based blockchain technology innovation to the new generation of the Internet, and the Ontology Web3 Network (OWN) is a collection of effective solutions provided by Ontology for the Web3 exploration path.</p><p>This article discusses the human relationship with Web3 from a human perspective and the possible organization of individuals and networks in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>“The divine law (or truth) can be known, but it may not be the law well-known to you (or well-known truth) Things may be named, but names are not the things.” （Quoted from Tao Te Ching). People gain cognition due to various definitions and are also limited and confused by these definitions. For the same thing, there are substantial differences in individual cognition and feeling. Everyone has a unique personal world that overlaps with reality. Web3 is the general term for the next generation of blockchain-based decentralized network technology, and its essence is to maximize the interaction between the personal world, virtual reality, and the physical world through technology and institutional design. The data and network formed by individuals, and the multi-dimensional universe formed by overlapping and parallel data on the blockchain will become the future form. In a sense, the most interesting part of blockchains is not machine trust and value transparency, it is a magnifying glass. The innovation of cryptocurrencies has inspired people to reshape all kinds of existence in more autonomous ways, from monetary finance, cultural entertainment, and organizational forms, to specific technological products. What really is really magnified is the way human nature and groups choose&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Technology and institutions create the fertile soil and environment for progress, acting on both the physical and virtual worlds. As the basic constituent particles, individuals will play a wider role in the network in the process of technological development. Just like in the blockchain, the platform network succeeds through protocols, and in Web3, individuals will succeed by becoming a platform. Currently, we interact with the real physical world by organizing our identities, items, possessions, credentials, personal connections, and more. In the future, we have the ability to express and confirm this key information in a credible way in the digital world, which constitutes an important foundation of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Just like the coexistence of a large number of L1 and L2 blockchain networks now, we can regard the “metaverse” as a general term for virtual reality networks, in which the production factors of each person’s “miniverse” are flexibly organized under different scenarios and needs. The “metaverse” is a multi-parallel digital universe, and the power it unleashes will far exceed the existing economic and social production model. What kind of society would that be? People can combine their own sovereign data sets more transparently according to the demand scenarios, and the demand side can verify the partners more accurately and quickly. In the first ten years, the token economy has greatly promoted the production and innovation motivation of blockchain projects, and we have seen an iceberg on the water. The next ten years, like Vitalik et al.’s vision of soul tokens and a decentralized society, will be a return to people-oriented state, a recombination of data production elements, and a person-as-platform. These explorations will show us the hidden depth of the icebergs.</p><p>In Web3, people are platforms, which is actually an extension and prospect of the concept of decentralization. Although Web3 is still in its infancy, and there are still countless difficulties in technology and scale implementation, we have seen more top talents choose to join this field to overcome difficulties. When people become the platform to personalize the virtual world, the first thing that is needed is the seamless movement of sovereign data between devices and the network. When multiple personal platforms interact, the corresponding data combinations are called, and the network effects of the personal platforms are also obtained. Therefore, individuals will have a better chance to play the role of middlemen in different scenarios. One of the key changes of Web3 is to transfer ownership to individuals through encryption technology, and to build a direct financial incentive channel for individual contributions through token design, such as The Graph and Dune Analytics. Users are the content creators and the distributors. Creation is not only motivated by incentives, but also brings the efficiency of product and model innovation. The fact that data can be mastered by individuals for use, management, or commercialization may only be the beginning of Web3. After that, there may even be enough tools and foundations for users to develop their own protocols and contracts, and interact on the chain completely independently. From this point of view, the boundaries of individuals and platforms in Web3 will become blurred, and the essence is to give users the opportunity to coordinate and organize data, that is, the way to build their own platform.</p><p>The blockchain network basically has the characteristics of open source, allowing everyone to contribute and build together. Open source co-construction makes the traditional platform lose its appeal, which is the basis for the formation of the personal platform in Web3. At the same time, the in-depth development of smart contracts also strengthens the call between the established work results and saves the cost of forming a personal platform. The rapid development of the Internet celebrity economy in the past few years is the manifestation of the scale of the personal platform effect in Web2, and we believe that the influence and utility of personal formation in Web3 will become larger and larger. The product portfolio in the OWN infrastructure is our way of looking forward to Web3, which can better help individuals form network effects. In the future, the form of social contribution may no longer rely on traditional institutions. People can participate in the digital society through their own data sets such as credit certificates. In addition, the distribution of rights and interests will be more even and transparent.</p><p>On the other hand, identity is an important dimension of information definition in Web3. In fact, no matter in the real or virtual world, a person has a multi-dimensional identity role. If you add a time frame to each identity, it naturally extends the utility of that identity through contribution, outcome, problems, etc. elements of the individual in playing a specific role. On-chain records and definitions of identities and contributions at different stages are indispensable for the organization and collaboration of Web3. These breathing bodies on chains will be ourselves in different metaverses and the keys to our opportunities. The innovation of blockchain applications in the form of DeFi, NFT, GameFI, and X-Earn have promoted the rapid development of the market, and the next round of application outbreaks, we believe, will occur in organizational collaboration scenarios based on decentralized identity&nbsp;data.</p><p>One of the visions of Web3 is to eliminate the opposition between platform users and managers and return the platform to users. If the time horizon is extended, it is likely that in the future, it will be a network form in which people are the platform and virtual reality with multiple parallel metaverses. People will be the most important part of it, no matter what the road ahead, what will happen will be exciting, and the existence itself is a miracle, just as you stop and ask yourself: Is everything in front of you real? We create a virtual representation of reality, we understand the whole through the individual, and in the constant opposition and unity, Ontology and you are committed to exploring the innovative road of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of general blockchain basic protocols and products provided by Ontology for Web3 applications. Basic components including data and reputation, etc., and general-purpose tools such as a Web3 wallet, etc. Web3 applications can choose different basic components according to different scenarios for easy integration. It saves Web3 applications from developing basic functions from scratch, and thus can quickly develop applications. Individual users can also quickly access Web3 applications by using OWN basic products.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/title-people-platform-web3-c8e96245e16c">People, Platform, Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Forrester Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) Study Confirms a 186% ROI. 
	
	 Can you afford not to look at the economics of your CIAM strategy? 
	
	<p>To say that an organization's identity and access management strategy is important to its business is somewhere between a major understatement and a massive one.  Most businesses agree that if they don't pay sufficient attention to how well they manage their customer interactions, they are at an economic and competitive disadvantage.  And although many can articulate the role of customer identity and access management (CIAM) in their strategy, few have a way to analyze CIAM's benefits with data. In today's economic environment, it's imperative that organizations take a close look at their strategy and infrastructure to identify and quantify areas for improvement.</p>
	
	<p>Forrester Consulting recently conducted a commissioned <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-total-economic-impact">Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) study</a> to examine the return on investment (ROI) enterprises can realize by deploying the CIAM platform from ForgeRock. The top-line benefits realized by a typical large enterprise over three years are 186% ROI, less than nine-month payback period, and a net present value (NPV) of $28.5M.  Forrester's approach and methodology give you a way to analyze your own enterprise and gauge the value you could realize.</p>
	
	 The approach and methodology 
	
	<p>The TEI study analyzed the IT infrastructure and technology deployments for customer identity and access management, the business impact of the deployments on the organizations, and their overall strategic significance. Forrester conducted in-depth interviews with several people responsible for the strategy, implementation, and maintenance of their companies' CIAM infrastructure at five large enterprises. They used the resulting information to create a composite organization that represents a typical large global enterprise with $30B in revenue, 20,000 employees, and 30 million customer identities to manage.</p>
	
	<p>The Forrester framework is used to measure the economic impact for the composite organization, and is meant to be adapted and used for any organization to measure current costs and estimate the value of future benefits from implementing the ForgeRock CIAM platform.</p>
	
	 Analysis and results 
	
	<p>The impact analysis focused on five key areas and the potential benefits realized in each of them.</p>
	
	  Legacy environment infrastructure – Not surprisingly, the CIAM infrastructure in most enterprises consists of legacy components that are either home-grown or bought off the shelf and deployed in a heterogeneous manner with some components on-prem and others in the cloud.  Deploying ForgeRock as the single CIAM platform and integrating it with other applications in the enterprise returned a present value savings of $8.1 million over three years. 
		 Avoiding development costs – Software development to integrate an organization's customer workflow into their CIAM environment is expensive to implement and maintain.  ForgeRock's orchestration capabilities enable one to build and modify specific customer journeys using a drag-and-drop capability called Intelligent Access Trees.  This capability saved $1.3 million in custom development. 
		 Reduction in customer support requests – High friction in customer interaction is costly and detrimental to customer satisfaction.  Yet organizations must continue to evolve their identity infrastructure to keep their customers secure, and often do so by sacrificing the customer experience and increasing support costs.  Much of this is  due to tedious password reset procedures, multiple login requirements, and poor implementations of multifactor authentication (MFA). ForgeRock's CIAM platform provides a frictionless self-service approach to password resets, flexible MFA capabilities, and consistent single sign-on capabilities that reduced call volume by 40%, resulting in a present value saving of $24 million. 
		 Improved time-to-value for new releases – Fast-moving enterprises are under constant pressure to add new IT capabilities to support their business. They could include deploying new applications in the infrastructure, improving existing processes such as self-service workflows for customers, and security improvements. Many of these systems and processes have been dependent on and restricted by the CIAM infrastructure. ForgeRock CIAM transforms this dynamic. Improvements included an increase in the number of software releases made to the existing infrastructure, a reduction in the time taken for each release due to the simplified integration capabilities in the ForgeRock platform, and an increase in the number of new software capabilities added to the infrastructure. All this resulted in a present value benefit of $5.9 million realized through cost savings as well as an increase in revenue attributed to the faster addition of customer-facing functionality. 
		 Reduction of fraud – The impact of fraud on customer-facing organizations is significant and expensive.  Costs include reimbursements to customers for fraudulent orders made with their accounts and the effort required to detect such activity.  ForgeRock's platform was directly responsible for detecting and reducing fraudulent transactions by 25%, resulting in a present value savings of $4.7 million. 
	  Applying these results 
	
	<p>In its study, Forrester says: "By adopting a unified identity platform, enterprises have an opportunity to treat digital identity and identity access management as a key strategic initiative and work to develop and deliver differentiated experiences that delight customers and drive loyalty and profitability." Through its analysis, Forrester provides a framework that identifies the cost, benefit, flexibility, and risks that factor into a CIAM investment decision.</p>

			 The Pitiful State of Identity Today 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Sometimes I marvel at how, despite sending people to space, editing genes, and getting dangerously close to AGI, humanity hasn’t built a way for me to prove my legal name is Riley Hughes online. Even to do so in real life, I need to pull a hopefully-not-forged plastic card out of a leather pouch in my pocket.<br><br></p><p>WHAT?! <br><br></p><p>Today’s digital identity companies ask users to photograph those plastic cards (and take a selfie) to authenticate their identity. Yet, we don’t photograph handwritten notes to communicate—we email. We don’t photograph checks to pay—we use Venmo or crypto. For all of our modern transactions, we use modern technologies and streamlined processes.</p><p><br>Our identity is the last thread tethering our lives to paper. It’s laughable, really, the way we’ve continued to use an archaic system for such an important and sensitive part of our lives.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What Does Identity Even Mean? 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>When I refer to identity in this context, I’m referring to everything that makes you, you. It’s not the same as “auth”—usernames, social logins, even public keys, are not your identity. And we’re not just referring to government IDs either. Our lives are so much richer and extend beyond our birthplace or address.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Real digital identity will allow us to represent our whole selves. It will enable us to illustrate and safely share our certifications, community memberships, licenses, preferences, and so much more.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Catch-22 Problem of Digitally-Native Identity 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>So why hasn’t real, digitally-native identity been done? First we need to acknowledge the catch-22 problem that exists. Right now, a university won’t be motivated to issue digital diplomas unless there are companies accepting them. Companies however, won’t be motivated to create an ecosystem for accepting university diplomas until universities are issuing them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer: we need a standard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Historically, companies have tried to *be* the standard. The problem with companies *being* the standard is that it’s led to a graveyard of “one ID to rule them all” companies. The result is clear: No single company can own the world’s identity. Even if a company does succeed in a niche, they scarcely grow beyond that niche. Only a standard can solve this problem at scale.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Role of Verifiable Credentials 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>This is where verifiable credentials (VCs) come into play. VCs are a W3C standard data container. Data inside a VC can be verified instantly and independently. That means someone could check that my diploma:<br><br></p>  was issued by my university,  was issued to me,  hasn’t been tampered with, and  isn’t revoked  <p><br>all without checking with the university. Of course, you’ll only trust the data in the credential as long as you trust the issuer. But this new standardized data container makes data portable for the first time.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Challenges of Decentralized Identity 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Instead of the interoperability companies were expecting, what we got were 15+ different “flavors” of verifiable credentials and decentralized identity. These ranged from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">SBTs</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SaHGyY9TjPg4a0VNLCsfchoVG1yU3ffTDsPRcU99H1E/edit#slide=id.g11b904107df_0_1">web5</a>, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ssmith-acdc-02.html">ACDCs</a>, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO’s mDL</a> (the standard Apple’s mobile driver’s license is based on), and more.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
									
																					image from https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png
										
								 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>What started as an effort toward interoperability ended up a mess of standards. Now, instead of solving business problems and building product, developers are being sucked into maintaining interoperability with an ever-changing, increasingly complex decentralized identity landscape. They’re forced to spend time and resources researching and detangling these complexities, instead of building their actual products.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>But the worst part of proliferating standards is the impact it’s had on adoption. The value of a standard is an exponential function of its adoption. In other words, verifiable credentials only become valuable as adoption increases. And the catch-22 problem is hard enough to overcome—a splintered ecosystem doesn’t help anything!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So is decentralized identity doomed? Enter Trinsic.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Trinsic: Decentralized Identity Made Simpler 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>We created Trinsic as an infrastructure for building awesome identity products. Dozens of engineers use our SDK to build identity wallets or embed verifiable credentials into their products. Our SDK enables an Apple Pay-like UX for sharing and verifying data either online or in-person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal has been to completely abstract away the complexity of the ever-changing landscape so organizations can focus on the important stuff—what product to build, and how to take it to market. Teams shouldn’t have to “pick winners” and wager what to build on. Their products should be interoperable with multiple ecosystems. That’s what Trinsic is providing, out-of-the-box.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Our Story 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>So how did we get started? We came together in 2019 and built the first SaaS product for decentralized identity where developers didn’t have to run anything locally. We removed barriers to entry through a freemium product with usage-based pricing. We wanted to create a way for anyone to issue a verifiable credential in under five minutes, and we did.</p>

															</a>
														 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>As we ventured forward, we decided to build for the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a> ecosystem first; it was the most mature ecosystem at the time, and we knew the ecosystem well. It was a great starting point, and we quickly became a major player in that community. Last we checked, we power about 2/3 of Sovrin’s traffic, which equates to tens of thousands of transactions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we also support the W3C ecosystem, including JSON-LD and BBS+ credentials, as well as the Anoncred format from the Sovrin ecosystem. Furthermore, we support anchoring those credentials to Bitcoin (using ION), Veres1, and traditional web-based PKI. <a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/">You can see all the details for each of these in our docs.</a> In short, today we’re building the rails that power products that interact with this emerging ecosystem of verifiable, user-controlled data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And where are we going next? Let’s talk about Visa, first. Below you can see the Visa business model:</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Visa created a trust model that successfully brought over 1 billion people access to better payment transactions. And they proved the model could scale. Our plan is to take that trust model and apply it to identity. Of course, there are some key differences:<br><br></p>  First, instead of plastic credit cards, we use digital verifiable credentials.  Secondly, instead of a centralized settlement network written in Cobol, we use decentralized PKI—usually on a blockchain, but we work with traditional DNS-based PKI too.  Lastly, instead of controlling the entire ecosystem, we’re an open, API-first infrastructure anyone can build on.  					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Our approach to growth has been very product-led. It’s helped us remain highly scalable as community members help answer questions other developers pose, contribute to discussions on new products being built, and foster an environment where more developers want to join and explore building. We’re what Visa would have built if they wrote their software in 2020 instead of 1960—except for identity instead of payments.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Future of Decentralized Identity 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>By removing the barriers to entry and providing an interoperability layer for developers, Trinsic is attempting to crack the adoption problem of decentralized identity. The best news: we’re seeing it work. We’re currently powering over 100,000 end-users’ identity wallets, up by about ~10x in just the last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, imagine for a moment you’re getting off the SpaceX craft on a Mars Colony. You need to prove your identity. Do you pull a plastic card out of your spacesuit? No. The future of identity will be much better than that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That future is a digitally-native identity as legitimate and nuanced as your human identity. Call it decentralized identity, web5, self-sovereign identity, reusable identity, or whatever you’d like. But it’s happening. Now that we know it’s possible, it’s inevitable.</p>

 An application without security 
 
 
<p>First things first, we need an application. You can use any web application, but for this post, I’ll stick with a Java Spring Boot app that will echo the details of the inbound HTTP request. Echoing the request information will help visualize the additional HTTP headers added by OAuth2 Proxy, such as the user’s email address.</p>
 
 
<p>You can grab the project from <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-oauth2-proxy-example">GitHub</a>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-oauth2-proxy-example.git -b start
cd okta-oauth2-proxy-example</code> 
 
 
 






If you want to see the completed project, check out the <code>main</code> branch instead.



 
 
<p>If you are interested in the details for this Java application, take a look at the <code>EchoApplication</code> class. It contains a single endpoint that will handle all requests and "dump" the contents of the request as a JSON object:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>@RestController
static class EchoRestController {
    @RequestMapping("/**")
    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; echo(HttpServletRequest request,
                             @RequestHeader HttpHeaders headers,
                             @RequestBody(required = false) Map&lt;String, Object&gt; body) {

        Instant now = Instant.now();
        Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();

        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; result = new LinkedHashMap&lt;&gt;();
        result.put("clientIpAddress", request.getRemoteAddr());
        result.put("cookies", cookies == null ? emptyList()
                                              : Arrays.stream(cookies).toList());
        result.put("headers", headers.toSingleValueMap()); // simplify json response
        result.put("httpVersion", request.getProtocol());
        result.put("method", request.getMethod());
        result.put("body", body);
        result.put("queryString", request.getQueryString());
        result.put("startedDateTime", now);
        result.put("url", request.getRequestURL());

        return result;
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you are a Java fan, you can start the application by running <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>. Everyone else can run the following Docker commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker build --tag echo-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 echo-app</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Once the application is running, open up your browser or access the web application in your terminal with HTTPie:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http localhost:8080/echo</code> 
 
 
 






When using HTTPie, you can omit "localhost" and just type <code>http :8080/echo</code>! 😎



 
 
<p>You will see a response that looks something like this:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
    "body": null,
    "clientIpAddress": "172.17.0.1",
    "cookies": [],

<p>Now that we have a working application, let’s secure it!</p>
 
 
<p>Before moving on to the next section, stop the app with Ctrl+C, don’t worry; we will start it back up in a minute.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Set up Okta 
 
 
<p>To secure our application with OAuth 2.0, we are going to need an OAuth Identity Provider (IdP). Just about any OpenID Connect (OIDC) capable server should work, such as <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> or <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloak</a>, but this is an Okta blog, so let’s use Okta.</p>
 
 
<p>If you don’t already have one, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a>
and from the project directory, run <code>okta start</code> to sign up for a new account and configure this application!</p>
 
 






If you already have an Okta account, run <code>okta login</code> first.



 

What does the Okta CLI do?
 
 
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the required redirect URIs and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: .env</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Run <code>cat .env</code> (or <code>type .env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ISSUER=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
CLIENT_ID=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
CLIENT_SECRET=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS</code> 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 Set up OAuth2 Proxy 
 
 
<p>There are two ways to use OAuth2 Proxy: route your traffic through it directly or use it with the Nginx <code>auth_request</code> directive. I’d recommend routing traffic through Nginx if possible, but I’ll walk through both options and explain my recommendation below.</p>
 
 
<p>To reduce the number of moving parts, I’ll leave Nginx out in this first example; all of our web traffic will flow through OAuth2 Proxy. Users who access the echo web application will be redirected to Okta to sign in. Once they have signed in, OAuth2 Proxy will set a session cookie. OAuth2 Proxy will validate the session before passing the request to the echo web app in future requests.</p>
 
 






In OAuth terms, OAuth2 Proxy is acting as the "client", handling the OAuth protocol details, (in this case, an <a href="https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/">Authorization Code Grant</a>).<br>
TL;DR - Redirects the user to the OAuth IdP’s sign-in page and handles a "callback" route to return them to the application.



 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>This example is going to outgrow manually using <code>docker run</code> commands; switch to using <code>docker compose</code> to start the echo web-app and oauth2-proxy.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s start simple and increase the complexity as we go along. Create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> with oauth2-proxy and the web app from above:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>version: "3.7"
services:

  web-app: (1)
    build: .

  oauth2-proxy:
    image: bitnami/oauth2-proxy:7.3.0
    command:
      - --http-address
      - 0.0.0.0:4180 (2)
    environment:
      OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS: http://web-app:8080/ (3)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAME: Okta
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER: oidc (4)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER_URL: ${ISSUER}
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID: ${CLIENT_ID}
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET: ${CLIENT_SECRET}
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PASS_ACCESS_TOKEN: true (5)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS: '*' (6)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIRECT_URL: http://localhost:4180/oauth2/callback (7)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: ${OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET} (8)

    ports:
      - 4180:4180 (9)</code> 
 
 
 


1
Build and run Dockerfile in the current directory.


2
Listen on port <code>4180</code>.


3
Proxy authenticated requests to the Java web-app container.


4
OIDC client information (issuer, client ID, and client secret), these values are defined in the <code>.env</code> file.


5
Optionally, pass the access to the web-app.


6
Allow all email domains unless you use a social auth provider, you’ll want to manage this in your IdP and NOT in your application.


7
Set the redirect URL to an <code>http</code> URL, this defaults to <code>https</code>.


8
Open up the <code>.env</code> file and set this variable to a random 32-byte base64 string <code>openssl rand -base64 32 | tr — '+/' '-_'</code>.


9
Expose port <code>4180</code>.


 
 
 
 
<p>Start everything up by running:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker compose up</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4180/echo</code>, and you will be redirected to a page with a sign-in button. Click the button, and you will be redirected back to the "echo" application, and you should see information about the newly authenticated request!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 






If you are already logged into your Okta account, open an incognito/private browser to see the full sign-in flow.



 
 
<p>Great, the application is now secured, but we still have a few things to clean up:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>All the session state is stored in a cookie.</p>
 
 
<p>The initial double redirect sign-in page has to go.</p>
 
 
<p>We haven’t talked about API access yet.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>These first two problems can be fixed with a few updates to the OAuth2 Proxy configuration. Edit the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>       OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: ${OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET}
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_SKIP_PROVIDER_BUTTON: true (1)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_NAME: SESSION (2)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SAMESITE: lax (3)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_SESSION_STORE_TYPE: redis (4)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIS_CONNECTION_URL: redis://redis
    ports:
      - 4180:4180
+    depends_on:
+      - redis
+
+  redis:(5)
+    image: redis:7.0.2-alpine3.16
+    volumes:
+      - cache:/data (6)
+
+volumes:
+  cache:
+    driver: local</code> 
 
 
 


1
Skip the default login page and redirect directly to the IdP.


2
By default, the cookie name is <code>_oauth2_proxy</code>; change it to <code>SESSION</code>.


3
Set the cookie’s same site policy to <code>lax</code>; the redirect from the OAuth IdP will need the session cookie.


4
Use Redis to store session information.


5
Start up a Redis container.


6
Persist the Redis data between restarts.


 
 
 
 
<p>Stop the docker-compose process (Ctrl+C) and start it up again:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker compose up</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Once again, open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4180/echo</code> and open up your network tab, you will see the renamed and now smaller <code>SESSION</code> cookie.</p>
 
 
<p>You could stop here, but you shouldn’t. We still have a few issues: API clients are not supported, and we haven’t talked about logging out.</p>
 
 






For the next section, you will need an access token. You can use the access token from your last request’s <code>x-access-token</code> header. Open your terminal and set an environment variable: <code>export TOKEN={your-token-value}</code>.



 
 
 
 
 REST API clients 
 
 
<p>For the sake of this post, I will consider any client that sets an <code>Authorization</code> HTTP header to be an API client. For example: <code>Authorization: Bearer {access_token_here}</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The API client probably cannot handle a redirect response but expects a <code>40x</code> status code to be returned.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>Let’s take a step back and configure OAuth2 Proxy as an <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/the-resource-server/">OAuth resource server</a>, which accepts JWT access tokens. This might be all you need for some applications, but if you need to support both browser and API clients, keep reading, we will get there in the following section.</p>
 
 






It is common, but it’s not required for <a href="https://oauth.net/2/access-tokens/">OAuth 2.0 access tokens</a> to be a JWT. If you are using a different OAuth IdP, double-check if they support JWTs before continuing.



 
 
<p>In the <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, trim down the environment variables to the bare minimum needed for a REST API:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
    environment:
      OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS: http://web-app:8080/
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER: oidc (1)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS: '*'
      OAUTH2_PROXY_SKIP_JWT_BEARER_TOKENS: true (2)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_EMAIL_CLAIM: sub (3)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER_URL: ${ISSUER} (4)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID: api://default (5)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_SET_XAUTHREQUEST: true
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET: this_value_is_required_but_not_used (6)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: NOT_USED_BUT_REQUIRED_VALUE_32b_ (7)
...</code> 
 
 
 


1
We are not actually using any of the OIDC flows, but this is still required.


2
Perhaps a poorly named variable, this tells <code>oauth2-proxy</code> to validate the JWT access token and to "skip" looking for an OAuth 2.0 session.


3
Read the user’s email from the <code>sub</code> claim in the access token.


4
The same issuer URL is used, the JWKS endpoint will be looked up automatically via the OIDC discovery metadata.


5
The "client-id" is actually the audience <code>aud</code> claim and not the ID of a specific client (multiple API "clients" could be accessing the same REST API).


6
There is no "client-secret," but it’s a required field…​


7
Same with the cookie secret, these flows do not use cookies, but the field is required.


 
 
 
 
<p>Restart the services. (Stop and then run <code>docker compose up</code> again.)</p>
 
 
<p>Using the access token environment variable you set in the previous section, run this:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :4180/echo "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Awesome! Now your application is secured for REST clients!</p>
 
 
<p>Not so fast; now our browser clients don’t work correctly! The client ID and secret are not correct, which means users will not be able to log in. We can fix both of these problems with Nginx.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Add Nginx to route traffic 
 
 
<p>Adding another reverse proxy into the mix might seem excessive; for a request to get to the application, it would need to pass through both Nginx and OAuth2 Proxy first. However, you may already use Nginx for load balancing, TLS termination, or other ingress concerns.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>While we could route our traffic through both proxies as pictured above, I will use the Nginx <code>auth_request</code> directive instead. Nginx will make a REST request to OAuth2 Proxy’s <code>/oauth2/auth</code> endpoint using the original request headers (including any cookies and <code>Authorization</code> headers). OAuth2 Proxy will respond with a <code>202</code> status code if the request is valid or a <code>401</code> otherwise.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>This setup uses the same number of requests as the previous diagram but provides additional flexibility on how requests are routed to the upstream web app.</p>
 
 
 Configure Nginx 
 
<p>Jump back into the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> and add a new <code>service</code> for Nginx:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.21.6-alpine
    depends_on:
      - oauth2-proxy
      - web-app
    volumes:
      - ./nginx-default.conf.template:/etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template
    ports:
      - 80:80</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, create a <code>nginx-default.conf.template</code> file.  This code block is a little involved, be sure to read the annotations:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    location = /oauth2/auth {
        internal; (1)
        proxy_pass       http://oauth2-proxy:4180;
        proxy_set_header Host             $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme         $scheme;
        # nginx auth_request includes headers but not body
        proxy_set_header Content-Length   "";
        proxy_pass_request_body           off;
    }

    location / {
        auth_request /oauth2/auth; (2)

        auth_request_set $email  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_email; (3)
        proxy_set_header X-Email $email;
        auth_request_set $user  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_user;
        proxy_set_header X-User  $user;
        auth_request_set $token  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_access_token;
        proxy_set_header X-Access-Token $token;
        auth_request_set $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie;
        add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host:80;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port 80;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto http;

        proxy_http_version 1.1; (4)
        proxy_pass http://web-app:8080/; (5)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Don’t expose this route to external clients.


2
Nginx makes a request to <code>oauth2-proxy</code> REST API, to verify the auth for this request.


3
Add headers returned from the auth request.


4
HTTP 1.0 is the default if not set.


5
Send authenticated requests to the web app.


 
 
 
 
<p>Restart the docker containers and verify everything is working with HTTPie (make sure you are using port <code>80</code> now).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http localhost/echo "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you remove or change the <code>Authorization</code> header, a <code>401</code> will be returned. Browser requests will now also return a <code>401</code>!</p>
 
 
<p>Almost done! We still need to make everything work for both API clients and browsers, and handle sign-out requests.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Route  all traffic through Nginx 
 
 
<p>Sending all the traffic through Nginx has the added benefit of giving you control of how the OAuth2 Proxy endpoints are exposed. For example, the previous section marked the <code>/oauth2/auth</code> route as "internal," so only the <code>auth_requst</code> directive can use it.</p>
 
 
<p>In the <code>nginx-default.conf.template</code>, add a couple of new <code>location</code> sections to expose the other <code>/oauth2</code> endpoints. The first <code>location</code> will handle the OAuth 2.0-related requests like the redirect callback. The second will configure the sign-out endpoint to accept only POST requests. (This prevents a rogue GET request from ending the user’s session.)</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>    location /oauth2/ {
        proxy_pass       http://oauth2-proxy:4180; (1)
        proxy_set_header Host                    $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP               $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme                $scheme;
    }

    location = /oauth2/sign_out { (2)
        # Sign-out mutates the session, only allow POST requests
        if ($request_method != POST) {
            return 405;
        }

        proxy_pass       http://oauth2-proxy:4180;
        proxy_set_header Host                    $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP               $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme                $scheme;
    }
...</code> 
 
 
 


1
Send the OAuth callback and logout requests to oauth2-proxy.


2
Only allow POST requests to the sign-out endpoint.


 
 
 
 






The sign-out endpoint does not use a CSRF token. TODO: link to Alisa’s post on this topic.



 
 
<p>One last change, update the <code>location /</code> section to redirect to the sign-in page for all non-API clients:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>location / {
        auth_request /oauth2/auth;

        # if the authorization header was set (i.e. `Authorization: Bearer {token}`)
        # assume API client and do NOT redirect to login page
        if ($http_authorization = "") {
            error_page 401 = /oauth2/start;
        }
...</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Configure OAuth2 Proxy to support API and browser clients 
 
 
<p>Sometimes, an application needs to handle requests from browsers and other API clients.  In this case, the application acts both as an OAuth client and resource server. OAuth2 Proxy can be configured to support both types of applications. However, you may have noticed that a few OAuth2 Proxy configuration values are overloaded; for example, the "client ID" is used both as the ID of the OAuth client, and the JWT value for the audience. Luckily, there is a workaround! Here is the final annotated <code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>version: "3.7"

1
Allow all email addresses; the IdP will manage which users have access.


2
For single IdP use cases, skip the intermediate login page.


3
oauth2-proxy defaults to <code>https</code>, this example uses <code>http</code> on localhost.


4
The issuer, client ID, and secret will be loaded from the <code>.env</code> file.


5
Allow processing of JWT bearer tokens for API clients.


6
Configure an extra "allowed" audience, in addition to the "client ID".


7
Use the <code>sub</code> claim from JWT access tokens as the email address.


8
Add user information headers to the proxied web-app request.


9
Optional, pass the access token to the proxied web-app request.


10
Use Redis for session management.


11
Refresh cookies every 30 minutes.


12
Set the session cookie name to <code>SESSION</code>.


13
Configure the encryption key (loaded from the <code>.env</code> file).


 
 
 
 
<p>Restart the services and access the application through your browser: <code>http://localhost/echo</code>. Try again using HTTPie:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http localhost/echo "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Both requests should show similar information.</p>
 
 
<p>Without any code changes, the "echo" web application is now secured with OIDC / OAuth 2.0!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Is OAuth2 Proxy right for your application? 
 
 
<p>This post taught you how to secure an existing application with OAuth 2.0 without any code changes! OAuth2 Proxy isn’t just for legacy applications; it’s also commonly used in a sidecar pattern with Kubernetes, allowing you to keep authorization concerns separate from your application.</p>
 
 
<p>It’s not perfect, though; there are a few shortcomings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>SSO logout (<a>OIDC RP-Initated Logout</a>) isn’t supported yet.</p>
 
 
<p>Requires working around a logout route that accepts <code>GET</code> requests and doesn’t require a CSRF token.</p>
 
 
<p>API use cases support JWT-only access tokens; if your application needs to <a>remotely validate tokens</a> you would need another solution. It may be easier to configure <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_jwt_module.html">Nginx’s JWT module</a> instead.</p>
 
 
<p>Configuration is a little clunky; some values are required but not used.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Where does it shine?</p>
 
 
<p>If you need to add authentication to an application that doesn’t have OAuth support, or you need to support various types of applications in a standard way, OAuth2 Proxy can be a great choice! As a bonus, it has excellent <a href="https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/docs/">documentation</a>.</p>

Two new features were implemented on MetaMUI&nbsp;7.0<p>MetaMUI mainnet 7.0 was successfully implemented on June 20th at 17:27:05 (UTC+8). New features were implemented and activated at the block height<br>9,213,361. Our blockchain enables a real-time upgrade without pausing or shutting down the network, so while the upgrade was taking place, there was no issue with depositing and withdrawing $MMUI to exchanges and sending transactions using the blockchain.</p><p>Here are new features listed&nbsp;below:</p>  Staking feature for node validators — Bank Nodes (Node Validators of MetaMUI) need to stake a certain amount of $MMUI to join the network as a node validator. In every block creation, a leader Bank Node will propose a new block, and other Bank Nodes will act as endorsers. If the leader node fails to produce a block proposal or has no block announcement within 5 seconds, the leader node’s locked bond will be&nbsp;slashed.  Memo feature of token transfer for the Yidindji CBDC system — last January, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/yidindji-dollar-issued-and-deployed-by-sovereign-yidindji-government">the Sovereign Yidindji Government (SYG) and MetaMUI team successfully launched the “Sovereign Yidindji Dollar (SYD)” on MetaMUI Blockchain.</a> Now, the people of the SYG can use their wallets, the Yidindji SSID Wallet provided by the MetaMUI team, to send and receive SYD. The MetaMUI team also implemented the Memo feature to the mainnet 7.0 for expanding the use-cases of the&nbsp;SYD.  <p>Our team is consistently upgrading our mainnet and implementing new features to our CBDC platform to become a real working CBDC blockchain platform.

<p>Organizations use physical credentials like employee badges, certifications, and passports to identify people and verify claims about them like being old enough to go to a nightclub or graduating with a degree. But of course, physical credentials have their drawbacks.</p><p>Did you know that:</p>  Over <a href="https://aaar.assembly.ca.gov/sites/aaar.assembly.ca.gov/files/reports/Intro%20to%20Degree%20Mills.pdf">half of all people claiming a new PhD</a> in the United States have a fake degree?  More than 1,200 vendors operating in the UK and worldwide offer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/16/fake-covid-vaccine-and-test-certificate-market-is-growing-researchers-say">fake COVID vaccine</a> and test certificates for as little as £25?  75% of university admissions staff <a href="https://ecctisblog.com/2020/02/26/survey-universities-and-education-fraud-75-cannot-spot-a-fake-certificate/">could not spot a fake certificate</a>?  <p>With the increasing digitization of information, people are required to interact with thousands of businesses online. How would organizations know if a digital document is real? If organizations can’t tell if digital assets are real or fake, they are exposed to liabilities such as hiring someone who is not really qualified to do a job. Many people simply use Photoshop or change a PDF themselves to make fake certificates or licenses.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials can help individuals and organizations create and share their identities and claims reliably.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>  What Is a Verifiable Credential? CEO Nick Lambert explains the basics and importance of Verifiable Credentials.&nbsp;<p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. Imagine digital and instantly verifiable versions of identity documents, academic achievements, licenses, and more.</p><p>When digital credentials conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which is a standard established by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials. The Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 is a “specification [that] provides a standard way to express credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.”</p><p>W3C is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work to set international standards for the World Wide Web. They created standards for URL, decentralized identifiers, and others. Verifiable Credentials are one of the three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is an approach to digital identity that gives individuals control of their digital identities. The other two pillars are blockchain and decentralized identifiers.</p>Verifiable Credentials, blockchain, and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are the three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity.<p>The main parties involved in the use of Verifiable Credentials are the:</p>  Issuer: Organization that has the authority to issue Verifiable Credentials such as a government department issuing a national ID or a college issuing a diploma  Holder: Someone who owns the credential and stores it in their digital wallet  Verifier: The person or organization validating or authenticating the credential like a hiring company needing to check a candidate’s educational credentials  The main parties in a Verifiable Credentials system are the holder, verifier, and issuer. Benefits of Verifiable Credentials   Instantly verifiable anywhere at any time within seconds compared to days, weeks, or months with traditional verification processes  Tamper-proof with cryptography, which enables people to store, protect, and share data securely  No need to contact the issuer (e.g. a university or certifying body) to confirm the authenticity  Creates immediate trust between parties  ID holder have full control and ownership of their data, enabled by decentralized identifiers (globally unique identifiers) and Public key cryptography.  Provides user privacy because they can choose which parts of their identity they want to reveal such as showing their age without showing their full name. Or proving they are above a certain age without disclosing their date of birth.  No personal data is stored on the blockchain  Portable as holders can store Verifiable Credentials in their digital wallet and take them anywhere while still being verifiable.  <p>Organizations can issue their degrees, IDs, licenses, and more as verifiable digital credentials that can be stored in a digital wallet, which is a digital version of a physical wallet that people can carry around as a mobile application on their phone, computer, or even a cloud-based server.</p><p>Gartner, a technological research and consulting firm, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-key-predictions-for-identity-and-access-management-and-fraud-detection">shared five trends</a> for identity and access management and fraud detection. One of the trends is that the decentralized identity standard will shift to being increasingly mobile and global. The term “decentralized identity” is used interchangeably with self-sovereign identity because it refers to the idea of individuals owning and managing their own identities.</p> Verifiable Credentials Example A government can issue a passport as a Verifiable Credential for the holder to securely store in their digital identity wallet.<p>In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, the issuer and holder are required to use Decentralized Identifiers, or DIDs. Decentralized identifiers are similar to email addresses and phone numbers in that they are unique. The DID and public key of the organization that issued the credential are stored on the blockchain. So when someone wants to verify the authenticity of the credential, they can check the blockchain to see who issued it without having to contact the issuing party. </p><p>A DID:</p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Comes with a private key and a public key  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>We will go into more detail later on about how DIDs work, but here is an example that ties all of these details together. </p><p>Let's say a government department uses Verifiable Credentials to issue passports. Whenever they issue a new passport, they will sign it with a private key while their public key and DID are on the blockchain. In this case, the data outline (schema) on the verified credential would include the name, country, date of birth, and so on.</p><p>You will be able to store your passport within your digital wallet and control precisely what you want a verifier to see. Then when a verifier like a company, for example, wants to check the Verifiable Credential, they can check to see if the government department really did sign it without contacting the issuer because the government's public key and DID are on the blockchain. </p>A passport issued as a Verifiable Credential can be stored on a digital identity wallet like the Dock Wallet.<p>Another benefit of a Verifiable Credential is privacy. If an on-demand driving company asks for your license if you're applying to become a driver, you can use your phone to simply show them a verifiable presentation of the credential that proves that you have the authority to drive. With a verifiable credential, you can selectively disclose only the information required by the verifier. If a platform uses Zero-Knowledge Proof technology, you could even prove you have a valid license without showing any information from the license itself.</p><p>With Verifiable Credentials, the DMV also has the authority and ability to define an automated expiration date. They can also revoke the license if a driver breaks the law and is penalized by having their credential removed for a certain period of time. </p> Why Do We Need Verifiable Credentials? What’s Wrong With Our Current Verification Systems? Nick covers the difference between centralized, federated, and decentralized ID management.<p>The main reason why Verifiable Credentials are becoming increasingly popular among people and businesses around the world is that it checks a lot of boxes when it comes to user privacy requirements and addresses several major issues associated with the current identity management system.</p> Problems With Our Current Traditional Verification Systems   Proving the authenticity of documents involves a slow and difficult verification process, which often takes organizations weeks or even months  Increased risk of breaches of data resulting from centralized data management systems storing a large amount of user information  Paper and digital credentials are easy to forge  Organizations store vast amounts of personal data from users which leaves users without control over who has access to their personal information, where their documents are stored, and how they are being used  With a physical credential or PDF, people may be disclosing a lot more information than is necessary when they present it for verification  <p>Verifiable Credentials enable people to verify their identity, only provide information that is relevant to the context, and prove their documents weren’t modified.</p><p>With a digital credential that could be in a PDF or XML document, for example, verifying the origin and authenticity of documents is complex. You’d have to confirm that:</p>  The Issuer Organization effectively issued that credential and has the authority to do so like an organization that provides driver’s licenses  The person submitting the credential (holder) is its rightful owner  The credential is valid and not expired, modified, or revoked  <p>​​In many cases, this involves manually contacting the issuing organization, which is a long, tedious, and often expensive process.</p><p>Here are just a few of many examples of how fraudulent IDs and credentials pose a risk to organizations:</p><p>Construction</p><p>New construction employees need to present credentials to an employer, especially if they will operate heavy machinery. If an employee presents fake credentials to a company, this is dangerous because this could result in a serious accident and the company could be liable for hiring someone without the right qualifications to operate the machinery and do the work safely.</p><p>Healthcare</p><p>The verification processes for providers in the healthcare industry have many inefficiencies with manual verification and gatekeepers. Traditional verification can take weeks to months which causes major delays in filling in much-needed healthcare roles and delays for people to begin working.</p><p>Supply chain</p><p>There can be severe safety issues and monetary damages that could happen from an improperly managed supply chain such as a manufacturer failing to ensure the safety of working conditions at their facilities, potentially resulting in severe injuries suffered by workers. Forged documents are also used to show the origin of goods, which can be dangerous for consumers if the products don’t meet safety standards.</p> How Does a Verifiable Credential Work? Dock's Solutions Architect Mike Parkhill explains how a Verifiable Credential works.<p>The issuer (e.g. nursing program) creates the verifiable credential and digitally signs it with a cryptographic key that only the issuer can use. When the verifier (e.g. hospital) receives a credential, they will verify its authenticity instantly through a blockchain, an immutable and decentralized database.</p><p>One important thing to note is that the blockchain doesn’t actually store people’s Verifiable Credentials. It only stores information that the verifier would need to validate the authenticity of the credential like the issuer's public cryptographic key that matches the one that signed the credential.</p><p>Using this information, the verifier will determine:</p>  If the issuer has the authority to issue that credential  If the verifiable credential is still valid (not revoked or expired)  If the credential has been tampered with  <p>This system is trustless. The verifier no longer has to contact the issuer to confirm the validity of the credential. And the best part is that everything happens in a matter of seconds!</p> The 3 Components of Verifiable Credentials   Credential metadata: This might be cryptographically signed by the issuer and contains the credential identifier as well as properties about the credential itself such as the expiry date and who the issuer is.   Claim(s): A tamper-proof set of claims made about the credential subject such as someone’s employee number and job title.   Proof(s): Cryptographic method that allows people to verify:     The source of the data (e.g. who the issuer is)  That the data has not been tampered with   What Is the Role of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) In Making Verifiable Credentials Work? Learn the basics and benefits of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Decentralized Identifiers Explained <p>We often use physical cards to provide proof of our identity and claims about us to show to other people or organizations. But in the digital world, there were no universally accepted standards for expressing, exchanging, and verifying digital credentials.</p><p>We currently use emails and phone numbers as identifiers to access websites, services, and apps. But our access to these identifiers can be removed anytime by service providers, the data is controlled by providers, and user data is vulnerable to hacks. Decentralized identifiers change all of this. &nbsp;</p><p>A DID:</p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers  Is created and owned by the user  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Comes with a private key and a public key that are also made up of a long string of letters and numbers  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Here is an example of a Dock DID: </p><p>A party can be an individual or organization and they can make as many DIDs as they want for different relationships. For example, you can have a DID for:</p>  Professional reasons like showing your credentials to an employer or university  Authenticate data for your personal interests like showing you are legal age to go to a bar or a member of an organization  Online gaming profiles  People can create as many Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as they want and manage them in a digital identity wallet. What Are Public and Private Keys? Every Decentralized Identifier (DID) comes with a public and private key.<p>Each DID comes with a private and public key. Keys come in private/public pairs and a DID can have multiple pairs. &nbsp;</p><p>Private key</p>  A private key (a string of letters and numbers) is like a password that allows a holder to access and manage their data.  The owner should be the only one who knows the private key and it should never be shared with anyone else.  Regarding DIDs, the private key allows people to prove ownership, grant permissions to share specific data, and sign documents.   <p>Public key</p>  A public key (a string of letters and numbers) that can be safely shared with anyone to send and receive data  Used for user authentication and verification purposes  <p>To explain how public and private keys work, let’s use the example of comparing a private key to a master key of a car. The car’s owner (holder) has the master key that gives her full access to all parts of the car, including the trunk and glove compartment. She can provide restricted access to other people she chooses. The owner should never give her master key to anyone else.</p><p>Now the owner wants to make another key that gives restricted access to a valet or auto body shop to start the car. This key is like the public key. The valet and car shop worker wouldn’t be able to access the glove compartment and the trunk. </p><p>To use another example, an employer would use their private key to sign and issue a verifiable credential to confirm an employee's job title. The employer’s public key would be shared on the blockchain so that the verifier, such as a government department that needs to authenticate someone’s work status, can confirm the authenticity of the data with that public key. Basically, the government body can check the DID on the blockchain to see who issued the credential without having to contact the issuing party.</p> Key Differences Between Centralized Identifiers and Decentralized Identifiers Dock's WebID allows people to securely sign in without a password and without revealing any more information than needed to access a website or app.<p>Centralized Identifiers</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers</p><p>Identifiers provided by centralized&nbsp; providers like Google or phone companies allow access to apps and services (email addresses and passwords)</p><p>Identifiers you generate for yourself powered by blockchain to use apps and services</p><p>Your personal data is collected on centralized servers and it's not clear who has access to it</p><p>Data is not shared with anyone except whoever you choose to reveal it to and there is no personal data stored on the blockchain</p><p>Data can be manipulated by providers</p><p>Records on the blockchain are immutable and tamper-proof once it’s recorded on the blockchain</p><p>Data is owned by third parties and you can’t control your data</p><p>You have full ownership of your DIDs and complete control of your cryptographic keys</p><p>People’s identifiers are used to track online behavior</p><br><p>Create as many DIDs as you want for different relationships to keep your data private as having multiple DIDs makes it harder to track users and correlate data&nbsp;</p><p>Providers can remove access to your data anytime</p><p>Your data can’t be taken away from you and your credentials can be verified anywhere, anytime</p><p>Less secure and private connections between parties</p><p>Enables unique, private, and secure peer-to-peer connections between two parties</p><p>Here is a scenario that goes through all of the steps of how DIDs and Verifiable Credentials can work:</p>  Issuer: Successo Institute  Holder: Anita Ramos  Verifier: Bubble Pearl restaurant    Anita creates a DID using the <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Certs platform</a> for educational purposes only to interact with the university and its partners. The DID will be on the Dock blockchain.  <p>2. Anita shares her DID with the university which allows the school to connect to her wallet and issue Anita a proof of enrolment status as a verifiable credential. </p><p>3. The university signs and issues the Verifiable Credential with their private key on Certs and emails Anita a PDF and JSON version of her credential.</p><p>4. Anita imports this credential on her Dock wallet phone app, allowing her to bring her Verifiable Credentials anywhere.</p><p>5. Partnering businesses on and off-campus give 20% discounts on products and services to university students and they trust Successo Institute as an issuer.</p><p>6. Anita goes to Bubble Pearl restaurant and they request data to confirm that she is a student of Successo Institute. They scan a QR code and she is prompted to give permission to show her credentials.</p><p>7. The cashier scans her QR code that is tied to her credentials and applies the 20% discount to her purchase.</p><p>In another example, if someone wants to buy alcohol, a cashier can scan the QR code on a customer’s verified credential to confirm that they are of legal age. In this process, the customer can use a Zero-Knowledge Proof to prove they are above a certain age, without sharing any other information like their entire birth date or name.</p> The Role of Blockchain in Verifiable Credentials <p>The DID and corresponding public key of the organization that issued a credential to a holder is stored on the blockchain, which is an immutable database. The person who wants to verify the validity or authenticity of the credential can check the blockchain to see who issued it without having to contact the issuing party. &nbsp;<br></p>Learn the basics of blockchain.<p>Blockchain is a system of recording information chronologically in a way that makes it extremely difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system. It is a distributed database that is shared among nodes, which are computers in the blockchain network, that can execute certain functions like sending and receiving information. Each block on the chain has unique data that references the previous block and the blocks combine to complete a chain. Blockchain technology is also referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p><p>Key Features of a Blockchain</p><p>1. Decentralized: Blockchains operate using a peer-to-peer network of computers to verify and record transactions. Whenever there is a new transaction on a blockchain, the block can’t be added to the chain until it is verified by the network. For someone to tamper with the blockchain, they would have to tamper with all of the blocks of the chain and hack every node, which is extremely difficult to do. </p><p>2. A blockchain acts as a decentralized distributed ledger: A distributed ledger is a digital database that runs on a distributed network in diverse locations rather than having one record of data in a centralized location that a person or body can control or manipulate. Each node gets a full copy of the blockchain and the information can be used to verify that everything is in order and make sure it hasn’t been tampered with.</p><p>If everything looks good, each node adds this to its own blockchain. Everyone in the network creates consensus where they agree which blocks are valid and which aren’t. Tampered blocks will be rejected by nodes in the network.</p><p>3. Immutable: Each block on a chain contains transaction data and the blocks can’t be tampered with or backdated. Unlike traditional forms of record-keeping that are easy to change and manipulate information without anyone knowing.</p> Verifiable Credentials Using Blockchain Not all data goes on the blockchain to protect user privacy and maintain security. Mike covers which data goes on the blockchain.<p>In identity management, a blockchain allows everyone in the network to have the same source of truth about which credentials are valid and who authenticated the validity of the data inside the credentials. Blockchain can enable zero-knowledge proofs, meaning that someone can verify credentials without a holder revealing the actual data like their full name and address. </p><p>For example, let’s say Shelly wants to sign up to play a mobile game from her phone. The gaming company requires players to be at least 18 years old and uses Verifiable Credentials to confirm their age.</p>  Shelly creates a DID with the Dock blockchain and stores it in her Dock wallet on her phone  The department of motor vehicles (DMV) in the US issues Shelly a driver’s license as a verifiable credential that contains her date of birth  The gaming company trusts the DMV as an issuer  Shelly signs into the gaming site with her DID and the company uses the Verifiable Credential associated with her DID to verify that she is at least 18 years old without her revealing her date of birth  Shelly can securely sign in to play with her DID without ever using a user name and password  <p>In the above example, Shelly has full ownership and control of how her data is shared and used. And her information can’t be tracked or stored.</p> How to Show the Proof of Existence of Verifiable Credential Data and Files With Dock’s Blockchain <p>With Dock, issuers have the option of proving the existence of Verifiable Credentials or files to a verifier by connecting the data to a blockchain with the use of <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-anchoring-feature-is-now-live/">anchoring</a>. </p><p>What is anchoring in blockchain? </p><p>An anchor is a digital fingerprint of external data that is included in a blockchain transaction to prove that the external data is authentic. The anchor makes up the credential’s proof of existence in their original form. </p><p>Anchoring works by converting data to cryptographic hashes (a long string of numbers and letters that is not readable by any human) that are written to the blockchain. </p><p>Hashes: </p>  Prove the existence of data on files and credentials while the content is kept private  Maintain the privacy and security of data because only the hash is stored on the blockchain rather than the credentials themselves  Creates immutable timestamps associated with the information and recorded on the blockchain  <p>Let’s say there is an online course that wants to issue credentials to students who have completed the program. The issuer can use Dock’s anchoring feature to hash the credentials that they have issued. Anchors are created when the hashes are posted to Dock’s blockchain and the record can’t be changed. </p><p>Anchoring can be applied to any documents and verifiable credential data for a variety of situations.</p> What Is and Isn’t Stored on the Blockchain  <p>By default, nothing gets stored on the blockchain except for an issuer’s DID and public keys. The Verifiable Credentials that contain personal details are securely stored on a decentralized digital wallet app rather than the blockchain. They don’t need to be stored on the blockchain in order to be verified as long as the keys are available.</p><p>What is stored on the blockchain</p><p>What is not stored on the blockchain</p><p>An issuer and holder’s DID and public keys</p><p>A holder’s personal data like name, date of birth, address, and credit card details</p><br><p>Verifiable Credentials like a passport, citizenship status, employee title, and university degree.</p><br><p>Cryptographic hashes (a long string of numbers and letters) can be tied to the verifiable credential and stored on the blockchain to confirm proof of existence without revealing personal data. The hashes make the data unidentifiable to a human.&nbsp;</p> Verifiable Credentials Use Cases <p>Industry</p><p>Traditional Process</p><p>Problems/Risks</p><p>Verifiable Credentials Solution</p><p>Supply chain</p><p>Relies on physical IDs and documents to demonstrate compliance, which creates inefficiencies.</p><br><br><p>Documents can be easily forged and difficult to authenticate.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Manual verification process is slow and prone to errors.&nbsp;</p><br><p>An importer can bring unapproved, non-compliant medical supplies into a market putting public health at risk.</p><br><p>Verifiable Credentials can’t be forged and they can be verified within seconds without contacting the issuing party, saving a tremendous amount of time and money.</p><p>Finance&nbsp;</p><p>To access financial services, someone has to go through compliance screening by submitting personal details in physical form that is stored in a large database and shared with one or more third parties that conduct know your customer (KYC) and credit checks.&nbsp;</p><p>Individuals have no control over how their data is secured, shared, and accessed by third parties.&nbsp;</p><br><p>The data provided in the credentials is cryptographically secured, tamper-proof, and can be verified.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Healthcare</p><p>Employers use manual processes to verify paper-based licenses and certificates for healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Traditional verification takes weeks if not months, which creates delays in filling much-needed health care roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Organizations that provide and regulate medical licenses for the healthcare workforce can issue licenses in the form of digital credentials. The recipients of these licenses can then easily share them for instant verification by any hospital, clinic, or medical department where they would like to work.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials can be applied to an infinite amount of use cases across many industries. Here are just a few of many examples of ways that Verifiable Credentials solve a variety of problems.</p> Dock’s Clients Using Verifiable Credentials <p>Dock is working with organizations to provide technological solutions to issue Verifiable Credentials and create decentralized identifiers. </p><p><a href="https://gravitytraining.co.za/">Gravity Training</a> connected with us so they could issue Verifiable Credentials in a convenient and cost-effective way to people who complete their training program in field positions. Authentic credentials are essential to keep workers and employers safe. Their courses include rigging, fall arrest, and radio frequency awareness training. </p><p>Fake credentials are a <a href="https://www.sapeople.com/2019/02/14/fake-qualifications-are-on-the-rise-how-universities-can-manage-the-risk/">growing problem in South Africa</a>. Many people are photoshopping credentials and showing them to employers. Gravity issues thousands of certificates a year for trainees and is manually uploading certifications on their database, which takes a lot of time and resources. They want to use Verifiable Credentials to be compliant, to manage verifications across various locations, and to enhance their record-keeping for auditability. </p><p>With Dock’s technology, Gravity is able to:</p>  Save a tremendous amount of time and money issuing and managing &nbsp;credentials with expiry dates in bulk with Dock’s user-friendly platform that doesn’t require any code  Allow inspectors and managers to instantly verify documents and monitor expiration dates digitally  Provide workers with credentials they can store on a wallet with their phones  Nick speaks with Grant Thomas, the CEO of Credenxia to discuss how this global verification company is using Dock Certs to move to a decentralized solution of creating and managing employee credentials.<p>Dock has also been <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-using-docks-technology/">collaborating with Credenxia</a> since 2021 to help them move towards a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials. <a href="https://www.credenxia.com/">Credenxia</a> is a leading global verification company that partners with businesses in a wide range of industries including construction, health care, and transport. Their technology helps with compliance for employers and workers as well as enables businesses to effectively manage the credentials of their workforce.</p><p>The company chose to work with Dock because of our expertise in blockchain, we are compliant with W3C standards, and the APIs were well-documented. Credenxia was previously running on a trust model to do manual verification. They were getting feedback from their stakeholders asking how people would know if Credenxia was compliant themselves during their verification process. There is no overarching body that checks the work and processes of document verification companies.</p><p>The collaboration with Dock allows Credenxia to: </p>  Provide Verifiable Credentials with blockchain technology.  Enhance transparency with clients by adding verifiable notes that are hashed on the blockchain, making them immutable. If the notes have been tampered with, clients would be able to see it.  Enhance the audit position of the user base and give back control to someone’s credentials and identity.  Move towards a zero-trust model that clients are demanding.  Retrospectively decentralize already verified credentials.   Decentralized Digital ID Wallet App <p>A decentralized digital identity wallet is an identity management application that allows people to securely store, manage, and share digital credentials. A digital credential can be an ID, license, background check, certification, and more. It’s the equivalent of a physical wallet that holds various IDs and cards to demonstrate claims about yourself like licenses, bank cards, and service cards. </p><p>To illustrate how a decentralized digital ID wallet can work, let’s say Carlos wants to create a new profile on an online sports shop that uses Verifiable Credentials. He can sign in and make purchases from his digital wallet without creating a user name, password, and entering credit card information. The website needs to confirm that shoppers live in Spain as they only deliver within the country and their payment method. The website verifies his credentials that were issued by a credit card company and driver’s licensing organization, which are issuers that the website trusts to authenticate the credentials. &nbsp; </p> Dock’s Decentralized ID Wallet  <p>The Dock Wallet enables you to have full control over your digital credentials and every piece of data stored in the wallet has the ability to be shared with third parties only when you choose to do so and how much information you want to provide. You can grant and remove access to whomever at any time. </p><p>With the Dock Wallet you can import existing certificates, batches, and credentials to store all of your records and achievements in one place as long as they were issued as W3C-compliant Verifiable Credentials.</p> Summary of Key Terms<br> <p></p><p>Anchoring</p>  An anchor is a digital fingerprint of external data that is recorded on the blockchain transaction to prove that the external data is authentic  Proves the existence of verifiable credential data or files while the content is kept private  Anchoring works by converting data to cryptographic hashes (a long string of numbers and letters that is not readable by any human) that are written to the blockchain  <p>Blockchain</p>  A blockchain is a decentralized database that is shared among nodes which are computers in the blockchain network  A system of recording information chronologically in a way that makes it extremely difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system  <p>Decentralized Digital ID Wallet</p>  An identity management application that allows people to securely store, manage, and share digital credentials  <p>Decentralized Identifier (DID)</p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers  Is created and owned by the user  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Comes with a private key and a public key that are also made up of a long string of letters and numbers  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Cryptographic hash</p>  A long string of numbers and letters that is not readable by any human  Used in anchoring to prove the existence of data on files and credentials while the content is kept private  Maintain the privacy and security of data because only the hash is stored on the blockchain rather than the credentials themselves  Creates immutable timestamps associated with the information and recorded on the blockchain  <p>Private key</p>  A private key (a string of letters and numbers) is like a password that allows a holder to access and manage their data  The owner should be the only one who knows the private key and it must never be shared with anyone else  Regarding DIDs, the private key allows people to prove ownership, grant permissions to share specific data, and sign documents  <p>Public key</p>  A public key (a string of letters and numbers) that can be safely shared with anyone to send and receive data  Used for user authentication and verification purposes  <p>Verifiable Credential</p>  A digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification  When digital credentials conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which is a standard established by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials   Conclusion <p>In an increasingly digital world, the problem with physical IDs and credentials is that they can be easily forged and take a lot of time to verify for authenticity. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials are:</p>  Are a digital version of paper-based credentials that people can present to organizations  Tamper-proof  Supports data protection  Instantly verifiable  Secure and allow the ID holder to have full control and ownership of their data  <p>In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, there is an issuer, holder, and verifier.

1&nbsp; What is Aries Interop Profile (AIP)? 
<p>Aries agents are all united through the standards and protocols they aim to adhere to, and the underlying technologies:</p>
 
 
 
 Cryptography 
 DIDs 
 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10NGAtlov49dbaDX96C0F4MdRrr20eHiE4RSZfJu0oXU/edit?usp=sharing">DID Utility Ledgers</a> 
 Verifiable Credentials 
 
 
 
<p>As <a href="https://northernblock.io/introduction-to-digital-trust/">Digital Trust</a> ecosystems evolve, they will naturally require many technologies to coexist and cooperate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders and users will not care about incompatibilities – they will simply wish to take advantage of the benefits of digital trust.</p>
<p>Interoperability ultimately means more than just Aries agents working with each other. It covers worldwide standards and paves the way for broader compatibility.</p>
<p>Interoperability will drive scalability while identities/subjects make self-sovereign choices. The technology must ensure that these choices don’t result in digital trust ecosystems losing trust.</p>
<p>To prevent vendor lock-in, interoperability must enable different ledger (and non-ledger) choices, and credential formats provided by identities/subject to co-exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today if we have to present two forms of ID at a bank, we have to present two seperate documents. The bank requires two different verification technologies/processes to ensure the two documents can be trusted. This process is very expensive, time consuming, and it also drives unique training needs – an additional cost. In this example, interoperability means that the same document reader can read both a Driver’s Licence and a Passport – a very cost efficient and trusted process for the economy.</p>
<p>If Hyperledger Aries is to continue to flourish, these are the five drivers that we think must be taken into consideration when talking about interoperability:</p>
 
 
 
 Drives Scalability  
 Maintains Privacy &amp; Security  
 Avoids Diluting Other Standards’ Principles  (e.g., if Aries should be interoperable with mDL, you can’t dilute the principles of mDL) 
 Drives Adoption through Cost Efficiencies  
 Ensures Tech Stack has long-term viability  (not a short term bridge solution) 
 
 
 
 <br>
2&nbsp; How We Achieved AIP 1.0 
<p>Towards the end of 2021, Northern Block demonstrated AIP 1.0 Compliance of its Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet against the Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH) (<a href="https://northernblock.io/nb-orbit-mobile-wallet-demonstrates-aip-1-0-compliance-with-digital-identity-laboratory-of-canada/">here</a>).</p>
<p>Interoperability is assessed using the Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH), which is an open-source software that runs a series of Aries interoperability tests and uses a <a href="https://aries-interop.info/URL">Behavior Driven-Development</a> (BDD) framework to run tests that are designed to exercise the community-designed Aries Protocols, as defined in the <a href="https://aries-interop.info/[https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs)">Aries RFC</a> GitHub repo.</p>
<p>We additionally tested this interoperability in action between organizations using the BC Gov Business Partner Agent (BPA) and the <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet</a>.</p>
  
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkPuEuf9K3Y">SSI Interoperability Demo – NB Orbit Mobile Wallet, PwC, Copper Mountain &amp; BC Mines</a></p>
<p>AIP currently has two versions:</p>
 
 
 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile#aries-interop-profile-version-10">AIP 1.0</a>, defines how Aries agents communicate with each other using a single type of verifiable credential, and 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>, builds on AIP 1.0 including how Aries agents can exchange several types of verifiable credentials, including W3C standard verifiable credentials. 
 
 
 
<p>Our work since these demonstrations has been to move the needle towards AIP 2.0 Compliance for both our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet and <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">Enterprise SSI Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
 <br>
3&nbsp; Why We Chose Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) 
<p>To achieve AIP 2.0, Northern Block needed both our Cloud and Edge agents to support it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Enterprise SSI Platform (Cloud Agent) is based on ACA-Py 0.7.3, which already provides support for AIP 2.0. However, ACA-Py can only run in the cloud – so it wasn’t an option for our mobile environments.</p>
<p>This section explains the reasoning behind why we chose Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) for our Mobile Wallet Agent to move us to AIP 2.0.</p>
 3A&nbsp; Vibrant Community 
<p>The first thing we looked at was the activity happening in the multiple Aries projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wished to become contributors to a project with lots of activity so that we wouldn’t be amongst the sole/few contributors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We realized that there remained a lot of work to do on these frameworks; and we wanted to share the load with others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We saw that there were multiple contributors working on AFJ with tons of recent, and real-time activity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This not only creates benefits for Northern Block, but also for our network of partners and clients. To avoid vendor lock-in scenarios, we recommend to our clients that if we build a product for them and for whatsoever reason they decide to no longer work with us; their code base will remain on an active open source framework and will likely continue to be maintained by us – meaning they will continue to reap the benefits of the framework updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all the activity happening in AFJ, the AIP 2.0 support was where we needed it.</p>
 3B&nbsp; Multiple Credential Format Support 
<p>In our <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/">NB Orbit Solutions</a>, we are agnostic to credential formats, as we want to make it as simple as possible for anyone to securely transmit verifiable data between two entities.</p>
<p>There are use cases where one would rather use an Indy AnonCreds credential (based on CL signatures) versus using a W3C JSON-LD credential (based on Ed25519 signatures).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 
 
 Indy AnonCreds are well suited when privacy-preserving and non-transferability are required (this makes them really well suited for government-issued credentials) 
 W3C JSON-LD – these are heading towards being privacy-preserving, but are transferable (this makes them better suited today for when identity binding is not a requirement, but verifiability and trust are still important. For example: a ticket, or a medical prescription.) 
 
 
 
<p>This factor eliminated agents such as <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go">Aries Framework Go</a>, which could have also been a valid option, but it doesn’t support Indy credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are some of the trade-offs that must be taken into consideration when comparing various Aries implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AFJ has both Indy and W3C support and it works in React Native – which brings me to the next factor.</p>
 3C&nbsp; Team, Technology and Skill Set 
<p>What you’re already familiar with and what you’re building can have a big impact on what library you choose.</p>
<p>Our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet is built in React Native. We chose React Native for our mobile wallet because:</p>
 
 It’s a popular language choice amongst developers (making it easier to find developer talent), 
 We wouldn’t have to create native mobile apps for different operating systems (e.g., one codebase for Apple, another code base for Android), 
 It has tons of widely used third party libraries (e.g., internationalization support). 
 
<p>Other agents such as <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a> limits you to writing your application in .NET. From past experiences, we can claim that .NET is a good platform to build mobile apps in and it’s built for enterprise usage. If you already have a mobile app, or you have infrastructure, or you have developers that are familiar with Go then you probably pick Go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It really comes down to developer preference.&nbsp;</p>
 <br>
4&nbsp; What Excites Us About AIP 2.0 
 4A&nbsp; Out-of-band With Connection Reuse 
<p>One of the really big advantages of AIP 2.0 is the ability to conduct out of band communication with connection reuse, in a standardized way.</p>
<p>Out-of-band (non-Aries) communication channels are available between the Verifier and the Prover(s), to allow the Verifier to provide a URL to the Prover.</p>
 
 
 
 Could be an email with a QR code to be scanned by a wallet and a link to be opened on a mobile device to be handled by a wallet 
 Could be a web page displaying a QR code 
 Could be a QR code printed by the verifier and posted 
 
 
 
<p>In-band connection will use a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of DIDs: <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>.</p>
<p>The outgoing messages are based on DIDComm Messaging, however it doesn’t use the in-band routing and encryption as defined by the DIDComm spec – but the replies are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as a first step, while there is no connection, you’re able to send a message using an out-of-band technology. And then you establish the DIDComm connection.</p>
<p>AIP 1.0 was missing a standard way to reuse connections. Labels could be used to identify the requester of the connection, and to not create duplicate connections when the same requestor sent connection requests. Hence techniques such as labels were used as a way to drive connection reuse – resulting in proprietary implementations to achieve connection reuse – a weak point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In AIP 2.0, the RFC added standard out-of-band for connection reuse as part of the protocol. It can be used as a generic out-of-band invitation to either create a connection, do connectionless exchanges, or both. It’s something that the end user does notice and makes UX a lot better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to sign in to a website, so you scan a QR Code.</p>
<p>You create a connection and then you show a proof of a credential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following week you want to sign in from a different computer so you create a connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what used to happen in AIP 1.0 is you would create a new connection, resulting in two connections that would show up in your wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you can reuse the connection, and you can sign in using that connection again, you won’t have to manage multiple connections for the same entity.</p>
<p>Of course we know that there exists use cases where you don’t want connection reuse (e.g., cases where you don’t want to be correlatable across connections). We wrote a recent blog post that scratches the surface of this: <a href="https://northernblock.io/why-credential-issuance-should-be-holder-driven/">https://northernblock.io/why-credential-issuance-should-be-holder-driven/</a>.</p>
 4B&nbsp; Credential Format Agnostic 
<p>This enhancement makes it flexible for implementation teams who would like to use Aries, but have requirements for a specific credential type. A couple differentiations in an above section were described in relation to Indy AnonCreds vs W3C JSON-LD credentials.</p>
<p>Generally in AIP 2.0,&nbsp; a lot of focus has been on removing the dependencies on Indy, making it more standards based to support formats such as the W3C credential. This big enhancement happens through the Issue Credential and Present Proof v2 RFCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The v1 protocol was specifically Indy-focused, meaning you could only use it with AnonCreds credentials. The v2 protocol now supports JSON-LD credentials and it could be defined in such a way that any more could be added later on, making it credential format agnostic.</p>
<p>Now, on the same issue credential protocol, you can now support multiple formats – you can send the credential as either an AnonCreds with an AnonCreds-based signature, as a W3C supporting different signatures, as an mDL, or any other credential format. If both agents support the signature and the message format, then they are able to decrypt what they have received.</p>
 4C&nbsp; Support for 90+ DID Methods 
<p>In AIP 2.0, we’ve also been able to remove the dependency on legacy Indy DIDs and legacy Indy Peer DIDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This wasn’t really adopted before, and now these new protocols use DID Exchange built on top of the W3C DID Core specifications, instead of the connection protocol, and always fully uses qualified DIDs that follow the RFC.</p>
<p>DID Exchange allows you to exchange DIDs and DID Documents. The connection protocol from AIP 1.0 wasn’t very well suited for standards compliant like non-Indy or Pairwise DIDs (this was more a limitation of the implementations and that it was an old protocol leaning on an unreleased/older version of the DID Core spec. There was nothing preventing the protocol to be used with other DID Methods).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DID Exchange protocol supports all DIDs – any method can be used. Of course both agents communicating must support DID Exchange. Peers must support the same DID Methods so that they can resolve the DIDs. For example, if Alice uses did:key and Bob doesn’t support did:key, then it can’t be resolved.</p>
<p>DID Exchange is much more generic – meaning DID exchange opens the door for all DID methods that are registered in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">spec registry</a>, so that 90+ DID Methods could be used.</p>
<p>This is an important upgrade to Aries for staying on top of evolving standards.</p>
<p>And here’s another reason why this upgrade is important.</p>
<p>If you are the Holder of a Bank ID Credential, it’s likely that you can present this ID to a Government Tax Agency and they will trust it. So if you have a did:bank ID which can only be used within their ledger and their governance, the tax agency will accept it since they trust the process that the bank would have done to verify claims and issue this ID to you.</p>
<p>We can draw parallels to how the first numbers on a credit card typically represent the issuer identification number. Using the standard format provides interoperability because you’re not tied to one to a federated ID or a centralized slash. If I’m only using did:sov, it can become a federated ledger if it’s the only ledger which can resolve the DID (identifier).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the end user can select the DID Method, then they’re not tied to a federated model, it’s completely decentralized.</p>
 4D&nbsp; Bring Your Own Identifier! 
<p>The purpose of supporting DID Exchange is to give the end user the freedom to choose their own identifier for the relationship; enabling them to use less/more secure or different DID Methods as their identifier.</p>
<p>It allows you to choose your own identifier for the relationship to avoid the centralized model (e.g., when you sign up for Facebook they give you an identifier).</p>
<p>In this decentralized model, you inform the other party of your identifier you wish to use, and they just have to resolve it.</p>
<p>This now gives end users much more flexibility; allowing the end user to create multiple personas around DIDs and present them as they wish.</p>
<p>Of course with Connectionless you don’t need to do that bootstrapping because you are not creating a connection; you’re creating a key that you’re only going to use for this single exchange, and then you’re going to throw it away – similar to a temporary email that you may use for a single purpose.</p>
<p>The single/temporary key usage can also be true for connection-based exchanges, which brings in the ability to conduct Key Rotation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other party could update their DID Document on the ledger, remove the previous key and update it for a new key. The next time they wish to send you a message, you resolve the DID Document and your agent can know that they changed their keys. Your agent will then begin using this new key to encrypt messages for them, allowing them to rotate keys as needed without informing you.</p>
<p>This brings added security benefits by reducing the chances that your keys get compromised. It’s a concept that’s similar to switching your password every 60 days for online services. If someone gains access to your keys, they can decrypt your messages.</p>
 4E&nbsp; Standardized URL Shortening 
<p>Another thing which has been standardized in AIP 2.0 is the URL shortening mechanism.</p>
<p>This standardization is part of the Aries RFC 0434: Out-of-Band Protocol 1.1.</p>
<p>URL shortening is used to make payloads simpler and smaller (e.g., in QR Codes). We ran into issues at Northern Block in the past in which our QR codes would get too heavy, making them impossible to scan from a mobile device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because URLs weren’t standardized in AIP 1.0, we were forced to create our own mechanism. And so did other vendors, which made it difficult to do interoperability.</p>
<p>Standardizing the way you shorten the URLs whether it’s an invitation, a proof request, or whatever that may be provides interoperability so people are not doing things their own way.</p>
 4F&nbsp; Standardized Mediator Coordination 
<p>Mediators are a store and forward system that provide mobile wallets with a static endpoint. Mobile devices are not guaranteed to be available online when a cloud agent needs to communicate with them. The mediator acts as an answering machine for the mobile wallet and will forward on the encrypted messages it has received when the mobile device is back online.</p>
<p>There’s now a standard protocol for that which is why you can use ACA-Py as the mediator and AFJ on the client-side. It’s not something the user will notice but it makes the infrastructure easier.</p>
<p>There was previously no standard way of registering my routing keys and endpoint with 3rd party mediators. There’s now a discovery protocol for the edge wallet to find the mediator and register itself using a standard protocol.</p>
<p>The Recipient (edge wallet) must know which endpoint and routing key(s) to share, and the Mediator needs to know to which endpoints messages received with a key need to be routed to.</p>
<p>This allows edge wallets (holders) and issuers/verifiers to connect with any third party mediator that supports this protocol, avoiding vendor lock-in.</p>

 Growing the Community 

<p>The Blockchain Commons community continues to grow to the benefit of all of our members.</p>

<p>Welcome to Chia. A big welcome to our newest sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://www.chia.net/">Chia Network</a>, Bram Cohen’s blockchain company. Chia joined mainly because of what we’re already doing, including our work on advocacy and our history with DIDs. We’re thrilled to have them not just because of the interest in our current efforts, but also because of their cutting-edge blockchain work, including the innovative Chialisp smart-contract language, work with pairing-based cryptography, and their <a href="https://www.chia.net/greenpaper/">Proofs of Space and Time algorithm</a>. Blockchain Commons supports the heterogeneity of the blockchain space. We want to make wallets work with multiple blockchains that are built in multiple ways, and having someone like Chia onboard makes that possible.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon. Community growth allows us to hold events to bring that community to share their knowledge. Thus, our first quarter welcoming of <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a> and <a href="https://www.proxy.com/">Proxy</a> allowed us to hold our first Silicon Salon, where semiconductor manufacturers, hardware-wallet makers, and other interested parties joined together to discuss the future of semiconductor design and how it can better support cryptographic functionality. The <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon website</a> contains complete information on the June 1st event, including <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/presentations/">videos, slides, and transcripts of all the presentations</a> as well as an <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/#discussions">overview of the discussions</a> with quotes.</p>

<p>Our reference apps demonstrate how the Gordian principles can be used in functional applications; while our reference libraries make it easy to use our specifications. We continue to upgrade and expand both with the support of our community — and occasionally deprecate some when they’ve served their purpose.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool 1.5. We upgraded our premiere Gordian app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Gordian Seed Tool</a>, to 1.5. This upgrade implemented new experimental functionality related to NFC Tags. You can now write to and read from NFCs by just tapping them with your phone. There are still a number of questions about NFC security, but we’re always interested in testing out the newest technology and considering how it could integrate into our secure architecture — and that type of experimentation is one of the major purposes of our references.</p>

<p>Gordian Server 1.0.2. One of the challenges of producing an application like <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a>, which makes it easy to install and use Bitcoin Core on your Mac, is that we’re vulnerable to any changes in Bitcoin Core itself. Some minor changes in the file names for Bitcoin Core 23.0 required us to do some updates to both Gordian Server and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup Scripts</a>, but everything is now up-to-date, allowing easy installation of a Bitcoin Server that will allow you to work with new Bitcoin technologies such as Taproot and Schnorr signatures.</p>

<p>Gordian QR Tool Deprecation. The maintenance load for apps results in us occasionally deprecating something, and that was the case this quarter for our QR Tool app. We originally released Gordian QR Tool to demonstrate the Gordian principles of resilience and independence in a simple, easy-to-use way. This included a way to store seeds and other vulnerable data as QR codes in a secure vault. However, Gordian Seed Tool has evolved so far since the debut of the two apps that we’ve decided QR Tool doesn’t hold many advantages any more. Thus, we’ve deprecated QR Tool so that we can instead focus our attention on Seed Tool.</p>

<p>Lifehash for Python. Thanks to the support of our sustaining sponsor <a href="https://cramiumsolutions.com/">Cramium Solutions</a> and the work of long-time Blockchain Common contributor &amp; supporter <a href="https://github.com/kanzure">Bryan Bishop</a>, Blockchain Commons is now able to offer a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash-python">Python implementation of our Lifehash library</a>. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info#readme">Lifehash</a> is a Blockchain Commons specification that creates beautiful visual hashes that make it easy to identify data at a glance. Thanks to Cramium for making this methodology available to Python programmers!</p>

 Evolving Smart Custody 

<p>Smart Custody is one of Blockchain Commons’ oldest projects, and it continued to see new life in the last quarter.</p>

<p>Full Draft of Multisig. We have completed the first draft of our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">multisig scenario for self-sovereign #SmartCustody</a>. Since our rough draft last quarter, we’ve added dozens of illustrations and responded to reviews, creating a new draft that’s hopefully more usable and definitely more accurate. Though we’re thrilled to now be able to advocate for a multisig solution for self-custody, in the process we’ve learned both that its complexity can be intimidating and that the specificity of required devices can make it unapproachable. So expect both more expansions in the future (to support more variants), as well as some bigger Blockchain Commons projects that will start to demonstrate how we can make multisigs simple.</p>

<p>Outline for #SmartCustody 2.0. We’ve been thinking about a second edition of our 
<a href="https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101">Smart Custody book</a> for a few years and have recently created <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md">a new outline for SmartCustody 2.0</a>. We’re not quite sure when we’ll be able to dedicate time for it, but these are our current thoughts on documenting SmartCustody for the future. In the meantime, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody#smartcustody-scenarios">Smart Custody Repo</a> for the scenarios, tools, and case studies that we’ve written in the last year and which will eventually appear as modules in the #SmartCustody 2.0 book.</p>

<p></p>

 Welcome to New Interns 

<p>For the third year in a row we’re running a Blockchain Commons virtual-intern program this summer.</p>

<p>The Third Cohort of Blockchain Commons Interns. Welcome to our latest cohort of Blockchain Commons interns, which this year includes 16 interns out of twice that many applications. We’ve always wanted to broaden our internships to go beyond just software engineers, and we’ve been pleased with the success of that this year, with a pre-law intern now leading a whole group in the support of our advocacy work in Wyoming. Projects our interns are working on include: the support for that legislative work in Wyoming and elsewhere; expanding Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line for new Taproot and Schnorr technology; exploring the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0322.mediawiki">BIP-322 proposal</a> to leverage Bitcoin Script to sign arbitrary messages; updating <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">Spotbit</a>; and writing use cases for human-rights workers such as emergency and medical personnel, monitors, press, and advocates. We look forward to reporting back on these projects at the end of summer.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Pre-Updates. To get the Learning Bitcoin course ready for our newest interns (and for their own work on it), we updated Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line for all recent PRs and to address all recent issues (most of which had to do with updates to Bitcoin Core over the last year). Thank you to everyone who has helped us to keep the Learning Bitcoin module up-to-date and correct over the years! We haven’t flagged an official release yet, as we’re hoping to at the end of summer, but the Learning Bitcoin course should now be more accurate and up-to-date with Bitcoin Core 23.0 commands.</p>

 Working with Wyoming 

<p>We’ve been thrilled to continue working with the Wyoming legislature, with support from our new interns. Christopher Allen and one of our interns gave new testimony on a variety of topics this June, with support from the legislative intern team.</p>

<p>E-Residency. We’ve spoken several times in Wyoming to advocate for e-residency, which will allow corporations to take advantage of the excellent digital business &amp; privacy laws that Wyoming has been advancing in the last several years. A local paper gave <a href="https://www.thesheridanpress.com/news/local/wyoming-considering-following-in-estonias-footsteps-with-new-program/article_fa2161e0-ed7f-11ec-b22a-db4cbe8144e0.html">good coverage</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>WRDAs. We also advanced new ideas on Wyoming Registered Digital Assets (WRDAs), which will improve Wyoming’s treatment of digital assets by allowing for perfection under the UCC. Here’s our <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061408-03WyomingWRDASlides.pdf">slides on the topic</a>.</p>

<p>Private Key Protections. Finally, our most important testimony for Wyoming may have been about protecting private keys from disclosure by courts. The problem is that courts are current endangering digital assets, information, and identity by demanding the turnover of private keys, often as part of pretrial motions. They’re not the proper tool, and they’re not being used in the proper way. Because this is such an important topic, we’re currently working on a position paper that will better explain why private keys are not appropriate for this usage.</p>

<p></p>

 Looking toward the Future 

<p>A lot of our work in Q2 was forward-looking, developing specs and architectures that we hope will be the next generation of responsible key management on the internet.</p>

<p>We expect to advance three major projects in the third quarter based on this work.</p>

<p>CSR. Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR) is the first step in the development of our next-generation Smart Custody architecture. The <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/149">CSR Project</a> is intended to automate the sharding and recovery of seeds and other essential metadata, with options to support shard-recovery services: interopable services will hold envelopes of data containing shards of the data required for wallet recovery and only return them to users following sufficient authentication. This work is currently being done in conjunction with Bitmark and Proxy.</p>

<p>Hardware API. The varied APIs of hardware devices can cause numerous integration problems for developers (the so-called “NASCAR Problem”. Thus our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/158">Hardware API Project</a> seeks to develop a  unified wallet architecture &amp; APIs that will work with a variety kinds of devices. We also plan to leverage URs and crypto-requests and to support device capability discovery. The first steps will be analyzing and assessing current hardware APIs, abstracting out functionality, and simultaneously leveraging new work such as that being done by CrossBar for silicon support. This work is currently being done in conjunction with CrossBar and Proxy while Blockchain Commons contributes specs and coordination.</p>

<p>Reference Upgrades. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/159">Automated multisig round-trips</a> are meant to expand the work Blockchain Commons has already done on Uniform Resources (URs) by using <code>crypto-requests</code> to automate the creation and usage of a classic (pre-Taproot) Bitcoin multisig. This will be done through the development of a new reference app, Gordian Coordinator, which will be a transaction coordinator that holds no private keys, and through the expansion of Gordian Seed Tool. Our ultimate goal is to demonstrate the ease of use possible with a fully integrated system of <code>crypto-requests</code>.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to the development of these exciting new architectures and designs for the future!</p>

It was a successful conference for the community, lots of fun, lots of heads turned, and lots of interest. Many community members attended, and for most of us it was the first time we all met in real life! It was an absolute pleasure and privilege meeting fellow community members and making friends along the way. The conference ignited a renewed sense of urgency for the continuation of the Verus mission. A public good for all of humanity, enabling novel ways for people to work together and create value.

<p>Anonyome Labs is a respected authority on&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity&amp;et_pb_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess&amp;et_pb_include_posts=yes">decentralized identity</a>. Our CTO and co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley frequently presents on the topic at conferences and seminars.</p>



<p>On 30 and 31 May 2022, Dr Ashley was honored to present a keynote address at the&nbsp;<a href="https://symposium-dlt.org/bafw/">Workshop on Blockchain Applications and Fintel</a>&nbsp;in Brisbane, Australia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshop, hosted by Griffith University, was a platform for sharing knowledge, innovations and practical experiences for industry, government and academia on the opportunities and challenges of real-world applications of blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



 What is blockchain? 



<p><a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain">Blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a database for recording information so it can’t be changed or hacked (immutable). It’s how we establish&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in decentralized systems. You might have heard of blockchain in relation to bitcoin.</p>



<p>Blockchain is a type of decentralised database that multiple participants (computers in a network) manage. It can be used for almost anything valuable such as supply chains, payments, accounts, production, orders, decentralized exchanges, smart contracts, etc. Blockchain has many benefits to users, including that it’s cost effective and lower risk than a centralized database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchains are unlimited in number and increasing all the time. Right now, about 1,000 blockchains exist in the world, with four different&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/What-are-the-4-different-types-of-blockchain-technology#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20main%20types,benefits%2C%20drawbacks%20and%20ideal%20uses.">types of blockchain network</a>&nbsp;(public, private, consortium and hybrid). Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain">this</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-blockchains-are-there/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20there%20are%20at%20least,platforms%20provided%20in%20this%20industry.">this</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>



 Dr Ashley discussed where the world is at with decentralized identity, one of the most important uses cases for blockchain&nbsp; 



<p>At the Brisbane workshop, Dr Ashley presented on the&nbsp;“Progress and Pitfalls on the Path to Decentralized Identity”. He discussed:</p>



  Improving privacy in the surveillance economy  What decentralized identity is, and the transition from centralized to decentralized identity management  Decentralized identity wallet&nbsp;  Decentralized identity blockchain  Decentralized identity verifiable credentials (or digital ID documents)  Decentralized identity standards  A case study on Block’s tbdex decentralized exchange protocol.  



<p>Dr Ashley concluded:</p>



  With the continued rise of the surveillance economy, the world needs solutions that improve privacy for everyday internet users.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Decentralized Identity is the most important privacy technology innovation for the next decade, giving users control of their personal data.&nbsp;  Decentralized identity-based applications rely on blockchain as the anchor of trust and therefore decentralized identity is one of the most important use cases for blockchain technology.&nbsp;  Although there has been a lot of progress in decentralized identity in the past few years, there are still many pitfalls that need to be overcome, including interoperability and ease of use for the everyday user.  



 Anonyome Labs offers decentralized identity capabilities in Sudo Platform 



<p>Dr Paul Ashley was an obvious choice for the keynote address on challenges and benefits of real-world applications of blockchain and decentralized identity as a use case for it. Anonyome Labs&nbsp;is enhancing its&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;digital identity with decentralized identity capabilities, to help&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/04/part-1-how-the-sudo-digital-identity-can-help-stop-the-attack-on-personal-privacy%ef%bf%bc/">stop the full-scale attack on personal privacy</a>. This functionality is available through our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;SDKs, to help enterprises rapidly develop and deploy customer privacy solutions.</p>



 Beyond Sudo Platform, Anonyome Labs supports the ongoing development of decentralized identity by: 



  Helping to run three decentralized identity-focused blockchains  Being an active contributor to the decentralized identity standards organizations  Contributing source code back to the decentralized identity open source community.  



<p>Decentralized identity is considered the most important privacy innovation for the coming decade since it provides the foundation for great improvement in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>. Learn more on our blog, or go straight to:&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the evolving world of open banking, it’s easy for businesses to get lost in the endless possibilities. Who do we partner with to provide services at scale? How do we make it easier and faster for our fintech, merchant and lender partners to use our services? What is the most effective way to deploy the power of open banking? <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html">Mastercard</a> today announced an expansion of its <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/engage/#/en/home">Engage</a> partner network to help businesses decide who they can count on for technology integration of open banking services. We connect platform providers and ecosystem partners and help them provide open banking services at scale, making it easier and faster for fintech, merchant and lender clients to utilize consumer-permissioned data to offer new and improved financial services.</p>
<p>The Engage network offers businesses easy access to financial technology partners that can quickly build and deploy open banking services for payments and lending decisioning use cases at scale. The initial partners to join Mastercard Engage for open banking include <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>, <a href="https://fintechautomation.com/">FinTech Automation</a>, <a href="https://www.i2cinc.com/">i2c</a>, <a href="https://www.link.money/">Link Financial Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.loanpro.io/">LoanPro</a>, <a href="https://www.novacredit.com/">Nova Credit</a>, <a href="https://www.provenir.com/">Provenir</a>, <a href="https://synctera.com/">Synctera</a>, <a href="https://www.ternitup.com/">Tern</a> and <a href="https://usio.com/">Usio, Inc</a>.</p>
<p>Through this new program, these providers benefit from fewer contracts, faster access to customers, data security and access and overall flexibility to better leverage Mastercard’s robust open banking services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard has a long-standing track record of working with technology and fintech partners to build the future of financial services and enable more choices for consumers. With three billion cardholders and 93 million merchants, the more partners Mastercard has, the more powerful the flywheel of our network becomes. Since 2018, nearly 150 partners around the world have joined the Mastercard Engage program. In the last year alone, nearly 100 Engage partners have helped their customers deploy new, innovative solutions on more than 250 million accounts with Mastercard digital services, including all-digital consumer payments experiences, tokenization, digital wallet, mobile POS solutions and now, open banking.&nbsp;</p>
 Implementation Choices to Fit Your Needs 
<p>Open banking through Mastercard and its technology partners allows businesses to establish direct consumer-permissioned connections with their customers’ bank accounts. Through these consumer-permissioned connections, businesses can verify accounts for payments and payouts, check balances to reduce payment failures, and cut fraud by confirming bank account ownership. This has improved the payment experience for both the businesses and their customers. </p>
<p>Similarly for lending, borrowers can directly permission data and insights through the ecosystem to support their lending decisioning processes. This also means a better lending experience for both the lender and borrower, as it provides financial insights, expanded data sets not available through paper submissions, increased financial inclusion, and a simplified experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Engage program provides two implementation options for open banking technology integration partners. The first two offerings are Partner Linked and Partner Direct. These methods provide a seamless and secure implementation of consumer-permissioned data through Mastercard’s open banking platform and can be used together or separately, depending on the preference of the financial technology provider.</p>
<p>Partner Linked provides broad ecosystem access, allowing business clients to quickly begin using the solutions through their preferred platform partner. This integration is an agreement with a partner and a direct agreement with the business. Engage partners can integrate to Finicity, Mastercard’s wholly-owned subsidiary with a customer-supplied access key, shielding their businesses from needing to handle user credentials. This method provides simple integration for our partners and the business contracts directly with Finicity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Partner Direct is a reseller agreement that allows for greater customization than the Partner Linked integration, and direct access to provide business clients with a single integration for all open banking data, lending and/or payment services. Partners can directly embed and/or resell Mastercard open banking services and offer a customized experience for their business customers, wrapping additional value-added services around Mastercard’s open banking platform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As an Engage technology partner, you can expect:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Go-to-market collaboration – Helps technology providers sell and deploy their solution in new markets and find new customers.&nbsp; 
 Promotion – Partners are featured on Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/engage/#/en/home">portal</a> to gain visibility and credibility with all Mastercard customers. 
 Training &amp; insights – <a href="https://academy.mastercard.com/events/mastercard-academy-north-america/event-summary-86538b8600e74bc4877f7af7ca3366a0.aspx?dvce=1">Mastercard Academy</a> gives partners access to a series of product and solution training sessions. They can also participate in regional forums with insights from Mastercard and its partners around value and product propositions as well as market priorities. 
 Technical support – Partners gain access to a network of global and regional technical engineers that can help address technical questions. 
 
<p>Some Mastercard open banking services are delivered through Mastercard’s wholly -owned subsidiary, Finicity Corporation. Open banking services through the Engage program are launching with U.S. partners today with plans to expand globally.</p>

<p>Athens is the cradle of Western civilization. So, it’s only fitting that the technical seeds of new democratic structures, rooted in blockchain, would begin to grow at <a href="https://twitter.com/GrapeAthensDAO">AthensDAO</a>.</p>



<p>Our Berlin-based engineers, Dan Kelleher and Alexis Raptarchis, recently journeyed south to take part in the Grape Protocol sponsored hacker house. Familiar with the many aspects of managing DAOs in both the physical world and in Web3, they were happy to connect with projects working to solve some of the same challenges.</p>



<p>During the week, the pair met with <a href="https://realms.today/realms">Realms</a>, a DAO governance platform on Solana. Together, they integrated our flagship product, Civic Pass, in order to introduce a veritable Swiss Army knife of tools to DAO admins and <a href="https://youtu.be/WauMPATsylA?t=14121">an enthusiastic hacker house</a>. Civic Pass allows real-world constraints and permissioning to be added to a DAO’s membership, based on digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because DAOs have flat organizational structures and shared bank accounts, decision-making can become more transparent and trusted — in part because of the smart contracts executing the decision-making. In practice though, delegating authority to a DAO can add unexpected challenges, from issues surrounding everything from human disagreements to cyber attacks on the system itself. Civic Pass helps alleviate some of these challenges.</p>



<p>Sybil resistance</p>



<p>Sybil attacks, which use large numbers of pseudonymous identities to gain unfair influence and voting rights, may be prevented with liveness and uniqueness verification by Civic Pass. Sybil resistance is essential for enabling systems like quadratic voting and one-person-one-vote systems. It is essentially the core benefit of uniqueness on DAOs.</p>



<p>Trusted decision-making processes</p>



<p>After a DAO makes a choice to be Sybil resistant, the DAO may enable one-person-one-vote and quadratic voting systems.</p>



<p>One-person-one vote</p>



<p>Checking for uniqueness can also prevent members from accumulating more than their allotted share of one vote. This may help prevent whales or individuals with a large number of wallets from voting more than once.</p>



<p>Quadratic voting systems</p>



<p>An upgrade on the standard on-person-one-vote system that most collectives employ, quadratic voting allows for voters to express the degree of their preferences, which helps eliminate majority rule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Location and age gating</p>



<p>DAOs may need to keep out minors or members from certain locations, based on local laws or other criteria. Civic Pass helps by verifying this information, while keeping other user information private.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC requirements</p>



<p>DAOs may need to adhere to local laws related to compliance. If they are subject to compliance, Civic Pass can help provide inputs to satisfy requirements.</p>



<p>In sum, we’re thrilled about this integration. Civic Pass helps DAO leaders set expectations around how voting will be conducted and protect the DAO at the same time. We are looking forward to hearing about how these features are put into practice.</p>

 Meet the Team — Todd Collins, Head of&nbsp;Design Todd Collins<p>Meet the Team is our ongoing series of employee profiles. It’s an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little better. As a remote company with employees around the world — from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand — it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>We’re excited to introduce Todd Collins, Head of Design at GlobaliD. Todd has an art school background with a focus on industrial design. He spent the early part of his career as a marketing designer with companies such as E-Trade and Oracle before helping design and launch Feedbin, a popular RSS&nbsp;reader.</p><p>Now, he’s a central part of our team working on the future of digital identity. During our conversation, Todd discussed the challenge of reimagining what identity looks like, developing language and visuals that appeal to people, but are also easily understood, and what attracted him to his role at GlobaliD.</p> Introducing Todd&nbsp;Collins <p>I’m Todd Collins, Head of Design. My responsibility is to own the user experience and user interface around the GlobaliD&nbsp;app.</p><p>When I first got the position, Greg [Kidd] told me that we needed to define what a credential is in this space, that I needed to define the future of what digital identity and credentials look and feel like, because these things didn’t yet exist in the world — at least not in the way we think it&nbsp;should.</p> On how designing in the world of digital identity is&nbsp;unique <p>This is sort of a unique position to be in, design wise. Typically, you’re working on things that already exist, that you can get easy inspiration from. But with digital identity, you’re really carving out your own path into a jungle. You have a machete and you’re cutting your way through, and people are going to be following you versus the other way around, which is part of the&nbsp;fun.</p> Why GlobaliD appealed to&nbsp;him <p>I’m at GlobaliD because it sounded really murky, really undefined. I don’t want to work at some other tech company and just do optimizations, post-market fit and all that. In that situation you’re just kind of making the company more money — optimizing, making more money, optimizing. This was not that, and that was very attractive to&nbsp;me.</p> What he likes about self-sovereign identity versus the convenience of big&nbsp;tech <p>I think Big Tech has caused a lot of issues with how they’re rolling out identity and how they’re managing it, which is very profitable for them, but I love the idea of controlling your own&nbsp;data.</p><p>There are conveniences with Big Tech, like using Google to log in across the web, but that means they get even more of your&nbsp;data.</p><p>What’s really cool about the notion of web3 is being able to connect to things and share just bits and pieces of info that are relevant. Hopefully, in the future, sharing data will be beneficial to me, and I’ll control it. There’s nothing wrong with getting a very good targeted ad as long as I’ve given you permission to access my data and only the data that I want you to&nbsp;see.</p> On his design priorities — make it relatable <p>I don’t want to build products for the San Francisco tech elite. It needs to be something that folks can actually use. How would this work if my mom was using it? How can I avoid making this some sort of technical thing? Those are the questions I think&nbsp;about.</p><p>I need to take this very complex concept, this challenging mental model, one that’s intimidating for anybody coming into it, and remove a lot of the complexity. So that in the end, folks understand what they’re doing and what’s happened.</p><p>There’s a lot of terms that get thrown around in the web3 space, and they just feel like gatekeeping to me. Like gas — that’s just a fee. If we ever have gas involved in our wallet I don’t want to use that term. I want to use terms that people understand. Just call it a fee. We all understand what a fee is. My mom knows what a fee&nbsp;is.</p><p>So, it needs to be relatable. That’s always going to be a big thing for me in my design philosophy.</p> Bridging the gap between physical ID cards and our digital&nbsp;future <p>The way I think about it is that we’re in a transitional phase between what we’re used to in the non-digital ID world and what we’re bringing over to the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Which is why right now, in our ID wallet that will be launched later this year, we have cards. Those are what we call the level ones. They look like cards, but they don’t look exactly like the ID cards in your wallet because we’re not interested in remaking a digital version of&nbsp;that.</p>Preview of the upcoming GlobaliD ID&nbsp;Wallet<p>We’re using a skeuomorphic approach, which is when you take a physical object and mimic it in the digital world so it’s easier for the user to interact with it. The early versions of Apple Books used this approach when they first launched to make folks feel comfortable with the idea of a digital book. These days, folks are very comfortable with these things and the skeuomorphic approach is not as needed&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>I see the card thing for the next couple years as the same kind of bridging approach where we’re helping people get used to the idea of digital IDs, but in the long run, I don’t even want to see the&nbsp;cards.</p> Making credentials, ID wallets and digital identity&nbsp;cool <p>We need to make this something that people covet, and that will open up the door to more people adopting digital identity.</p><p>We have plans after the initial launch to really beautify the credentials you’ll keep in your ID wallet, to put some cool designs in there. That way, if you’re at the coffee shop and you show your ID, or you’re at the bar and you show that digital version of it, people are like, what the heck is that? That’s super, that’s awesome. I want one of those! That’s what I’m trying to achieve right now in the short term with the&nbsp;team.</p> What the digital form factor can bring to&nbsp;identity <p>It’s important that we take advantage of the digital form factor, that’s key. With something digital we can bring in motion, we can bring in animation and other dynamic pieces to it. We can constantly update the look and feel of it. Whereas with physical IDs, you can’t do any of that. It’s a physical artifact that can’t change once it’s been made. So, it’s important that we really utilize the opportunities that come with designing digital products.</p> On his education background and early&nbsp;career <p>I actually started out as a musician. I was a drummer, and I was playing in bands, but then I decided I should go to college. I went to art school and studied industrial design, and I loved it. I liked working with my hands. I got to design and build a lot of physical things, work on computers, things like&nbsp;that.</p><p>After graduating I immediately went into marketing design. I worked for all sorts of Bay area companies like E-Trade, Oracle, Lyft, Samsung, and a bunch of startups as well. I was building marketing websites, doing product discovery and always working on something new. I really loved being in that&nbsp;space.</p> How he helped build the Feedbin RSS&nbsp;reader <p>Ben, a developer I was working with at the time, told me he was developing a project and asked if I could do some design work for him. He ended up creating Feedbin, a web-based RSS reader, because he got the feeling Google had stopped working on Google Reader, their own RSS&nbsp;service.</p><p>He announced it, and shortly afterwards, Google said they were shutting down Google Reader. All of a sudden we were getting thousands of people signing up for our service. Next thing you know, he started charging for it and generating revenue. He asked if I would help him out moving forward, and here we are 10 years later. We’ve got over 10,000 paying customers including prominent CEOs and journalists. There’s also a mobile app and a Feedbin podcast app is on the&nbsp;way.</p> What he’s most excited about for GlobaliD moving&nbsp;forward <p>I want to bring GlobaliD to the next level. I think that our users are in a good spot for 2022. We’ve set them up for success with the beautiful wallet we’ve created, but I’m very excited to bring on more verification partners. I really want to connect with businesses and provide a product they see as a legit solution to their problems. That’s what I see as the biggest challenge and opportunity moving forward — really serving those business needs, and then beyond, working with credentials issuers as well. That’s what excites me right now, trying to make that work and bring these awesome products to&nbsp;market.</p><p>We’re hiring!

				  Soul-bound tokens are not designed for privacy, verifiable credentials are—and they can be deployed now  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Privacy by design means, as the European Union explains, “nothing more than ‘data protection through technology design.’” But in this case, “nothing more” means quite a lot. As a company building identity solutions for enterprises around the world, privacy by design is non-negotiable. Privacy preserving technology is seen as a given technological starting point and not a bolt-on feature. The business vibe shift, so to speak, is that privacy is a digital right and that decentralized identity technology is a superior solution to the imperfections of data privacy law. With decentralized identity, you get authentication and you get privacy by design in a way that generates security by design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what is there to say about a new technology that doesn’t do this? Apparently lots. The paper “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul</a>” has generated much discussion as a more advanced and beneficial way of applying an NFT-type technology to encode “social relationships of trust” in Soul-Based Tokens.</p>
<p>It’s a thoughtful and provocative paper with many interesting ideas that go beyond the scope of the single, critical point we wish to address. So, we’re going to go straight to section 8.4 where the arrow strikes Achilles in the heel. Soul-Based Tokens, the authors admit, “ are initially public[,] making them inappropriate for sensitive information like government-issued identification.”</p>
<p>In fact, it’s worse than that. Anything rendered as a Soul-Based Token can be correlated by virtue of being recorded on-chain. It’s a recipe for creating honeypots of personal information that can be read, anonymously, by anyone. Even little bits of what might be considered ‘mostly harmless’ private information when correlated can present unexpected privacy problems. What this means is that the only information safely applicable for use in a Soul Bound Token is so impersonal as to be of little practical use.</p>
<p>This is a marketplace non-starter. (not that there is a market-ready Soul-Based Token system to deploy). The ability to share sensitive information in a privacy preserving way and without writing any of it to a blockchain is precisely what companies and governments want from decentralized identity solutions and it’s what verifiable credential technology gives them.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials enable “social relationships of trust” (what we at Indicio call “Trusted Digital Ecosystems”) because they are verifiable without checking in with the source, they give the data owner control of their data, and they enable that data to be shared through privacy preserving mechanisms (selective disclosure and zero knowledge proofs).</p>
<p>Again, we focus on this section of the paper because it is the flaw that stops the vision taking flight. New ideas have to be evaluated in terms of the technologies we have available today and the issues that exist in the identity space and the marketplace. Verifiable credential technology is being implemented right now because it works to solve the issues that currently exist in the identity space and in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Don’t misinterpret our focus on delivering technology today as a lack of enthusiasm for the technologies of tomorrow. Every technology we have today was once a new idea that developed over time, and we look forward to seeing how the ideas animating Soul-Bound Tokens (and other new developments) will mature over time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’re focused on delivering solutions now, and we’re <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">happy to explain</a> why open source verifiable credential technology is the best solution available.</p>

Over the past two years we’ve needed to access all sorts of services, while to do so, we’ve used different means to share personally identifying information. This is not without risk: some of the methods used do not lend themselves to strong credentials verification, and cybercriminals will look for ways of misappropriating people’s personal information, which highlights the need for&nbsp;reform.”</p><p>The emergence of DID technology allows Internet identity and personal sensitive data to be protected.

 KYC and AML solutions are playing an increasing part in tackling money laundering in Germany. But are Germany’s strict regulatory requirements holding its financial services back? IDnow investigates. 



<p>Every year around <a href="https://www.linklaters.com/en/insights/blogs/businesscrimelinks/2021/february/the-recent-reform-of-german-money-laundering-law">€100 billion of laundered money</a> circulates throughout the German economy.</p>



<p>Money laundering and other types of financial crime are rapidly growing problems that threaten the stability of the global economy. In fact, according to the United Nations, money laundering accounts for 2-5% of global GDP (around US$800 billion to US$2 trillion). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulations have long been in place to help prevent money laundering activities. These began with rules from the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/">Financial Action Task Force </a>(FATF) in the 1990s and have evolved and been adopted by many countries since then. As an EU member, Germany follows the European Parliament’s Anti-Money Laundering Directives (AMLD), which are implemented in German law through the German Anti-Money Laundering Act, known as <a href="https://www.brd.nrw.de/themen/kommunales/handel-handwerk-gewerbe/neues-geldwaeschegesetz">Geldwäschegesetz</a> (GWG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oversight and regulation in Europe are handled at a country level. Read our blog to discover more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-aml-kyc-challenges/">how KYC technology is being used to cle</a>an up the UK’s financial services sector. In Germany, <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">BaFin </a>is the regulatory body overseeing and enforcing financial institutions’ compliance with AML and KYC regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although AML and KYC compliance is a legal obligation, there are other important reasons why banks should adhere to compliance rules. Adhering to regulations helps protect banks and fintechs, and their customers from harm, and is likely to enhance the reputation and trustworthiness of the company in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 



  



 What is BaFin and the Geldwäschegesetz?&nbsp; 



<p>AMLD regulations were first introduced in 1991 and have passed through several iterations, each of which has offered improved regulation and coverage, alongside changes in criminal behavior and improvements in technology. The latest 5AMLD regulations and 6AMLD regulations were introduced in 2020 and 2021, and like the upgrades before them, made significant improvements, including a greater focus on Politically Exposed Person (PEP) screening, and sources of finance, while creating consistency and understanding across the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Germany, the GWG Act has been updated several times to reflect changes in AMLD regulations – most recently to reflect the new requirements for enforcement and punishment under 6AMLD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Germany regulatory body known as <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">BaFin</a>, (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), or the Federal Financial Services Authority, reports to the Ministry of Finance, and the Federal Government appoints its president.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BaFin’s responsibilities include AML and KYC but is also responsible for issuing licenses for financial institutions, controlling audits and financial statements, enforcing penalties for financial institutions, and protecting consumers.&nbsp;</p>



 What is the current legal framework for AML in Germany?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>AML law in Germany is implemented through GWG, which covers all aspects of AML and KYC legal compliance, including:&nbsp;</p>



  Definitions and scope of money laundering and AML activities, and obliged entities.  Requirements for customer due diligence, risk assessment, and monitoring.  Escalation and reporting of suspicious activity requirements.  The involvement of the German Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), responsible for analyzing and recording suspicious transactions. It also maintains a centralized database.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Enforcement and criminal liability.  



<p>One area where country-specific regulations can differ significantly is the technical implementation of AML and KYC procedures. AMLD guides the required procedures and scope of AML and KYC, but does not specify the technologies to be implemented, or permitted levels of automation. This is left to the discretion of the national regulator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>BaFin takes a more conservative approach than other regulators, such as UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, by only allowing automated verification via video review, which requires a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature</a> (QES) and a small bank transfer as part of onboarding.</p>



 <br>How to comply with AML regulations in Germany&nbsp; 



<p>The GWG Act specifies a risk-based approach to AML. It requires the development of a risk management system and process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such processes must be embedded in the organizational infrastructure and followed by all relevant employees. BaFin gives instructions and requirements for staff training in AML, but it is left to organizations to decide on the best training format and timing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Processes must also be in place for the escalation and reporting of suspicious customers and transactions – both internal and to authorities. In Germany, such cases must be reported to the <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/Geldwaeschepraevention/Verdachtsmeldewesen/Verdachtsmeldewesen_node_en.html">Financial Intelligence Unit</a> (FIU).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the KYC process, three main stages, or components, must be set up, which are standard in regulations across Europe:&nbsp;</p>



 
 
  Identity Verification, or the Customer Identification Program (CIP). The first step in the KYC process is to prove that the customer is who they claim to be. This includes both individual and corporate customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Customer Due Diligence (CDD). This takes verification one step further and aims to prove whether the financial institution can trust the customer. CDD is about defining a customer’s risk level, and to what extent they can be trusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
 



 
  CDD includes AML screening to check that the potential client isn’t on any sanctions or Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists. Customer addresses can also be checked. Customers considered to be of higher risk will undergo further checks under <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/enhanced-due-diligence/">Enhanced Due Diligenc</a>e, which can include checking PEP, sanction and watchlists, and monitoring adverse media.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Ongoing Monitoring. AML and KYC compliance is not just about checking new customers during onboarding. Financial institutions must have a program in place for ongoing KYC checks and monitoring. This can include further sanction and PEP checking and regular monitoring of transactions.&nbsp;  
 
 



 How to perform KYC/AML checks as a financial institution or fintech in Germany&nbsp; 



<p>As most new banking customers in Germany are onboarded and verified digitally, the eKYC processes must follow regulatory guidance and feature the three main components described above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customer onboarding and identity verification involves collecting identity documents and checking their authenticity by ensuring the customer and document identity match. In processes that are fully or partially automated, this is increasingly taking place online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CDD must be carried out for all new business relationships (whether this is a person or business). It must also be undertaken in several situations defined by BaFin, including for suspicious or large transactions (over €15,000) or with changes in customer circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Risk assessment procedures must be in place, and further EDD carried out, when the risk is determined to be high. Guidance from BaFin for factors triggering EDD includes:&nbsp;</p>



  Identification of customer or company beneficial owner as a PEP  Complex or suspicious transactions – including those that are unusual or have no apparent economic purpose.&nbsp;  Links or partnerships with a business identified as high risk or located in high-risk countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>BaFin sets several requirements for conducting EDD when necessary. These include involvement from senior management in approvals, enhanced monitoring, and further checks on sources of funds and company relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some notable differences in KYC/AML checks under German regulations compared to other jurisdictions. Rules that financial institutions in Germany need to be aware of include:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Video-based verification. In 2014, Germany was one of the first jurisdictions to permit video onboarding. It is still considered the standard in Germany, as BaFin does not permit the use of artificial intelligence and biometric-based verification that other regulators (including the UK) do, but this is likely to change soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BaFin sets strict standards for video identification procedures, including the stipulation that video identification must take place in real-time, with no interruptions, using end-to-end encrypted channels. Other requirements include standards for video quality, lighting levels, and training of employees to conduct identification. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Use of QES and bank transfer. GWG regulations add an extra layer of protection to AML and KYC. When onboarding and verifying a new customer, a small bank transfer from a named German account must be used as verification support. This simplifies the process of opening additional accounts in Germany, while maintaining a high level of security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reading of ID cards using NFC. Although commonly used throughout the Nordics, the use of identity cards is almost nonexistent in the UK. In Germany, however, identity cards are rolled out to all German citizens, and can be used as a means of verification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What trends and challenges for German KYC and AML practices are coming up?&nbsp; 



<p>AML and KYC processes and techniques have been continually improving since they were introduced to keep pace with changes in criminal behavior, and the regulatory requirements to combat them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technical solutions that make use of increasing degrees of automation will also continue to improve. Several European countries, including the UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Spain now allow the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based methods of verification to check the authenticity of identity documents and biometric verifications of identity. Germany’s BaFin will likely follow suit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other sectors in Germany, change is already happening. In mid-2021, Bundesnetzagentur, the national regulator for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post, and Railways <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-welcomes-bundesnetzagentur-decision-and-predicts-turning-point-for-digital-identity-verification/">authorized</a> the use of AI-based solutions for the verification of certain customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a likelihood that some of this will be addressed in EU-wide AML regulations (including the current draft EU regulation 910/2014), as the EU aims to bring different national AML regulations together to better address fraud and enforcement criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other trends likely to affect AML and KYC include growing privacy concerns in Europe. Any development and updating of GDPR regulations will likely impact data access and data collection and storage as part of customer verification and risk assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Could KYC technology finally clean up the ‘dirty money capital of the world’? IDnow investigates. 



<p>As London is one of the largest financial centers in the world, it is no surprise that the UK continues to be a progressive adopter of new innovations in AML and KYC, and a global leader in promoting corporate transparency. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, London is also known as the “dirty money capital of the world,” with good reason as the National Crime Agency believes money laundering costs the UK <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/national-economic-crime-centre-leads-push-to-identify-money-laundering-activity">over £100 billion</a> every single year. </p>



<p>Money laundering, identity fraud, and other types of financial crime pose a significant threat to the stability of not only the UK’s, but the global economy. In fact, the United Nations reports that <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">financial crime accounts for 2-5%</a> of the global GDP (around US$800 billion to US$2 trillion).</p>



<p>In a bid to prevent financial crime, regulations and AML programs are regularly updated to reflect new techniques and changes in criminal behavior. However, AML and KYC compliance is not just a legal obligation. Adhering to regulations helps protect banks and fintechs, and their customers from harm. It can even enhance the reputation and trustworthiness of an organization.</p>



 AML and KYC obligations for a financial institution or fintech in the UK&nbsp; 



<p>AML is enacted in UK law through several legal acts, principally:&nbsp;</p>



  The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.&nbsp;  The Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Regulations (2019).&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017.&nbsp;  



<p>Compliance is monitored by the government regulator, the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a> (FCA), which regulates both financial institutions and fintechs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, the FCA is regarded as one of the most open and forward-thinking regulatory bodies in the world. It adopts standard global AML procedures, regulations and coverage (largely in line with guidance from the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/">Financial Act Task Force </a>[FATF]). It has also introduced several new concepts, such as RegTech, launched a separate regulatory sandbox environment, extended regulatory coverage to cryptocurrencies, and introduced or approved several automated verification techniques.</p>



 What changes were made to the AML framework after Brexit?&nbsp; 



<p>The UK left the European Union on 31st January 2020, and the transition period ended on 31st December 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, there have been no major changes to UK AML law, as it was mostly introduced before Brexit. Regulations from the European Parliament’s Anti-Money Laundering Directives, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/financial-services/articles/fifth-anti-money-laundering-directive.html">5AMLD </a>(introduced in Europe in 2020) are fully covered by UK law, while the relevant parts of 6AMLD (introduced in Europe in 2021) were already covered by UK law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There have been some small post-Brexit changes to UK AML law though, including:&nbsp;</p>



  EU countries are now classified as “third countries”, so are treated with different risk factors.&nbsp;  The list of high-risk third countries is managed by the UK, while previously it was managed by the EU. The only EU country currently included on the EU list is Malta.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) regulates the EU-UK relationship and has several provisions for information sharing and common AML standards. This includes maintaining central registers of beneficial ownership.&nbsp;  



 How to perform KYC, AML checks as a financial institution or fintech in the UK&nbsp; 



<p>While UK laws and regulations do not prescribe the exact technologies or method of implementation, they do define the essential parts of a KYC process. In general, there are three main stages, or components:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity Verification, or the Customer Identification Program (CIP). The first step in the KYC process is to prove that the customer is who they claim to be. This includes both individual and corporate customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity verification involves collecting identity documents and checking their authenticity by ensuring the customer and document identity match. In processes that are fully or partially automated, this is increasingly taking place online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customer Due Diligence (CDD). This takes verification one step further and aims to prove whether the financial institution can trust the customer. CDD is about defining a customer’s risk level, and to what extent they can be trusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>CDD includes AML screening to check that the potential client isn’t on any sanctions or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons</a> (PEP) lists. Customer addresses can also be checked. Customers deemed to be of higher risk will undergo further checks under <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/enhanced-due-diligence/">Enhanced Due Diligence</a>, which can include PEP screening, checking sanctions and watchlists, and monitoring adverse media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ongoing Monitoring. AML and KYC compliance is not just about checking new customers during onboarding. Financial institutions must have a program in place for ongoing KYC checks and monitoring. This can include further sanction and PEP checking, and regular monitoring of transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 







 The rising use of automated techniques in verification&nbsp; 



<p>Increasing numbers of services have become automated in recent years, especially in the financial services sector. In fact, global consultancy firm, McKinsey &amp; Company believes that companies are now <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">seven years ahead</a> in digital transformation efforts, with the acceleration partly explained by the sudden demand caused by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AML and KYC are areas that are also rapidly changing. Although eKYC, which refers to the digitalization and automation of KYC processing, began by simply moving documentation collection and verification online, it now involves many automated processes and technologies, including video-based verification, followed by artificial intelligence-based techniques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Advanced KYC technologies include:&nbsp;</p>



  Automated validation of identity documents, including checking built-in security features&nbsp;  Biometric and liveness checks to match the user with the identity document&nbsp;  Reading and processing NFC data from cards&nbsp;  Automated AML screening checks, including PEP, sanction list checks and watchlists&nbsp;  



<p>The use of automated techniques in verification varies around the world, with regulators taking different views on whether it is acceptable. As one of the most forward-looking regulators, the FCA generally permits fully automated verification, but this view is not necessarily shared throughout Europe, where only some countries (including Belgium, France, Netherlands, and Spain) allow full automation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automation has many benefits. As it is primarily faster and more secure, it can lead to lower costs, improved customer experience, and increased conversion rates (vital for any bank or fintech). The recognition of improved security is a leading reason for its growing acceptance by the FATF and national regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What trends and challenges for KYC &amp; AML are coming up in the UK?&nbsp; 



<p>While there have been some operational changes to AML since Brexit, there has certainly been no let-up in the attempted monitoring of money laundering in the UK. Indeed, in 2021 the FCA issued <a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/fca/2021/12/20/fca-fines-increase-nearly-four-fold/">400% more fines</a> than the previous year (£577 million in total). Over half of which were for AML compliance failures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UK’s strict regulatory oversight is likely to continue, as is the trend for new techniques and applications of technology. Read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/germany-aml-kyc-regulations/">blog </a>to discover how KYC and AML solutions are playing an increasing role in tackling money laundering in Germany.</p>



<p>As technology develops, changes to regulation will also certainly follow. Many recent changes have focused on enhanced customer checking (including the concept of PEPs), corporate risk and ultimate beneficial owners, and the rising use of cryptocurrency. Future changes are likely to address the increasing use of technology in areas like customer onboarding and automated verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other trends, such as growing privacy concerns, will undoubtedly affect AML and KYC in the UK, and elsewhere. Changes to processes, data collection and storage for customer due diligence, as well as data sourcing for more advanced checks, are likely on the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Existing KYC processes will, of course, continue to develop and improve in tandem. Ongoing monitoring, for example, is already making a significant difference to AML, as monitoring and analysis becomes increasingly automated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Una soluzione unica, frutto della collaborazione tra la prima Certification Authority in Europa<br>e la società leader nei processi di KYC (Know Your Customer) in ambito bancario</p>



<p>Roma, 13 luglio 2022 – InfoCert – Tinexta Group, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea e società leader in Europa nel mercato del Digital Trust, e CRIF – azienda globale specializzata in sistemi di informazioni creditizie e di business information, analytics, servizi di outsourcing e processing nonché avanzate soluzioni in ambito digitale per lo sviluppo del business e l’open banking – annunciano di aver completato il processo di integrazione delle rispettive piattaforme tecnologiche in ambito KYC (Know Your Customer) con l’obiettivo di offrire al mercato la più evoluta soluzione per i processi di identificazione, contrattualizzazione e verifiche antiriciclaggio per l’onboarding di clienti in ambito Financial Services.</p>



<p>La progressiva digitalizzazione nel rapporto cliente-banca impone una rivisitazione dei processi di onboarding dei clienti e delle relative verifiche di compliance. Tale tendenza, accelerata negli ultimi anni dalla pandemia, è destinata a crescere ulteriormente nei prossimi anni spinta anche dalla rapida diffusione degli strumenti di identità digitale.</p>



<p>InfoCert e CRIF, entrambi leader nelle diverse fasi della catena del valore nei processi di compliance bancaria, da oggi uniscono le forze per proporre al mercato una soluzione di digital onboarding ancor più completa, integrata, secure by design e conforme a tutte le normative nazionali e comunitarie.</p>



<p>InfoCert contribuisce alla partnership con le competenze verticali, la proprietà intellettuale dei suoi 22 brevetti e la piattaforma TOP® – Trusted Onboarding Platform per l’onboarding e la contrattualizzazione remota, adottata da oltre 120 clienti in 30 paesi e con oltre 20 milioni di onboarding già completati.</p>



<p>CRIF, dal canto suo, porta in dote alla partnership le proprie avanzate competenze analitiche, il proprio ecosistema di credit &amp; business information proprietarie nonché un set di soluzioni innovative per la gestione dei processi di KYC per l’onboarding della clientela retail.</p>



<p>Tra i principali benefici derivanti dalla partnership, oltre alla semplificazione dell’offerta, va sottolineata anche la comodità di potersi affidare ad un’unica piattaforma integrata e pacchettizzata, dotata di avanzate caratteristiche di sicurezza, adatta a rispondere alle esigenze di clienti di qualsiasi dimensione. Inoltre, la piattaforma di InfoCert-CRIF è già predisposta per supportare i futuri schemi di identità Europea basati su digital wallet e credenziali di identità.</p>



<p>Danilo Cattaneo, CEO di InfoCert: “L’unione di due champion del panorama Europeo consente di offrire ai clienti, in un settore strategico come quello dei Financial Services, la possibilità di affidarsi ad una soluzione sviluppata e gestita in Italia, un fattore strategico ancora più rilevante nell’attuale momento storico: viste le elevate tensioni geopolitiche, è alto il rischio di ingerenze nelle infrastrutture critiche di un paese ad opera di soggetti con logiche gestionali e governance dei dati ubicate al di fuori dei confini nazionali o europei. ”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simone Capecchi, Executive Director di CRIF: “Questa partnership nasce dalla volontà di offrire al mercato soluzioni sempre più avanzate oltre che in linea con le recenti novità tecniche e regolamentari. Ognuno dei nostri reciproci clienti si caratterizza per un modello di business diverso, un approccio commerciale unico, una specifica visione del modo con cui si interfacciano digitalmente famiglie e imprese. Pertanto, per poter soddisfare queste esigenze, è necessario un mix di tecnologie, processi, dati e competenze in continua e costante evoluzione che solo due player come CRIF e InfoCert, con la loro consolidata esperienza sui mercati più avanzati e competitivi, possono mettere a disposizione di tutti gli operatori europei e non solo. Per noi, questa partnership tra due leader di matrice italiana, è anche un motivo di grande orgoglio, per il nostro Paese e per la nostra comunità digitale”.</p>

  <p>In an effort to cut costs, improve efficiencies, and cater for a mobile and remote workforce, businesses are adopting cloud services from multiple providers. This has created a host of challenges in managing identity and access across multiple clouds, and has introduced several risks that need to be addressed urgently.&nbsp;Join experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and ARCON as they discuss the security implications and the need for processes and controls to ensure that Identity and access are managed effectively and easily across a multi-cloud environment. They will also consider how a unified management strategy can dramatically reduce cybersecurity vulnerability in a multi-cloud environment.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at how the identity and entitlement management of multi-cloud environments is changing radically. He will also explain what security managers can do to keep on top of this change.&nbsp;Mr. Anil Bhandari, Chief Mentor at ARCON will discuss the challenges in administering and governing multiple user IDs in an ever-expanding multi-cloud world in the current context, and explain how ARCON’s Cloud Governance platform can help to overcome those challenges.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/multicloud-identity-governance"></a>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — July 4th to July&nbsp;10th  Stablecoins, Global Crypto Regulation and Demands for Stricter Frameworks in this Week’s&nbsp;Recap <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s Weekly Regulatory Recap. The crypto prices were comparatively stable last week. Yet, there was no stopping the regulatory blitzkrieg from taking shape as calls for strict regulations continued from various authorities globally. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> US Treasury Pitches a Framework for Global Crypto Regulation <p>In a move that announced the United States’ intention to lead from the front in shaping global crypto regulations, the US Treasury published a fact sheet consisting of a blueprint on how international regulators could team up to tackle the challenges presented by the growing market of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Based on US president Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto, the fact sheet aims to ensure global interoperability for better protection of crypto consumers, investors, and businesses. It also seeks to stop the use of digital assets in illicit activities, such as terrorist financing and money laundering, among other&nbsp;things.</p><p>All in all, this fact sheet will “…reinforce U.S. leadership in the global financial system.”</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/07/us-treasury-develops-framework-for-international-crypto-regulation/">https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/07/us-treasury-develops-framework-for-international-crypto-regulation/</a></p> Bank of England Demands Tough Regulations Citing $2 Trillion Drop in Global Crypto Market&nbsp;Cap <p>The $2 Trillion drop in the global crypto market cap has attracted the attention of international financial regulators, with the recent one being the Bank of&nbsp;England.</p><p>The United Kingdom’s central bank demanded stricter regulations highlighting a brutal crypto market meltdown. It noted that such a massive fall in the global market cap shines a light on the high vulnerability of crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Although the central bank agreed that the overall health of the financial market remains very much unaffected by the falling crypto prices, it went on to say that in time both sectors will become much more intertwined, which will affect the country’s financial stability. Thus, stricter regulation is the need of the&nbsp;hour.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2022-07-05/bank-of-england-crypto-crashes-show-need-for-tougher-rules">https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2022-07-05/bank-of-england-crypto-crashes-show-need-for-tougher-rules</a></p> Singapore Considers Taking Tougher Measures Against Digital Assets Amid Falling Crypto&nbsp;Prices <p>Known for being one of the most crypto-friendly countries, the Singaporean government is now compelled to act tough against the digital assets market amid a drastic fall in the crypto market&nbsp;cap.</p><p>Previously, it had barred crypto service providers from advertising in public spaces. And last week, Senior Minister and Minister in Charge of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Tharman Shanmugaratnam, said that such an unprecedented drop in crypto prices demonstrates the clear need for strict regulatory measures.</p><p>The measures may include retail trading limits and outlawing crypto leverage in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://zeenews.india.com/international-business/crypto-friendly-singapore-mulls-tougher-restrictions-amid-meltdown-2482176.html">https://zeenews.india.com/international-business/crypto-friendly-singapore-mulls-tougher-restrictions-amid-meltdown-2482176.html</a></p> UK Stablecoin Regulation is Likely to be Introduced in&nbsp;August <p>Reports indicate that the UK Treasury is collaborating with the Payments Systems Regulator, the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority, and a few more to prepare a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The legislation is likely to be introduced in&nbsp;August.</p><p>The stablecoin legislation could have been rolled out much earlier. But it was affected by the recent changes in the UK government, such as the resignation of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson &amp; Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi&nbsp;Sunak.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/uk-stablecoin-regulations-only-weeks-away-from-taking-shape-a13687a3ed6d">https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/uk-stablecoin-regulations-only-weeks-away-from-taking-shape-a13687a3ed6d</a></p><p>Although the crypto market cap was comparatively stable last week, with minimal downward pressure, regulators continue to demand stricter regulations to protect investors and the broader financial market. Thus, Virtual Asset Service Providers must prepare themselves for the uphill task of complying with a plethora of national and international crypto regulations. But before that, start complying with current digital asset regulations.</p><p>When it comes to international digital asset rules, begin with the FATF’s Travel Rule, a global piece of law that aims to put an end to the use of digital assets for terrorism financing and money laundering. And the first thing that a VASP will need to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Solution Provider.</p><p>Interestingly, we have a world-class TRSP to suggest — Veriscope! It is the only solution to the “Sunrise Issue” that almost all VASPS suffer from while complying with the Travel Rule.

 Earn by locking OCEAN and by Curating Quality&nbsp;Data  1. Overview <p>ve tokens have been introduced by several projects such as <a href="https://curve.fi/">Curve</a> and <a href="https://balancer.fi/">Balancer</a>. These tokens require users to lock project tokens in return for ve&lt;project tokens&gt;.</p><p>In exchange for locking tokens, users can earn rewards. The amount of reward depends on how long the tokens are locked for. Furthermore, veTokens can be used for voting in grants DAOs or for asset curation.</p><p>We are rolling out veOCEAN to give token holders the ability to lock OCEAN to earn yield, curate data, and vote on OceanDAO proposals.</p><p>People lock their OCEAN up to 4 years to get veOCEAN. If someone locks 1,000 OCEAN, they get 1,000 OCEAN back at the end, plus rewards along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>veOCEAN supports passive staking by default. Active staking can lead to higher&nbsp;yield.</p><p>Going forward, veOCEAN will be the main mechanism for staking OCEAN, and for curation of datasets. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools to achieve similar benefits.</p><p>We aim to launch veOCEAN, including the DF features within 3&nbsp;months.</p><p>The rest of this article elaborates as follows. Section 2 gives design goals. Section 3 gives the veOCEAN design, and section 4 frontend mockups. Section 5 is an FAQ. Section 6 concludes. The appendix discusses Ocean pool&nbsp;risks.</p> 2. Design&nbsp;Goals <p>Ocean pools recently suffered some attacks, which illuminated their risks and the community’s related concerns. Ocean pools are getting wound down, and Data Farming paused until veOCEAN ships. The appendix has&nbsp;details.</p><p>We see this as an opportunity to make some changes! An opportunity to not only resolve the concerns about pools, but to refine the Ocean &amp; OCEAN architecture to make staking itself much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Here are the design goals for&nbsp;veOCEAN:</p>  Make staking much safer. If someone locks 1,000 OCEAN, they get 1,000 OCEAN back at the end, plus rewards along the way. Stakers can only&nbsp;gain.  Offer paths for passive and for active stakers. Some people want to just stake OCEAN in one place and be done. Others people want to engage more, for higher potential returns.  Leverage stakers to help curate datasets — staking on datasets is useful to help identify higher quality datasets but it must be&nbsp;safe.  Reconcile short- and long-term incentives — the longer someone locks their tokens, the more reward and voting power they&nbsp;get.   3. The Design:&nbsp;veOCEAN  3.1 Background <p>We’ve been exploring ve and related ideas in the background since 2021. Other candidate designs include tokenized vaults, bonding curves, and AMM varieties.</p><p>The ve pattern originated with Curve more than two years ago. Since that time, it’s become battle-tested, with millions locked, and billions transacted. Many teams have adopted the <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html">veCRV</a> model, including our friends at <a href="https://app.balancer.fi/#/vebal">Balancer</a> and <a href="https://ve.neworder.network/">New Order</a>. We’re adopting ve for&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> 3.2 Core&nbsp;Idea <p>The core idea is: stake longer for higher rewards and more voting power. A staker can be passive, though they earn more if&nbsp;active.</p>  stake OCEAN for 1 week → get 0.0048 veOCEAN = 1 / (4 *&nbsp;52)  …  stake OCEAN for 1 year → get 0.25&nbsp;veOCEAN  stake OCEAN for 2 years → get 0.50&nbsp;veOCEAN  stake OCEAN for 3 year → get 0.75&nbsp;veOCEAN  stake OCEAN for 4 years → get 1.0&nbsp;veOCEAN  <p>veOCEAN cannot be unlocked before the pre-set time. veOCEAN is non-transferable.</p><p>For OceanDAO grants, people will vote with veOCEAN. This is the “v” in&nbsp;ve.</p><p>veOCEAN holders have earnings from community fees, and from Data Farming. (The next sections give details.)</p><p>Taken together, these mechanics align near-term incentives with long-term incentives to around Ocean and&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> 3.3 Earnings from Community Fees <p>Every transaction in Ocean Market and Ocean backend generates transaction fees, some of which go to the community. 50% of the community fees will go to veOCEAN holders; the rest will go to OceanDAO grants,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>All earnings here are&nbsp;passive.</p> 3.4 Earnings from Data&nbsp;Farming <p>veOCEAN holders will get each weekly DF rewards allocation, except a small carveout for DF&nbsp;Crunch.</p><p>veOCEAN holders can be passive, though they will earn more if&nbsp;active.</p><p>“Being active” means allocating veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs). Then, rewards follow the usual DF formula: DCV * stake. But now, stake is the amount of veOCEAN allocated to the data asset, rather than liquidity in a datatoken pool. (And this stake is safe: you can’t lose your OCEAN as it is merely&nbsp;locked.)</p> 3.5 Evolution of Earnings&nbsp;Volume <p>Earnings from OPC revenue (1) is smallish in the near term but grows to be large in the longer term as DCV&nbsp;. Complementary, DF earnings (2) will be large in the near term (once the DF rewards ramp), and will shrink over time as DF rewards follow a Bitcoin-like distribution curve.</p> 3.6 Flow of&nbsp;Value <p>The image below illustrates the flow of value. On the left, at time 0, the staker locks their OCEAN into the veOCEAN contract, and receives veOCEAN. In the middle, the staker receives OCEAN rewards every time there’s revenue to the Ocean Protocol Community (top), and also as part of Data Farming rewards (bottom). On the right, when the lock expires (e.g. 4 years) then the staker is able to move their OCEAN around&nbsp;again.</p>Flow of&nbsp;value<p>The veOCEAN design is in accordance with the<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e"> Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>, which Ocean uses as its system-level design.</p><p>The veOCEAN code will be forked from the veCRV code. veCRV parameters will be the starting point. To minimize risk, tweaks will be circumspect.</p><p>This is the current design. We expect changes based on feedback from the community, and learnings during implementation.</p> 4. veOCEAN Frontend&nbsp;Mockups <p>Ocean’s Data Farming webapp will be expanded to support veOCEAN, for both veOCEAN lock/unlock and for allocating veOCEAN to data assets. The following mockups illustrate. They may change significantly before final release; we’re sharing them now to help the community understand what veOCEAN might look&nbsp;like.</p>Mockup for veOCEAN lock/unlock. Steps to lock are (1) approve (2) set amount and duration (3) commit the&nbsp;lock.Mockup for allocating veOCEAN, evolved from <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">https://df.oceandao.org</a>. 5. veOCEAN&nbsp;FAQ  5.1 Pricing&nbsp;FAQs   Q: in this scheme, can people stake on fixed-price datasets?  A: yes. They allocate their ve to datasets. Then DF rewards follow the usual DF formula: DCV * ve&nbsp;stake.  Q: does this work for other pricing&nbsp;schemes?  A: Yes, from the get-go! It doesn’t matter how data is priced, this works for all&nbsp;schemes.  Q: With pools getting wound down in Ocean Market, will fixed-price be its only pricing&nbsp;scheme?  A: For now in Ocean Market, yes. However people can price datatokens however they like, leveraging whatever DeFi tools they like. For example. do an IDO via <a href="https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-lbps">Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool</a>, ending up in an unmodified Balancer AMM. And we will continue listening to the community, to understand best where to focus our&nbsp;efforts.   5.2 Staking&nbsp;FAQs   Q: what about passive stakers — people who just want to stake in one place and be&nbsp;done?  A: Earnings are passive bey&nbsp;default  Q: what about active stakers — people who want to do extra work and get rewarded?  A: it works. Half the DF revenue to ve goes to ve stake that users can allocate. Allocate well → more&nbsp;$$   5.3 Third-Party Market&nbsp;FAQs   Q: What do you think could be the monetization / incentive options for third party dApps and Data Markets that build on top of&nbsp;OCEAN?  A: People pay fees on fixed-rate exchange and in consume. 3rd party markets can get a cut of both. More info at <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;docs</a>.  Q: Staking veOCEAN will be an important part in curating the most valuable datasets. Which earning opportunities will stakers have other than DF and fees generated from consume transactions?  A: veOCEAN holders’ earning potential via fees and DF on their own could be quite substantial, eg given that a large portion of OCEAN supply is directed towards DF. No need for more ways per se. There won’t be a fee on locking OCEAN for veOCEAN, because adding that code would have meant changes to veCRV contracts, something we’re not doing for security reasons. Re ALGA or other apps making money on facilitating veOCEAN: there are several ways, the best way to get inspiration is to look at projects on top of base ve tokens, such as <a href="https://www.convexfinance.com/">Convex</a>, <a href="https://aura.finance/">aura</a>, <a href="https://www.redactedcartel.xyz/">Redacted Cartel</a>, and&nbsp;more.   5.4 Chains   Q: Will the Market still need to be multi-chain?  A: Yes, Ocean Market still needs to be multi-chain: all the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">reasons</a> that we went multi-chain for are as valid as&nbsp;ever.  Q: Which chain will veOCEAN be deployed&nbsp;on?  A: Current plan is for veOCEAN core contracts will only be on Ethereum mainnet, and allowing to allocate veOCEAN tokens to any&nbsp;chain.  Q: Which chain should fixed price assets be deployed now in order to be ready for veOCEAN deployment and DF in 3 months&nbsp;time?  A: You can publish assets to any chain that Ocean supports.   6. How the veOCEAN design meets the&nbsp;goals  7. Conclusion <p>veOCEAN is coming. It will mean safer staking. People can earn by locking their OCEAN and by curating quality&nbsp;data.</p> Appendix: Ocean Pools Aims and&nbsp;Risks <p>Ocean V4 has three out-of-the-box approaches to pricing data: free, fixed-price, and dynamic. Each has its use cases and since datatokens are ERC20 tokens, the Ocean backend supports many pricing approaches (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/lets-talk-about-data-pricing-part-i-bbc9cf781d9f">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/value-of-data-part-two-pricing-bc6c5127e338">2</a>).</p><p>We made AMM-based pools a core feature of Ocean Market for these benefits:</p>  Dynamic pricing of data. Automatic discovery of price, based on supply and&nbsp;demand.  Staking. LPing in pools has served as the main vehicle for staking. The Ocean community really wants&nbsp;staking.  Curation. The amount of stake in a pool is an proxy signal for quality of a dataset, to help dataset discovery.  <p>Pools bring risks. First, data price in pools can have high variance, especially in low-liquidity pools. On some occasions since V4 release, LPers that added OCEAN liquidity, and removed it later were surprised to see a drop in their OCEAN. This is impermanent loss (IL). While IL is expected behavior in AMMs, it makes pools less attractive to people who simply want to stake and know that they will get back the same number of tokens as they injected.</p><p>Second, we’ve come to understand that stakers who are not consuming the data should not determine the price of the data. Ocean V3 did this; V4 solved it with one-sided staking. However, Ocean V4 staking still affected pricing: e.g. the more staked on a dataset, the harder it is to move its price. Deep liquidity is a double-edged sword.</p><p>Third, over the past weekend, a new attack vector emerged. A malicious actor found a way to drain OCEAN from pools. The actor did the sequence: (1) stake OCEAN, (2) buy datatokens, (3) unstake OCEAN, (4) sell datatokens. With amounts set just right, the attacker was able to drain a small amount of OCEAN from the pool. Repeated several times, it became a large amount. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-changes-3384fd7e113c">This blog post</a> has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Given the risks, we are winding pools down in the frontend. (They remain active at the chain level, of&nbsp;course.)</p><p>Accordingly, Data Farming will get paused. Counting has stopped on DF4 (the current round as of 12.01am today, Jul 12). All other DF4 parameters will remain the same, including the 10K of OCEAN rewards are available. Rewards will be dispensed on Jul 14, as&nbsp;planned.</p><p>DF will resume when veOCEAN launches.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> for project announcements.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">John Tolbert</a></p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Cybersecurity have for too long been separate disciplines with distinct solutions that have not interoperated optimally. This has put defenders at a disadvantage because malicious actors have increasingly made IAM solutions a primary vector of attack in their campaigns over the last several years. The best path forward for all organizations is to take a unified Identity &amp; Security approach to increase efficiency and reduce mean time to detect threats and respond on time. In this paper, we will consider the innovative methods by which CrowdStrike, a leader in Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response technologies, brings a broader security platform approach that converges and correlates threat signals across endpoints, identities, and workloads.

 What Are the Risks and Challenges of Using Passwords? 
<p>Passwords are the most common form of authentication still on the market today. And this fact makes a lot of sense. Passwords are easy to implement, low cost (on the front-end), and complementary with other authentication methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in many ways, passwords are an artifact of an older time in computing, one where users interacted with local or network machines on a much smaller scale. Modern technology, based on users engaging with dozens of accounts, is demonstrating some of the key weaknesses of password-based authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these fall into recognizable categories:</p>
 
 Social Engineering: Phishing is one of the most prevalent forms of cyberattacks globally, counting on the fact that people will fall for official-looking communications. The success of these attacks also relies on the reality that passwords are completely compromised once given away, and it only takes a few minutes to lose control of an account or a system. 
 Database Theft: Passwords need to be stored somewhere. That “somewhere” is usually a central database—a database that has a huge target on it, depending on its owner. Once a database is hacked, even encrypted passwords will eventually be compromised.&nbsp; 
 Lack of Identity Proofing: Passwords are a form of authentication that cannot guarantee the user’s presence. This means that whoever has the password will be considered authentic no matter where they are. Identity proofing and assurance are impossible with passwords alone.&nbsp; 
 User Experience and Bad Cyber Hygiene: One or two passwords are manageable. Dozens, perhaps a hundred, are not. To help users juggle these passwords, they often avoid following best password practices, like creating long, complex passphrases and using unique phrases for every platform. This leaves them vulnerable to brute-force attacks and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-spraying/">password spraying</a>. 
 
<p>So, while passwords are common, and there are ways to make better use of them, they also have some fundamental flaws across security, usability, and flexibility for compliance.&nbsp;</p>
 
 What Are Alternatives to Passwords? 
<p>Unsurprisingly, enterprise businesses will often provide complete alternatives to single-password authentication systems. Replacing passwords as the only solution for authentication doesn’t just protect the end user, it protects the company as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the more common forms of password alternatives include the following:</p>
 
 Personal Identification Numbers 
<p>Sometimes companies will call for a PIN alongside a password, essentially asking for two different forms of password-like identification. Typically, you won’t find an organization fully replacing passwords with PINs because, by and large, they serve the same purpose and introduce the same risks.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Multi-Factor Authentication 
<p>Multi-factor authentication uses two or more forms of different authentication. By calling for multiple forms of identity verification, the system can assure that both the author is who they say they are and that their credentials haven’t been stolen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For MFA to work, however, the authentication process must include two or more different types of credentials:</p>
 
 Knowledge: The user proves that they know something, like a password or PIN.<br>
 
 Ownership: The user confirms that they own or hold something, like a mobile device or email account.<br>
 
 Inherence: The user proves that they are someone through biometric evidence from their body or behavior.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By combining two or more of these categories, a system can reduce the risk of fraud or identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some common forms of MFA, including the most common two-factor authentication systems, will use passwords in combination with one of the following items:</p>
 
 One-time passwords: OTPs are delivered at the point of authentication, automatically generated by the system and sent to a location that only the user should have access to (ownership). These locations can include an email, SMS text, or automatically generating OTP through a mobile verification app.&nbsp; 
 Biometrics: Several biometrics categories (see below) serve as verification of “inherence.” 
 Geolocation: Some modern authentication methods will check a badge or mobile device for location and only allow authentication based on proximity to a physical space, like an office.&nbsp; 
 Physical Keys: Physical authentication devices differ from OTPs in that they can provide additional security based on cryptography while still serving as proof of ownership. These work well when a very close physical proximity to a device or security measure.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 Biometrics 
<p>Biometrics is the most rapidly expanding form of authentication on the market, mainly due to the proliferation of devices that can collect biometric data quickly. Biometrics are also popular because they are tough to fake—while some biometric information can be spoofed, it’s much more difficult to do than, say, stealing a password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometrics also short-circuit some of the weaker aspects of passwords, specifically that most biometrics require some sort of physical presence and reduce the threat of phishing attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some common forms of biometric authentication include the following:</p>
 
 Fingerprint Scan: Many smartphones, tablets, and workstations include the option for fingerprint scanners. While not 100% unique across the entire human population over time, fingerprints are still remarkably useful alongside or as a replacement for passwords.&nbsp; 
 Facial Recognition: Many modern devices, including camera-enabled computers, can perform facial scans, which are surprisingly unique when factoring in the size, shape and location of every piece involved (hair, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, etc.).&nbsp; 
 Iris Scan: Like facial recognition, iris scans use camera-enabled devices to scan the shape and contours of the iris, a part of the body that is as unique as, if not more than, a fingerprint.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;Voice Verification: Voice analysis was much easier to falsify than a facial scan. However, modern advancements in voice recognition with AI have made voice verification a viable tool for MFA solutions.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Single Sign-On (SSO) 
<p>The challenges of multiple passwords across multiple apps and platforms are monumental. Approaches to managing the complexity of this situation have led to solutions like federated identity, a practice of using a central identity and an authentication manager to log in to multiple platforms. The central organization does not broadcast password information. Instead, external partner sites will send assurance requests to that provider, and when approved, allow the user to authenticate using that set of credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a critical step in reducing the problem of weak passwords or password theft compromising multiple systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A smaller version of this, SSO, uses federated identity for authentication within a single domain. So, for example, while broad providers like Google can help authenticate against a wide range of apps, an SSO solution would do the same for all your accounts tied to your job (cloud apps, HR solutions, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Through a series of transactions, each with over 1,000 embedded operations (with a total of 6,000 separate transactions), the attacker drained larger data pools of $OCEAN liquidity.</p><p>We took the following steps:</p>  To break the attack, we raised the swap fee to 100%, so any swap transactions going through the Ocean Market would result in all proceeds being remitted to the Ocean community wallet.  We committed to the community that all losses would be reimbursed.  <p>Actions from&nbsp;You</p><p>We ask you to do the following:</p>  Remove any remaining liquidity from data pools&nbsp;now.  Publish datasets with a fixed price or free&nbsp;only.  <p>We are now setting up a plan and timeline to execute the following:</p>  Remove the data pool functionality from Ocean&nbsp;Market  Implement veOCEAN for safe staking and&nbsp;curation  Update Data Farming to reward consumption on all priced datasets, regardless of the pricing model. Until then, the Data Farming program will be&nbsp;paused.  Thoroughly examine the attack vector and report to partners and authorities as appropriate.  Calculate losses from liquidity provisioning for everyone and airdrop compensation.  <p>All other usual Ocean activities will continue without any interruption.

				<p>The rules, or governance, of a verifiable credential ecosystem dictate which participants are allowed in a given ecosystem and therefore, who can be trusted. With Trinsic’s Trust Registry Service, ecosystem governance is implemented and configured directly through the Trinsic SDK. This means our customers do not have to build a unique technical solution to solve governance in their ecosystem. It comes baked into our platform with interoperability guarantees, saving you time and resources. Below, we explain what a trust registry is and show what it looks like in action.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Fighting bad actors 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>One of the recurring questions we get at Trinsic is: As a verifier, how do I know that the issuer of a credential is trustworthy? Similar to how anyone could create a fake ID in the physical world, anyone could create a fake or unauthorized verifiable credential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This risk can be managed when verifiers only need to keep track of a few issuers. Those few issuers sign their public DIDs onto the credentials they issue, and those DIDs signify to the verifier that the credentials indeed came from the appropriate issuer. However, when a credential can be issued by hundreds or even thousands of issuers, it is not realistic to expect all verifiers in an ecosystem to maintain their own list of approved issuers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, imagine you are hiring from your local university—simple. But what if you got 100 job applicants from 100 different universities? How would you know which universities were reputable, let alone which were legitimate? Talk about a logistical nightmare.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Introducing trust registries 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>This is where a trust registry comes in. A trust registry is an approved list of issuers and verifiers that are authorized to issue/verify certain credentials in a verifiable credential ecosystem. Trust registries are created and maintained by an ecosystem’s governing authority, who is most often the ecosystem provider.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
									
																					In addition to creating the credential templates and the verification policies for a verifiable credential ecosystem, an ecosystem’s provider creates and maintains a trust registry—an approved list of authorized issuers for the ecosystem.
										
								 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>When a trust registry is in place for an ecosystem, verifiers no longer need to manage a list of valid issuers. They just need to trust one provider who manages the trust registry. If a credential does not come from one of the authorized issuers listed in the trust registry, the verification will be unsuccessful.</p><p><br>Simply put, a trust registry has the following characteristics:<br><br></p>  Adds issuers and verifiers and assigns the credential templates they’re allowed to issue/verify  Allows verifiers to query the registry and check if issuers are allowed to issue certain types of credentials  <p><br>Overall, trust registries are one of the important ways we are helping our customers solve governance concerns in their verifiable credential ecosystems. The video below is a short demo of Trinsic’s Trust Registry Service.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The importance of interoperability  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Trust registries also need to be interoperable. The <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> has a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-tf">specification</a>&nbsp;for an interoperable trust registry, and ours is the first implementation of this spec. Because of this, Trinsic’s Trust Registry Service is architected so that one ecosystem could reference or incorporate a trust registry from a separate ecosystem if needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, imagine you are a software vendor whose verifiable credential product is used by all the major universities in the U.S.. Since your product is powered by Trinsic, you have your own trust registry for your ecosystem. However, let’s say the U.S. university accreditation body all of a sudden decided they wanted to adopt the Trust Over IP Framework and create their own trust registry. Since Trinsic’s Trust Registry Service is based on the interoperable trust registry specification, you could seamlessly incorporate their trust registry into yours. Additionally, other software vendors that work with universities and related organizations may want to incorporate your trust registry. They could easily do so as well.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The future of trust registries 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>We are still in the early days of verifiable credential adoption, so we know that the role of trust registries will only expand as the number of verifiable credential ecosystems grow and the need for cross-ecosystem interoperability is necessary. Despite the ever-involving best practices around governance in verifiable credential ecosystems, you can rest assured that Trinsic’s SDK will include the necessary tools like trust registries, so you can spend less time thinking about how to implement governance and more time building your identity solution.

<p>Fake social accounts negatively impact users’ trust in social media platforms. Many times, users are forced to ignore or reject genuine connections because of the inherent inability to verify a connection’s personal data. Further, this has dented the trust in social media platforms. Predatory behavior, scams, fake news, and more problems are the result of such fake social accounts, so it’s a pressing problem that each of us can relate&nbsp;to.</p><p>So, how do we address this problem of fake social accounts? Is it possible to create a social platform with only genuine&nbsp;users?</p><p>At LemmaTree, we asked these questions to our interns — brilliant minds who were welcomed under our inaugural Internship Program.</p><p>This ideathon was specially designed as an exciting challenge for the Singapore interns and centered around trusted data. Here are some of the incredible solutions that the five teams came up&nbsp;with.</p><p>Group #1: Team&nbsp;Podium</p><p>Team Podium divided the problem into three distinct processes, namely, account creation, account maintenance, and user behavior, and produced a solution for each. They also crafted a module to eliminate fake news and false information on the news feed. The team understood the potential limitations of their proposed solutions and presented ways to address them, making their solution a well-thought-out one that spanned across different aspects of prominent social media platforms.</p><p>Team #2:&nbsp;Ups</p><p>The team had a noble idea of addressing predatory behavior commonly seen on social media which not only reduces the trust among users, but could cause permanent trauma to&nbsp;minors.</p><p>To address this behavior and to enhance the trust and safety of other users, the Ups Team proposed a VC-based solution to verify personal information and an API that should effectively filter inappropriate messages sent on social media. Both solutions would combine to enhance social networks to penalize users with malicious intent and safeguard users from predators, resulting in the strengthening of trusted connections on such platforms.</p><p>Team #3:&nbsp;Reliabae</p><p>As the name perfectly reflects it, Reliabae is the solution by the team that seeks to address the trust and reliability issues in online dating applications, returning reliability of the applications to users looking for genuine connections. Reliable is a VC-based dating app that eliminates fake accounts and identities using a two-pronged approach — incorporating APIs to fetch verified data and the use of deep neural networks for image recognition.</p><p>Team #4: Super&nbsp;Identity</p><p>Also looking to solve the challenge of fake accounts on dating applications is Team #4. And they’re doing it through their super solution, Super Identity. It is a Single Sign-On (SSO) application that provides an easy and secure way for users to verify their identity on social media. One of the key highlights of Super Identity is that it is scalable and can be used on other social media platforms beyond the dating&nbsp;scene.</p><p>Team #5:&nbsp;Protego</p><p>Team #5’s Protego is a community-based social media application, which requires users to verify their identity to access the full set of features on the platform, and helped to eliminate fake news using an NLP model. Users can request for Verifiable Credentials from trusted organizations like schools and institutions. The solution proposed by the team also had an elaborate timeline which showcased the thoroughness of the team in ensuring this solution’s success from&nbsp;launch.</p><p>All five solutions were well presented to the judge — Duy Dang, the Head of Engineering of Trustana, one of the entities under LemmaTree. Duy gave great advice and comments to the teams based on the judging criteria provided:</p>  Creativity and usability of the solution.  Does the solution leverage the concept of trusted&nbsp;data?  Were Lemmatree employees’ opinions incorporated into the solution?  Quality of presentation  Bonus: Practicality of the&nbsp;Solution  <p>In all, these solutions provide a glimpse into the power of trusted data and the limitless possibilities of what you can do with trusted data. We would like to thank all participants of the ideathon and we’re excited to see some of these solutions getting launched in the near&nbsp;future!</p><p>If you’d like to talk about specific use -cases or learn more about creating and using trusted data, reach out to&nbsp;us.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/interns-ideathon-solutions-to-build-trusted-social-connections-501b2404b6c7">Interns’ Ideathon: Solutions to Build Trusted Social Connections</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2022/06/192510-digital-identity-platform-unstoppable-domains-city-of-miami-providing-web3-education/">City of Miami Providing Web3 Education</a><br>Miami recently hosted “Miami for Everyone,” a three-day event on Web3 hosted by Miami Dade College. Unstoppable Domains, an NFT domain provider, partnered with the city of Miami to put on the event, with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez commenting that the goal was to&nbsp; “make Miami the ‘capital of capital’ with an economy that focuses on innovation, technology, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.” The event was focused on NFTs, with attendees being “taught how NFT domains can act as their digital identity, unlocking exciting opportunities across Web3,” said Sandy Carter, SVP and head of business development at Unstoppable Domains.</p>
<p>While many&nbsp; similar events offer workshops for people of different skill levels, Miami for Everyone took it a step further by including all ages and providing Spanish language versions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202206/economic-identity-are-digital-id-schemes-a-road-to-hell-asks-human-rights-report">‘Economic identity’: are digital ID schemes a ‘road to Hell?’ asks human rights report</a><br>Biometric Update draws our attention to a new report by the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, which comes in the wake of ID4Africa and raises concerns about some of the current trends in digital identity. Notably, rather than recognizing individuals’ rights via legal ID, digital ID campaigns “focus on fueling digital transactions and transforming individuals into traceable data.” Delegates to the conference, held this year in Marrakech, said that digital ID providers often “ignore the ability of identification systems to recognize not only that an individual is unique, but that they have a legal status with associated rights.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/dcms-publishes-beta-of-digital-identities-and-trust-framework/">DCMS publishes digital identities and trust beta framework </a></p>
<p>UK Authority, a publication that covers public sector use of digital data and technology in the United Kingdom, looks at some recent updates to the 2021 digital identities and trust framework by the UK government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS).</p>
<p>As described by the report from the UK DCMS, “The trust framework aims to make it easier and more secure for people to use services that enable them to prove who they are or information about themselves. It is a set of rules for organizations to follow if they want to provide secure and trustworthy digital identity and/or attribute solutions.”</p>
<p>Feedback from over 250 organizations has lead to some key changes from the alpha version released in 2021, include the addition of sub-roles for the three broad type roles that providers could play – identity, attribute and orchestration services to address concerns by service providers that they did not fit in the original three categories, as well as including a requirement that biometric technologies be held to an industry standard.</p>
<p>The UK authority added that policy development lead official for the program, George Muskat, was interviewed at the Think Digital Identity for Government conference, commenting that there are four areas they are focusing on for further policy development, the user agreement, ensuring that certifiers meet key principles, assessing risk from non-certified providers, and fraud management.</p>
<p>The original report is detailed and thoughtful and can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version#introduction">here&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>What is the future of biometrics, and are there opportunities for my business to become more secure through biometric authentication? Keep reading to find out.</p>
<p>What is the future of biometrics?</p>
<p>The future of biometrics will be adding facial, voice, or other types of biometric authentication to security for accessing sensitive data at work, applying for a bank loan, or using money management systems.</p>
 
 What Are Biometrics? 
<p>Biometric authentication is the use of physical characteristics to verify a user’s identity for authentication and authorization. Biometric authentication systems collect and store different physical characteristics in templates that can be used to verify users.</p>
<p>Biometrics are a rapidly expanding and reliable form of authentication because physical characteristics are, for the most part, much more difficult to falsify than passwords or PINs. Additionally, the ubiquitous implementation of biometric scanners on popular consumer devices (smartphones, tablets, and workstations) has made that much easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easy deployment, ready adoption, and increased security have made biometrics a major part of modern cybersecurity. Additionally, this increased focus on biometrics has resulted in continued innovation in several different areas of biometrics. New types of scanners, new software, and new AI have promoted various types of biometrics, including the following:</p>
 
 Fingerprints: Fingerprint scanners are common on workstations and mobile devices because fingerprints are unique. Likewise, modern computers and laptops often employ fingerprints as a baseline identity verification mechanism if not using other biometrics.&nbsp; 
 Iris Signature: The human iris features are considered equally unique, if not more than to fingerprints. Modern cameras on mobile devices can scan the iris for identity verification.&nbsp; 
 Facial Recognition: Much like iris scans, facial recognition scans use cameras on mobile devices or computers to match facial features (nose, eyes, ears, mouth, etc.) as a biometric fingerprint for identity verification.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In terms of security, facial and iris scans are somewhat more secure overall than fingerprints, if for no other reason than it’s much harder to fake a face (in theory at least—see our discussion on the challenges of biometrics later in this article).&nbsp;</p>
 
 Voice Recognition: <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-voice-authentication/">Voice recognition</a> has often been marginalized due to the relative ease by which a hacker could spoof a voice through a voice modulator. Modern AI, however, has strengthened voice recognition such that it has become a viable form of biometric authentication for select sensitive systems.&nbsp; 
 Handwriting Recognition: With the addition of document verification systems into security and privacy, handwriting recognition is an essential form of behavioral biometrics. While handwriting can often be faked by practiced forgers, matching handwriting on file against official documents is still a viable security measure in human-managed document verification.<br>
 
 Vascular Recognition: Some innovative sensors can record and identify vein patterns from different body parts using IR light. This form of biometrics overlaps with iris scans in that they both look for vein patterns as part of their operation.&nbsp; 
 
 
 What Are Future Trends in Biometrics? 
<p>While biometric authentication methods are becoming more common across consumer and enterprise systems, new forms of fraud prevention and advanced biometric approaches are filling in the gap for systems that call for higher levels of reliability and security.</p>
<p>Some of the future trends for <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-biometric-authentication/">biometric authentication</a> include the following:</p>
 
 Physical Identity Verification: The expansion of AI-driven biometrics, particularly facial and behavioral biometrics (gait, voice, and accent recognition), will fuel new forms of real-time <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-biometric-id/">biometric identity</a> verification through on-premises cameras.&nbsp; 
 Advanced Biometric Authentication: While there are reliable forms of biometrics and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/biometric-authentication/biometric-password">biometric passwords</a> in the market now, new technologies are focusing on drawing even more advanced biometric markers from the body, each providing another hard-to-fake marker to use for secure authentication. These can include odor recognition, heartbeat pattern recognition, hand geometry, and DNA signature reading. 
 Identity Proofing: One of the strengths of biometric authentication is the assumption that the user must be physically present to provide biometric data. Even stronger measures, like live identity verification or AI-driven video identity verification, layer additional “liveness” testing into the processes to thwart emerging forms of identity fraud.<br>
 
 Continuous Authentication: Authentication usually happens once, during login, or multiple times based on user access to different resources. Continuous authentication uses behavioral patterns or other markers to maintain authentication to guarantee continued user verification over time periodically.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These trends aren’t emerging in isolation: advanced biometrics drive innovation on continuous authentication, while identity proofing is fueling more advanced physical identity verification in areas like high-security compliance standards.&nbsp;</p>
 
 What Are the Challenges of Modern Biometrics? 
<p>While the future of biometric authentication looks bright, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t any speed bumps. Modern security methods will always introduce new threats, new problems, and new ideas to challenge new systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the common threats that we see arising include the following:</p>
 
 Physical Spoofing: One of the bigger challenges for image-based biometrics (facial scans, etc.) is using artificial methods to fool these systems. For example, a hacker may attempt to use the photograph of a user in place of that actual user to cheat the authentication system.<br>
While AI is playing a significant role in mitigating these challenges, physical spoofing of biometrics like faces, fingerprints, and even iris patterns have been proven, in controlled situations, to bypass even high-level biometric authentication systems.&nbsp; 
 Deepfakes: Modern AI is also fueling attack vectors like deepfakes. A deepfake is a faked video of an individual or event that has been modified to look shockingly real, particularly to the human eye. Deepfake videos combine advanced video-editing techniques and voice spoofing to create nearly real videos showing a famous figure saying something shocking or illegal. 
 
<p>The social impact of these deepfakes are apparent. However, the technical and security impact is also a huge problem. Deepfaked videos can be used to trick facial recognition tools or even video-driven identity proofing and liveness checks.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Civil and Legal Accountability: Modern biometrics can present a significant ethical issue depending on the information they gather. For example, a user may feel unease working with a system that constantly monitors typing patterns or their facial features for continuous authentication purposes.&nbsp; 
 
<p>New laws are coming into focus, at international, national, and local levels, to address these issues. Like the European Union, some jurisdictions are quickly moving to implement consumer-focused laws to protect end users from unlawful and unethical data-gathering processes. Many states in the Unitd States (like California) are moving quickly to follow the lead of the EU.</p>

Stablecoin regulations are expected to be introduced as early as&nbsp;August.</p><p>The stablecoin regulatory framework could have come even earlier, but recent changes in the government, including the resignations of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, may have set back the planned schedule. Deputy BoE Governor Jon Cunliffe also confirmed the same at Qatar Centre for Global Banking and Finance’s annual conference, where he said that the plans on stablecoin regulations were delayed due to “recent&nbsp;events.”</p> Earlier Consultation on Stablecoin Regulations <p>The talks around stablecoin regulations began in the UK government circles in April 2022, with a consultation taking place in the same month. During the consultation, the Treasury said that the government is contemplating regulating stablecoins as a means of payment under the 2017 Payment Service Regulations, the 2011 Electronic Money Regulations Act, and Financial Services&nbsp;Act.</p> Global Standard on Stablecoin Payment is&nbsp;Next? <p>While speaking at Qatar Centre for Global Banking and Finance’s annual conference, BoE Governor Jon Cunliffe also said that the international panel known as Payments and Markets Infrastructure Committee, which he heads, will begin working on a global standard for stablecoin payments in the next few&nbsp;months.</p><p>The key topics that the panel will discuss include which asset types will be allowed for backing stablecoins, their redemption process, and the mechanism to test the safety and stability of stablecoins.</p><p>The current crypto market downturn, which saw the global digital assets market cap drop below one trillion dollars from three trillion dollars, has led to a worldwide consensus that digital assets could no longer be allowed to operate without regulatory oversight. Thus, we are seeing news about various countries regulating crypto-assets one after the other. This makes one thing clear. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must prepare to comply with a plethora of regulations at the country and global&nbsp;levels.</p><p>And when it comes to international crypto regulations, the FATF’s Travel Rule comes at the top, as it is already in implementation in 11 countries, with many more in the line to implement it. So, VASPs must start preparing to comply with the Travel Rule even if the country they are based in hasn’t implemented it yet. After all, with the FATF urging countries to speed up Travel Rule adoption, the day is not far when all nations will be on the same page in enforcing this global crypto-focused law.</p><p>The first thing that VASPs will require to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution Provider (TRSP). And we have the best solution available in the market — Veriscope! It is also the only solution to the much-dreaded “Sunrise Issue” that VASPs encounter while implementing the Travel Rule.

             July 2022   
	 
		 
			 A Special Trip for a Special Team 
<p>Happy July! We are already halfway through the year, and I hope that you’ve been able to begin planning (or begin enjoying) your summer holidays.</p>
<p>This newsletter is a bit different and a bit more special than previous ones, as I want to tell you about&nbsp;Tokeny’s recent team building event that happened earlier this month in Barcelona.</p>
<p>As you know, the Tokeny team hails from around the world working in various countries remotely. We have colleagues from 16 nationalities and counting, with different experiences, cultures, and personalities that help make Tokeny the unique company that it is. Although we function very well remotely, it is important that we take the time to meet up in person to share, learn, and enjoy our time as a collective unit.</p>
 Why teambuilding is so important 
<p>Team building is crucial in any company, as it creates a moment where colleagues can&nbsp;shift their focus from their daily work objectives to a collective focus on the team itself. These activities bolster our motivation and provide opportunities that allow us to reconfirm our objectives and professional goals as members of Tokeny. And, of course, it gives us time to take part in fun activities both during and after the workday.</p>
<p>These activities are even more important for remote companies, as it is rare to have interpersonal interactions in this setup. Team building for remote teams, especially in a beautiful city like Barcelona, creates excitement and a more relaxed environment where we can express ourselves and communicate in a more enjoyable way. I strongly believe that remote work has boosted our productivity, but let’s face it: Brainstorms and chit-chats are extremely hard and boring via video calls.</p>
 An intensive program that united our team forever 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Throughout the three days, we took part in many activities which gave us better insight into our company goals – both long and short term – and a chance to form stronger bonds with each other.</p>
<p>When we arrived Sunday evening, it was immediately clear how excited we were to be a part of this trip. For many of us, it was the first time we saw not just new people from the company, but many people within Tokeny’s team.</p>
<p>Some of our activities on Monday and Tuesday brought us together to further strengthen our company vision and objectives. They included our monthly “CEO Talk”, a Ted Talk-style presentation called&nbsp;“Tedkeny”, and collaborative team building exercises.</p>
<p>We also wanted to create lasting memories together for each of us as a collective group. We all went on a catamaran in the early evening and sang karaoke at night which let us all bond with one another and discover some hidden skills.</p>
<p>As we gave our goodbyes Tuesday afternoon, we realized how splendid the team building trip was. Even though we all go back to our homes in different parts of the world, we each felt a bit closer together in our relationships and Tokeny’s vision for the future as we departed.</p>
 Final Thoughts 
<p>The excitement we had in seeing each other was truly remarkable. As our company grows in stature, so do we grow in numbers.&nbsp;Since January, our team has almost doubled in size. We could all feel the communal sense that we know our company and products are very unique, and as we continue to push forward, we will achieve our goals and overcome any obstacles in our way.</p>
<p>I would like to give a very warm thank you to the whole team for being part of our journey and showing everyday that we can push finance and blockchain further. Also, a special thank you to Ivie Satijn and Radka Tocikova for their incredible work in preparing this event. Finally, thank you to our Customers and Partners for the trust you put in our team.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity and payment provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=Nuggets">Nuggets</a> is piloting its Verified Self-Sovereign Digital ID solution with the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/global-assured-identity-network-gain">Global Assured Identity Network</a> (GAIN), a grouping of 150 financial institutions striving for globally interoperable digital identity mechanism for individuals and businesses. Nuggets’ approach requires both parties in every transaction to be verified via open standards, and has an eye to the metaverse.</p><p>Nuggets’ Verified Self-Sovereign Digital ID uses open standards such as W3C verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), zero-knowledge proofs and the encrypted communication standards of&nbsp;<a href="https://didcomm.org/">DIDComm</a>.</p><p>Both the originator and recipient of a transaction made within the GAIN pilot, whether for money or digital assets, would be required to be verified for the transaction.</p><p>During the transaction, the user’s identity is established through the creation of a unique Peer Decentralized Identifier (PeerDID). The verifiable credentials involved support selective disclosure. The transaction also uses zero-knowledge proofs. This means information supplied can remain anonymous while the users can also prove who they say they are without giving away any of their personally identifiable information.</p><p>As the use of DIDs as a digital identity standard becomes more widespread, Nuggets hopes its SSI service will be interoperable with solutions and could be used to combat ID fraud risks in the metaverse.</p><p>“For too long now business has relied on usernames, passwords and devices as the gateway of confidence to ensure authentication, leading to fraud and misuse,” comments Alastair Johnson, <a href="https://nuggets.life/founders.html">founder</a> and CEO of&nbsp;Nuggets.</p><p>“Securely engaging in the digital economy requires a user-owned and controlled ID solution that cryptographically proves everything from access to services to trusted transactions. It needs to be reusable, verifiable, portable, private and secure. It’s an important recognition that GAIN has ensured that self-sovereign identity will be a part of this moving forward.”</p><p>GAIN is currently undergoing consultation on its <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202111/gain-readies-for-december-launch-of-poc-group-for-digital-identity-interoperability">development and role</a> as financial institutions continue to&nbsp;join.</p><p>“GAIN and Nuggets share a duty to protect users from financial crime and uphold the law.

  <p>In this tutorial, you’ll use JHipster to build a microservice stack and deploy it to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The microservices will use Java and Spring Boot for resource servers and Vue for the frontend. The server-side applications will use Spring’s Reactive technology stack. The microservice will include multiple databases and database types: PostgresSQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. You’ll secure the service using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC), with Okta as the OIDC provider. With Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code>, you’ll encrypt all of the secrets in the project configuration files. To generate the project, you’ll use JHipster CLI and the JHipster Domain Language (JDL).</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>Before you get started, install the required software listed below. You’ll need to sign up for an Amazon Web Services account and a free Okta account (which you will be able to sign up for later using the Okta CLI). The Kubernetes cluster required to finish this tutorial does not qualify for free tier on AWS. However, if you are careful about stopping and deleting the cluster when not actively working on the tutorial, the cost should be very small, only a few dollars.</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a>: you’ll need to have Docker Engine installed. 
   <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>: you’ll need a Docker Hub account to host the Docker images so that EKS can pull them. 
   <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11</a>: this tutorial requires Java 11. If you need to manage multiple Java versions, SDKMAN! is a good solution. Check out <a href="https://sdkman.io/install">their docs to install it</a>. 
   <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/">JHipster CLI</a>: you’ll use the JHipster CLI to bootstrap the application. To install with <code>npm</code> just use <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster</code> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI</a>: you’ll use Okta to add security to the microservice network. You can register for a free account from the CLI. 
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">Amazon Web Services</a>: sign up for an AWS account. 
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a>: Amazon Web Service CLI 
   <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl">eksctl</a>: you’ll use <code>eksctl</code> to create your cluster on EKS 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a>: CLI to manage Kubernetes clusters. As of the time I was writing this tutorial, there was a bug in <code>kubectl</code> version 1.24 that results in an “invalid apiVersion” error. You can avoid this error by installing version 1.23.6. 
 

<p>For more info on the <code>kubectl</code> error, see <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/6920">this issue</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>The error looks like this:</p>

 <code>2022-05-31 18:56:08 [✖]  parsing kubectl version string  (upstream error: error: exec plugin: invalid apiVersion "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
) / "0.0.0": Version string empty
</code> 

<p>On Linux, to install version 1.23.6, you can use the following commands.</p>

   <code>curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.23.6/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
</code>   

<p>For Windows and Mac, there are instructions on how to install specific versions on the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubernetes docs pages</a>.</p>

<p>Just so you have a general idea of what you’re going to do, the basic steps in this tutorial are:</p>

 
   Generate the microservice applications and Kubernetes descriptor files using JHipster 
   Build the apps and push the Docker images to Docker Hub 
   Configure the services to use Okta for OIDC authentication 
   Create an Amazon EKS cluster 
   Deploy the microservice stack to EKS (which will pull your Docker images and deploy them to AWS EKS) 
   Test the app 
 

 Generate the application using the JHipster generator 

<p>The JHipster generator makes it easy to bootstrap complex applications, including microservices with multiple services and domain models. You can read more about it in <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-app/">the JHipster docs</a>. In this tutorial, you are going to create a microservice using the JHipster Domain Language.</p>

<p>This will generate a microservice with four services:</p>

 
   JHipster registry 
   JHipster API gateway 
   Store 
   Blog 
 

<p>When you look at the DSL below, you might notice that there isn’t a registry application listed. The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster registry</a> is a standard application in the JHipster microservice stack that doesn’t need to be defined. It includes a Eureka server and a Spring Cloud Config server. The Eureka server is a <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/reference/html/">Spring Cloud Netflix</a> service discovery registry that allows services to find each other on the network. The <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/">Spring Cloud Config</a> server allows the centralization of service configuration. You’ll use it to centralize the Okta OAuth 2.0 and OIDC configuration, among other things, allowing you to configure all of the services to use the same OIDC application from the same configuration point.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/api-gateway/">JHipster API gateway</a> is the front-facing, public face of the application. It has a Vue front-end and a PostgresSQL database backend. The gateway also includes features like load balancing and circuit breaking. Public requests to the service go through the gateway.</p>

<p>The store and blog applications are backend resource servers with MongoDB and Neo4j databases (respectively).</p>

<p>Create a file called <code>app.jdl</code> in the root directory for the project. Paste the contents below into the file. You need to add your docker repository name at the bottom in place of the placeholder <code>{your-docker-repository-name}</code>.</p>

   <code>application {
  config {
    baseName gateway
    reactive true
    packageName com.okta.developer.gateway
    applicationType gateway
    authenticationType oauth2
    buildTool gradle

    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
  }
  entities Product
}

entity Blog {
  name String required minlength(3)
  handle String required minlength(2)
}

entity Post {
  title String required
  content TextBlob required
  date Instant required
}

entity Tag {
  name String required minlength(2)
}

entity Product {
  title String required
  price BigDecimal required min(0)
  image ImageBlob
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  Blog{user(login)} to User
  Post{blog(name)} to Blog
}

relationship ManyToMany {
  Post{tag(name)} to Tag{post}
}

paginate Post, Tag with infinite-scroll
paginate Product with pagination

microservice Product with store
microservice Blog, Post, Tag with blog

deployment {
  deploymentType kubernetes
  appsFolders [gateway, blog, store]
  dockerRepositoryName "{your-docker-repository-name}"
  kubernetesNamespace demo
  serviceDiscoveryType eureka
  kubernetesServiceType LoadBalancer
}
</code>   

<p>From the root project directory, run the generator.</p>

   <code>jhipster jdl app.jdl
</code>   

<p>This will probably take a minute or so to complete.</p>

<p>It should end with something like the following output.</p>

 <code>...

INFO! Alternatively, you can use Jib to build and push image directly to a remote registry:
  ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/gateway in /home/andrewcarterhughes/Development/okta/2022/aws-kubernetes/gateway
  ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/blog in /home/andrewcarterhughes/Development/okta/2022/aws-kubernetes/blog
  ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/store in /home/andrewcarterhughes/Development/okta/2022/aws-kubernetes/store

You can deploy all your apps by running the following kubectl command:
  bash kubectl-apply.sh -f

[OR]

If you want to use kustomize configuration, then run the following command:
  bash kubectl-apply.sh -k

Use these commands to find your application's IP addresses:
  kubectl get svc gateway -n demo

INFO! Generator kubernetes succeed
Congratulations, JHipster execution is complete!

</code> 

<p>If you look at the directories in your root project, you’ll see four subdirectories.</p>

   <code>├── blog
├── gateway
├── kubernetes
└── store
</code>   

<p>Three of the directories are the application projects for your services: blog, store, and gateway. Remember that the registry uses a stock image, so it doesn’t need a local project. The fourth directory, kubernetes, holds the descriptor files for the kubernetes deployments (YAML files that tell Kubernetes how to deploy your applications from the Docker images).</p>

<p>If you looked in that directory, you’d see four subdirectories (as well as some other files).</p>

   <code>├── blog-k8s
├── gateway-k8s
├── registry-k8s
└── store-k8s
</code>   

<p>These four directories hold the deployment descriptors for the Kubernetes services that correspond to the four applications in the microservice.</p>

 Update MongoDB headless service configuration 

<p>You also need to update the Kubernetes deployment definition for the store’s headless MongoDB service. This fixes a problem with the store not being able to find the database. This entry is at the bottom of the file.</p>

<p><code>kubernetes/store-k8s/store-mongodb.yml</code></p>

   <code># Headless service for DNS record
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
...
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  clusterIP: None
  publishNotReadyAddresses: true  # &lt;- ADD ME
  ...
</code>   

 Use Jib to build the Docker images and push to your Docker Hub registry 

<p>Kubernetes on AWS needs to be able to access your Docker images. The easiest way to do this is to push them to your Docker Hub account (which you should have already signed up for, if you didn’t already have one).</p>

<p>Gradle and <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-gradle-plugin">Jib</a> make this super easy. In fact, you have the commands you need in your console output. You can copy and paste them from there and run them in the correct directories. You cannot copy and paste the commands from my terminal listing above without replacing the docker repository name.</p>

<p>Make sure you are logged into Docker.</p>

   <code>docker login
</code>   

<p>The commands to build the Docker images and push them to Docker Hub are the following. You must replace <code>{your-docker-repository-name}</code> with your actual docker repository name and run these commands in the correct project subdirectories.</p>

   <code># in ./gateway
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/gateway
# in ./blog
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/blog
# in ./store
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/store
</code>   

<p>You’re only building the blog, store, and gateway, not the registry. This is because the registry using a stock image and you don’t have to build it.</p>

 Configure OAuth Security with Okta 

<p>Before you start, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>. Run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.</p>

<p>Then, from the root project directory, open a Bash shell and run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>.</p>

<p>The default app name is fine. Or change it. Also accept the default redirect URIs.</p>

<p>My output looked like this:</p>

   <code>Application name [kubernetes]: 
Redirect URI
Common defaults:
 Spring Security - http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta
 JHipster - http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc
 Quarkus OIDC - http://localhost:8080/callback
Enter your Redirect URI(s) [http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc, http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc]: 
Enter your Post Logout Redirect URI(s) [http://localhost:8080/, http://localhost:8761/]: 
Configuring a new OIDC Application, almost done:
Created OIDC application, client-id: 0oa7pu3434DasvWSo4x7
Creating Authorization Server claim 'groups':
Adding user 'andrew.hughes@mail.com' to groups: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN]
Existing group 'ROLE_USER' found
Existing group 'ROLE_ADMIN' found
|
Okta application configuration has been written to: /home/andrewcarterhughes/Development/okta/2022/aws-kubernetes/QA1/kubernetes/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>This command creates an OIDC application on the Okta servers for you. It also creates a <code>groups</code> claim on your authorization server and adds to groups: <code>ROLE_USER</code> and <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code>. The group names have <code>ROLE_</code> prefixed to them because of the way Spring Boot processes group names. You need these default groups for authentication to work.</p>

<p>Remember the name of the OIDC application. You’ll need to find it in the Okta Admin Console later. The <code>okta apps</code> command creates a config file named <code>.okta.env</code>. This should look something like the following.</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="0oa7pu3434DasvWSo4x7"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="09328uu098u4..."
</code>   

<p>The microservices use Spring Cloud Config to centralize configuration (this service is part of the JHipster registry). This means that you can configure the entire microservice to use Okta as an OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider in a single place.</p>

<p>Open <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>. Add the following at the end of the <code>data.application.yml</code> entry (before the <code>jhipster-registry.yml</code> entry), filling in the <code>issuer-uri</code>, <code>client-id</code>, and <code>client-secret</code> taken from the <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>

<p>This is the Spring Cloud Config file that the JHipster registry will serve to the entire microservice network.</p>

<p><code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code></p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
# app specific configuration
jhipster-registry.yml: |-
  ...
</code>   

<p>You also need to configure the registry to use OAuth. In the <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> file, add <code>oauth2</code> to the values under <code>SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE</code> (as shown below).</p>

<p><code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code></p>

   <code>spec:
  containers:
    - name: jhipster-registry
      env:
        - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
          value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

 Create an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes (EKS) cluster 

<p>Now you are going to create the EKS cluster on AWS using the <a href="https://eksctl.io/">eksctl</a> CLI.</p>

<p>You should have the AWS CLI and <code>eksctl</code> installed and configured already. Use the following command to create the Kubernetes cluster for the microservice. After you run the command, go get some coffee or lunch. This command is slooooow.</p>

   <code>eksctl create cluster --name okta-k8s \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --nodegroup-name okta-k8s-nodes \
    --node-type t2.xlarge \
    --nodes 2
</code>   

<p>This will take several minutes to run.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IMPORTANT: This cluster costs money as long as it is running. If you only keep it running for the hour or so you need to run the tutorial, the costs are small. If you forget and leave it running for a month or two, it could cost a lot more. Don’t forget to delete it when you are done!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are using a managed cluster with EC2 nodes. You are not using the newer, Fargate managed clusters because when I tried Fargate I ran into problems. There are reports of a compatibility problem between Fargate and Eureka. See <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jhipster-dev/c/148uESs6vns">this google groups thread</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jussiseppala/eurekafargatesample">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>You can look at <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">the AWS docs on managed node groups</a> for more in-depth information. Basically, though, being managed means that you do not need to separately provision and register the EC2 instances in the node group. The EC2 instances and Kubernetes nodes are packaged together and managed as a unit. Unmanaged node groups allow you to separate the node group management from the EC2 instances, allowing for finer control but also requiring more direct involvement in instance management.</p>

 Troubleshoot problems using AWS CloudFormation 

<p>If you have a problem, you can log into the AWS console and search for the CloudFormation tool. CloudFormation is an AWS service that (according to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html">their docs</a>) “helps you model and set up your AWS resources.” It allows you to create templates for configuring and provisioning resources and can help with dependencies between AWS resources. The <code>eksctl</code> tool uses CloudFormation behind the scenes.</p>

<p>My console ended with this non-specific error.</p>

 <code>2022-06-17 09:32:51 [ℹ]  waiting for CloudFormation stack "eksctl-okta-k8s-nodegroup-okta-k8s-nodes"
2022-06-17 09:32:51 [!]  1 error(s) occurred and cluster hasn't been created properly, you may wish to check CloudFormation console

2022-06-17 09:32:51 [✖]  waiter state transitioned to Failure
Error: failed to create cluster "okta-k8s"
</code> 

<p>When I logged into AWS and opened CloudFormation, I saw this on the console.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The cluster was created successfully, but the node group failed. I clicked on the node group name. Then I selected the events tab. Scrolling down, I found the error.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The error reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Resource handler returned message: “Your requested instance type (t2.xlarge) is not supported in your requested Availability Zone (us-west-2d). Please retry your request by not specifying an Availability Zone or choosing us-west-2a, us-west-2b, us-west-2c. (Service: Eks, Status Code: 400, Request ID: 442805e0-f485-4503-a697-838dfbd690d0, Extended Request ID: null)” (RequestToken: 13e73586-c07b-6a2b-2209-a31bd1bc2560, HandlerErrorCode: InvalidRequest)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I needed to add an additional flag to my command to specify an availability zone. If you look at <a href="https://eksctl.io/usage/creating-and-managing-clusters/">the <code>eksctl</code> docs</a>, there’s a note about this for the <code>us-east-1</code> region. This was the first time I’d run into it in the <code>us-west-1</code> region.</p>

   <code>--zones=us-west-2a,us-west-2b,us-west-2c
</code>   

<p>I deleted the cluster and cleaned up using:</p>

   <code>eksctl delete cluster --region=us-west-2 --name=okta-k8s
</code>   

<p>And tried it again:</p>

   <code>eksctl create cluster --name okta-k8s \
--region us-west-2 \
--zones=us-west-2a,us-west-2b,us-west-2c \
--nodegroup-name okta-k8s-nodes \
--node-type t2.xlarge \
--nodes 2
</code>   

<p>You may have to rename the cluster. I found that sometimes even though the cluster resources have been deleted, the name is still unavailable.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are wondering, if you got this error, why I didn’t include the <code>--zones</code> flag in the original command. Was it just for the teachable moment? Not entirely. I wasn’t sure if the availability in the zones is consistent enough to warrant including the specific zones in the original command.</p>

 Deploy the JHipster Kubernetes microservice to EKS 

<p>Next you’ll use <code>kubectl</code> to deploy the microservice to AWS EKS. Before you do that, if you haven’t already, you should install a tool for monitoring the services. Both <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s">k9s</a> and <a href="https://k8slens.dev/">Kubernetes Lens</a> are great. Installing one of these tools isn’t strictly necessary. You can do everything from the <code>kubectl</code> if you want, but life is short. Live a little. Use a GUI instead of the CLI. Step away from the <code>vim</code> and try an IDE. Nobody will know. You’ll still be cool.</p>

<p>Open a Bash shell and navigate to the <code>kubernetes</code> subdirectory of the project.</p>

<p>Run the following command to update your local Kubernetes configuration with the AWS EKS cluster config.</p>

   <code>aws eks update-kubeconfig --name okta-k8s
</code>   

<p>If you don’t do this, you may see the following error.</p>

   <code>Kubeconfig user entry is using deprecated API version client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1. Run 'aws eks update-kubeconfig' to update.
</code>   

<p>Now you’re ready to deploy the microservice.</p>

<p>Run the following command (again, from the <code>kubernetes</code> subdirectory).</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>To use the CLI to check on the pods, you can use:</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n demo
</code>   

<p>Hopefully everything has a status of <code>running</code>. If not, something is wrong.</p>

   <code>NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

</code>   

<p>In K8s Lens, here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Another useful command is <code>describe</code> (I won’t replicate the output here). This is great for more detailed information for debugging.</p>

   <code>kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt; -n demo
</code>   

<p>You can also tail logs of a specific pod using the following command.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt; --tail=-1 -n demo
</code>   

<p>To access the Eureka registry service, you need to forward the port.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8761. You may have to log in if you aren’t already logged into Okta.</p>

<p>You want to see a lot of green.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If everything is good, <code>control-c</code> to stop forwarding the registry. Forward the gateway and open it.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Open http://localhost:8080</p>

<p>You’ll see the front page of the demo application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go to Account and Sign in.</p>

<p>If you are already logged into Okta, you won’t have to log in again. Otherwise you’ll be redirected to the Okta SSO sign-in page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you’re authenticated, you’ll be directed to the authenticated front page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To verify that the application works, try and create a product and a blog. Go to the Entities menu and click on Product. Click Create a new Product and fill in the form with dummy values. You should be able to successfully create a new product. Do the same thing with Entities and Blog. You should be able to create a blog and a blog post.</p>

<p>Remember that the blog application uses a Neo4j database backend and the store uses a Mongo DB backend. You’re accessing these services through the public gateway application, but this is forwarding the requests to the private services and their associated databases.</p>

 Protect sensitive configuration values using <code>kubeseal</code> 

<p>The microservice is working. The only thing left to do is to protect any sensitive configuration parameters that you don’t want to check into a repository. In this case, the main value that needs to be protected is the Okta OIDC client secret (and the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>, which, as you’ll see in a moment, is used to encrypt the client secret but which itself will need to be encrypted using <code>kubeseal</code>).</p>

<p>In <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, add an environment key-value pair (you can add it anywhere under the same <code>env</code> list that you edited earlier). Make up an encryption key. The longer the better. Generating a UUID is a good solution. Linux has a tool called <code>uuid</code> that can be used.</p>

   <code>- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  value: &lt;your-encryption-key&gt;
</code>   

<p>Redeploy the Kubernetes configuration. If you are still port-forwarding the gateway, <code>control-c</code> to stop it. Run the following from the <code>kubernetes</code> subdirectory.</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>Port forward the registry.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Open http://localhost:8761</p>

<p>Go to Configuration and Encryption</p>

<p>Copy your client secret (from <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code> or from the <code>.okta.env</code> file) and paste it into the text field.</p>

<p>Click Encrypt.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy that value, including the <code>{cipher}</code> part, and paste it back over the old value.</p>

   <code>registration:
  oidc:
    client-id: 0oa7i972cgX989i99u
    client-secret: "{cipher}515aaa9d9bd1b14d2f076e2ba6..."
</code>   

<p>You can redeploy your app (<code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code>) and verify that the encrypted client secret is working (by making sure you can still log in). However, unfortunately, because the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> is sitting there in the configuration files right alongside the encrypted client secret, this isn’t all that secure.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can use <code>kubeseal</code> to secure the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>. Matt Raible explains secrets management in Kubernetes in his post,  <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. He also includes a lot of great resources. Check out his post for more info. You can also take a look at <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">the <code>kubeseal</code> GitHub page</a> for more info. In this post, I’m just going to show you how to get it working.</p>

<p>Install <code>kubeseal</code> in the EKS cluster.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.17.5/controller.yaml
</code>   

<p>Retrieve the certificate keypair that this controller generates.</p>

   <code>kubectl get secret -n kube-system -l sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key -o yaml
</code>   

<p>Copy the raw value of <code>tls.crt</code> and decode it. You can use the command line, or learn more about <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/#base64-encode-the-client-id-and-client-secret">base64 encoding/decoding</a> in our documentation.</p>

   <code>echo -n &lt;paste-value-here&gt; | base64 --decode
</code>   

<p>You should get something like this:</p>

   <code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIEzTCCArWgAwIBAgIRAOTmN5wRwZak1XsbhMqpbBAwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQELBQAw
ADAeFw0yMjA2MTgwMzE1NTZaFw0zMjA2MTUwMzE1NTZaMAAwggIiMA0GCSqGSIb3
DQEBAQUAA4ICDwAwggIKAoICAQDKuios+wTX6cSQRmL7T4ebTQN37vCElL6CFps5
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</code>   

<p>Put this value in a <code>tls.crt</code> file.</p>

<p>Next, install Kubeseal. On macOS, you can use Homebrew. For other platforms, see <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/tag/v0.17.5">the release notes</a>.</p>

   <code>brew install kubeseal
</code>   

<p>Run the following command to encrypt <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>. Replace the placeholder with your actual encryption key value.</p>

   <code>kubectl create secret generic project-secrets \
  --from-literal=ENCRYPT_KEY='&lt;your-encryption-key&gt;' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>Convert the secrets to encrypted secrets.</p>

   <code>kubeseal --cert tls.crt --format=yaml -n demo &lt; secrets.yml &gt; sealed-secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>Delete the unencrypted secrets file.</p>

   <code>rm secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>The <code>sealed-secrets.yml</code> file will look like this:</p>

   <code>apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: project-secrets
  namespace: demo
spec:
  encryptedData:
    ENCRYPT_KEY: AgBElusDb+KI9pHVeqWpzBAMnj4ksNXqXKoHdGTUQRzHi+0mnPxG+jm51QHz/6RoAGVRwVZbVnC+YpsjenbyYjz2q0U1yf+K1p3qYoOg8FlEQZYcbDRR/mQWhSZgIHTj5tRknZMkgGGkTCXGJTY4Dpjw...
  template:
    data: null
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      name: project-secrets
      namespace: demo

</code>   

<p>Deploy the sealed secrets to the cluster.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -n demo -f sealed-secrets.yml &amp;&amp; kubectl get -n demo sealedsecret project-secrets
</code>   

<p>Update the registry configuration to use the encrypted value for the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>. Replace the previous entry for <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>env:
  ...
  - name: ENCRYPT_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: project-secrets
        key: ENCRYPT_KEY
</code>   

<p>Deploy the cluster again.</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>Wait a few moments. Forward the registry again.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Open the registry and make sure you can log in.</p>

<p>If that works, try forwarding the gateway again.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Open http://localhost:8080</p>

<p>Make a product. Or a blog. Everything should still be working.</p>

<p>Once you’re done, delete the EKS cluster. If you don’t do this, you’ll keep getting charged for the AWS resources.</p>

   <code>eksctl delete cluster --region=us-west-2 --name=okta-k8s
</code>   

<p>It wouldn’t hurt to log into the console and make sure all of the resources were cleaned up.</p>

 AWS, Kubernetes, and Spring Boot Microservice is done! 

<p>In this project you deployed a JHipster microservice to AWS EKS. You used the AWS CLI to create the Kubernetes resources, and you used <code>kubectl</code> to deploy the applications to the Kubernetes pods. You also used Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider to secure the microservice. Finally, you properly encrypted all of the sensitive configuration values using a combination of JHipster registry encryption, Kubernetes secrets, and <code>kubeseal</code>.</p>

<p>This project is based on two of Matt Raible’s tutorials, which were helpful for me when I was writing it.</p>

<p>Vinay Gupta, CEO of Mattereum and Ethereum launch co-ordinator in 2015 looks at what needs to be done to truly embed the blockchain into the&nbsp;future</p><p>During a<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa"> Perez Cycle</a> there is one very predictable way to make money: be the exchange. This is one form of the old saw about “during a gold rush, sell shovels.”</p><p>In the recent loops,&nbsp;that’s:</p>  Coinbase in its Bitcoin, altcoins, Ethereum, and ICOs&nbsp;phases  Uniswap (and all the rest) during the Defi&nbsp;phase  OpenSea during the NFT&nbsp;phase  <p>OpenSea got 2.5% of everything. Pushing $400,000,000 a month in fees at one&nbsp;point.</p><p>That’s no joke. That’s real money. But it’s essentially a toll road, and if the cars go somewhere else you don’t get a cut. Coinbase is doing NFTs but it’s going to have a hard time catching OpenSea. Maybe this deal with Mastercard will&nbsp;help.</p><p>But, really, this is just a tax on bubbles. You want to get into the bubble, you pay the gatekeepers. It’s generating real wealth by skimming a little on other people’s speculative activities. In a casino, this is called the vig. In roulette, it’s the green “00” where the house wins and takes all the money on the&nbsp;table.</p><p>In crypto it’s the commissions going to the people selling access to the speculative market. This is not a bad business to be in for the winners. It’s real&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>But it’s not actually wealth generating.</p><p>So how does crypto actually generate&nbsp;wealth?</p><p>Here’s the first argument: crypto is monetary policy as a service. Crypto makes money by literally making money. Bitcoin miners pull the stuff out of thin air, with enormous energy costs, and sell it. Money is a product. Now this argument was always solid, but the counter-argument was “but Bitcoin is worse money than the US&nbsp;dollar.”</p><p>And here we get into a&nbsp;thicket.</p><p>Bitcoin was a worse, more expensive, more volatile version of the US dollar for a long time. But the price, on average, kept going up. Bitcoiners would talk about scarce supply and historical inevitability, and the good and right-thinking people of the world would roll their eyes and say “but it isn’t really money” and move on, while the bitcoiners continued to be wrong and get&nbsp;rich.</p><p>The thing that kept the Bond Villains in the loop on bitcoin was the underlying fear that the US dollar was inevitably going to start inflating eventually. The 2008 bust had left the economy in a fickle, precarious position and the vultures knew it was only a matter of&nbsp;time.</p>Source <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart">https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart</a><p>Well, that time is now. 12% inflation is one hell of a thing. It was a global crisis that last time inflation was that high. It’s a global crisis&nbsp;now.</p><p>And the bitcoiners are clearly and visibly right about Bitcoin being “monetary policy as a service” while, at the same time, losing money hand-over-fist right now as the current <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa">Perez Cycle</a> bubble they are in bursts (again… for like the 5th time). They were making money when they were wrong. Now they’re losing money when they are&nbsp;right.</p><p>There’s no justice. But there is inflation.</p><p>For our younger readers: inflation means there’s too much money chasing not enough stuff. The price of the stuff starts to rise, and year-on-year everything gets more expensive. If wages rise at the same price as stuff, the people who lose are people with money in the bank. If wages don’t rise at the same price as stuff, the working class gets poorer and poorer, and the landlords get all the money. This was last a thing in the 1970s, and it led to the 1980s. What a disaster. And as for keeping wages rising through an inflationary period, who’s in a union these&nbsp;days?</p><p>So “monetary policy as a service” in bitcoin means this: by restricting the supply of money to below the availability of goods and services, the amount of goods and services a given amount of money can buy will keep going up. This is known as “deflation” — prices go down every year instead of up. Well, sure enough, with 12% inflation and worse on the way probably (stagflation! secular stagnation! contagion!) for the dollar economy, the bitcoin (and soon, Ethereum) “hard money claim” begins to look pretty good. There’s no doubt it’s a plausible model of the future: in-between the massive Perez cycle crashes, there is a massive on-going infrastructure built out and fundamental economic wealth creation from making and selling hard money during an age when all the governments will sell you is increasingly-soft money.</p><p>Back when the market cap of Bitcoin was around $500m USD people used to say to me “why is Bitcoin worth anything at all?” and I’d say “given the state of the world, does a $500m hedge against the dollar going horribly wrong seem unreasonable to you?” and usually they’d go “Ah. Hm. Alright then, sure.” It made a difference to their understanding of the situation.</p><p>So the argument here is that, even though Bitcoiners are losing money on the current Perez Cycle, they’re also right about inflation. Selling wealth preservation as a service is inherently profitable (if you’re any good at it) — just ask any professional wealth&nbsp;manager.</p><p>The long term trajectory here is WAGMI: Satoshi’s analysis of the inability of governments to control inflation in the long run was accurate, and the apocalypse that they predicted is&nbsp;here.</p><p>But Bitcoin prices are still going down because the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent, as they say in finance. It’s a hard&nbsp;life.</p><p>So that’s one half of “during a gold rush, sell shovels.” Bitcoin is the selling the gold part. I won’t say that’s going well, but it’s going as expected. There are huge issues, as always with bitcoin, but the nation state’s money isn’t all roses either: defense spending vs. bitcoin mining, you know? It is the same sort of spending: protecting value.</p><p>Here’s the other&nbsp;half.</p><p>Protecting wealth from inflation is only one kind of protection we&nbsp;need.</p><p>The other kind of protection we need is environmental protection.</p><p>Now here you say “but Bitcoin has horrible environmental externalities” and I’m not saying you’re wrong. It does. There is a paradox here, at no mistake, and we all have to live with it regardless of what position we take relative to Bitcoin. I’m very pro Proof of Stake systems including Avalanche and whatever we’re calling ETH2 these days, and have been for&nbsp;years.</p><p>Environmental protection is a big deal. The existing economic architecture of the world makes it essentially impossible to protect nature. I could go on for some time about how the key function of colonialism is to convince rich people that it isn’t unceasing violence that maintains their wealth but, at the end of the day, you either know how this world works or you don’t. I used to get into trouble for saying “what is the point of Free Software running on hardware manufactured by slaves” at open source conferences. You know&nbsp;me.</p><p>A system of sound money, no matter how outlandish or mainstream, is not going to save us alone. There is nothing about bitcoin that will stop us destroying ourselves with CO2 emissions, indeed many would argue (and I’m among them) that Bitcoin has done immense damage in this&nbsp;way.</p><p>We need a comprehensive overhaul of how things are done while the global system is in shock: there is a window of opportunity to start a reorganisation of trade the likes of which hasn’t been seen in about five hundred years. We need hard asset accounting to deal with fraud and asset bubbles, and we need to start counting environmental and social externalities on the same kind of basis that we account for payments. And it has to be the same system. (to read more about what an integrated blockchain-based environmental economics backbone would look like, see this Medium&nbsp;piece)</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Can the World Computer Save the World? Part 3: Building an Economy with a Future</a></p><p>But back to the hard asset economics. Here’s the core issue in a nutshell.</p><p>Nobody trusts anybody else’s&nbsp;money.</p><p>If you’re in China and signing a deal for 12 months in the future, what do you think the dollar is going to be&nbsp;worth?</p><p>So being able to see exactly what is going on with your counterparties is an increasingly good idea. If I’m being made promises about a supply chain, I want to be able to inspect it. Are you really going to be able to deliver me 1200 PC laptops at 200 a month, or is your vendor going to crap out? If you do fail me, can I get my money&nbsp;back</p><p>Uncertainty is high. All time high. Trust is low. All time low. The global system is stressed.</p><p>We restore trust by making the system transparent: visibility into our counterparties’ supply chains enables us to make a better guess about whether or not they’re going to be able to deliver. This kind of trust problem on trading and delivery is breaking out all over the place, in previously-unprecedented ways.</p><p>The answer, inevitably, is to use less volatile things to pay for less volatile&nbsp;things.</p><p>Absolute certainty about hard assets and their value is a precondition for being able to do trade. But you also need certainty about the value of money, and the risks of the goods not being delivered because of supply chain problems. No system can solve all of this, but strategically deployed cryptographic assets can. If I have a crypto token which translates to four ounces of gold in the form of a gold bar, and you have every reason to trust that token, I can use it to pay for two laptops priced in gold. If you prefer SDRs to gold, and you want to bake in some terms for inflation to index-link the price of the contract, no reason that can’t be done&nbsp;too.</p><p>Turning the&nbsp;corner</p><p>The crypto industry has two fundamental ways of making money: “scarcity as a service” to protect wealth from governments printing currency. That mode of wealth production should be strongly reinforced by 12% per year US inflation and similar rates in other wealthy countries. But 50% drops that apparently come out of nowhere make it hard unnecessarily hard to make that&nbsp;case.</p><p>The other, complimentary, approach is to get stuck in to the hard work of getting physical asset trade on chain. There are a huge range of benefits to tokenizing physical assets as NFTs or representing them as&nbsp;ERC20s.</p>  support for environmental economics  lowered fraud&nbsp;rates  guarantees there’s no slave labour in your&nbsp;stuff  circular economy benefits to reduce raw material&nbsp;usage  easier sales because people trust the stuff they are&nbsp;buying  <p>All this together turns the blockchain itself into the marketplace for the entire world. That’s how we win: we get the real estate, the gold, the land, the wine, the cars, the clothes and furniture and everything else flowing over the magnificent complex infrastructure that has been built up by the last 6 rounds of the Perez Cycle in the blockchain space.</p><p>We have world-changing infrastructure. Now we have to use it to change the&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-is-new-in-the-world-of-blockchain-64b482e1f9d7">What is New in the World of Blockchain?</a></p><p>My company, Mattereum, derisks physical assets as they are turned into tokens. We make Mattereum Asset Passports (MAP) which enable people to vouch (with their money) for the condition of physical goods, ranging from fine artwork to real estate. We combine cutting edge legal developments with blockchain technology so we can partner with merchants to add a MAP to every transaction — the MAP is a digital smart contract that legally binds the identity of an item being sold to its detailed specifications and value. Within the asset passport, each specification is backed by a warranty that is legally enforceable in more than 160 jurisdictions. This means it is no longer necessary to have to just rely on trusting the seller to tell the truth about an item, solving the problem of the lack of a trusted third party in sales on the blockchain. For the first time it enables purchasers to fully trust in the value, integrity and authenticity of on-chain merchant sales, which is of critical importance for the growth of metaverse and NFT transactions that will dematerialise and financialise the world’s physical assets, and allows an avenue for recompense if your on-chain asset is stolen. In addition, through engaging as a warrantor, brands and manufacturers can participate in recurring revenue streams from secondary market transactions.</p><p>Using MAPs we’ve helped our customers sell everything from gold bullion to a world-famous DJ’s trumpet. We are hard core economic realists: Vinay Gupta (CEO) spent years as a consultant on failed states; Anton Shelupanov (Managing Director) saw the economic troubles in former Soviet countries in the 1990s and early 2000s from an extremely difficult position: working alongside justice systems he witnessed the outcomes of economic collapse, which included uncontrolled hyperincarceration, leading to an amplification of the TB and HIV pandemics and the resultant harm to societies. It took respective governments and international organisations years and in some cases decades to put in place strategies to begin to recover from that&nbsp;harm.</p><p>We’re building the technologies, teams, and know-how to run the global economy in an era of unprecedented pressure. We have a circular economy service to make the physical goods we have work harder. We’re working on a large-scale scale play to take gold bullion from around the world and decentralize gold custody. We’re working on real estate, both so you can use real estate as collateral more easily, but also to make it possible to transfer real estate faster and with more certainty which minimises exposure to fluctuating purchasing power and interest rates. We’re getting stuff digitally tagged so you know exactly what you are buying. Soon, all kinds of machineries like futures and options on physical assets: the full Defi toolkit applied to the real world. And because we really believe in and understand ecological economics, because the assets we help sell have estimates of their environmental impact and integrated CO2 offsets, this is all Refi: “Regenerative Finance.” Documenting real things, including the environmental externalities, is critical to our model of the world. You can’t know the real value of a thing unless you fully understand and know its environmental externalities. And knowing real value is what we are all&nbsp;about.</p><p>I want to encourage all of you to join us. The real asset revolution is how crypto really generates wealth.</p><p>How, you say? Right now the global economy offers us no reliable global way to buy and sell things of substantial value around the world, with strong legal protections for both buyers and sellers, and excellent risk management to make sure people get paid if something goes wrong. We don’t gather and collect the information necessary for environmental economics and right-pricing of assets, discounted by any environmental damage they are causing. We know only the cost of everything, but the value of nothing, and it’s really harming&nbsp;us.</p><p>TradFi destroyed the world through systemic fraud of the kind that led to the 2008 financial collapse. It’s working on destroying the future through funding climate change. Defi built the tools for doing some amazing things, but underpriced risk to a scary degree. Refi is both “regenerative finance” but also, critically, Re-al Finance. Finance fully grounded in the real world, including all that messy environmental, social and governance stuff that TradFi and Defi conveniently left out of the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Everything that we can do to make transactions faster, more certain, more trustworthy, higher in information content, more international — all of that — generates real wealth by moving transactions from inefficient and data-losing rails (have you tried buying a house recently?) on to dramatically more functional infrastructure for the future of world&nbsp;trade.</p><p>And this is how we make the blockchain space valuable in an operational way, rather than a speculative way. This is how we move from a series of bubbles to enduring, stable wealth. We get into the real world, and we solve the transparency, accountability and trust problems which dominate real world trade and financial markets. This is the way&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Mattereum is up and running and open for business, creating MAPs for an ever-growing variety of assets.

<p>An Identity management process run with Dizme ID wallet, designed by InfoCert in collaboration with <a href="https://keyless.io/">Keyless Tech</a>, &nbsp;has been the most voted solution at #SHACK22 hackathon.</p>



<p>The hackathon held by INTEROPen, a leading organization to support &amp; accelerate the delivery and adoption of Interoperability Standards in health &amp; social, in partnership with NHS (National Health System) was aimed at developing innovative solutions for the management of access and safe mobility of staff in hospital facilities.</p>



<p>#SHACK22 was attended by twelve international teams from software vendors and consulting companies that competed to present their cutting-edge solutions to face off the challenge.</p>



 How to use DIZME for digital identity and access verification in the health care environment 



<p>As we know, access to health care facilities is highly regulated, this is to be able to ensure maximum safety and security for patients. But health care facilities are also a workplace for hundreds of thousands of workers.</p>



<p>Every day, doctors, nurses, and health care workers must be able to access hospitals in a certain and verified way and with full respect for their privacy.</p>



<p>Thanks to DIZME, a Digital Identity wallet, blockchain based, that combines the benefits of the SSI world as well as the compliance to eIDAS regulation perimeter, InfoCert was able to design a complete access management process that would guarantee total security, while fully respecting privacy and with a high-level of UX thanks to a smart and Passwordless approach.</p>



<p>DIZME’s disruptive approach to access process management enabled it to be voted as the best solution proposed at #SHACK22.</p>

 Practice data cleanliness to mitigate XSS 
<p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that continues to plague web developers. This vulnerability is a type of injection attack and is so common that it’s <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/">number 3 on the OWASP Top Ten list</a>.</p>

<p>How does this vulnerability work? In short, XSS happens when code pollutes data, and you don’t implement safeguards.</p>

<p>Ok, fine, but what does that mean? A classic example is a website that allows user input, like adding comments or reviews. Suppose the input form accepts anything the user types in and doesn’t appropriately safeguard that user input before storing and displaying it to other users. In that case, it’s at risk for XSS.</p>

<p>Imagine an overly dramatic but otherwise innocent scenario like this:</p>
<blockquote>
   
     A website allows you to add comments about your favorite K-Drama. 
     An agitator adds the comment <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('Crash Landing on You stinks!');&lt;/script&gt;</code>. 
     That terrible comment saves as is to the database. 
     A K-Drama fan opens the website. 
     The terrible comment is added to the website, appending the <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag to the DOM. 
     The K-Drama fan is outraged by the JavaScript alert saying their favorite K-Drama stinks. 
   
</blockquote>

<p>So, this is obviously awful. Least of all because we all know “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10850932/">Crash Landing on You</a>” is, in fact, wonderful. Also, this scenario exposes your website to the possibility of a colossal breach in which an injection attack can do all sorts of bad things. With JavaScript, the attack could grab cookies, dig around your browser’s local storage for authentication information, access your file system, make calls to other sites, and do even more harm.</p>

<p>In this case, we’ve show an example very clearly using a <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag to make it easier for us to talk about, but an attack can use anything that runs JavaScript, such as adding an HTML element with JS embedded in the attribute, adding JS to resource URLs, embedding JS into CSS, and so forth. This is the true stuff of nightmares!</p>

<p>How do we avoid these sorts of shenanigans? There are a few different defensive tactics, but the main one is to ensure you practice good data hygiene through escaping and sanitizing.</p>

<p>Escaping refers to replacing certain specific characters in HTML so they are read as text strings, such as replacing <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> with <code>&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;</code>). When you escape, the browser no longer treats the value as part of the code. It’s simply text or data. Although we’re talking XSS here, escaping is a good practice in general as it will protect you against SQL injection, a different type of injection attack.</p>

<p></p>

<p>– <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">xkcd</a></p>

<p>Sanitizing removes code that might be malicious, while preserving some safe HTML tags. The primary use case for choosing to sanitize instead of to escape the code is when you want to allow markup to display, like if you have a rich text editor on your website.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more to discuss regarding cross-site scripting, including types of XSS and mitigation technique specifics, so keep an eye out for a follow-up post with more details, including the built-in XSS security mechanisms provided in some SPA frameworks.</p>

 Dive into XSS 
<p>Can’t wait to read more about XSS? Check out these resources that cover how cross-site scripting works:</p>

   <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting">Cross-site scripting resource from Port Swigger Web Security Academy</a> 
 

 Validate requests for authenticity to mitigate CSRF 
<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is another well-known vulnerability in the <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/">top spot of the OWASP Top Ten, Broken Access Control</a>. CSRF allows attackers to exploit your identity to perform unauthorized actions. Sounds pretty bad, right? Well, yup, you’re correct.</p>

<p>The exploit works like this.</p>

<blockquote>
   
     You log in to the K-Drama site to upvote some recent shows you watched. 
     Then, in a loss of judgment, you open a spam email and click the link to transfer money to an agitator claiming to be your long lost high school sweetheart. (What were you thinking!) 
     The link takes you to a malicious site with a hidden form embedded within it. 
     The hidden form sends an HTTP POST request with terrible comments to the K-Drama site along with the active session cookie. 
     Since you have an active authenticated session on the K-Drama site, the POST completes as if you were the one adding terrible comments about “Hospital Playlist”!

<p>Luckily in this example, the unauthorized action isn’t irreversible or devastating. You can delete the terrible comments, and you can explain how it wasn’t really you who posted such comments to horrified “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11769304/">Hospital Playlist</a>” fans. However, you can see how dangerous and malicious this exploit would be if the target was something fundamental like a bank!</p>

<p>The only way to mitigate against CSRF is to ensure the request is legitimate.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we already have some tools and actions at our disposal that we covered previously, such as:</p>
 
   Prefer tokens in HTTP headers for authenticated HTTP calls and ideally store those tokens in-memory. 
   Configure tight CORS controls. 
   Protect your cookies! 
 

<p>These mechanisms are so good that some say <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/csrf-is-dead/">there’s nothing more you need to do for SPAs</a>!</p>

<p>However, CSRF relies on your backend not completing due diligence to verify the authenticity of the requests and allowing non-JSON payloads. Hackers are very clever, and you may need to allow <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> payloads in your backend, so you may need extra safeguards. When you do need extra guards, you can add a unique CSRF token for communication between your frontend and backend. The backend needs to verify standard authentication and authorization safeguards and verify the CSRF token’s legitimacy.</p>

<p>The token is generated by the backend and sent to the frontend. The frontend then uses the token in subsequent calls to the backend by adding it as a custom HTTP header.</p>

<p>For SPAs, getting that CSRF token from the server is the difficult part. In traditional web apps, it’s not a problem. But for SPAs, you don’t call your back-end API until after you load the application. You also want CSRF protection before logging in if you’re not delegating authentication to a third-party authentication provider. 😎</p>

<p>The recommendation is to have your client call an endpoint on your backend to get the CSRF token. The endpoint must be super vigilant about confirming the caller’s origin and keeping that CORS allowlist very strict.</p>

<p>Password attacks are becoming easier to achieve with most people having too many passwords to remember, leading them to use the same password over and over.</p>
<p>What is a password attack? Password attacks are malicious ways hackers attempt to gain access to your account. Examples of password attacks include brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and password spraying.</p>
 What Is Password Security? 
<p><a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person#:~:text=How%20many%20passwords%20does%20the,repeat%20passwords%20or%20password%20elements.">A study commissioned by NordPass</a> showed that most individuals are working with around 100 different passwords. It’s no wonder, then, that passwords are often the most attractive target for hackers looking to break into enterprise systems. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach">According to IBM</a>, data breaches cost businesses an average of $1.07 million.</p>
<p>As multi-user systems and the internet became the norm, system designers and admins used username and password combinations as a logical and simple approach to security.</p>
<p>This approach made sense at the time, when physical limitations meant that systems had limited users, and users, in turn, had little use for multiple system accounts. The explosion of online services like email, social media, e-commerce, cloud storage, and banking led to individuals having several accounts across dozens of platforms, each with their own unique account information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relying on passwords, essentially, led us to critical security issues:</p>
 
 Simple Passwords: Passwords should be hard to guess, but users faced with memorizing 100 complex passwords will often instead opt to create simple ones —simple passwords that are, unfortunately, easy to guess or break.&nbsp; 
 Reused Passwords: Even a handful of passwords are difficult to remember, and users aren’t prone to writing every single password down. Instead, as Infosecurity Magazine notes, <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/your-employees-reusing-passwords/">up to 65% of users reuse the same or similar username/password combinations across multiple accounts</a>. This includes reuse of credentials across consumer and work-related accounts.&nbsp; 
 Password Theft: Password systems aren’t interested in the actual user sitting at a computer, only that they have the right credentials. That means that passwords are much easier to steal and use without repercussion.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These practices prevent a unique problem for security experts and administrators. First, simple passwords are easy to hack, even with the simplest methods. Second, hackers who steal credentials from one platform can attempt them across several major platforms with a relatively high success rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relative strength of the password is also subject to the cyberhealth of the user, including how well they protect knowledge of their passwords.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the 8 Most Prominent Password Attacks? 
<p>Based on these three potential problems, a whole host of attacks have emerged to try and steal login credentials from users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to understand the impact that password attacks have on cybersecurity. We often have an image of hacking in our heads that comes from movies, one that isn’t quite based on reality. Instead of shadowy figures directly connecting to external systems, most breaches start when a hacker gets access to that system from password theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some of the most common password attacks:</p>
 Brute-Force&nbsp; 
<p>The simplest and slowest form of password attack is the brute-force method. Automated systems manually attempt several million, billion, or trillion combinations of letters and numbers in the hope of accidentally stumbling on an account password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This form of attack isn’t practical for online accounts for the most part, where page loading times and server security features (like limiting page requests) limit effectiveness. However, a brute-force method can potentially pose a threat to stolen hardware or databases where the hackers can mount attacks in real time without an internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent brute-force attacks:</p>
 
 Utilizing complex passwords with combinations of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols can make guessing difficult.&nbsp; 
 Using longer passwords is also preferable, as longer passwords add exponential layers of complexity to brute-force guessing.&nbsp; 
 Enact account lock if a user provides an incorrect password too many times. A locked account with limited cooldown time can thwart brute-force attacks.&nbsp; 
 Implementing multi-factor authentication and passwordless solutions can eliminate the effectiveness of brute-force attacks, as they require credentials that these methods cannot replicate.&nbsp; 
 
 Dictionary 
<p>Dictionary attacks try words from a predetermined list in attempt to brute-force an account’s password. These dictionaries, while including fewer overall words, will often focus on “common” passwords compiled by hackers over the years. The lists&nbsp; can also include terms from actual dictionaries, common names, or combinations of dates and locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent dictionary attacks:</p>
 
 Avoiding common passwords made of readable words, even if you are using combinations of common words.&nbsp; 
 Creating passwords out of random or seemingly random combinations of letters, numbers, and characters.&nbsp; 
 Enacting account lock if a user provides an incorrect password too many times. A locked account with limited cooldown time can thwart brute-force attacks.&nbsp; 
 Implementing multi-factor authentication and passwordless solutions can eliminate the effectiveness of brute-force attacks, as they require credentials that these methods cannot replicate.&nbsp; 
 
 Keyloggers 
<p>Keyloggers are types of software that monitor keystrokes on the host system and copy that information into a text file. These types of software can come from some other kind of hack, like an infected email attachment or something installed locally on the machine. A keylogger will expose any passwords typed by the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent keylogger attacks:</p>
 
 Scanning systems for malware or other malicious software using antivirus tools, and checking for unexpectedly installed software in the system.&nbsp; 
 Maintaining complete physical protection over physical computers, including strong authentication for workstations and physical security (locks, keypads, and cameras) in any area where computers are located.&nbsp; 
 
 Credential Stuffing 
<p>It’s common for a hacker, upon hacking one account, to attempt using those credentials on several other accounts. Similarly, hackers who steal passwords (through, for example, a database breach) will wait and, over time, attempt to use those credentials again, both in other systems and within the same system again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach assumes that at least some users will fail to update passwords after a breach and that more users will not change an identical username and password on a different system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent credential stuffing attacks:</p>
 
 Forcing users to change passwords after a breach. A mandatory change can mitigate the threat of old passwords causing a problem.&nbsp; 
 Requiring users to change their passwords at regular intervals and making it so they cannot reuse previous username and password combinations.&nbsp; 
 Making password managers mandatory if sticking with passwords as a primary security approach.&nbsp; 
 
 Phishing 
<p>Phishing has been one of the most prominent forms of cyberattack. It counts on users’ ignorance of modern security threats and their trust in official-seeming emails by spoofing these emails to request user passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one is invulnerable to these attacks, and phishing has been the source of some of the most significant cybersecurity events in modern history—massive <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/whale-phishing/">spear phishing attempts</a> have cost enterprises billions of dollars in stolen funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phishing itself is a widespread form of attack, with several different forms:</p>
 
 Email 
 SMS Texts 
 Video Conferencing Software 
 Voice Calls 
 Spoofed Websites 
 
<p>All of these approaches can use marketing messaging, spoofed email templates, spoofed email addresses, and additional measures to fool users into giving up their passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent phishing attacks:</p>
 
 Training team members, from salaried employees to senior executives, on how to recognize phishing attacks when they see them.&nbsp; 
 Implementing email-based warnings to provide alerts when employees receive emails from outside of the organization.&nbsp; 
 
 Password Spraying 
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-spraying/">Password spraying</a> tries to attack multiple accounts at once in search of weak passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A spraying attack will take a handful of common passwords (like a dictionary attack) but rely on regular patterns, like well-known defaults, birthdates, or simple phrases like combinations of numbers and the word “password,” and attempt to brute-force multiple accounts at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This “spray approach” will not have the same success rate as a dedicated dictionary attack. Instead, it counts on a numbers game: across hundreds of accounts, at least one of them is using weak password security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strength of this attack is that it only takes one set of stolen credentials to compromise an entire enterprise system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent password spraying attacks</p>
 
 Avoiding common passwords made of readable words, even if you are using combinations of common words.&nbsp; 
 Creating passwords out of random or seemingly random combinations of letters, numbers, and characters.&nbsp; 
 Requiring users to change their passwords at regular intervals and making it so that they cannot reuse previous username and password combinations.&nbsp; 
 Making password managers mandatory if sticking with passwords as a primary security approach.&nbsp; 
 Implementing multi-factor authentication and passwordless solutions can eliminate the effectiveness of brute-force attacks, as they require credentials that these methods cannot replicate.&nbsp; 
 
 Man-in-the-Middle 
<p>Man-in-the-middle attacks occur when a hacker gains control of an intermediary system between two parties, such as a user and an authentication platform, and steals information as it moves back and forth between them (including passwords). Unsecure channels of communication can make this information easily readable, and any attacker in the middle can read the information without alerting either party to the threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks:</p>
 
 Encrypting data entering and leaving the organization, and avoiding sending any information, including login credentials, over cleartext. 
 Leveraging virtual private networks for remote users accessing critical systems.&nbsp;

<p>Clone phishing is a dangerous attack that can easily make it into any of your employees’ inboxes. So what can you do to protect against it?</p>
<p>What is clone phishing? Clone phishing is a type of phishing attack that replicates a legitimate-looking email to entice the reader to click the link or open the attachment to allow the hacker to gain access to their account.</p>
 What Are the Different Types of Phishing? 
<p>“Phishing” is a cyberattack where the attacker uses fake communications to deceive individuals into providing information or access. The most common form of phishing is through email. Still, modern innovations in communication technology have seen a parallel expansion of phishing into areas like phone calls, video call software, and SMS texting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We often like to see ourselves as a well-educated and aware digital natives. However, the reality is that with the right combination of tools, lies, and luck an attacker can successfully fool a significant number of people and reap huge rewards. Phishing is so successful that a Cisco study reported that with 86% of respondents at least one person in their organization clicked a link in a malicious email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it only takes one click to expose an entire system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phishing attacks revolve around a standard set of tactics, and as such, there are a few primary forms of phishing that transcend technology:</p>
 
 Traditional Phishing: Traditional mass-communication phishing involves the attacker creating a fake message (typically an email) to fool users into providing authentication credentials or clicking links that steal that information.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These attacks are often the crudest form of phishing and target hundreds or thousands of users—which means that even with a success rate of 1% or less, they still end up with something to show for it.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Spear Phishing: Spear phishing is a form of phishing where the attacker targets high-profile users, like managers and executives.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These managers aren’t impervious to attack, and sufficiently sophisticated messages can convince them to provide system access to company resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spear phishing attacks have been the root of many major hacks, including the hack on the Democratic National Committee email servers during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/whale-phishing/">Whale Phishing</a>: The next step up in the phishing hierarchy is whale phishing, a form of spear phishing that targets the highest executives in an organization, often chief executive officers or chief financial officers. Whale phishing has cost enterprises millions of dollars due to executives sending money or other resources to hackers under false pretenses.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Businesses must understand that phishing is an issue that can affect an organization at any level. Phishing is the biggest threat most enterprises face in modern cybersecurity.</p>
 How Does Clone Phishing Differ from Other Forms of Phishing? 
<p>The previous examples of phishing differentiate themselves based on their targeting approach. Phishing types also break down across technologies. For example, “Smishing,” or SMS phishing, uses SMS texts to entice users to click links. “Vishing,” or voice phishing, uses digital voice or video conferencing software to trick users. Video software phishing on platforms like Zoom is quite common due to the apps’ prevalence in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>By and large, however, email is still the biggest platform for phishing attacks and where advanced techniques like clone phishing come into play. This is for a few reasons:</p>
 
 Cost: Email is cheap, simple, and easy to set up. Hackers can send thousands of emails with the touch of a button.&nbsp; 
 Ubiquity: Everyone uses email. Even people who rarely actually email have an email to manage accounts, and most business correspondence happens via email.&nbsp; 
 Spoofing: Email is relatively easy to spoof. First, the sender address and link URLs are relatively easy to obfuscate to prevent detection under a cursory inspection. Second, many people simply don’t pay close attention to emails.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Clone phishing leverages these facts to send sophisticated fake emails to users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider business email. When employees receive messages from internal parties, most do not investigate those messages. They assume they are from who they say they are from. In many cases, however, business emails are harder to falsify—they require an understanding of company personnel or access to an internal email account to spam users directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if the attacker has a copy of an email sent by someone in a business, they can copy that email and use it for phishing.</p>
<p>This is clone phishing. This attacker gains access to an official email using special formatting, branding, letterheads, or other official designations. They then change something about the email, like an attachment or a link, and resend it from a spoofed email account as an error correction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recipients who get the second email assume it’s identical to the first, other than some small changes, and trust it (along with any links or attachments included). This is the danger of cloned emails: they bypass some of the red flags we might see in other phishing attempts by using something we’ve already seen, a legitimate email, as a smokescreen.</p>
<p>Clone phishing is different from compromised business emails because a clone phishing email will still be sent from an outside location. With business email compromise, the attacker can send emails directly from a compromised account, so there isn’t a need to clone an email. That doesn’t make clone phishing any less dangerous, however.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While they may be hard to detect, some characteristics of clone phishing emails may include:</p>
 
 Link URLs to non-professional or unknown websites. 
 New attachments added to emails that previously had none. 
 Broken image links for references lost during a copy and paste job.&nbsp; 
 Email addresses that don’t match the original sender. 
 Added text with extensive typos. 
 
 How You Can Protect Your Organization Against Clone Phishing 
<p>Phishing prevention is one of the most critical security undertakings many organizations will take. Such security requires coordination of technology, training, and people. While clone phishing emails are much more sophisticated than spray-and-pray email phishing campaigns, many of these preventative approaches can mitigate them in the same way.</p>
<p>Below are a few critical steps that can prepare your organization for clone phishing attacks:</p>
 
 Phishing Awareness Training: Always have training programs and resources for employees to understand what a phishing email looks like. Users often need training on how to check email addresses (and not just those in the “From” field), use on-hover previews to check links, and recognize red flags like typos or bad copy-and-paste jobs. 
 Visual Email Alerts: Email filters are only so good at keeping spam out of a business network. Additional measures, like adding visual warnings that denote email from external email addresses, can signal users to pay attention to the email and its details.&nbsp; 
 Strong Multi-Factor Authentication: Hackers are usually looking for login credentials. In systems that rely on passwords or PINs, it’s much easier to steal that information. Strong MFA, like SMS tokens or, even better, strong biometrics, can make phishing attempts unable to gain access to a system.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">Passwordless Authentication</a>: As a step beyond MFA, you can use a passwordless system that doesn’t require that users maintain credentials. Instead, they can use dedicated authentication apps and device biometrics to access systems. A hacker can’t phish biometrics from users of a passwordless system.&nbsp; 
 
 Harden Your System Security with 1Kosmos and BlockID 
<p>Unfortunately, hackers don’t often rely on brute-force <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-spraying/">password spraying</a> or fanciful hacking attempts to undermine system security. They rely on the trusting nature of people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key to mitigating these kinds of email attacks is removing the user vulnerabilities. By eliminating passwords, relying on biometrics, and streamlining the authentication process for user devices, you can effectively mitigate many phishing attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While authentication systems won’t protect you 100% from clone phishing attacks that use attachments to deliver virus payloads, a technology like 1Kosmos BlockID, combined with proper email controls and training, can shore up your phishing prevention approach.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID provides the following features:</p>
 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Streamlined User Experience: 1Kosmos provides simple user onboarding and convenient access anywhere, anytime and on any device. The experience can be delivered via the BlockID app or integrated via our SDK into your custom app.

<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts will look at the broad range of security requirements in today’s agile IT and DevOps infrastructures, at solutions that help in increasing software supply chain security, and at the specific role Secrets Management plays.&nbsp;Craig Lurey, CTO and Co-Founder of Keeper Security will explain the main points of infrastructure secrets management and how this can be done securely using a cloud-based, zero-knowledge platform without adding complexity or needing to invest in extra hardware.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/devops-tools-securing-supply-chain"></a>

<p>At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s some of the latest from our development efforts:</p> Sign-In with Ethereum <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  We're currently in the process of designing and implementing a method of delegating object capabilities to a session key using a SIWE message. For more on session keys, check out:  <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/from-sign-in-with-ethereum-to-session-keys/">  From Sign-In with Ethereum to Session Keys  Session keys let users root all their digital interactions to their keys.  SpruceWayne Chang    </a>  We are currently working various fixes across our libraries such as an update for our Discourse plugin, updating some of our examples, and are in the process of releasing <code>v2.0.4</code> of our SIWE core library.   As mentioned in our previous update, our <a href="http://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/">community run identity</a> server via the ENS DAO has had a witnessed deployment and is currently set up on Cloudflare along with relevant access for witnesses. Additionally, the Sign-In with Ethereum documentation has been updated to point to this new server.  We are currently finishing work with a major wallet on a direct Sign-In with Ethereum integration, and are currently working on how Sign-In with Ethereum can support non-standard verification methods.   We're currently working on a new, ergonomic way to use Sign-In with Ethereum and session management for applications, and are currently in the process of setting up beta testing. If you're interested in trying this out, <a href="mailto:hello@spruceid.com">please get in touch</a>.   Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  We've rewrote the core SDK functionality in Rust, refactored out some core definitions from <code>kepler</code> to <code>kepler-lib</code>, and added support for CACAO-ZCAPs (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/116">kepler #116</a>)   We've implemented better bundling of the Wasm SDK dependency to improve developer experience, removing the need for specific configuration downstream. (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler-sdk/pull/40">kepler-sdk #40</a>)   SpruceID <p>SpruceID is a decentralized identity toolkit that provides everything you need for signing, sharing, and verifying trusted information.</p> DIDKit   We've added a basic UCAN implementation that takes advantage of <code>ssi</code>'s JWT/JWS and DID tools. (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/447">ssi#447</a>).  Various minor improvements and fixes.   Rebase   We have deployed the first demo example of a Rebase frontend that allows users to go through various workflows that result in the user receiving a valid Verifiable Credential.   The demo features credential workflows for Twitter accounts, GitHub accounts, DNS ownership, and demonstrating ownership over two Ethereum wallets.   We've fully documented the architecture, and have added guides on implementing new signers, witness flows, and schemas. This information will also be added to the core SpruceID documentation.   Our next step here is to contribute this codebase to the Rebase community initiative, allowing any organization to issue Rebase credentials.   Standards and Community   We congratulate the Decentralized Identity community on the DID-core specification moving forward to become a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/06/DIDRecommendationDecision.html">W3C recommendation</a>.    <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web. Through SpruceID and Kepler, Spruce provides an ecosystem of open source tools for developers that let users collect their data in one place that they control, and show their cards however they want.

 Vinay Gupta, CEO of Mattereum and Ethereum launch co-ordinator in 2015 looks at how to survive the Crypto Winter and come out the other end with new&nbsp;purpose <p>Around 2017 I was looking at starting a VC fund. I didn’t know exactly how to do it: I’d worked in a fund in the 1990s but there was a lot about the business I did not understand at the&nbsp;time.</p><p>As part of the research, I put about 100 people through their first VR experience. I wanted to figure out if it was time to invest in VR projects. It was market research.</p><p>I came to the conclusion that we were years away from VR being a workable technology. The hardware was clearly ready: Oculus Rift was a little clunky but it was the Apple IIe of VR: the thing that tells you The Revolution is Coming. That was&nbsp;fine.</p><p>But the software was appalling. Back in the day they made movies by putting a camera on a tripod and doing a stage play in front of it. It took decades to make movies. A whole new art form (cinematography) had to be invented. Shocking and amazing things happened decade after decade for a century to get us to where cinema is now. Those changes were often driven by technology, but they were delivered by actors and directors portraying the human experience in new ways, creating ever-more-compelling works. VR is not ready for artistic reasons, far more than for technical ones. I could go on about this for some hours, but the lack of a “virtual cinematography” makes most VR experiences as compelling as watching CCTV footage of mall parking lots. It does not matter if I’m looking at the wheat fields of Gondor and scouting for Nazgul, if it’s not telling me a story I don’t want to&nbsp;know.</p><p>Also violence is overwhelmingly overpowering in VR. It’s literally just too much and reducing the violent content of our video games to the point that it doesn’t traumatize people to play (Arizona Sunshine, I’m looking at you here) is also going to take&nbsp;time.</p><p>So my prediction is this: the Metaverse is going to fail. The pandemic is more-or-less over, people are back out in the world again, and everybody loves this place! The stay-at-home culture which VR is fundamentally rooted in doesn’t provide the lived experiences which people want. There is something very much like VR which people do want, but until VR has solved the artistic problems of storytelling in the virtual medium it’s just chat rooms with better graphics. I have an Meta Quest II, and it’s gathering dust: there’s just nothing to *do* in&nbsp;there.</p><p>Not yet.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/w0000CE0/status/1537401568328404993">@w0000CE0</a></p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, we have inflation. To inflate. The state of things being inflated.</p><p>The bubble of all&nbsp;bubbles.</p><p>Folks don’t remember inflation.</p>Source: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html</a><p>Realistically the <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts">US inflation rate is about 12%</a> right now, if it’s calculated using the same measures used back in the day. If that stays up for four years, each dollar in circulation loses half of its&nbsp;value.</p><p>The whole economy goes through what the Ethereum community has gone through in the last few weeks, over a couple of years. It is devastating. In theory wages adjust to keep up with inflation, and interest rates too. Practically speaking without strong labour unions to negotiate, workers get poorer year-on-year.</p><p>Pair that up with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/09/global-supply-chain-crisis-fuels-push-to-local-manufacturing-as-chinas-appeal-dims">global supply chain crisis</a>, including food, and you’ve got <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1119752">a recipe for global disaster</a>.</p><p>The middle class don’t just get to retreat into the virtual world. There’s nothing there that anybody&nbsp;wants.</p><p>No, we have to stand our ground and fight for the real world: it’s where we&nbsp;live.</p><p>The metaverse is not going to save us. If we re-inflate the tech-hype bubble around the metaverse, it’ll produce a brief flare of innovation, some very inflated prices for assets which are inherently extremely volatile, and another flame-out like the one that we’re in, just a couple of years down the road (at most.) I quite liked <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-axs-price-risks-deeper-losses-despite-90-drawdown-already">play to earn as a concept</a>. It didn’t seem inherently bonkers to me that the age-old practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming">gold farming</a> could be modernized by crypto into something that allowed essentially independent operators to do it in a defi way. But it’s stuck in the <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa">Perez spin cycle</a>, along with everything else, and people in developing world countries are losing their entire livelihood in this&nbsp;chaos.</p><p>We have to change how this&nbsp;works.</p><p>We have to take the hard path now: we have to start building the kind of wealth that Warren Buffet can understand, the rebuilding that outfits like Southwest Airlines specialized in.</p><p>We have to learn how to make&nbsp;money.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/build-back-better-8a1be80623b2">Build Back Better!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><br>
Introduction</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The main value of a platform such as Uber or AirBnB is that it reduces transactions costs for participants that use their network.</p>
<p>Before smartphones with connectivity and good map functionality, it wouldn’t have been economically viable to stand on a street corner and hope that a driver you don’t know would pick you up and take you to a predetermined place. Taxis were really the only solution – but you had to call one beforehand – sometimes far in advance and there was a price to that.</p>
<p>Platforms such as Uber come along and are able to use these technological advances to connect demand and supply, transfer value through cashless exchanges/credit card in-app; and create trust through a rating system. You can look at a platform like AirBnB with a similar lens.</p>
<p>I see what we’re doing in self-sovereign identity as further reducing the costs of business/transactions. And this incremental value value is achieved by reducing trust costs across silos.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image 1 – The cost of establishing trust reduces with the elimination of silos</p>
<p>How can an organization trust that a supplier located hundreds of kilometers away is who they say they are? Or, as a person, how can I verify that the organization receiving my personal data is indeed who I believe them to be?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a fundamental principle which often hinders development in the digital economy: trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the global economy continues to go digital, overcoming the challenges associated with digital identity management is crucial. The ability to accurately identify legal entities represents a huge part of that effort. Only by establishing trust between legal counterparties can the true benefits of a digitally enabled world be realized.</p>
 
 
 
<p><br>
Note: my thinking around network effects related to decentralized (non-siloed) ecosystems started while reading <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">this wonderful 2019 blog post</a> by Sam Smith.</p>

 Vinay Gupta, CEO of Mattereum and Ethereum launch co-ordinator in 2015 looks at the latest Crypto Winter and how we got&nbsp;here. <p>Once again, crypto winter is upon us. Depending on how you count this is my fifth or eighth. Back in the 1990s there was ITAR and the crypto wars, where the US Federal Government basically killed the industry in America, back when crypto was a thing you did to emails not a shorthand for privately issued anonymous digital cash. The early days of bitcoin, when it hit thirty-something dollars then crashed to four and stayed there. The 2016 DAO crisis. I’ve seen it&nbsp;all.</p><p>I want to talk about how we wound up where we are today, and how we get off this nightmare ride of boom-and-bust cycles which are psychologically trashing our industry and making it so hard to build enduring value. We can stop the bleeding, but we have to be&nbsp;smart.</p> The psychology of the boom-bust innovation cycle. <p>Here’s <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/2018-year-in-preview-the-future-of-cryptocurrency-b99110480ff0">the piece I wrote in 2017 about the 2018 crypto winter</a>. Some of you may remember it. It lays out the same basic case I’m going to make here: crypto wins by solving problems that nobody else can solve, profitably. It has to win at three levels to&nbsp;survive:</p>  Ordinary people have to use&nbsp;it  It has to generate actual value, not just move value&nbsp;around  Governments have to tolerate it or use it themselves — either one will&nbsp;do  <p>If we can’t hit all three of those criteria WANGMI. We’re building a technology that needs a billion regular users to survive. The constants are huge: big engineering teams, big marketing budgets, complex legal and regulatory work. It all costs money and the only thing that can sustain the industry is real economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>It is still <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/02/16/warren-buffett-invested-1-billion-crypto-bank/">Warren Buffet</a>’s world — literally, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/berkshire-hathaway/marketcap/">he owns it</a>. His way of analyzing the world is to look at the fundamental valuation and profitability of assets. He’s so good at it, his company has roughly the same market cap as Ethereum had a couple of years ago. But Buffet’s company doesn’t 10x up and 4x down every couple of years: it’s plodded along fairly reliably for decades, incrementally growing&nbsp;value.</p><p>Now, you’ve gotta ask yourself, “why can’t Warren Buffet see crypto?” And it’s not because he’s old or doesn’t get tech. No, it’s because he’s smart about <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp">financial fundamentals</a>.</p><p>That’s all that boring stuff&nbsp;like:</p>  How much food will come out of the&nbsp;ground?  What’s the global market for machine tools going to look like next&nbsp;year?  How fast are people moving to the&nbsp;cities?  <p>Thinking about this stuff really carefully is how you figure out when a real-world asset is under-valued.</p><p>Buying things which are under-valued is how Warren Buffet makes&nbsp;money.</p><p>But Warren Buffet won’t buy bitcoin at any price. So we have to think about that. What do we know that Warren Buffet&nbsp;doesn’t?</p><p>Now let me introduce another big thinker about finance: <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/people/carlota-perez">Carlotta Perez</a>. Perez is good at valuing bubbles. Specifically, she’s good at thinking about how bubbles create value in the long run even though they all pass through horrible periods like&nbsp;this.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/">https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/</a></p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting</a></p><p>What Perez says, roughly, is that bubbles build infrastructure. There’s a massive surge of irrational enthusiasm during which water flows uphill, capital flows into the most improbable things, and the future seems so close you can touch it. Warren Buffet hates this stuff because it involves guessing about the future. During that initial lift, during the innovation burn period, the G-force is like sitting in a plane at take-off. It hits you right in the base of your spine. Here we&nbsp;go!</p><p>Then a little later nearly everyone goes bankrupt.</p><p>Then a bunch of grown-ups who know how to run business move in, buy up all the assets cheap, and turn all of this technological potential into profitable businesses.</p><p>It’s a fundamental change in the nature of the people that run the industry: it goes from innovators to operators. Risk tolerance goes way down because the technology already works but it needs people who can operate it profitably.</p><p>My company, <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> is in the middle of that process of transformation right now as our business team takes more and more responsibility for running the business, and the original innovators are now more integrated into product development and sales. Usually companies don’t make that transition under their own power — somebody has to come in and fire the CEO — but in our case we knew enough about how businesses really run to make those changes under our own power (without anyone firing&nbsp;me).</p><p>I’ll introduce a few members of our new senior leadership team in another Medium post&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>So we’ve been through basically six rounds of the Perez cycle in crypto in the past 15 years. These things come on each-other thick and fast. An enormous amount of underlying technological, financial and even social innovation has happened.</p>  Bitcoin  Altcoins  Ethereum  ICOs  Defi  NFTs  <p>And at the end of that we’re left with a rough copy of about a third of the global financial system. You could just about put together a mortgage loan and buy a house as an NFT if you really put your mind to it. It would take work and connections, but you could just about buy real estate as an NFT today, with financing. Mattereum is of course going to make that a lot easier real soon, but let’s deal with things as they are rather than as they’re going to&nbsp;be.</p><p>So in every one of these rounds of the Perez cycle we can see the future as clearly as all the folks who went bust installing “dark fiber” optic cables in the ground. About 20 years ago companies ploughed billions into the ground to lay fiber optic cables that nobody needed or would pay for. It was THE FUTURE. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/11/fiber-optic/">Then everybody went bankrupt</a>, grown ups bought the assets for a song, and slowly started to operate the fibre profitably. Same thing happened with airlines: again and again and again Southwest Airlines acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Southwest_Airlines">bankrupt airlines for a song</a>, with planes and routes, and operated them profitably.</p><p>In crypto we run this cycle super fast and with the same people in the room on each cycle. But the field keeps growing and changing, and all these ups and downs result in a most “interesting” phenomena: the All Time&nbsp;High.</p><p>During the All Time High, at crypto events, every single person in the room has made money. Everybody. You bought in yesterday, you’ve already made $5. You bought in six months ago and you look like a genius. The money just seems to take care of&nbsp;itself.</p><p>During a dip the “newbies” have lost money; the least socially connected 10% or 20% of the people in the room bought, then it dipped, and the old hands are buying at the current price. The newbies are a bit twitchy but the old hands are all looking greedy rather than fearful, and life goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>During a crash, and all-importantly after a crash, 70% of the people in the room have lost money. Some of them have lost 70% of what they invested: they took real money out of bricks-and-mortar assets and bought hype tickets, and then got rekt, to use current parlance. And in these periods the old hands aren’t buying anything; they’re sitting on their winnings and waiting for the rally somewhere on down the&nbsp;line.</p><p>The NFT space is now in this condition. At <a href="https://www.nft.nyc/">NYC.NFT</a> in June 2022 the mood was mordant. People have lost a lot of money, and they wonder if they’re ever going to make it back. Remember 2018, Ethereum people? The ICO craze had blown over because the massive promises made by those projects had failed to materialize, and people were gloomy as all hell. A long time passed until <a href="https://oecdonthelevel.com/2022/01/31/from-defi-summer-to-crypto-winter-leverage-liquidations-and-policy-implications/">Defi Summer</a> in 2020, and then the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">2021 NFT take-off a year&nbsp;ago</a>.</p><p>Most of the new folks in the space haven’t seen crypto winter before. 70% or so of the people in the room have lost money. The mood is down, down,&nbsp;down.</p><p>Welcome to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Revolutions_and_Financial_Capital">Perez Cycle</a>, kids. I’m sorry to be seeing you down here in the gutter one more time, but you’ll find a lot of old friends here, survivors of previous rounds of the&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>We stick together.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa">Winter Has Come</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The European Union has been looking forward to the rollout of a verified, cross-border digital identity for years now. The European Commission has seen the spread of digital commerce as well as its integration with social media and has rightly deduced that new systems and protections are required as we move into the 21st century. Such an all-encompassing ID certainly can provide benefits to private users as well as big businesses, but there hasn’t been a clear vision as to just what it would look&nbsp;like.</p><p>The ideas so far put forward found insufficient traction, and that sent regulators back to the drawing board. However, with the release of an updated framework comes an opportunity. The new techniques and ideas that are necessary to bring about such an identification system are already present in the Nuggets verified Self-Sovereign Identity platform.</p><p>eIDAS 1.0 Explained</p><p>The Electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS</a>) is an EU regulatory framework designed to govern both electronic identification and general trust services in the world of electronic commerce. Established in 2014, eIDAS comes along with the European Commission’s (ECs) broader mission outlined in Europe’s “<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/64/digital-agenda-for-europe">Digital Agenda</a>.” The ultimate purpose of this endeavor is to push innovation and generally bring the EU into the 21st&nbsp;century.</p><p>eIDAS specifically calls for the Union-wide adoption of a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Digital Identity</a>. Under this system, all citizens are given their own unique, verifiable digital credentials. These can then be used to securely access services online and offline across the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>This is not a brand-new development, and a public service-only version of this model is already being rolled out, but the adoption rate of this first attempt has been fairly poor. Only about ⅔ of EU citizens even live in a country that has enabled such an ID, and they don’t yet all work together. To add to the problems, there has also been some <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/244763/eIDAS-policy%20paper-EW+EDRi.pdf">general resistance</a> to the move, with detractors pointing out the potential abuses surrounding both user autonomy and general&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>It also doesn’t help things that the events of 2020 and 2021 have left an irreversible mark on society and how people interact with it. This all has led to the EC deciding to go back to the beginning and reimagine what this regulation really needs to look&nbsp;like.</p><p>How To Fix What Was&nbsp;Wrong</p><p>Those who have opposed the original framework for this universal eID have pointed to a variety of concerns, so let’s take a look at what those are right now. First of all, in its original form, the regulation described a unique ID that was linked to all aspects of a person and would ultimately follow them for their entire life. There wasn’t enough wording to describe how things like privacy or separation of different types of information would work, leaving the door open for companies to be able to see far too much, and the user could only do little about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Then there was the concerning part of the proposal that called for governments to be able to implement a form of “kill switch” on any given ID. The stated purpose was to cut off funding should illegal activity or terrorist financing be detected, but many still felt this was too far of a stretch. The possibilities for abuse or even honest mistakes leading to the “deletion” of a person in the system were just too troubling.</p><p>Lastly, the eID described in the original version also isn’t well optimized for the variety of use cases it has in the private sector. Too many limitations and complexities meant it couldn’t be an all-in-one solution for both public and personal use, and other IDs would likely be necessary. This will only stand to limit adoption and frustrate the general public. Nobody wants to use one ID to board a plane and another to make a verified purchase.</p><p>Fortunately, EC listened and has put forward a whole new model called <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281&amp;from=EN">eIDAS 2.0</a>. This is being done to address the failings of the original model and hopefully roll out a system that is safe, functional, and ultimately attractive to private citizens, businesses, and governments alike.</p><p>What To Expect From eIDAS&nbsp;2.0</p><p>eIDAS 2.0 will engage with the points of contention that brought criticism to its predecessor. For starters, this new framework now acknowledges the role of self-sovereign identity (SSI). The benefits of SSI sit with ownership and control of the individuals’ personal information. Additionally, having been based upon decentralized blockchain technology, eIDAS 2.0 is based upon concepts of reusability and interoperability.</p><p>This also brings in the added benefit of curbing the control that big tech companies like Facebook have over user data. Because of some of the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/facebook-data-misuse-and-voter-manipulation-back-in-the-frame-with-latest-cambridge-analytica-leaks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANwD9oHPeAK03BBZ9yYuCXw1IEvzo_AMDnfJb4QO-eYl-lSgMHRnSQrZajYX-QZkxLW2A9ObWuw_Ti1lV1GYZxhJeqFH1vksmcuWeIqPx6N4A3nbNAb3oN8RFV_QC3gLHmdlZ3GLc18Y5YEO45mX5q3Qj5tshPn3qZjbk2vqU6l">issues</a> surrounding how social media platforms handle this information, it is imperative that this new eIDAS system doesn’t hand them, even more, control and instead takes it away. This is especially true as eIDAS 2.0 is designed to incorporate many more types of personal data than any ID ever has&nbsp;before.</p><p>According to the legislation itself, any such ID would have to contain the bare minimum of the following information: name, address, age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality, educational qualifications, titles and licenses, professional qualifications, public permits and licenses, and financial and company&nbsp;data.</p><p>However, the potential use for SSIs goes way beyond these basic elements and can include things like medical history, purchasing, and browsing preferences. With strict measures in place that only allow this data to be accessed when and where the user&nbsp;decides.</p><p>As long as the end-user has final control over the private keys tied to their ID, then this system stands to empower them. This is likely the key to the broader adoption that the EC is looking for in such an eID. We’ve outlined many of the reasons and features that the new eIDAS will encompass, but how will it actually be developed? Well, fortunately, this is where Nuggets comes&nbsp;in!</p><p>How Nuggets Makes It All&nbsp;Work</p><p>Nuggets have already developed a multi-award-winning, verified self-sovereign digital identity and payment platform that can provide a persistent, interoperable, and verified digital identity. This new platform is designed for and compatible with Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and the rising Metaverse. In addition to verified digital identities, Nuggets also offers a personal cloud vault and auditable data.</p><p>This means that anyone using an SSI can demonstrate zero-knowledge proofs or selective disclosure of the minimum amount of data required for proof of identity or access instead of revealing everything and having to leave it behind. Combine this with verifiable credentials that cryptographically prove the validity of any information provided, a win-win situation for users and providers, and create a safer environment all&nbsp;around.</p><p>This stands to be the ubiquitous solution that is being described by the eIDAS 2.0 legislation. Because our platform is transnational, all credentials will be accessible anywhere with an internet connection. There is no need to “reinvent the wheel;” Nuggets already offers everything that the EC is looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>To make this system work, this SSI leverages a variety of technologies to bring to life the ideas outlined for eIDAS 2.0. For example, in order to limit access to data while still delivering verifiable proof of authenticity, Nuggets employs what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs</a>. This technique means that the ID can deliver an unfalsifiable confirmation of a person’s identification or right to access something without revealing the underlying data. ZK Proofs form a major cornerstone of how these IDs will bring full control of private information back to the users without sacrificing security for the platforms they engage&nbsp;with.</p><p>Furthermore, Nuggets leverages biometric data, such as a fingerprint or iris scan, to link these SSIs to the only person whom they represent. This will make it virtually impossible for anyone besides the actual individual to use them. Combining this type of veracity with ZK Proofs is how absolute validation is possible while still obscuring the underlying biometrics from any third&nbsp;party.</p><p>Nuggets packages all of these techniques with other powerful protocols, like W3C verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and the encrypted communication standards of DIDComm. By bringing together all of these features, Nuggets is safe to use as a personal financial wallet. What this also means is that consumers can confirm things like age or prove that they have a sufficient minimum balance to, for example, make a purchase or take out a loan all without ever having to reveal their actual bank account information.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We couldn’t be happier to hear that the European Commission has decided to revamp its outline for a European Digital Identity with eIDAS 2.0. Nuggets has already built a system that meets all of its specifications and even more. The platform is ready to use and easy for consumers to interface with. We fully support the need and possibilities that this new type of identification system can offer and can’t wait to bring verifiable, autonomous services to citizens in the EU and&nbsp;beyond.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/working-european-commissions-eidas-2-0-aligns-perfectly-with-nugget-s-technology-and-vision-996909bf9a36">Working: European Commission’s eIDAS 2.0 Aligns Perfectly with Nugget’s Technology and Vision</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining. Today, we are going to hear now what is next for identity and access management. And we have a guest who really does a lot of research and training and consultancy about specifically identity and access management. Our guest today is Simon Moffatt. He is Founder and Analyst at The Cyber Hut, a leading boutique industry research, analysis, and advisory firm focused on identity, access, and cybersecurity technology.</p>
<p>He has more than 20-year career experience within the identity and access management space, having worked for consultancies, start-ups, and global software vendors. He is a published author and contributor to identity standards as the likes of NIST and the IETF. He’s also fellow of the Chartered Institute of Information Security. His long running research is focused upon next generation authorisation and emerging authentication technologies, as well as having an interest in the history of code breaking, signals intelligence, and cyber warfare operations.</p>
<p>Hello, Simon.</p>
<p>Simon Moffatt: Hi, Oscar. How are we doing? It’s great to be here today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Pretty good. It’s a pleasure talking with you, Simon. So definitely, we want to hear what’s coming in identity and access management. So yeah, let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. And first, we would like to hear a bit more about yourself, especially what was your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, thanks. It’s such a fascinating area, identity. I’ve been fortunate to have been in it for just over 20 years, which is a little bit scary when I say that out loud. But I guess like any technology in any sort of technology trend, 20 years is an absolute lifetime. And there’s been so many changes in actual products that are available, the standards, how technology is used, it seems an absolute world away.</p>
<p>But I started my career back in 2001, working in industry, like most people probably do when they when they start their careers. And I was working for a large insurance company in the UK for three or four years. And I was essentially doing identity by hand. I was creating accounts on RACF mainframe, I was setting up access control profiles, and TSO IDs and job control language stuff, all this crazy stuff on the mainframe. And having to do this by hand, there was no sort of automation involved in account creation and managing permissions and things. And it was quite an eye-opening experience at the age of 20 odd, I guess, you know the starting my career doing all of these, these processes by hand, which were time consuming, really labour intensive, really error prone. And it was a really interesting sort of introduction to identity and management if you like.</p>
<p>And then essentially, from there, I spent a bit of time in consultancy. And then I ended up the vast majority of my career working for software vendors, making software to rid the world of all of those manual processes of having to set up accounts by hand and having to manage permissions and access management and single sign-on and authentication and all that stuff. And really had a good 14, 15 years building software in those landscapes around provisioning systems, governance and compliance, role-based access control, obviously more latterly, on things like authentication and MFA, and zero trust and some of the buzzing words which have become more prolific.</p>
<p>But it’s just been quite an interesting journey to go from doing everything by hand and doing it manually to sort of working on automating that stuff, really. And it’s just been good to see identity now become a really accepted part of the enterprise landscape. I think 20 years ago, for example, it was something which it wasn’t particularly automated, it sat within IT operations, and it was just something organisations had to do.</p>
<p>Whereas I think today, in 2022, identity is so pervasive, and it powers the consumer identity lifecycle, it’s integrating with IoT and privacy and a whole host of other things around defence and cyber warfare and all host of with the different angle’s identity is now taking. So, it’s been a bit of a privilege to being in a sector for so long and seeing all those changes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s quite interesting when you say that doing identity and access management by hand, right? It’s hard to imagine today. It will be crazy if someone does still by hand today. We have now, of course, the standards, we have the software who does that. Yeah, interesting. And also, one of the last things you said is that it started with IT, right? You were an IT manager or IT specialist when you are doing this by hand, but today, actually I think a lot of the identity and access management is not done anymore by IT, correct?</p>
<p>Simon: I think that’s a really, yeah, really good observation. I think when I started, it was definitely within the IT, the infrastructure operations part of the business. And I think, today, even in the B2E, the employee identity infrastructure, it’s very separate, it’s very different. There are their own identity specialists, identity architects, identity leads, maybe even Chief Identity Officers, perhaps in some organisations, but it certainly has its own domain. And I think with that brings responsibilities that there are new and different metrics around what success looks like for identity and access management. And then clearly, then we have this whole brand-new area, or more recent area around, things like consumer identity or the identity for devices too and that’s, I guess, driven these needs to have identity as a separate playing field really, it doesn’t just sit within IT anymore.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So now let’s explore some of the research that you have been involved recently. So, tell us about that, what did you discover.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, I mean, so at The Cyber Hut we work on, on looking at, emerging patterns that are happening in the broader identity and access management space. And it’s a pretty exciting space to be because there are so many new emerging themes, standards, use cases, vendors, solution providers, and there’s so much happening in there. But there’s a couple of interesting topics that we’ve been researching over the last sort of six or seven months or so. And one of them we released a report last year, looking at passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>And I think it’s an interesting topic, because we all hate passwords as end users and as consumers and as employees. But yet we use passwords every day. Every day of our lives, we log into to all of our web services, websites, our employee directories, our laptops, everything is still dominated by passwords and shared secrets. And this age-old way of authenticating. It’s been there since the mid ’70s when computing started its commercial journey. And I think we’ve been desperately trying to move away from passwords ever since, the best part of 50 years, I guess. And we still haven’t quite got there.</p>
<p>We started to look at this space and try to look at some of the vendors, and some of the use cases, and the technology that is now available and really trying to understand, are we really getting close now to being able to rid the infrastructure of passwords in its entirety? And it was a fascinating journey, really. And I think the technology is there today, I think there are numerous different solutions, whether it’s based on sort of biometrics, or perhaps standards, like FIDO and WebAuthn that provide us with the tools and techniques to rid ourselves of passwords.</p>
<p>But clearly, there’s a whole host of other factors involved, be it sort of psychological acceptability, the security angles, the integration angles, and so on. So, it was a fascinating journey. I think we are getting closer to killing the password. But unfortunately, we’ve all probably got stories of how we logged in today using the old way of doing it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, we’re hearing all the time of technology for getting rid of passwords. And yeah, hopefully in the near future, we would really be completely rid of passwords. Another topic I think you were exploring was authorisation, correct? Like, next-generation authorisation, so tell us about that.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, authorisation is a fascinating area. I think, on the authentication side, many organisations, that they do invest heavily in authentication technologies, login processes, and biometrics. And it’s interesting, the authorisation, you know, what happens after the person has logged in often was a little bit neglected. It wasn’t necessarily an area which received lots of investment from the enterprise, the number of start-ups involved. It wasn’t particularly huge. It wasn’t a particularly large market.</p>
<p>Whereas I think move forward to 2022, the authorisation has had a huge sort of re-invention, if you like, if that’s not too bold a word, so certainly a pretty extended evolution. And the authorisation aspects, you know, working out what access an individual has, or if the device, what access a device could potentially have, is now suddenly becoming vitally important whether you are talking about the B2E space and employees and how they perhaps operate in a distributed working environment on the back of things like COVID and a pandemic, right through to the consumer angle where we’re talking about privacy and data security there as well.</p>
<p>But authorisation has certainly had a huge re-investment, if you like, or a re-invention over last sort of 36 months, there are numerous different start-ups involved in here, lots of interesting VC funding. I’m really starting to see this emergence of external authorisation platforms and looking at things like adaptive access, contextual access control, and things like zero trust and identity-centric security is, I guess, driving the need to have a strong authorisation platform where you are handling permissions across on-premises systems, cloud systems, APIs, microservices, there’s a whole host of different assets that need to be protected.</p>
<p>And organisations are now figuring out that actually, if they get authorisation right, it allows them as a business to be more agile, allows them to increase the speed that they can deliver applications and services. And clearly, speed and agility are hugely important for most businesses, so they can essentially get to value and get to their customer bases as quick as possible.</p>
<p>So, I think authorisation, yeah, has certainly become vitally important. There is some interest in emerging patterns there around how you protect microservices, leveraging API protection clearly have things like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, which have been around for quite a while in protecting APIs. But there’s certainly interest in extending that and looking at things like contextual access and more dynamic and adaptive ways of giving access to different assets. And I think that that in itself is suddenly becoming very topical and very important I think for many CISOs and CIOs.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, and when authorisation is not a word that you hear so much, let’s say in marketing, at least. So, you don’t see them so much mentioned, you don’t see so much on the website. But for instance, you mentioned contextual access, what was that you mentioned just? What is that concept, for instance?</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, you’re absolutely right. You know, many people, they don’t think of authorisation as an object. They think of the business problem, which is, how do I get my staff or customers to complete a transaction, or gain access to the things that they need to do their job, or maybe perform a transaction online? So, the authorisation aspects, certainly from a contextual authorisation perspective is not just looking at the people involved, the identities involved, and the resources that they want to access. But it’s also starting to look at other data signals as well. So other pieces of information that could be leveraged to help make an authorisation decision.</p>
<p>So, we’re talking about things like the device characteristics, you know, the laptop and the mobile phone, is there anything from those devices that can be leveraged in the authorisation decision, things like device versions, operating system versions? Does the device have antivirus installed, for example, or what type of locking mechanism does the mobile device have? Or what potential apps have been installed on the device? And all of these little, small pieces of context and signalling essentially has helped the authorisation decision process become a lot richer, a lot more informed and allows that process to be more personalised, and more tailored.</p>
<p>And I think this context aspect is now starting to pull in information from the devices but also things like the environment, things like breach credentials, threat intelligence systems, anything really which can amplify the risk analysis process. And I think, if you can pull in more of that context during the authorisation decision, the authorisation output can be much more fine grained as well. And I think we’re certainly starting to move away from this very black and white allow and deny sort of model which we’ve had for a number of years, where, if something is slightly erroneous, or looks slightly risky, there’s a big block and deny comes down, the big 403, or a big interruption into the user journey.</p>
<p>Whereas I think actually, what we’re starting to see now is much more subtle degradation of the service. You may be allowed access, but some of the service may be removed, or perhaps you’re allowed access, but it’s only read only, or perhaps you are allowed access, but perhaps certain fields of the database have been removed, or certain attributes in a payload have been removed, because perhaps you’re on a public Wi-Fi and that has a high level of risk or something similar.</p>
<p>So, I think we’re certainly starting to see this leveraging more information during the authorisation decision. And then the output of that decision is much more fine-grained and much more personalised, I think. It’s just moving away from blocking access entirely to allowing access but… and it’s just having that “but” in there and allowing more personalised experience, I think, it helps the end users and I think it helps the security posture as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can visualise what you explained definitely also reduces friction because you get logged in with some level of authorisation. And of course, based on the algorithms or the system, it might lead you to a closer level of authorisation that you should have maybe it’s not the perfect, but you are logged in you have some level authorisation, and you can do at least part of your job and hopefully don’t need to contact the IT or whoever is administering that.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, exactly. That’s an interesting point as well, it’s allowing people to continue on their journey. And I think that’s become really important, I think, in both the employee space where, in honesty, a lot of people now are working from home, even though that the pandemic is easing. So, you do things remotely, you do things away from a central office. So, it isn’t easy is it to go and speak to the IT helpdesk, for example.</p>
<p>And certainly, in the consumer space as well. Last thing the consumer or the customer wants to do is have their journey interrupted, and they have to go and ring the help desk of their bank or their insurance company, or their, telephone company or whatever. So, I think it’s allowing journeys to continue but applying the necessary friction at the correct time, under the correct risk conditions. I think that that is certainly a winning combination, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. And what trends are you seeing emerge in identity and access management?</p>
<p>Simon: I think there are numerous actually. I think there’s the fact that we have a wonderful podcasts like this and lots of work and research everybody is doing in the community just amplifies that identity is now sort of pervasive. I think it is now the tentacles of identity and now being sort of placed into huge parts of the enterprise, be it data security, endpoint protection, privacy, consumer identity, employee identity, there’s a whole host of research around identity for IoT and identity for devices.</p>
<p>Now, I was at a conference this week in Paris, actually a defence conference. And there’s a whole host of discussions there around leveraging identity and access management and trust and assurance within this sort of space and defence sectors as well. So, under the whole host of research topics to think about. And you know, we talk about ourselves as consumers, and when we think of consumer and identity and consumer interactions, we’re talking about usability, we’re talking about privacy by design.</p>
<p>And these are quite new concepts really if you think about identity and security and that really occurred to most vendors or certainly most systems to think about the usability and the privacy enablement. It was a case of get the system working. And yes, we may think of security afterwards. But certainly now, things like privacy, enablement and privacy by design are vitally important and an identity is a huge part of how that would operate.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. It seems super interesting that now, it’s yeah, concepts like that are already on their agenda, on their minds of many decision makers, it’s fabulous. And seeing a bit more towards the future, let’s say in the next five years, for instance, how do you see now the identity and access management landscape evolving?</p>
<p>Simon: Oh, it’s a great question, isn’t it? As an analyst, you get asked this sort of question quite a lot around what does the future look like, and which technologies or standards are going to die off and which ones are going to survive and become real? And I think it’s always quite difficult to predict. And I think there are certainly some interesting meta trends, I think, certainly, identity is now hugely important to both the security architecture of the modern enterprise, but also things like usability, privacy, business agility. And then all of the enabling technologies that allow businesses to grow and compete and be agile, and to all the things which allow them to be successful. I think that is quite certainly a different way of looking at identity and identity-based security.</p>
<p>Whereas maybe three or four years ago, it was always leveraging technology to be restrictive and preventing bad things happening and stopping the bad guys from doing so. I think we’re definitely moving towards identity as an enabler for business growth. There’s a whole host of technology areas, I guess, things like decentralised everything, you know, decentralised internet, decentralised identity, and distributed identities. And then I guess, empowering the end user to have more control, essentially, over their identity data, be it things like wallets and ownership of how they share their identity data with governments and third-party services. And we’re certainly starting to see this emergence around decentralised identity perhaps is maybe the next way of handling identity information.</p>
<p>But there are certainly the other interesting areas, I mean, do we need things like Chief Identity Officers in the organisation? Interesting conversation I had a few weeks ago about that, you know, do we need to have a C-level executive who looks after identity? Maybe in three or four years we may see that happening as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Is there any now?</p>
<p>Simon: I’m not aware of any who have that particular label. I think certainly some of the larger enterprises, there are certainly executives who are leading the charge for identity, really looking to transform how identity is measured, how it’s reported into either the CISO or the CIO. I’m not sure they have the title, Chief Identity Officer, but it would be interesting to see how that emerges over the next few years though.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, there might be a top executive with kind of similar, very high-profile role in leading identity, especially as you said, in large organisations, but maybe not the CIO.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, we already have one of those. Yeah, yeah. Agreed.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what are the main challenges that need to be solved in this next, let’s say five years, on relatively midterm?</p>
<p>Simon: I think there’s some interesting, I guess, obstacles, which are starting to emerge. I think the pandemic has accelerated lots of different things, technology trends, investment trends. And there are certainly some meta characteristics that have come out of that process. You know, businesses want to be more agile. They want to be more responsive to change external change from the competition, or threats such as COVID-19 and other things.</p>
<p>So, they need to be agile. And what does that mean? Well, they’re going to be driving towards agile methodologies, maybe containerisation, APIs, microservices, outsourcing everything to cloud systems and subscription-based systems. And that all brings a whole magnitude of challenges from an identity perspective and having visibility of your identity infrastructure across hybrid cloud, containers, legacy systems, on-premises systems and so on.</p>
<p>And I think that being able to identify threat across that identity landscape is becoming more of an issue, because essentially, the identity infrastructure is becoming more complex. So how do you handle permissions across a multitude of different systems? How do you embed identity into IoT devices and privacy enablement systems? It’s hard to do that unless you have that visibility across that quite complex landscape.</p>
<p>So, I think there’s lots to do but I think equally, there are some good opportunities now. I think identity is well-known. It’s seen now as a really important part of many enterprises’ digital journey. So, I think there’s work to do, a lot of challenges ahead, but I think there are the right people, the personnel, the training, and standards available to make identity a vital part of every organisation over the next three to five years.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, we expect that will happen. It looks like it’s going in the right direction as you said.</p>
<p>Simon: I think so. I’m hopeful. I’m positive.</p>
<p>Oscar: Simon, we’re almost leading to the end of this interview, I’d like to ask you one final question for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Simon: Oh, wow, wow, can only have one? I could probably give 10 I guess, which probably doesn’t help people, does it? I think it’s just being aware of identity. I think many organisations certainly, particularly, the large organisations probably have identity projects running and technology in place. But even if you’re a smaller organisation, maybe mid-sized enterprise, looking, thinking about things like data security or endpoint security or privacy controls, it’s thinking that identity really is the foundation for those aspects. And just thinking like, thinking about the identity concept, looking at identifying your identity assets within the organisation be that people, permissioning systems, perhaps where you may identify contexts and how you can respond to contextual changes.</p>
<p>But I think just having an understanding of what your identity landscape looks like, I think is a good starting point, you know, where your authoritative sources of directory information are, which piece of context you may need to use, which assets do you want to protect? And I think that seems quite simple, but I think it’s actually it’s quite important because I think a lot of organisations start with a technology first mindset where actually they may want to start with really identifying their identity landscape. And then working out the problems with their identity landscape before they sort of look at technology selection. So, I think like anything just understand your landscape first and that’s a really good, a good starting point.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think it’s a great takeaway. Yeah, thank you for this super interesting conversation. I definitely enjoy hearing your passion about identity. I can feel it all the time when you when you talk, and you absolutely know a lot about this field and you are researching so thank you for sharing all this.</p>
<p>Finally, for our listeners who like to get in touch with you or learn more about what you’re doing, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, of course, it’s great to be here. I am passionate, it’s certainly it’s an exciting area to be in. And I guess the best place, I’m pretty active on social media, so reach out on LinkedIn, or on Twitter, or go direct to The Cyber Hut website at thecyberhut.com. We’re more than happy to reach out and then respond to any questions, comments or just interesting conversations people want to have around identity, we’re always open to those.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot, Simon. And all the best.</p>
<p>Simon: Thank you, Oscar. Thank you. Take care.</p>

<p>Dock is building a gateway to Web3 by providing simple solutions for businesses and developers to build, manage and present digital Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identities using blockchain. </p><p>Dock provides credentialing technology that can be used to create cryptographically secure and instantly verifiable digital credentials, including workforce certificates, academic achievements, identity documents, and KYC checks. <br></p> Problems With Existing Centralized Credential Systems <p>Identity management has been a major concern since the internet was invented. Centralized identity management has always been vulnerable to threats, cyberattacks, and privacy breaches with a single point of failure. Billions of dollars have been spent providing a private and secure space for digital transactions. </p><p>We also know that large companies and governments control this information on our behalf. This whole control of large organizations sparked the entire movement of decentralization that propelled the applications of decentralized technologies like blockchain. The movement started with financial data and gave its origin to Bitcoin. Now this whole movement is addressing the necessity of decentralizing ownership of every data and we are calling it Web3.</p><p>Web3 is an umbrella term for the next iteration of the internet that is blockchain-based, decentralized, transparent, secure, and provides true ownership of data to its users. This will also enhance the portability and security of our identity documents such as passports, educational certificates, driving licenses, social media resumes, and more. </p><p>This is one side of the problem. There is another side where the data is having no protection from getting forged and the documents produced in various industries are getting forged. Verifying a paper-based or pdf-based certificate/credential in a fast-paced environment like today is often time-consuming and prone to errors. Hence, you can see an interconnected web of problems where the centralized database of these documents is a goldmine for hackers, the documents can be easily forged and pirated for malicious purposes, and adding to this, there is no instant verification infrastructure available. </p><p>Right from our birth, we receive numerous certificates and credentials like birth certificates, driving license, national and taxation IDs, education degrees and transcripts, and medical certificates, to name a few. From an individual to an organization, the potential documents that need to be protected, kept private, and might need authentication verification are uncountable. This is where we need a blockchain-based cryptography-enabled solution that can make any document tamper-proof with instant verification, Verifiable Credentials (VC).</p> Introduction to Web3 and Decentralized Identity<br> <p>The Web3 movement is not only limited to ownership, it is also about how we establish trust. This vast amount of data and information individuals and organizations are generating at a massive scale remains unverified and unauthenticated. Billions of dollars have been spent only to establish 2 fundamental necessities in the ecosystem - Security and Trust. </p><p>Web3 is the next evolution of the World Wide Web that incorporates decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics. </p><p>Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that allows people to generate and control their own digitial identity without depending on a specific service provider. Web3 is about ownership and by using Dock’s technology, individuals can now truly own their most important documents and IDs and regain control over their data. </p><p>A major component of Web3 is blockchain technology. In fact, blockchain technology is the foundation on which Web3 is built since it revolves around decentralization. By building on a blockchain network, transactions are open, decentralized, and secure. Dock’s proof of stake blockchain is built for Web3. </p><p>Web3 is a newly popular term, but we have been working in this space since 2017. The Web3 Foundation recognized our efforts in the space and provided Dock with a grant to help organizations adapt and innovate in the Web3 ecosystem by helping them understand the true ownership of their data and making their documents, certificates, and credentials become digital, tamper-proof, and instantly verifiable. <br></p> What is Dock? <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> is a pioneer in the revolutionary Web3 space. Since 2017, we have been building cutting-edge Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Credentials (VC) technology, which will act as a gateway to Web3 in the future. We have been helping organizations to adapt and innovate in the Web3 ecosystem by helping them understand the true ownership of their data and making their documents, certificates, and credentials become digital, tamper-proof, and instantly verifiable. Web3 is about ownership and by using Dock’s technology, individuals can now truly own their most important documents and regain control over their data.</p><p>Dock has built a decentralized network for issuing credentials and decentralized identifiers. But what does that mean for someone like you and me? Well, in our daily lives we come across questions like these situations:<br></p>  Is the doctor who will treat me at this hospital board certified?  Is there an easier way to provide your necessary personal information for KYC for a bank or financial app?<br>   Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers Explained <p>A digital identity is the body of information about an individual, organization, or electronic device that exists online. Data that form a digital identity includes a user name, password, and online searches. Almost all of our digital identities are connected through devices, apps, and services. </p><p>Up till now, we have only interacted with centralized identity systems and IDs where you create an account to access a service and enter personal information. Then, you either wait to manually authenticate this information or wait for automatic processes that only create your identity but not reliably authenticate it. This may be your educational certificates, customer IDs, employee IDs, business operation credentials, passport, or driving license, and the list is endless. Even your email and social media accounts are also a form of digital ID that you create yourself automatically just by agreeing to the terms and conditions of the platform. However, all the data produced by you using these central identifiers are not completely owned by you and the authentication processes are taxing. </p><p>Decentralized identity systems allow users to gain control, store, and manage their own identities and data. Users decide how and when they share their data and with whom. Instead of being siloed in one place, data is decentralized to each user. </p><p>Users have a digital identity wallet that stores their credentials and documents as Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Verifiable Credentials are cryptographically signed digital documents that can be instantly verified and authenticated based on the identity and trustworthiness of the issuer. Using VCs, you can prove your identity, skills and achievements, and a verifier will always know that the file was not modified or faked.</p><p>This identity wallet can hold verified user identity details such as their name, age, address, education, employment details, and financial information. The possibility to share verified information unlocks new opportunities with financial, employer, legal, and compliance-related use cases.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.dock.io/importance-of-verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credentials here</a>.</p><p>Each issuer and user has a DID, a Decentralized Identifier. A DID is an identifier that belongs to you. It's like an ID, similar to your employer or student ID, and you can have more than one. The big difference is this:oday the university gives you your Student ID. But with the Web3 enabled by Dock you:</p>  Generate the DID for yourself  Fully own and control your DIDsit  Can even create a different DID for every online interaction<br>  <p>The DID is written on the Dock blockchain when you create your DID. For example you can have multiple DIDs for: </p>  Your personal interests like signing in with one DID to play on different gaming websites  Professional purposes where you can use another DID to show educational credentials to employers when applying for a job  Financial reasons where you create a DID to access and use financial services  <p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.dock.io/blockchain-for-decentralized-identity/">Decentralized Identifiers here</a>.<br></p> The Dock Solution <p>We say Web3 will solve the problems related to data ownership, management, and security but nobody is demonstrating how. Web3, the decentralized internet built on the foundation of blockchain and cryptography has the potential to make this data secure, self-owned, and trustworthy. </p><p>This is where Dock is needed and we have built a technology that demonstrates how. We saw this problem and started to address this problem by building cutting-edge technology to ensure the data source can be known using decentralized identifiers and guaranteed (verified) using Verifiable Credentials. We have built a decentralized network for creating, issuing, and managing both Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identifiers on the Dock blockchain.</p><p>Dock’s Verifiable Credential ecosystem has the following 4 participants:<br></p>4 participants of a Verifiable Credential ecosystem<p><br>As the name suggests, the issuer is an entity that has the authority to issue Verifiable Credentials. This could be your college university issuing you a diploma after you finish the course, governmental organizations issuing you a national ID, etc. &nbsp;</p><p>The holder is someone who owns the credential. They store and share the Verifiable Credential from their digital wallet, in our case the Dock Wallet.</p><p>Lastly, the verifier is the one who validates or authenticates the credential. This could be a hiring company you’ve shared your diploma with.</p><p>Watch the video below to hear directly from our CEO, Nick Lambert to learn about the 4 actors of the Dock’s Verifiable Credential ecosystem.</p><p>But how is the identity verified?</p><p>The issuer issues the Verifiable Credential and digitally signs it with a cryptographic key (private key) that only the issuer can use.</p><p>When the verifier receives a credential, they will verify its authenticity through the Dock blockchain, an immutable and decentralized database.<br></p>Architecture of a Verifiable Credential Ecosystem built on Blockchain The Dock Blockchain - Built for Web3 <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/technology">Dock’s Substrate-based blockchain</a> provides an open-source, decentralized, and low-cost platform for organizations and developers to build Decentralized Identity and data applications for the Web3. Substrate is the primary blockchain SDK used by developers to create the parachains that make up the Polkadot network.</p><p>It is fast, interoperable, secure, scalable, and cost-efficient. It forms the basis of trust by maintaining a verifiable registry of all Dock-issued DIDs as well as additional functionality supporting Verifiable Credentials. Its architecture prevents the unauthorized modification of any data that is associated with a DID and the use of cryptography ensures that Verifiable Credentials are not tampered or forged. </p><p>Everyone using Web3 will need their own Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The Dock blockchain serves as the entry point with a protocol layer for all things Web3. Our blockchain-based credentialing system adheres to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C standards</a>. W3C is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work to set international standards for the World Wide Web. They created standards for URL, decentralized identifiers, and others. </p>Features of the Dock blockchain&nbsp; The Nominated Proof of Stake Consensus <p>Dock runs its own <a href="https://www.dock.io/validators">validator</a> network and our blockchain is built on Substrate (which is the same framework used throughout the Polkadot ecosystem). It uses the consensus mechanism offered by Substrate, which is a hybrid as it separates block production and finality and achieves them through different methods. The blockchain has the same consensus and governance mechanism as Polkadot.</p><p>In simple terms, nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) is the process of selecting validators to be allowed to participate in the consensus protocol. NPoS is a Proof-of-Stake variant that is used in Substrate-based Blockchains like Dock, Kusama, Edgeware, and Polkadot.</p><p>Nominated Proof of Stake has two entities in its space, the Nominators and the Validators. Nominators select validators they would like to process transactions, produce blocks, and validate transactions. They do so by staking Dock tokens. Validators process transactions, produce blocks (by putting transactions in blocks) and finalize them. They also validate blocks produced by other validators.</p><p><a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance">Learn more about governance on the Dock blockchain here.</a></p> Consensus and Framework <p>Dock uses the consensus mechanism offered by Substrate. The finality is achieved through a finality gadget called GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement). It finalizes chains rather than individual blocks and offers provable finality.</p><p>When Dock transitioned into utilizing PoS, the block production algorithm changed from Aura to BABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension protocol) which selects a validator for each slot (interval of time) randomly using a VRF (Verifiable Random Function).</p> Dock Staking <p>There are 50 validators running the Dock blockchain at any given time. We are glad that Binance joined this group back in January 2022, which also includes highly regarded staking companies like Everstake, Stakin, Ryabina, My Container and others. All Dock token holders can participate in staking to earn rewards in the form of Dock tokens. <br></p> Dock Product Suite <p>Dock’s products are already capable of serving the largest organizations to instantly issue Verifiable Credentials and create decentralized identifiers on their own blockchain. We provide all of the necessary products for individuals and organizations to hold and manage these DIDs and Verifiable Credentials on a secure wallet app and verify these credentials.</p><p>Certs</p><p>We provide both ready-made and customizable VC and DID opportunities for companies and developers. Users can opt for whichever seems most convenient. Organizations that want to issue Verifiable Credentials without writing a line of code can simply use <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?utm_source=coinotag&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=guide">Dock Certs</a>. </p><p>Users can sign up for Dock Certs in a few clicks and start creating their Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. After the creation of the credential, organizations can send it to the user as a link in an email, a PDF or a JSON file. The JSON file can be saved in the user's digital identity wallet. Cryptography is used to ensure that the credentials were not modified since they were issued.</p><p>Certs API</p><p>Certs is available in both no-code and API versions. Dock offers developer-friendly APIs to easily and instantly issue, verify, manage, and revoke Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers on the Dock blockchain.</p><p>Wallet SDK</p><p>Using Dock Wallet SDK, developers can build a Verifiable Credentials wallet inside their own app and allow their users to store, receive, and manage their credentials as well as DOCK tokens. </p><p>Dock Wallet App</p><p>Individuals can store and manage these DIDs and Verifiable Credentials in a secure <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock wallet app</a>. With the Dock Wallet, you can now store your digital Verifiable Credentials and truly own your professional and educational achievements. </p><blockquote>All your data will not be stored on the Dock Blockchain. You will have complete control on your credentials via your personal app. <br></blockquote><p>This wallet can also be used to store, send, receive, and buy DOCK tokens.</p> Dock Partners and Clients <p>Currently, we are working with Seven Mile, an Australian-based organization that is using Dock Certs to issue educational qualification certificates to the students who are completing courses with their platform. </p><p>Winners of the prestigious Odyssey Momentum Hackathon, overhd has utilised our open-source software to implement and host a permissioned blockchain as well as leveraged Dock’s features of creating VCs and DIDs. </p><p>Dock has also advised Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, a German development agency commissioned by German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Dock assisted them with the technical architecture and features for a professional profile data wallet linked to atingi, a digital learning platform built by GIZ.</p><p>We have also announced several partnerships including Credenxia, an Australian workforce training company, and Xertify who is working on several pilots for COVID vaccine credentials in Mexico and Columbia. We are working with additional partners that will be announced later.</p> Dock Use Cases <p>Use cases for adopting Dock’s technology include healthcare, education, supply chain, finance, compliance, NFTs, DeFi, and many more sectors that rely heavily on credential data.</p><p>Let’s take the example of <a href="https://blog.dock.io/nfts-and-verifiable-credentials/?utm_source=coinotag&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=guide">NFT marketplaces</a>. Fraud is rampant both within and outside of the blockchain space, and NFTs are no exception with scammers setting up fake accounts and selling fake NFTs. A Verifiable Credential can be used to verify the identity of all parties involved in creating, buying, and selling NFTs, to ensure the reputation and authenticity of everyone involved without divulging private information. For example, an NFT creator could share a verifiable Credential that demonstrates a history of creating legitimate NFTs, or a seller can have a Verifiable Credential that shows a reputation score based on their previous NFT sales. And they can do this while remaining anonymous!</p><p>Here are some other examples of our use cases:<br></p>  Healthcare: &nbsp;Dock is working with a healthcare technology company that has created an ecosystem of credential issuers, employers, and individuals. We provide a platform to streamline credential issuing, verification and monitoring. With the use of Verifiable Credentials and blockchain, their product enables issuers to create digital Verifiable Credentials and a mobile app for individuals to store, share, and instantly verify in real-time. Learn more <a href="https://www.dock.io/case-study-healthcare">here</a>.<br>  Supply chain: &nbsp;Dock’s core technology can help businesses and government authorities ensure a legal and compliant supply chain with genuine goods and materials in addition to timely, reliable deliveries.

The end results are huge savings in administrative costs and increased trust in the talent pool.<br>  Financial Services: &nbsp;Identification and compliance practices are extremely important in providing financial services. Dock provides the technology to solve these verification challenges in the financial industry. Using Certs, Verifiable Credentials can be issued to provide a spectrum of financial and identity information that individuals and companies can present in order to unlock access to services.

It is also going to be largely about data ownership. Web2 uses centralized identifiers like social media accounts and email addresses to access websites and apps while a Web3 ID will enable you to surf, transact, or share your data securely on a decentralized internet while fully owning and controlling your digital identity. <br></p><p>This Web3 ID:</p>  Will carry your credentials, IDs, your reputation, and the linked data in a decentralized digital wallet  Opens multiple use cases in DeFi and NFT marketplacesEnables the ability to prove/verify transactions and ownership of assets without revealing wallet address or the entire history of transactions<br>  <p>Dock already has all of the &nbsp;technology and tools to support functionality for decentralized identities. Adding the support of Verifiable Credentials is a powerful and secure way to add trust and authenticity to every credential, document, or a certificate used in Web3 while ensuring the privacy of everyone participating.</p>

We should own and control our identity and&nbsp;data.<p>What is your identity? It’s the ability to represent to the world who you are. That can cover everything from what you wear to who you associate with to what country you are from. Your identity is a collection of attributes that describe&nbsp;you.</p><p>In practice, proving your identity is also the key to unlocking your social and economic potential — physically and digitally. Society has always been built on trust, and sometimes, we need to know who we’re dealing&nbsp;with.</p><p>As such, your identity is core to who you are and what you’re able to do, whether that’s buying something online, opening a bank account, or starting a business.</p><p>The problem is that the way we deal with identity hasn’t caught up to the modern&nbsp;world.</p><p>Part of the reason is that our most credible forms of identifying documents like driver’s licenses and passports still live in the analog world. The pandemic further shone a light on those limitations with places like the U.S. still reliant on paper vaccination cards, which are inefficient, difficult to verify, and easy to counterfeit.</p><p>One of the issues with analog identifying documents is that not everyone has them. The reality is that our current system <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/">excludes 1.7 billion people from basic financial services</a>, many of whom lack traditional forms of identity. For instance, migrant workers may not even have a home&nbsp;address.</p><p>Things aren’t much better in today’s digital world, where an abundance of online accounts means that our identity and personal data are scattered across servers vulnerable to attack. Outside of just giving away your email and phone number or accepting tracking cookies on your browser, some services collect more official forms of identity. Have you ever had to send a picture of your driver’s license or insert your passport number when buying something online?</p><p>The result? In just the first half of 2019, <a href="https://pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/2019-midyear-data-breach-quickview-report">an astounding 4.1 billion records were compromised</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, we don’t own the digital identities we create. The Facebooks and Googles of the world do and profit mightily from our data. And because they own our data on their proprietary platforms, we can’t easily bring our identity and data with us if we decide to go somewhere else. The reputation you created on Facebook Marketplace as a long time seller is stuck on Facebook. If you ever decide to sell on Ebay, you’re starting from&nbsp;zero.</p><p>The fragmentation of your digital identity extends well beyond popular websites. A pillar of the United States traditional financial system is the credit score — a system entirely predicated on centralized digital identity that you have no control over. Anyone who’s moved to the U.S. from abroad understands the challenge of trying to get a mortgage or even open a bank account — even if you had great credit in your home&nbsp;country.</p><p>Do you want to know the worst part? The digital identities described above aren’t even that credible in the first place. Most social media platforms are more concerned with expanding their user base than verifying accounts are owned by real people, contributing to society’s growing trust&nbsp;deficit.</p><p>What we need is a human-centric approach to digital identity, one that is easier, safer, and cheaper than the one we have&nbsp;today.</p><p>We need a digital identity that works for people and organizations alike.</p><p>Your digital identity should&nbsp;be:</p>  Self-sovereign. We should own and control our identity and data. Further, we should be able to decide who we share our data&nbsp;with.  Private, secure and encrypted. Our data should be private and safe, always. You should be confident that only you have access to the information you create, save, and share. Third party entities and bad actors should never have the opportunity to see your information in the first&nbsp;place.  Interoperable and portable. Our identities should be premised on globally accepted standards just like the internet is built on interoperable protocols that power the web and email. They shouldn’t be locked into proprietary, closed ecosystems dictated by corporations or governments. Moreover, we should be able to bring our identity with us to whatever platform we choose. Remember when your cell phone number was locked into your mobile service provider? Today, our phone numbers are portable. You can bring your phone number with you no matter what provider you choose. The same will be the case for our digital identities.  Built on verifiable credentials. You should be able to verify your identity once, receive a machine-verifiable credential, and reuse that credential many times over. This means you won’t have to redundantly verify your identity and re-share your data each time you interact with a new business or service. The best part is that those services never need to see your personal information to know it is true. That way, businesses can trust that you are who you say you are, and don’t need to store and manage your personal data on their servers. Less servers holding your data means a more secure identity.  Usable. What good is a fancy digital identity if it is impossible to use in your daily life? Digital identity and the associated credentials are going to take years to be adopted by 100% of establishments. That’s why it is crucial to make safer digital identity useful in the contexts we are living in today. That might mean making it easier to store and share a picture of your ID card. Tomorrow it could mean applying for a bank account. Next year, it might mean doing your taxes. Human-centric digital identity must meet the moment, wherever it may&nbsp;be.  Inclusive. Identity is a human right. Anyone, anywhere should be able to create one. Notably, your identity should grant you access to basic services such as banking and payments.  <p>It’s clear that the way we handle our identities today is broken. What’s incredibly exciting is that a convergence of developments across fintech, regtech, and web3 now enable a smarter, better, and more inclusive framework.</p><p>Human-centric digital identity is the key to a future that works for us, allowing us to set new standards for how we deal with issues like financial inclusion, communication and censorship, and even the integrity of our democratic elections.</p><p>Our identities are the building blocks for a modern society and economy. We owe it to ourselves and each other to get this&nbsp;right.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about how digital identity can work for you and stay up to date with the latest updates, sign up for the monthly <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">GlobaliD Insider newsletter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">GlobaliD 101: How digital identity should work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Revised July 1, 2022</p>
<p>This week, Freddie Mac announced the latest Loan Product Advisor® (LPASM) enhancement that includes on-time rent payments as part of the company’s purchase determinations.</p>
<p>Mastercard, a designated third-party service provider for Freddie Mac, is excited to provide two reports for lenders that include rent payment history.</p>
<p>Our<a href="https://www.finicity.com/demo/"> Mortgage Verification Services (MVS)</a> product provides the consumer-permissioned data necessary for LPA’s rent payment history credit assessment with no setup required for the lender. If you’re already using an MVS asset report, you will automatically send the data necessary for a rent assessment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html">Mastercard’</a>s open banking platform (provided by Mastercard’s wholly-owned subsidiary,<a href="https://www.finicity.com/"> Finicity</a>), is a designated service provider that offers a digital, single-vendor solution for assets, income and employment through both<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/"> Freddie Mac</a> and<a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/"> Fannie Mae</a>. By automating the asset and income assessment process, we can also provide transaction data for rent payment history, direct deposits and 10-day pre-closing reports for employment verification. These solutions help to streamline lenders’ loan approval process and increase homeownership opportunities to qualified borrowers.</p>
 Rent Payment History in Lender Credit Decisioning 
<p>By virtue of sheer numbers, millennials are defining the trends of today’s housing market. The age group now accounts for 43% of all homebuyers so far in 2022, according to a new report by the<a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf"> National Association of Realtors</a>. With approximately one-third of this demographic<a href="https://risk.lexisnexis.com/insights-resources/article/credit-invisibles#:~:text=Denying%20Credit%20for%20Millennials,millennial%20consumers%20are%20credit%20invisible."> being credit invisible</a>, there’s an opportunity to incorporate additional data sources to help establish creditworthiness and the ability to repay the loan. The integration of rent payment history into the mortgage lending process can be helpful to first-time homebuyers who have a strong track record of on-time rent payments, creating a new path to homeownership while still promoting safe lending.</p>
<p>In addition to this week’s announcement from Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae has included rent payments in their automated mortgage credit decisioning process in Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) since September 18, 2021. Fannie Mae identified recurring rent payments in bank statements and transaction data as a factor which could deliver a more inclusive credit assessment.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae said 17% of applicants who have not owned a home in the last three years and who did not receive a favorable mortgage recommendation could have instead received an “approved” or “eligible” recommendation if their rental payment history had been considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To take advantage of the rent payment history feature, Mastercard provides a Verification of Asset and Income (VOAI) and a Verification of Assets (VOA) report through its Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) that includes 12 or 24 months of transaction data that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae can use to identify rent payment history that may provide a more favorable credit assessment.</p>
<p>If they are using the VOA report, lenders have the freedom to access either two or 12 months of data to satisfy their own underwriting requirements. The reports can be called with a direct API or are available currently in ICE Encompass and Encompass Consumer Connect, as well as the SimpleNexus mortgage point-of-sale (POS) platform.&nbsp;</p>
 Integrated with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae Systems 
<p>Mastercard is a service provider for Freddie Mac’s automated underwriting system, LPA, which automates the assessment of borrower assets, income and employment using LPA asset and income modeler (AIM). By leveraging the expertise of service providers, AIM helps to deliver a simpler, more efficient loan origination process.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae’s DU validation service also accepts our mortgage verification services to independently validate borrower assets, income, and employment data—providing Day 1 Certainty® on validated loan components. By digitally validating secure third-party data through DU, you can help eliminate the paper chase and help get your borrowers approved quicker.</p>

 Rennes and Munich, July 5, 2022: IDnow Group, a European leader in identity proofing and digital identity, appoints Jean-Marc Guyot as Vice President of R&amp;D (Research and Development) at IDnow group. His main responsibility will be the further unification and development of one joint platform for the European market.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Jean-Marc Guyot’s appointment will engage a new dynamic in the R&amp;D department, with the aim of&nbsp;driving best in class engineering teams and meeting the group’s ambitions of leading the way in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His responsibilities will include: uniting the IDnow and ARIADNEXT engineering teams, located across several countries of the world, into a cohesive entity; orchestrating technological choices and orientations and defining architectures to meet the product teams’ requirements, including automatic, video and signature solutions; streamlining and combining all the Group’s existing and future verification solutions to optimise the new IDnow platform.</p>



<p>“I’m looking forward to building a high-performing engineering department at IDnow. The former IDnow and ARIADNEXT teams both have valuable benefits and skills and my job will be to bring this together into one platform that answers the needs of European companies across jurisdictions and use cases,” explained Jean-Marc Guyot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m especially excited to work with the teams in France and Germany and to meet the high standards in technology that are key for the IDnow Group,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jean-Marc Guyot started his career in 1995 as a system architect at LSI Logic, where he worked on the first Digital Terrestrial TV digital demodulation chip. He then joined NXP as Product Marketing Director.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2004 he founded Silembia, a high-tech startup, that he then sold to Silicon Laboratories (an American semiconductor company) and moved to the USA to manage the merger of the teams. Back in France in 2014, he joined ENENSYS to create the Telecom Business Unit with a focus on LTE Broadcast technology. There, he actively participated in the 3GPP SA4 standardisation committee. Early in 2019, he became Vice President of Engineering for Cloud-Based Security Services at WALLIX, before taking over the entire R&amp;D department. He created the R&amp;D site in Rennes which now employs more than 40 people and also re-sited the company in the future CyberPlace beacon building in Rennes. Finally, he and his teams won the “Grand Défi Cyber” with the OSCAR project and implemented the transformation of the R&amp;D teams into agile mode.</p>



<p>“Jean-Marc brings a wealth of technology and international leadership experience into his role. His arrival at IDnow will further accelerate the development of IDnow’s Identity proofing platform, starting with combining the best-in-class technology stack from all IDnow group companies. I’m looking forward to working with him,” commented Vikas Seth, IDnow Chief Product Officer.</p>

What a day! <a href="https://t.co/CVZsHOjBeL">pic.twitter.com/CVZsHOjBeL</a></p>— Kai (@Kai_dentity) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kai_dentity/status/1534543537680830464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>From 2021 until 2024, the German ministry of economics and climate action is funding four projects for “Secure Digital Identities”, each in a different part of Germany and executed by a consortium of different partners, stemming, respectively, from community administrations, industry sectors, tech providers, research institutions and use specific implementation partners. The four consortia are called ONCE, ID-Ideal, SDIKA and ID-Union.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ONCE consortium is one of the most ambitious of these four projects – led by the Bundesdruckerei they have the ambitious plan to be the first of the four SDI projects to wrap, by late summer of 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, with one year left and the pandemic-situation finally permitting to meet in person, it was time for an interim project meeting of the #ONCE2022 consortium. Altogether 65 participants gathered in Willingen from 8th – 9th June to discuss project milestones, next steps, and new developments. After multiple attempts and postponements, it was the first in-person meeting of the whole project team since the beginning of the implementation phase. As representatives from Jolocom, Kai Wagner and Ben Biedermann attended and presented our work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this get-together it was satisfying to see the progress made in the different work packages. From implementing first prototypes in the field of electronic identity (eID) or mobile driving license (mDL), to creating student ID’s, communal and resident credentials, as well as credentials for the tourism and hospitality industry: the past year has been a productive one. Aside from updating each other on our individual progress, in collaborative brainstorming sessions we also put our physical presence to effective use. One session was focussed on improving our future users’ journey by applying innovative approaches from different digital industries to the problems we tackle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Jolocom SmartWallet is the wallet of choice for all ONCE compliant use cases, but also in the broader SDI (Secure Digital Identity) ecosystem, with <a href="https://id-ideal.de/">ID-Ideal</a> and <a href="https://www.sdika.de/">SDIKA</a> using it as well. We saw six demonstrators for eID, mDL, and SSI credentials of all sorts from different partners. Furthermore, the Jolocom Agent is becoming increasingly popular among project partners as an efficient prototyping and implementation tool, be it as API or application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SSI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SSI</a> architectures don't change? Look closely. Iterations matter. We received good feedback when <a href="https://twitter.com/GETJolocom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GETJolocom</a> presented a perspective on the <a href="https://twitter.com/SDIKA_de?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SDIKA_de</a> solution at the <a href="https://twitter.com/once_identity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@once_identity</a> meet-up in Willingen earlier this month. <a href="https://t.co/CmtmnqZrYa">pic.twitter.com/CmtmnqZrYa</a></p>— Ben Biedermann (@ben_criticus) <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_criticus/status/1539541741585551371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>In Willingen, Jolocom was able to engage in and facilitate several technological discussions. Working together on the spot helped us generate new momentum and ideas for the upcoming months, where we are planning to move many of the use cases into pilots in our partner cities. We also engaged in fruitful conversations with representatives from ID-Ideal and SDIKA on issues pertaining to interoperability across the SDI ecosystem. These issues have previously been fostered by the Begleitforschung and are now picking up speed in bilateral projects and discussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All workshops benefitted from the constructive attitude of the participants. The event highlighted the&nbsp; productive and well-natured relationships that have been established in this consortium. State of the art conference rooms and facilities added to the friendly and inspiring atmosphere. On a personal level, our hike to the ski resorts of the region was a fantastic opportunity and reminder to connect beyond tiles on a screen and reconfirmed the importance of personal connections for developing safe digital identities.&nbsp;</p>

As a W3C member organization, we are thrilled by this excellent outcome, and will celebrate it by sharing our favorite ideas about the next evolutions of DIDs that will make them more secure, composable, and friendly to implementers.</p>DIDs 101<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> is a URI that resolves to a JSON object called a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID document</a>, which describes how to authenticate as the DID’s controller for different purposes. When a service knows that it’s talking to the controller, it can use this fact as the consistent anchor point to construct a decentralized identity, enriching the session with related data referring to the DID such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials (VCs)</a> or any associated information found on a public blockchain.</p><p>Where do DID documents come from? Each DID specifies a “DID method” that describes an exact resolution procedure (among other actions) to interpret the DID’s “method specific identifier” and ultimately produce a DID document.</p>DID Documents 101<p>DID methods can retrieve data from a variety of sources: TLS-protected websites, public blockchains, or solely from the method-specific identifier itself. Over the past several years, dozens of different DID methods have emerged in practice, with proponents enthusiastic at how powerful and flexible DIDs can be to bridge disparate trust systems (e.g., Ethereum, GPG, and X.509), and detractors declaring an impending interoperability nightmare, with plenty of headaches for implementers. </p><p>However, there is a way we can prevent this impending interop nightmare!</p><p>Enter DID method traits: testable properties about DID methods that can help implementers tame complexity and choose the right DID method(s) for their use case. They can be used as requirements revealing which DID methods could satisfy the relevant constraints presented across different use cases. </p><p>For example, requirements to support certain operations for the NIST Curve P-256, NIST-proposed Curve Ed25519, bitcoin Curve secp256k1 could all be expressed as different DID method traits complete with test suites. Also expressible as DID traits is the guarantee that a DID method is “purely generative,” requiring no storage lookups as in the case of did-key and did-pkh, as opposed to those actively querying a network such as did-web, did-ens, and did-ion.</p><p>Finally, there may exist a DID method trait that ensures composability across different DID methods: that one DID may serve as the authentication method for another DID, such as <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">did-pkh</a> for <a href="https://medium.com/uport/ens-names-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids-724f0c317e4b">did-ens</a> or <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">did-ion</a>.</p><p>This means that a user can start with an Ethereum account represented as did-pkh, then “upgrade” to a DID method that supports key rotation such as did-ens or did-ion. This helps create a great user experience when using DIDs, as with this approach, users do not need to set up a new decentralized public key infrastructure just to get started.<br></p><p>Instead, they can start with whatever key-based accounts they have, leverage the corresponding DID methods, and graft their existing identifier to a more featureful DID method supporting this kind of composability whenever needed.</p><p>Previous work has been done on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/">DID method rubric</a>, which evaluates criteria as wide-ranging as underlying network decentralization, adoption metrics, and regulatory compliance. DID method traits may exist as a subset of possible criteria in the DID method rubric, or as a parallel spec used in conjunction.</p><p>I will be writing a paper on DID method traits as my submission to the forthcoming Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT) conference in The Hague.

			  Ivie Satijn is Marketing &amp; Business Development Intern at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Ivie (pronounced “eevee”). I was born in the Netherlands, where I have spent my childhood, teenage years, and where I studied for my Bachelor’s Degree. I consider myself a lucky kid because my mother has shown me all the beautiful natural areas in the south of the Netherlands, and my father brought me on many trips all over the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After finishing high school, I went to South Korea to volunteer and when I returned, I began studying at University College Maastricht. Soon after starting this degree, I noticed that I was not happy. I needed a study program that was more practice-oriented; therefore, I decided to switch to International Business. This was a good choice because I really enjoyed learning about business and languages, and I had the chance to spend a semester in Colombia and another in Mexico. Also, I was able to have a side job as a sports instructor, which was a lot of fun!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last September, I moved to Luxembourg and started my Master’s Degree in Entrepreneurship and Innovation. I really like the city, and I feel that it gives me plenty of opportunities to start a career or launch my own business.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Two years ago, I coincidentally discovered an online course on bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I did not know anything about blockchain, so I decided to start it. Almost immediately, I realized that I was very interested in the topic and I continued learning. Step by step, my enthusiasm for web3 grew and when I started to plan my internship, I set the goal to land a position at a blockchain startup. I am very grateful that Tokeny offered me to work with them.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Interactive, high-paced, innovative, and nicely challenging. I am truly having an amazing time. As an intern, I am given many responsibilities and the Tokeny team is actively working on making my learning journey as valuable as possible. Also, even though we are working remotely, I feel like there is a very friendly atmosphere in the team. In Dutch, I would describe it as very “<a href="https://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/155-gezellig">gezellig</a>”.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To live somewhere surrounded by loads of nature and animals.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Accept the fact that you will feel thrown into the deep in the beginning. If you are open to learning, you will quickly catch up with the work style and the terminology. From then on, the fun can start!</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Personally, I am particularly looking forward to the point when ONCHAINID will become the identity standard for web3 activities, and I therefore never have to worry about losing my digital assets anymore.</p>

<p>Due to its immutability and censorship resistance, the Blockchain seems to be a suitable place to manage identities and credentials. However, querying the data on the blockchain in a trusted and efficient way is one of the most challenging issues every Web3 developer has to face while developing a DApp. Therefore, this article describes a simple approach to revoke verifiable credentials and a decentralized and efficient way to index and query those revoked credentials using the <a href="https://thegraph.com/en/">Graph protocol</a>.</p><p>We consider the knowledge of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and rudimentary knowledge of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver/blob/master/doc/did-method-spec.md">Ethr DID method</a> as a requirement for understanding this&nbsp;article.</p> Ethr DID and Credentials <p>The Ethr DID method uses Ethereum addresses as identifiers. By default, the DID of the issuer/subject does not require an on-chain registration and it is constructed from the Ethereum address and controlled by its private key. This feature minimizes the effort of integrating Identities in many on-chain use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>When an off-chain verifiable credential is created, the issuer entity must set the “issuer” property to its Ethr DID and the “credentialSubject.id” property to the Ethr DID of the subject.&nbsp;Example:</p> "verifiableCredential": {<br>    "@context": [..],<br>    "issuer": {<br>      "id": "did:ethr:0xf1232f840f3ad7d23fcdaa84d6c66dac24efb198"<br>    },<br>    "issuanceDate": "2022-07-2T12:00:00.000Z",<br>    "credentialSubject": {<br>      "id": "did:ethr:0x435df3eda57154cf8cf7926079881f2912f54db4",<br>      "degree": "Bachelor Of Arts"<br>    },<br>    "proof": { ... }<br>  } <p>After that as usual the issued credential will be used by the subject to generate a verifiable presentation. The verifier will verify the presentation and accept or reject it depending on its business&nbsp;logic.</p> Credential Revocation <p>Verifiable Credentials are similar to certificates, some of them have an expiration date and some don’t. However, in both cases, the issuer and the subject must be able to revoke them. To enable this critical requirement, we need a tamper-proof revocation data registry that is always available and cannot be censored by any of the mentioned parties. This can be achieved using the Blockchain. Such a registry can be implemented as a simple smart contract that stores a reference of the credential and a reference of the entity who revoked&nbsp;it.</p><p>The revocation process:</p>  Get the hash value of the issued verifiable credential using the keccak256 hash function after converting the credentials to bytes. This value will be used as the on-chain reference to the credential  Send a transaction to the revocation smart contract to call the revoke method revoke(bytes32 digest)giving the extracted hash value as&nbsp;input  The entity that revoked the credential is the address of the invoker and it can be matched with the issuer or subject of the credential based on their&nbsp;DIDs  <p>The additional important key that will help use indexing those revocations is that when a credential is revoked, the revocation smart contract triggers an event that includes the keccak256 hash of that credential and the address of the entity that revoked&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the Github <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/vc-revocation-graph">Repository</a>, we prepared a simple project&nbsp;that:</p>  Deploys a revocation smart contract that stores references to the credential and the entity that revoked&nbsp;it.  Uses the did-jwt-vc and ethr-did libraries to issue 3 off-chain verifiable credentials by 3 different issuers and revoke them&nbsp;on-chain  <p>Please check the&nbsp;./ssi-contracts folder and follow the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/vc-revocation-graph/tree/main/ssi-contracts">README</a> file. After following the steps you should have the address of the revocation registry smart contract deployed on the Goerli network. The 3 revoked transactions can be found on <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> using the address of the deployed contract.</p><p>Why do we need to index the revoked Credentials?</p><p>In a verification scenario, the verifier gets a verifiable presentation that includes 1 to n verifiable credentials from the subject. In addition to the normal validation process of the credentials, the verifier must also check the on-chain status of the credential at any time easily and efficiently. To do that the verifier could request the status of each credential by calling the methodrevoked(address issuer, bytes32 digest) in the revocation registry contract. However, this approach of getting the information is limited, costly, and not efficient for many reasons, some of which&nbsp;are:</p>  It requires knowledge of the Blockchain and Web3 technology  It is slow and limited because of the latency, number of requests, node capability  It requires running a blockchain node or relaying on a node&nbsp;provider  Duplicate requests for the same credentials are sent over and over&nbsp;again  It requires the verifier to be online all the&nbsp;time  <p>And this is when indexing comes into play to provide an easy, fast and simple way to iterate and query data. Indexing is especially needed in the Blockchain area where its underlying design makes it difficult to search for relevant&nbsp;data.</p><p>But How can we index the Blockchain?</p><p>One approach is iterating all transactions and checking if the transaction interacts with our revocation contract. This method is very slow and resource-intensive. The other approach which is used by most developers is to subscribe to events that are triggered by the target contract. This method is much easier, supported by tools and libraries like web3js, and is more resource-saving. Now we come to the second important question of who should do the indexing? There are some possible&nbsp;answers:</p><p>1. The verifier himself. But it is not a good solution because each verifier needs to build up and maintain its own logic and infrastructure. Furthermore, the server of the verifier that is responsible for the indexing is a Single-point-of-failure</p><p>2. External ingestion service that indexes the data on behalf of the verifier. Such a service could be very useful. However, it creates one of the most critical issues which is the lack of TRUST. Verifiers need to trust the ingestion service and relying on it eliminates the advantage of using the Blockchain</p><p>3. Decentralized indexing protocol like The Graph protocol, which enables decentralized applications to query complex data from the blockchain without having to develop and operate proprietary indexing servers or use a centralized service provider. This is the preferred solution in most use cases&nbsp;because:</p>  It is distributed and decentralized. Therefore it removes the Single-point-of-failure and the missing trust&nbsp;issue  It does not require advanced Web3 knowledge. Developers use only GraphQL requests to query the data from already implemented and indexed Subgraphs  The technology behind it has been designed specifically for the Blockchain. Therefore, it is quick and easy to query and&nbsp;filter  Cost-efficient because indexers are competing with each other to provide the best service for the lowest&nbsp;price  Can be used by many verifiers around the world with minimal latency because the nodes are distributed and&nbsp;public  <p>The creators of the Graph protocol recognized the indexing and querying problem at the end of 2017 and started working to solve it by defining and implementing a decentralized indexing protocol. The <a href="https://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/introduction/">introduction page</a> of the Graph protocol offers detailed information about the protocol and you can also join the free and very useful courses provided by <a href="https://thegraph.academy/courses/">The Graph&nbsp;Academy</a>.</p><p>Develop and Deploy a Revocation Subgraph</p><p>A Subgraph defines which data should be indexed from a blockchain, and how it should be stored. In our simple example, the core data the verifier requires is the hash of the credential and who revoked it. To make things easier for verifiers we could also add the timestamp and block&nbsp;number.</p><p>To keep the article simple we will deploy the subgraph on a <a href="https://thegraph.com/docs/en/hosted-service/what-is-hosted-service/">hosted service</a>. Hosted service can be seen today as a good and easy place to start with the development of Subgraphs because it is free to use and reduces the deployment and testing complexity of Subgraphs. Developers can at any time migrate their Subgraphs to the decentralized network.</p><p>The following steps to develop and deploy the Subgraph are described in detail with all the related files in this <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/vc-revocation-graph/tree/main/credential-revocation-subgraph-files">repository</a>&nbsp;:</p>  First, initialize a new sample project using the <a href="https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli">graph&nbsp;cli</a>  Then modify some of the configurations like adding a startBlock and checking the address of the&nbsp;contract  After that comes the main part of the development which is to define the entities and implement the handle method that will be executed when an event is emitted by a smart&nbsp;contract  In the end, build the project and deploy it on the hosted service using the graph cli and an access&nbsp;token  <p>When the Subgraph is deployed and synchronized we can query the indexed data using simple GraphQL requests.</p><p>Example: open https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/&lt;github-name&gt;/credential-revocation-graph in browser and run the following query to get the hashes of all credentials that are revoked by Issuer-A from&nbsp;./ssi-contracts</p>Query revoked credentials by an&nbsp;issuer<p>The results should contain only a single revoked credential unless you modified the scripts inside&nbsp;./ssi-contract or used an already existing contract for this query. You can also compare the results with the logged data of the executed script in./ssi-contract</p> Summary <p>In this article, we described one of many approaches on how to revoke issued credentials. This outlined approach benefits from the Ethr DID characteristic and it depends on the Blockchain as an immutable registry accessible for all parties. We also talked about the likely best way to index and query revoked credentials without relying on centralized services. And at the end, we showed how to develop a simple Subgraph that could run on the Graph protocol decentralized indexing <a href="https://thegraph.com/explorer/">network</a> and index the required&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> is a provider of crypto-economy solutions based in Stuttgart, Germany.</p><p>51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/indexing-and-querying-revoked-verifiable-credentials-e229dc2781d4">Indexing and Querying Revoked Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today (June 28, 0222), the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI issued a warning</a> stating that scammers may be trying to score jobs at companies to access customer or financial data, corporate IT databases, and/or proprietary information. It goes on to state that there has been an increase in complaints reporting the use of deepfakes and stolen Personally Identifiable Information data (PII) to apply for various remote work and work-at-home positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a solvable problem, beginning with strong identity verification during the hiring process. Unfortunately, while identity verification is a standard process, current practices have failed to keep up with fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>
 Contractor Fraud and the Rise of Remote Work 
<p>Many organizations require the use of contractors, known as third parties. Managing these non-employees through the HR system, the authoritative identity source for their IT ecosystem, can be burdensome. In addition, third-party individuals often require access to organizational resources such as shared tools, applications, or data sets to provide critical services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that this access is usually for a limited period. Third parties present challenges and bring additional risks, such as ensuring that access rights and permissions are managed correctly and, when required, deprovisioned quickly. With the rise of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, these concerns have only been exacerbated</p>
<p>Many companies assume that virtually checking a photo of a new contractor’s driver’s license and passport ensures that they are always the person logging in and working from home every day. Unfortunately, this isn’t necessarily the case. The increase in remote work in the last year has made it easier for fraudsters to attack your organization.&nbsp;</p>
 How Does Contractor Fraud Happen? 
<p>Let’s look at how identity fraud happens in an organization: When new contractors get hired, they receive access to numerous company resources like email and Slack. To gain access to these resources, they will likely use an active directory username and password and a 2FA tool.</p>
<p>What happens if this contractor outsources their work? The employee will provide a third-party outsourcer with usernames, passwords, and 2FA codes. It’s been done before, and with today’s collaboration technologies like Whatsapp and Slack, it can be done in seconds. This could be detrimental to an organization if this person found someone cheaper to do their work or got paid by a third party to let them into the organization to steal intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your company likely did a thorough background check of your employees and contractors. However, you did not do a background check on the subcontractor. This means that this individual could have a questionable background that is not suitable to work at your company. Your company resources and knowledge are vulnerable to the subcontractor.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Improve Third-Party Access Governance? 
<p>The reality is that nearly all organizations have a variety of these third-party individuals who need access to infrastructure, applications, and data. 1Kosmos improves the security of third-party access with our distributed digital identity platform that is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">FIDO2</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">NIST</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">PAD2</a> certified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefit of onboarding contractors with 1Kosmos BlockID is ensuring the highest degree of identity assurance in a virtual environment, eliminating fraudulent activities. Contractors who are bound to their proofed identity with 1Kosmos, they have identity-based biometric authentication and a passwordless experience. In practice, contractors can utilize their secure mobile device for physical or logical authentication and step-up authentication required for privileged access. As a result, each access event is associated with a real, verified identity. Overall, organizations will eliminate the risk of contractor fraud and extra security exposures contractors introduce.</p>
<p>Are you interested in learning more? I invite you to check out a webinar where we covered this very issue “<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/webinars/identity-based-authentication-journey-to-passwordless/">Identity-Based Authentication and The Journey to Passwordless</a>” where Edward Amoroso and Mike Engle discussed third-party access management and contractor fraud prevention. </p>
<p>Additionally, this <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/contractor-enrollment-and-onboarding/">whitepaper</a> covers our integration with Saviynt Third Party Access Governance. The combination of technologies ensures that when a contractor authenticates into the organization, you will have a high assurance that it is the contractor you hired, not someone else working on their behalf or a hacker!</p>

<p>Open banking is a big deal.</p>
<p>That means that Mastercard’s platform (which includes services from Mastercard’s wholly owned subsidiary, Finicity Corporation) is a combination of the work of many different disciplines like engineering, financial expertise, security and more. At the center of it all are product analysts like Kayla Kent, who began at Mastercard in December 2021, after moving to Utah from Northern Virginia.</p>
 What’re your responsibilities? 
<p>I’m on the consumer experience team, and we support the development of Mastercard’s open banking products. As a product analyst, I’m kind of the middleman between our development team, our design team, marketing, legal, etc, making sure basically that we’re on track and aligned with our product roadmap. I help support the team through the software development lifecycle with an agile project methodology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What kinds of challenges do you solve? 
<p>When we’re going through our backlogs and getting work ready for our development team, there’s a bit of planning that goes into that, so a project management hat goes on. And then we’re working with our design team and reviewing product designs and features that are going in, so I’m putting on more of a creative hat. When we’re doing competitive analysis and seeing how we can be better, I’m wearing an analytical hat.</p>
<p></p>
 How does your team exemplify Mastercard values like urgency? 
<p>Our team just gets the work done. If there’s something blocking us, we’ll escalate it immediately. We help each other out by seeing if there are ways to fix any issues that are keeping the project from progressing, making sure we’re pulling in the right people to address those problems and things like that.</p>
 What’s the culture like on your team? 
<p>We have a lot of team bonding social events. So we’ll do a lot of lunches together; we do a bi-weekly team social where we’ll play games and stuff, which is super nice. Because it’s not just like it’s all work between your colleagues. You’re kind of building a relationship past that and having that cohesive team feeling.</p>
<p>I think what’s really cool is that, like, on Slack, there’s all these various team channels, and there’s one that’s called “#misc_womenatfinicity” where we’ll share upcoming volunteering events or career development events that are going on. Another cool resource is Unlocked, which is a resource where you can build your profile and find other volunteering opportunities if you want to develop certain skill sets, or even find a mentor.</p>
<p></p>
 What does working at Mastercard enable you to do in your spare time? 
<p>There’s a good work-life balance at a Mastercard company, and my fiance and I wanted to live in the Salt Lake City area because of all the outdoor activities the area has to offer. So in my free time, we do a lot of skiing, hiking, camping and exploring the national and state parks down in southern Utah, which has been super fun.</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a slower-paced lifestyle here, which I like because you get a chance to breathe, whereas in Washington, or really in any urban area, you get really wrapped up in your work, you’re pulling a lot of overtime and you’re kind of consumed in that.</p>
 Why should someone consider joining the Mastercard open banking team? 
<p>I was interested in working in fintech because you get more opportunity to truly innovate, which you don’t get at every workplace. Another thing is that Mastercard has subsidiaries and offices everywhere, so you’re working with people in places like Europe or in India, and you get that different perspective or background from them. The four weeks of work-from-anywhere time is also really nice—since my family and a lot of my friends are based on the East Coast, it’s nice to be able to take advantage of that.</p>
 Interested in joining our team?

				  Cardea is a complete, decentralized, off-the-shelf, open source codebase for sharing health data in a way that’s compliant with data privacy law  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Cardea emerged from a crisis, a law, and a technology.</p>
<p>The crisis was the global Covid pandemic, the law a US requirement that Americans must be able to access their health care data, and the technology was verifiable digital credentials, which enabled people to do just that—hold their data, share it in a privacy-preserving way, and have it authenticated without having to check in with the source of the data.</p>
<p>That’s a lot to unpack, which is why the community of developers who built and maintain Cardea have written a white paper to explain it all—the background, the mechanics of decentralized identity and verifiable credential technology, and the benefits.</p>
<p>While Cardea now has a <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">white paper</a>, it’s far from a theory: it has been built and you can deploy it right now. It was developed by Indicio for SITA, the world’s leading provider of IT to the air transport sector, and the government of Aruba, which saw it as a way to manage Covid testing, reopen the tourist-dependent island safely, and ensure traveler privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				<a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf"> </a>
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>The trials were successful. The solution <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-the-eic-decentralized-identity-award-means-for-indicio/">won</a> SITA the decentralized identity and verifiable credential award at the 2022 European Identity and Cloud Conference, and Indicio has been <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-crn-tech-impact-awards/">nominated</a> for a social impact award at the CRN Tech Impact Awards in September. The unique parts of its codebase were donated to Linux Foundation Public Health so that public health authorities anywhere had a decentralized, privacy preserving solution optimized for Covid testing and vaccination. That’s when it acquired a name, <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a>.</p>
<p>In proving that tamper-proof health data could be issued to travelers by their health providers and be verified by airlines and other countries without having to check back in with the health provider, Cardea has laid the foundation for something much bigger than Covid testing. Verifiable credential technology provides a way for all kinds of health data to be shared in a privacy-preserving and security-enhanced way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we call Cardea a Trusted Digital Ecosystem because it enables all the parties in the ecosystem to trust the data being shared and to do so without direct integrations with the source of the data. Trustworthy data means immediately actionable data. And that has revolutionary potential in health, travel, finance, and the public sector. <br></p>
<p>This is just a thumbnail sketch of what can be done with the technology; there’s a lot more, and we’ve striven to make the white paper as accessible as possible to the widest audience possible. <br><br>Download a <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">PDF here</a>.</p>

Whilst unions like <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/">IWGB</a> are thinking creatively about their options for collective bargaining in emerging sectors (such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/19/firms-urged-to-protect-workers-from-abuse-in-wild-west-uk-gig-economy">gig economy</a>) and finding new ways to exert leverage (such as targeting company owners and organising across sectors, as Alice Martin <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/newe.12256">documents</a>), they are still not focused on the relationship between owners and&nbsp;renters.</p><p>Other forms of union have emerged — in particular, tenants unions such as <a href="https://londonrentersunion.org/">London Renters’ Union</a> (LRU), or community unions such as <a href="https://www.acorntheunion.org.uk/">ACORN</a>. Whilst they have won many important victories, their organising model — based mainly on direct action, in-person peer and expert support, and public pressure of landlords — is hard to scale and lacks the ‘hard power’ of exerting real pressure on profits that traditional trade unions had via strike&nbsp;action.</p><p>There’s a gap: a need to focus on the asset owner-renter relationship and building collective financial power.</p> Our enquiry: The neighbourhood union as a new institution of solidarity <p>We began with the idea that neighbourhoods could provide a strong centre of gravity around which to organise. People often identify strongly with their local area, and remain there for a long time. Broad based community organising has always centred local leadership and&nbsp;place.</p><p>A Neighbourhood Union would aim to build the collective power of different groups — residents, small businesses, leaseholders — and connect their struggle to questions of local, democratic ownership. We see this as a complement to trade unions (organised around work) and renters unions (organised around&nbsp;tenure).</p><p>Our research — including interviews with members of London Renters’ Union, leaseholders, lawyers, policy makers, and think tanks — suggested three design principles for such an institution:</p>  Principle 1: Focus on one-to-many ‘relationships of&nbsp;power.’  Principle 2: Combine digital and social infrastructure  Principle 3: Provide practical tools &amp; services for collective action   Principle 1: Focus on one-to-many ‘relationships of&nbsp;power’ <p>As Deepak Pateriya has <a href="https://forgeorganizing.org/article/whats-your-power-analysis">argued</a>, understanding how power operates is a critical step in making change happen. Within a neighbourhood, there are a wide range of relationships that are characterised by a ‘one-to-many’ relationship between a rentier and a renter, resulting in a significant difference in power. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Corporate landlords (or managing agents) and residents. Many landlords own multiple properties, and the <a href="https://www.homeviews.com/business/industry-blog/the-6-build-to-rent-operators-rated-highest-in-the-uk/">build to rent</a> market is growing rapidly, in which each landlord has hundreds or thousands of tenants. Banks are increasingly getting in on the act, with Lloyds <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9dc9617-f059-4de6-b43a-d5e9978d8c0b">aiming</a> to become one of the UK’s biggest landlords in the next 10&nbsp;years.  Commercial landlords and small businesses. The level of <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/uk-corporate-debt-after-covid-19-what-might-the-impact-be/#:~:text=33%25%20of%20SMEs%20have%20debt,increased%20from%203%25%20before%20Covid.">SME debt</a> has massively increased since the pandemic, with 33% now sitting on debt more than ten times their cash balance, and the general <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-to-resolve-remaining-covid-19-commercial-rent-debts-now-in-place">moratorium</a> on commercial evictions ended in March. Whilst the government may be willing to take action to prevent commercial landlords from simply sitting on empty property, there is currently little scope for small businesses to engage in a collective conversation.  Freeholders and leaseholders. Many leaseholders have been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p09l35m3">shouldered</a> with extremely high costs for building repairs, which are often too high to pay and make it impossible to sell their flat. Some have started local groups, but often limited to their own building — as finding others with the same freeholder is hard to&nbsp;do.  Utility companies and customers. Energy companies have made huge profits as a result of the increase in prices while millions of people are struggling with bills. Water companies have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/england-privatised-water-firms-dividends-shareholders">paid out</a> £13billion in dividends in the last 10 years, whilst in 2020 Thames Water <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60046320">dumped</a> 400 Olympic sized swimming pools worth of raw sewage into the&nbsp;river.  <p>The advantage of focusing on the ‘one-to-many’ relationships is that it makes new forms of collective action possible. If my landlord only owns one property, then there are no other tenants with whom I could take action. If they own multiple buildings, then we could exert real pressure by withholding fees or bringing multiple legal&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The relevance of these one-to-many relationships will differ in each neighbourhood, and there may be others that are not included here. A Neighbourhood Union would aim to be a forum within which these power dynamics are analysed and coalitions built — with a focus on the possibility of disrupting flows of finance in an&nbsp;area.</p> Principle 2: Combine digital and social infrastructure <p>Our starting point in this work was that a digital platform could help address the problems of fragmentation and distance in trying to bring together people who might be scattered across a neighbourhood, and who do not work together. Organisations such as <a href="https://commonknowledge.coop/work/">Common Knowledge</a> and <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">My Society</a> are showing the potential of using digital tools to amplify the power of organisers.</p><p>We think a digital platform could&nbsp;offer:</p>  The ability to identify and connect with others who have your landlord. For example, by uploading information from a tenancy agreement, a platform could match you with other members who have the same landlord.  New participation pathways for those who would be unlikely to attend branch meetings of tenants&nbsp;unions.  An information hub that helps to signpost towards resources that might be helpful in a dispute with a landlord, utility company or freeholder.  Providing easy-to-access tools for collective action (see&nbsp;below).  <p>One message that came through clearly in our conversations, however, was that digital infrastructure alone would never be enough. Social infrastructure and interactions are vital to build trust, relationships, and solidarity between members. Places like the <a href="https://www.thefrontroom.cc/about/">Floating Front Room</a>, which acts as a long-term neighbourhood platform co-owned by local communities, provide creative inspiration for how to build the necessary physical roots in a place. The Local Trust’s work on <a href="https://localtrust.org.uk/insights/research/the-double-dividend/">social infrastructure</a> shows the critical role it plays in shaping residents’ sense of identity, fostering civic pride and building bonds that encourages peoples’ participation in their community. Groups such as <a href="https://www.right-here.org/">We’re Right Here</a> and <a href="https://renaisi.com/">Renaisi</a> are working on creating the conditions that communities need to&nbsp;thrive.</p><p>Whilst being digitally native would be the starting point, a Neighbourhood Union would need to have a physical home, or at least access to physical&nbsp;space.</p> Principle 3: Provide practical tools &amp; services for collective action <p>Our conversations highlighted some of the practical difficulties in organising. Leaseholders who were protesting against the astronomical amounts they were being charged by their freeholders spoke of the difficulty in finding others with the same leaseholder, and the lack of forums on which to communicate. Those that had managed to organise themselves were often doing so via WhatsApp — but one renter we spoke to said that their landlord had managed to infiltrate their WhatsApp&nbsp;group.</p><p>Managing a dispute is difficult enough when there is just one person. Collecting and documenting evidence, staying on top of communication with a landlord / company, filing the right legal papers — it all takes work. Coordinating that across a group who want to take collective action is a massive task. One benefit of being digitally native would be to offer tools and services that make it easier, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Collective case management (document storage, messaging);  Collective legal&nbsp;action;  Collective financial action (eg. withholding rent, bills or service charges).  <p>Unions have always provided practical and legal support — and the new unions mentioned earlier, such as IWGB, are also taking action to shape the law in new areas such as the use of <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/racist-facial-recognition/#:~:text=The%20Independent%20Workers'%20Union%20of,termination%20of%20darker%20skinned%20workers.">facial recognition technology</a> or Uber drivers’ employment status.</p><p>Neighbourhood Unions would aim to combine some of the best practice from new housing unions and new workplace unions in threatening the bottom line whilst working within a community.</p>Photo by Samuel Regan-Asante on&nbsp;Unsplash In the long&nbsp;term <p>The outline we have sketched above imagines a Neighbourhood Union as an institution that can push back against rentier asset owners. A group of leaseholders withholding service fees; a group of residents withholding their water bill; small businesses collectively negotiating rent. In the medium term, this would be an enormous win. But in the longer term, it could take a more proactive, positive role, and help shape local development. A Neighbourhood Union could — like a Community Land Trust — own assets on behalf of the community. Following Community Wealth Building principles, it could enable members to spend money collectively, for example on maintenance &amp; renovation contracts, in a way that retains money in the&nbsp;area.</p><p>Neighbourhood Unions of this kind would be part of the wider movement for civic organising that is taking root. There is growing recognition that the deep, structural and complex challenges we face require more than just policy change — although the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-deal-for-private-renters-published-today%5C">Renters Reform Bill</a> and the end of Section 21 no-fault evictions will be a massive step forward. But whether it’s responding to a pandemic, addressing the cost of living crisis or confronting the climate emergency, we need new institutions for collective actions as much as we need new&nbsp;policy.</p><p>If you’re interested in exploring this work further with us, please get in touch, or come and join us on July 13th at 6.30pm, at Pub in the&nbsp;Park.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/u/9dd85ed72d9e">Dan Wainwright</a> <a href="mailto:info@darkmatterlabs.org">info@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/u/3af4c23a5d6e">Tom Beresford</a> <a href="mailto:tom@darkmatterlabs.org">tom@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p><p>With thanks to all those we spoke to in writing this blog for their time, insight, and&nbsp;care.</p>

<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is the most important&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;innovation of the decade and it’s here now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is already introducing DI capabilities into its&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;privacy toolkit,&nbsp;which will be available as easy-to-use SDKs, sample apps and unbranded apps ready for fast deployment to customers. Our proven&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;digital identities&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">fit neatly with the DI story</a>.</p>



<p>But what is DI, really? And what do all its technical components mean? We drilled down into Anonyome Labs’ deep knowledge of DI to come up with these simple words for complex terms.&nbsp;</p>



 DI lets us control our own personal information. 



 It’s a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is trustworthy, and respects privacy. 



<p>Decentralized identity&nbsp;is the technology and standards that allow a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is more trustworthy and respects privacy. DI puts the user in sole control of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;that forms their identity. It’s&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;because there’s no central authority or single issuing agent.</p>



<p>DI allows a fully digital, universally accepted way of identifying ourselves online (e.g. to a web site or app) and in real life (e.g. at a bar or a border crossing) so:</p>



  We don’t have to use email or usernames and passwords to login, carry paper or plastic versions of our IDs, or give out our personal information to every organization we want to access.  No central authority (e.g. bank, airline, Instagram, Netflix) needs to collect and store our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal ID information</a>&nbsp;(e.g. name, DOB, SSN, address, phone number etc.) and abuse it or&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">risk losing it</a>.  We can take back control of our own IDs and personal information.  



<p>Another term for DI is&nbsp;self-sovereign identity, which simply means the system is&nbsp;self-governing – the user has full control over their personal information.</p>



 DI has 3 pillars:&nbsp; 



  verifiable credentials (or digital ID documents) and the digital wallet they’re stored in  decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and the methods used to verify them  blockchain/distributed ledger used as the anchor of trust.  



 Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 



<p>Digital ID documents with digital signatures that either replace or complement paper or plastic versions (e.g. digital driver’s license, digital passport, digital travel visa). They’re not tied to any one organization or central authority, the user stores and uses them autonomously, and they are easily shared and checked to confirm the holder’s ID to unlock services (e.g. proof of age at a bar, or proof of vaccination at an airport).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital wallet&nbsp;is like a leather wallet only it’s a digital app (usually mobile app) and on the user’s device instead of in their pocket. They use it to store, control, share and carry their digital ID documents, and establish trusted connections (say, between them and their bank or university).&nbsp;We are building a set of SDKs so our enterprise customers can quickly create their own digital identity wallet. We also plan on building an unbranded identity wallet app if an enterprise customer wants to get to market faster.</p>



Figure 1: Example use cases for verifiable credentials (digital ID documents).<br>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>.



 Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) 



<p>You’ll recall from the digital wallet definition that a DID is the unique identifier that identifies a user or service. DIDs are generated&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/01/what-is-encryption-and-why-is-it-important/">cryptographically</a>&nbsp;– so each digital identity has a unique DID and a unique private/public key pair. Attached to the DID on the blockchain is a DIDDoc which contains the public key and also an endpoint address where a message can be sent. The issuer of a digital ID document would write their DID information (including their DIDDoc) onto the blockchain.&nbsp;<br><br>DID methods&nbsp;– This is the interface description of the decentralized ledger or blockchain. It describes how to write and read from the blockchain to use it for decentralized identity applications. For example, it explains the format of the DID, the DIDDoc (public key and endpoint user address for communication), how to write a verifiable credentials schema, credential definition and issuer DID.&nbsp;</p>



 Blockchain&nbsp; 



<p>Perhaps the most used term because it enables cryptocurrencies like bitcoin,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain">blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a database for recording information so it can’t be changed or hacked (immutable). It’s how we establish&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in DI systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain is a type of decentralised database managed by multiple participants (computers in a network). Blockchain can be used for almost anything valuable such as supply chains, payments, accounts, production, orders, decentralized exchanges, smart contracts, etc. Benefits to users are that it’s cost effective and lower risk than a centralized database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchains are unlimited in number and increasing all the time. Right now, about 1,000 blockchains exist in the world, with four different&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/What-are-the-4-different-types-of-blockchain-technology#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20main%20types,benefits%2C%20drawbacks%20and%20ideal%20uses.">types of blockchain network</a>&nbsp;(public, private, consortium and hybrid). Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain">this</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-blockchains-are-there/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20there%20are%20at%20least,platforms%20provided%20in%20this%20industry.">this</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>



<p>Decentralized or public ledger&nbsp;– Similar to a blockchain, this is an encrypted, unalterable record-keeping system which is open to any internet-connected participant. It is secure and anonymous and is like a record book of all transactions between participants.&nbsp;It’s called a public ledger because no central or single authority (e.g. bank or government agency) owns, maintains or monitors it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main difference between a ledger and a blockchain is that a blockchain is fully public and permissionless, whereas a ledger is usually public and permissioned (limited assigned validators/endorsers on the network).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Putting it all together 



<p>That’s the basic concepts covered; now let’s look at who does what in a DI system.</p>



<p>DI needs 3 players:</p>



  Issuer&nbsp;– an authority that asserts a person is who they say they are and issues a digital ID document (e.g. driver’s license)  Holder&nbsp;– the person who owns and stores the digital ID document, and uses it where they want to unlock services (e.g. prove their age at a bar)&nbsp;  Verifier&nbsp;– a person, organization or device app such as a QR code scanner that checks the holder’s digital ID document and unlocks services.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



Figure 2: The 3 players involved in a DI system.



<p>You’ll see that both issuers and verifiers of a digital ID document interact with the blockchain: the issuer uses it to list its DID, schema and credential definition of the digital ID documents it is issuing, and the verifier uses it to check the digital ID document originated at the issuer and has not been modified.</p>



 Some other DI terms you might want to know 



  Verifiable data registry&nbsp;– In DI, this is the system that provides the source of trust for digital ID documents, encryption keys, and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys, etc. Blockchain is one example of a verifiable data registry.&nbsp;  Identity hub&nbsp;–&nbsp;Identity hubs are an additional data store beyond the digital wallet. They’re decentralized off-chain personal data stores which the user has total control over. In their identity hub the owner can securely store all their sensitive data in a way that prevents anyone from using it without their permission. The user can securely share their data with other people, apps, and businesses, and decide to give access to only the minimum data necessary and retain a record of who has access to what.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/identity-hubs-as-personal-datastores/ba-p/389577">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;is doing a lot of work in this space.  DI standards&nbsp;– The rules for exchanging information uniformly via DI systems across the internet. Anonyome Labs&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity-development/">actively contributes</a>&nbsp;to the DI standards area.  DI relay&nbsp;– A DI relay allows DI peer-to-peer messaging even when a user’s device (edge agent) is offline.&nbsp;Relays receive and store messages for when the user comes back online. We just introduced the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo Platform DI Relay</a>.  Edge and cloud agents&nbsp;–&nbsp;These are software components that users and services in the decentralized identity ecosystem leverage, including to set up relationships and handle communications.&nbsp;An&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">edge agent</a>&nbsp;is an application that sits on an edge device, such as a user’s mobile phone. Edge agents can provide an array of DI functionality such as providing wallet and peer-to-peer services.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">Cloud agents</a>&nbsp;are similar to edge agents but provide cloud-based&nbsp;services that are always available – they&nbsp;do not need relays because they are always connected to the network.&nbsp;  Zero knowledge proof&nbsp;– This is a privacy-preserving way of proving something without revealing the actual information. ZKPs make it possible to post confidential transactions to the blockchain by proving the transaction was carried out correctly without revealing the actual information involved in the transaction (e.g. addresses, dollar amounts, etc.).  Peer-to-peer&nbsp;– This simply means two users interacting without a third party in between, for communications, payments etc.&nbsp;  



<p>Some terms in an effective DI system:</p>



  Verifiable&nbsp;– It can prove the validity of a digital ID document (i.e., that a trusted issuer created it and it hasn’t been modified).&nbsp;  Trustless&nbsp;– There’s no requirement on the user to place their sole trust in any one third party in order for a network or payment system to function.  Self-governing&nbsp;– The user has full control over their personal information.&nbsp;  Permissionless&nbsp;– There are no restrictions, and no central authority or administrator controls participation.  Distributed and robust&nbsp;– It uses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;technology, with a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network (as used in cryptocurrency).  Stateful&nbsp;– Transactions can’t be changed (immutable) and are stored in the distributed database of the network.  Native built-in payments&nbsp;– It facilitates the exchange of payment information.  Standards-based and open source&nbsp;– It uses set “rules” so it can work across web sites and services.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p>Verantwortliche für Cybersicherheit sehen sich mit wachsenden Herausforderungen konfrontiert, da die Cyberkriminellen immer kreativer werden und mit einem anscheinend unendlichen Arsenal an Ressourcen bewaffnet sind. Die rasante Digitalisierung in der Folge der Pandemie und die unsichere geopolitische Situation zwingen die Verantwortlichen, ihre Cybersicherheitsstrategien zu überdenken. Trotz eines deutlichen Anstiegs bei den Cybersicherheitsbudgets werden Unternehmen weiterhin Opfer von Cyberattacken. „Den Feind und die eigenen Schwachstellen erkennen und verstehen“ ist der Schlüssel zu wirksamen Verteidigungsstrategien und dafür, einen Vorsprung vor den Cyberkriminellen zu bekommen. Organisationen müssen einen vollständigen Einblick in die externe Bedrohungslandschaft haben und wissen, welche potenziellen Angriffe ihnen drohen. Diese vorausblickende Fähigkeit ermöglicht es Organisationen, sich auf die größten Risiken zu fokussieren und zumindest die schwerwiegendsten Schäden durch Angriffe zu vermeiden.

Wenn die Eingangstür bestmöglich gesichert ist, dann brauchen Sie vielleicht nie wieder Schlüssel für weitere Türen. Durch die Verwendung komplexer Passwörter verschwenden Unternehmen Zeit, Geld und Ressourcen für deren Rücksetzung und verringern die Produktivität ihrer Mitarbeiter. Die sichere Anmeldung bei Anwendungen ist wichtig, aber der erste Authentifizierungspunkt für die meisten Mitarbeiter ist der Laptop, Desktop oder die Workstation selbst. HYPR bietet mit seiner passwortlosen und phishing-resistenten MFA-Lösung eine einfache und dennoch sichere Anmeldung, die den Benutzer am Desktop identifiziert und die Eingangstür absichert. Die Desktop-MFA kann verwendet werden, um sich einfach und sicher an einem Gerät anzumelden und den reibungslosen und sicheren Zugriff auf Anwendungen zu ermöglichen.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Recently deepfakes made a splash in the headlines: Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kiev held one-on-one virtual interviews with several European leaders – or so they thought. In the days following the interviews, it came to light that the Ukrainian official was not actually conducting the interviews, but an unknown party had presented a false representation of Klitschko – with possibilities ranging from a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/25/european-leaders-deepfake-video-calls-mayor-of-kyiv-vitali-klitschko">real-time deepfake</a> to a <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/vitali-klitschko-zweifel-an-giffeys-deep-fake-these-2206-166427.html">re-edited version of existing video footage</a> called “shallow fakes” – that lasted approximately 15 minutes. One of the interviewees became suspicious of Klitschko’s authenticity and broke it off early, but others had no suspicions and continued the interview until its conclusion.</p>
 Deepfakes pose risks for businesses 
<p>More detailed information is not available about the falsified Klitschko, but it opens up many questions about the implications of shallow and deepfakes in politics and across all industries. It adds to the ongoing discussion: how do we know who we interact with digitally, be it our customers, employees, partners, or board members?</p>
<p>Access being granted to an impostor poses severe risk to an organization, be it in this case an impostor gaining audience with mayors of major European cities, or in countless other scenarios such as impersonating a CEO to authorize a funds transfer. Risks like these are clear calls for Zero Trust architectures, described at its simplest as “trust nothing, verify everything”. What options do organizations have to verify the identity of those they interact with digitally?</p>
<p>Remote identity verification is popular in industries like financial services, retail, and health care for consumer-facing interactions, and is gaining traction in many others to cover use cases such as external partner/organization onboarding, employee onboarding, and authentication bound to a verified identity. These solutions typically onboard the person in question by scanning a government-issued identity document (with OCR, NFC, or other means) and compare it against government registries and a real-time selfie of the individual for both biometric measurement and liveness detection. Although this is a market segment that is still maturing, the technologies are well established and continuously being improved. But are they robust enough to detect and reject deepfakes?</p>
 Deepfakes vs. liveness detection 
<p>The biometric onboarding and liveness detection portions of remote identity verification solutions are designed to address presentation attacks, but are not yet always equipped to fend off deepfake attacks.</p>
<p>The concept of detecting liveness is to confirm that the correct individual is physically present at the time of the transaction, and is not misrepresented by a photo, video, or mask, and sometimes synthetic representations (like a deepfake). Usually, the individual is asked to take a live selfie with their mobile device providing real-time evidence that the correct individual is conducting the transaction. Checks such as audio and facial synchronization, consistent blinking, and biometric inconsistencies help to indicate if a synthetic video or deepfake has been presented.</p>
<p>A deepfake could be injected via a faulty API, bypassing the device camera, or infecting the computer with malware. In this case, a selfie (injected by the attacker) may not be interpreted as fraudulent. For additional security against such deepfakes, either active or passive liveness checks should be completed. The individual may be asked to follow directions like blinking, turning their head, saying a series of random numbers, and so on to detect if the person is real and can respond to spontaneous instructions. This is referred to as active liveness, since the individual is asked to actively do something to prove their presence, to which a deepfake may not always be able to dynamically respond. Passive versions exist as well such as flashing a random sequence of colors on the individual’s face as they take a selfie. If a deepfake video was injected into the communication stream, this series of colors would be interrupted and indicate an attack.</p>
<p>Both deepfakes and liveness detection are improving, making it a game of chess to stay ahead of attacks.</p>
 Do deepfakes require adoption of identity verification? 
<p>The simple answer to this is yes, the more deepfake attacks increase in volume and sophistication, the more businesses can counteract with identity verification. However, the reality depends on factors:</p>
 
 The high cost of producing deepfakes 
 The scenarios deepfakes will be used in 
 The willingness of normal, non-fraudulent users to verify their identity 
 The different circumstances that non-fraudulent users are willing 
 
<p>Currently, believable deepfakes are labor-intensive to create, and do not scale well compared to other presentation attacks like static images, videos, 2D or 3D masks, injection attacks, or replay attacks. Deepfakes will likely play an increasingly threatening role in social engineering attacks and spear-phishing, since the resources required to develop it can be focused on a particular target. But largescale attempts to onboard or authenticate fraudulent users may not be the most common use case for deepfakes. Additional protection against deepfakes for high-profile people, politicians, celebrities, and C-level members of organizations may be considered, but may not be necessary when general public onboards or authenticates.</p>
<p>It may be prudent to ask if a political leader would subject themselves to remote identity verification conducted by another sovereign nation. Would it be viewed as a security risk for country that they represent, or seen as a gesture of goodwill? The same could be said for C-level members being verified by an external organization that they wish to do business with. And if these individuals refuse to agree to an identity verification step, will the other party rely on increasingly passive methods, which are arguably more invasive as collecting appropriate consent becomes more difficult?</p>
<p>While certainly not a complete answer to these questions, interoperability and standard credential formats can help ease the reluctance of one party being verified by the system of the other, mainly by allowing the identity verification step to be conducted internally, and shared with the other party in a standardized format. Initiatives like <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81119/gain-explained">GAIN</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81204/guide-to-implementing-decentralized-id">Verifiable Credentials</a> are making steps towards establishing globally interoperable <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity">reusable verified identity</a>.</p>
 What changes do we need? 
<p>As the quality and scalability of deepfake attacks increase, we must increase the defensive detection measures. While some current identity verification solutions claim to detect deepfake attacks, most are geared towards deterring more scalable attacks like spoofing, fraudulent documents, or masks. Especially notable is synchronous video identification, where the individual joins a video call with a live agent. These solutions rely on manual verification only, and while agents are trained in verifying documents and passports, they are not trained to detect a deepfake. Since these attacks look more and more believable to the human eye, video identification in particular would benefit from additional algorithmic checks for anomalies. We should expect remote identity verification solutions to invest in the ability to better detect deepfake attacks.</p>
<p>The best weapon against attacks that use AI is defense that uses AI. Adding algorithmic anomaly detection for deepfake tell-tales like inconsistent or nonexistent blinking, inconsistent background and inconsistent video quality will be a meaningful step forward towards deterring more deepfake attacks. Deepfakes already have and will undoubtedly continue to address these inconsistencies, and therefore it becomes paramount to develop the capabilities to detect anomalies that have never been seen (or trained for) before.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole continues to research the identity verification space, and will publish a series of reports in the later half of 2022. Keep an eye out for this research to stay up to date on topics like liveness detection.</p>
