Back then, we had a vision and a mission: that every human being — every citizen in every country in the world — should have the right and ability to gather and use their own data for their own purposes, including exercising control over how others collect and use their&nbsp;data.

<p>It’s over 13 years since we at Mydex Community Interest Company set up&nbsp;shop.</p><p>Back then, we had a vision and a mission: that every human being — every citizen in every country in the world — should have the right and ability to gather and use their own data for their own purposes, including exercising control over how others collect and use their&nbsp;data.</p><p>At the time, this idea seemed so outlandish that most people simply ignored or dismissed our ideas as irrelevant.</p><p>But over the years the need for our mission has become ever more apparent, with mounting abuses and accelerating imbalances of power and reward, and with growing awareness that our society and economy is failing to <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">unleash the full potential of data</a> — especially personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Also, slowly but surely, the means of achieving this mission has also become clearer. Every citizen needs to have their own personal data store which enables them to collect, store, use and share their own data under their own control, independently of any other party or organisation that might have collected data about&nbsp;them.</p> Critical design principles <p>Particular details of how this system should work have also become clearer. Over the years, we worked hard to clarify the design principles that are critical for our mission’s success. We laid out the most important ones <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-a-new-data-infrastructure-22124e300f6c">in a blog back 2018</a>. Key amongst them&nbsp;were:</p><p>1. Public/social purpose and mission. The purpose of the new personal data infrastructure should not be to monetise data but to promote the public good e.g. benefits for citizens.</p><p>2. Independence. It should work for people — citizens — not for the profits of private corporations or for the&nbsp;state.</p><p>3. Neural and enabling The infrastructure should not be designed or used so as to favour one party’s vested interests over&nbsp;another.</p><p>4. Distributed, not centralised With each personal data store uniquely and separately encrypted, held by individuals for individuals (i.e. not creating yet another massive centralised database).</p><p>5. Zero-knowledge operations It should not look into or seek to influence how individuals use their data. Its job is to promote and enable their agency, not to seek to control&nbsp;them.</p><p>6. Aligned incentives The way it earns its money should be structured so that it has no financial incentives to monetise, manipulate or seek control over individuals’ data or their uses of this&nbsp;data.</p><p>7. Separation of storage from use The only way to achieve all the above is to create a structural separation of functions and roles: with one focused on the provision of infrastructure enabling citizens to collect, store and share their data, the other actually using the data (e.g. to provide financial advice, treat a medical condition, or assess an individual’s eligibility for a service).</p><p>8. Built to last — the infrastructure should have built-in safeguards against changes to its role, functions and priorities — for instance, in the case of a change of leadership, stock market listing, merger, sale, acquisition, bankruptcy etc.</p> The EU&nbsp;agrees! <p>This week, the EU published its new Data Governance Act, its core purpose being to “foster the availability of data for use by increasing trust in data intermediaries and by strengthening data-sharing mechanisms across the&nbsp;EU”.</p><p>A core part of its provisions are rules relating to data intermediaries that enable what it calls ‘C2B’ [consumer to business] data sharing. This is what the Act&nbsp;says:</p><blockquote>“These providers will have to comply with a number of requirements, in particular the requirement to remain neutral as regards the data exchanged. They cannot use such data for other purposes. In the case of providers of data sharing services offering services for natural persons, the additional criterion of assuming fiduciary duties towards the individuals using them will also have to be&nbsp;met.”</blockquote><p>Just as we had&nbsp;said.</p><p>Clause 23 goes on to say (in a rather long-winded paragraph):</p><blockquote>“A specific category of data intermediaries includes providers of data sharing services that offer their services to data subjects in the sense of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 [GDPR in other words]. Such providers focus exclusively on personal data and seek to enhance individual agency and the individuals’ control over the data pertaining to them. They would assist individuals in exercising their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular managing their consent to data processing, the right of access to their own data, the right to the rectification of inaccurate personal data, the right of erasure or right ‘to be forgotten’, the right to restrict processing and the data portability right, which allows data subjects to move their personal data from one controller to the other. In this context, it is important that their business model ensures that there are no misaligned incentives that encourage individuals to make more data available for processing than what is in the individuals’ own interest. This could include advising individuals on uses of their data they could allow and making due diligence checks on data users before allowing them to contact data subjects, in order to avoid fraudulent practices. In certain situations, it could be desirable to collate actual data within a personal data storage space, or ‘personal data space’ so that processing can happen within that space without personal data being transmitted to third parties in order to maximise the protection of personal data and privacy.”</blockquote><p>All this is pretty much what we wrote in our blog back in May&nbsp;2018.</p> One step forward&nbsp;… <p>It is incredibly positive that the EU has made this step, in many&nbsp;ways.</p><p>It’s very important that there is legal recognition of personal data services that work for and behalf of individuals; that are not traditional ‘data controllers’ that collect and use data for a particular organisation’s purposes.</p><p>It is very important that the two way nature of data sharing — both so-called ‘B2C’ [business-to-consumer] and ‘C2B’ [consumer-to-business] — be recognised. (We would rather that the ‘C’ refer to citizens rather than ‘consumers’, which is a derogatory term in our minds. But you can’t have everything).</p><p>And it is particularly important that the core design principles outlined above are recognised, embraced and enforced.</p><p>That said, there’s still a long, long way to go. Writing down some good principles is one thing. Interpreting them in the right way and actually implementing and enforcing them is something else entirely. The new Act makes progress easier, but in no way does it make progress inevitable.</p><p>There’s also the question of how the UK responds. Will the UK Government adopt a similar approach? With its own National Data Strategy consultation coming to a close next week, the UK Government has an immense opportunity to unleash the full potential of personal data for the nation’s citizens, society and economy. Has it got the vision and political will to do&nbsp;this?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/vindicated-cb897fb4e94b">Vindicated!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A recap of everything that has happened so far…and of what’s to&nbsp;come.  Intro <p>3 years can feel like an eternity at a time of relative normality, let alone in a year like 2020. In the blockchain industry, time travels so quickly that it can make you feel like you are travelling at lightspeed given just how much occurs in such a short amount of time. When Ontology officially launched in New York as 2017 was coming to an end, the world was witnessing global recognition of Bitcoin for the first time as the price jumped to almost $20,000, before crashing in January of 2018. At a time when the industry was plagued by scams, false pretenses and an overall lack of clarity, Ontology was able to seize the moment and establish itself as an industry leader that enterprises can rely&nbsp;on.</p><p>Not only has Ontology survived the bursting of the initial bubble; we have found our footing and thrived in the process. The first 3 years of Ontology have seen massive accomplishments both in terms of technical development and market adoption. Our focus has, and always will be geared towards the protection and control of individual user privacy and data rights, as stated by our Founder, Li Jun, in his earliest conception of the Ontology blockchain. In fact, Li Jun’s vision seems even more pertinent now than it was back&nbsp;then.</p><p>Today, concerns around user privacy continues to grow amongst all facets of society. Laws such as the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/#:~:text=The%20regulation%20was%20put%20into,tens%20of%20millions%20of%20euros.">GDPR, passed back in May 2018</a>, show governments attempting to address these concerns. It seems Ontology’s vision of a total decentralized identity solution such as our ONT ID is needed more now than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>However, we know that growth and progress isn’t always linear, as we have seen with the highs and lows the industry has experienced over the last 3 years. What is important though, is that we continue to move forward. We have compiled a recap of the things we have done to achieve our goals over the last 3&nbsp;years.</p> Year One: Systemic Construction <p>As with most long term projects, the first step is about building a solid foundation upon which the project can flourish. For Ontology, our initial phase saw the launching of our <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ontology-mainnet-ontology-1-0-has-officially-launched">MainNet</a> and the first version of our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/o-wallet-ontologys-official-desktop-wallet-version-0-8-0-release-notes-38b2ed8d1492">ONTO wallet</a>. Our MainNet serves as a high-performance public blockchain with a distributed ledger and smart contract system that also supports public chain customization and chain network collaboration. Notably, Ontology 1.0 was the first public chain capable of executing smart contracts with identity, setting the vision for decentralized identity in motion. To allow for better user interaction, we subsequently launched the first version of ONTO in the summer of 2018, which supported individual wallets, shared wallets, and the ledger hardware wallet. On top of that, in our first year we introduced a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-launches-vbft-a-next-generation-consensus-mechanism-becoming-one-of-the-first-vrf-based-91f782308db4">new consensus algorithm VBFT</a> for the Ontology framework and the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-introduces-the-triones-membership-system-5211294976bf">Triones Consensus System</a>, which laid the groundwork for an open governance model. With the first series of projects having launched on GitHub in March 2018, we moved further into the area of decentralized identity with the launch of <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-first-version-of-the-ontology-roadmaps-8760c96e50b5">ONT ID</a>, which includes the Ontology distributed identification protocol and verifiable claim protocol. To close off our system construction in year one, Ontology joined an array of internationally recognized blockchain based groups including the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation.</a></p> Year Two: Industry Recognition <p>Ontology’s second year revolved around developing our singular vision and ensuring our technical prowess within the broader ecosystem. Our goal was realized when Ontology was chosen to be part of the Microsoft Accelerator in December, 2018<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/onchain-wins-the-microsoft-accelerator-shanghai-third-cohort-graduation-award-acd28dcc22b5">,</a> as well as being officially listed as a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-is-now-an-official-google-cloud-partner-as-three-ontology-projects-are-accepted-to-the-935edeef3e64">Google Cloud Partner with three of our projects having been accepted</a> in their partner program shortly after in February of 2019. In June of 2019, Ontology celebrated its one year anniversary of our MainNet launch. Once we achieved a certain level of public trust in the technical expertise behind Ontology, launching our MainNet allowed us to build upon it for further Enterprise projects who were focusing on decentralized identity and data privacy. In addition, we launched the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-v1-8-0-goes-live-with-wasm-fa34e9f7f930">Wasm TestNet in May</a>, as well as the first ever cross-chain TestNet in the same month. The <a href="https://blockchain.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> also passed both of our proposed blockchain standards in&nbsp;June.</p><p>We wrapped up our second year with our Multi-VM launch in October, followed by the launch of our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-sharding-design-released-c900331f71fa">Sharding Design</a>. Our Sharding Design was specifically designed to provide effective linear stability and support for atomic cross-shard transaction processing.</p><p>During our second year, we also released the <a href="https://ont.io/Ontology-Infrastructure-White-Paper-EN-2.0.0.pdf">second version of our Whitepaper</a> in July. The whitepaper reiterated Li Jun’s original vision for decentralized identity and data privacy and highlighted our technical infrastructure and framework which put us ahead of the&nbsp;pack.</p> Year Three: Global Integration <p>In Ontology’s third year, our focus was to identify key ways in which we could become a cross-chain powerhouse in the blockchain industry, while also utilizing our ONT ID and data protection features in partnership with other leading companies. From a technical standpoint, we kicked off our third year with the launch of ONT FS, as well as our Blockchain SaaS Framework. Moving into 2020, our technical progress was demonstrated by the launch of Ontology Layer 2.0 — which included the launch of a brand new <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-wasm-jit-released-a-leading-smart-contract-virtual-machine-with-high-speed-and-519783fe5055">Wasm-JIT</a>, which provides high speed performance at low storage costs. Its launch was paired with the ONT ID 2.0 upgrade, which combines users’ decentralized identity with their ONTO wallet with one single login, while providing a framework that helps users control their identity and data. This further strengthened our position as a market leader in ensuring user privacy and data protection; a position reflected by the vast amount of external partnerships and media mentions we have achieved in our third year from leading outlets such as CoinDesk and Cointelegraph — the latter of which we are officially listed in as an Enterprise Solution Provider under their new consulting arm. We introduced a new governance and staking model in July, affecting both ONT and ONG, equipped with a <a href="https://node.ont.io/calculator/node">node and yield calculator</a> allowing users to easily estimate how much they can potentially earn from staking through ONTO. The launch of the <a href="https://www.poly.network/">Poly Network</a> in partnership with Neo and Switcheo enabled the support of cross-chain assets on Ontology. This allowed us to focus even more on providing decentralized identity solutions across different chains. It also enabled us to list ONT and ONG on Uniswap towards the end of the summer. With the turn of the leaves into Fall, we deployed our cross-chain DeID solution on Ethereum, Near, Neo, TRON, Klaytn, Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot. We partnered with Patract Labs late in November to accelerate smart contract ecosystem development on the back of our technical prowess.</p><p>As our third year draws to a close, we have been focused heavily on decentralized finance, otherwise known as DeFi. In September of 2020, the Ontology core team launched <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing.Finance</a>, a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi lending platform. Not only has Wing seen significant growth and engagement in its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with over ten governance votes passed already, but it is also primed to be the first ever DeFi platform to incorporate credit-based lending through Ontology’s unique OScore credit scoring solution. The Wing Inclusive Pool will allow users to under-collateralize assets and lower their interest rates. The Inclusive Pool is the first lending pool of its kind in the DeFi space, as well as the broader blockchain space as a whole. Not only is this incredibly exciting for Wing, but it will serve as an incredible opportunity for the demand of OScore as&nbsp;well.</p> Moving Forward. <p>We have accomplished a lot in our first three years. We tend to overestimate what we can accomplish in one day, but underestimate what we can accomplish in a year. So with that in mind, we want to ensure our community that we are adamantly and tirelessly working towards making the next three years even more successful than the last three years. Specifically, we continue to develop our core features such as ONT ID and OScore, we will seek more partnerships and collaborations with both public-chains and offline enterprises in an attempt to integrate Ontology’s technology and our underlying belief system. We will use Wing as a foundation to demonstrate how credit-based lending can catapult DeFi into the next era; an era of credit backed by&nbsp;OScore.</p><p>Still, throughout it all, we will focus first and foremost on the original vision laid out by our Founder, Li Jun — a vision of complete identity decentralization designed to protect users’ data and grant them the access, control, and autonomy that we believe every user deserves.</p><p>Thank you.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/3-years-in-the-blink-of-an-eye-the-ontology-story-so-far-e2b1298f89f4">3 Years In The Blink Of An Eye: The Ontology Story So Far</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Suomi.fi customer test environment patch is now available. 
<p>As we previously announced:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On 4.9.2020 Suomi.fi announced that the algorithms used in Suomi.fi authentication would be updated to harmonise security and protections to SAML2 authentications to be in line with Traficom’s SAML2 profile recommendations. Initially on 15.10.2020 these changes were applied to the Suomi.fi customer test environment. Then towards the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 the changes will be applied to the Suomi.fi production environment. Please find the original announcement from Suomi.fi&nbsp;<a href="https://palveluhallinta.suomi.fi/en/ajankohtaista/uutiset/5f51e6b9fc2bb907bbb64186">here</a>.”</p></blockquote>
 Resolution 
<p>This patch release permits the continued use of your integrated applications with the Suomi.fi customer test environment. Detailed information about the changes in this release can be found in&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20191/Identity+Server+2019.1+Release+Notes#IdentityServer2019.1ReleaseNotes-SSO8.4.2">SSO 8.4.2 change log</a>.</p>
<p>SSO 8.4.2 can be found in the following location:&nbsp;<a href="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/">https://downloads.ubisecure.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 SSO 8.3.9 – status 
<p>In our original <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/technical-announcements/suomi-fi-saml2-algorithms-are-changing/">announcement</a> in September we offered an estimate release date for the then supported versions of SSO.&nbsp; While we encourage all customers to update their installed applications regularly, we recognise that this is not always possible.&nbsp; At this time SSO 8.3.x is no longer supported, see our <a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/KNB/Supported+versions">Supported Versions</a> table, that said, if you require this patch for your SSO 8.3.x environment, we ask that you please open a ticket with <a href="https://support.ubisecure.com/service-desk/">Support</a> or contact your Account Manager.&nbsp; We will work with you to ensure your environment remains functional with Suomi.fi until such time that you can upgrade to a supported version of SSO.</p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your IDS Platform in a timely manner. We release two to three Identity Server platform releases per year, which include feature improvements, corrections to known deviations and security fixes. We use&nbsp;<a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>&nbsp;on software releases. Minor versions are shows as, SSO 8.x.0 and CustomerID 5.x.0. As needed, we also will release patch version, SSO 8.5.x or CID 5.5.x. Patch versions will contain requested deviation corrections or essential security fixes. Updating your environment regularly is the best way to ensure you have access to the latest security fixes and the quickest access to essential code corrections such as this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.</p>

<p>Munich, November 26th, 2020 – IDnow (www.idnow.io), a leading provider for Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions, publishes the latest figures on changes in fraud methods within the digital environment in its “Cyber Security Report 2020”. The company sees a strong increase of 250% in fraud attempts. Technology and security systems remain ahead of the new trends.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, IDnow sees a general increase in the demand for digital services and processes. With this development, however, digital fraud methods have also changed and, in addition to new scams, show a dramatic increase over the year.</p>
<p>Between March and June, when many countries ordered a lockdown and processes had to move to the digital environment, IDnow saw new developments in identity fraud: Cases of Similarity Fraud increased by 231 percent during this period, Fake-ID fraud rose by 180 percent and Social Engineering attacks by 75 percent.</p>
<p>The fraud methods themselves also show new tricks that are adapted to the current pandemic situation. IDnow saw new cases, especially in social engineering: fraudsters use, for example, applications for government aid programs or, in the context of increased unemployment, false job advertisements as a lure.</p>
<p>“In the past few months, our security system has seen a sharp increase in fraud attempts and numerous new methods against which we protect our customers. We have invested in a comprehensive concept and early indicator detection to stay one step ahead of the fraudsters,” says Armin Bauer, co-founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow. “In addition to technical warning systems, we have set up an anti-fraud team here to do research in Darknet, test fake ads ourselves and exchange information with victims to study the exact approach of the fraudsters. In this way we can detect and avoid attempts of attacks at an early stage.”</p>
<p>Despite the new methods and an increase in fraud attempts, IDnow is pleased to report a constant False Acceptance Rate (FAR) compared to last year.</p>

  <p>When COVID-19 caused a sudden and dramatic increase in the number of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ask-these-questions-before-deploying-remote-access-technology/">remote workers</a>, cloud offerings delivered on their promise of scaling to support business imperatives — including business continuity and disaster recovery and ensuring the availability of key workloads in the midst of change.</p>
<p>In fact, the pandemic and its subsequent business impacts continue to showcase the many benefits of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cloud-shift-impacts-all-it-markets/">cloud </a>services.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cloud adoption will continue to accelerate as key workloads are needed to support remote workers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“By 2022, 75% of organizations that implemented work-from-home policies for their workforce during COVID-19 will retain the remote working options for their employees,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/41344">Ed Anderson</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/apac/symposium-india">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>. “Cloud adoption will continue to accelerate as key workloads are needed to support remote workers and maintain data center operations.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>In a post-pandemic world, there is opportunity to move key workloads to the cloud for the benefits it offers today and to prepare for the next unforeseen disruption.</p>
<p>Organizations of all types should prioritize<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-actions-from-gartner-hype-cycle-for-cloud-security-2020/"> public cloud environments</a> to host critical workloads, including seven key workloads that should be moved to cloud now.</p>
 No. 1: Mobility 
<p>Mobile devices and applications, including access to organizations’ key services and data, are indispensable to remote working. The demand variability related to mobile services is well-aligned with the adaptive cloud operating model, which makes cloud an ideal back end for supporting mobile solutions.</p>
<p>“Select a hyperscale cloud partner that offers robust capabilities in supporting mobile applications,” Anderson said.</p>
<p>Explore the full capabilities of the hosting cloud platform, including the incorporation of cloud-native technology implementations and operating models.</p>
 No. 2: Collaboration and content management 
<p>Microsoft Office 365, iWork and Google G Suite are just three examples of enterprise applications that facilitate <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-distributed-cloud/">collaboration</a>. The success of these applications is a testament to how well-suited cloud-based collaboration is for cloud delivery because of its broad, horizontal applicability to most organizations. Cloud-based collaboration also enables more remote access, and meets resiliency requirements.</p>
<p>In some instances, a complete shift of content management to cloud may not be feasible because of legal and governance concerns, but these are still the exceptions and not the norm.</p>
 No. 3: Videoconferencing 
<p>For remote workers around the world, videoconferencing is one of the most important tools. When COVID-19 hit, the demand for videoconferencing technology doubled and, in some markets, tripled. The highly variable usage patterns and the immense demand for networking bandwidth make hyperscale cloud providers well-suited to reliably deliver videoconferencing solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz05ZDc3MWIzODJhN2QxMWViYjQ1ZDlmNGE0OGE3MTgzZg=="></a></p>
 No. 4: Virtual desktops and remote workstation management 
<p>A virtual desktop solution, or desktop <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-cloud-providers-to-support-customers-through-covid-19/">virtualization</a>, is a tool used by IT administrators to separate the physical desktop system, including laptops, from the desktop environment and applications used by individuals. This is, in fact, one of the most important aspects of enabling remote working — individuals can access their applications and documents and stay connected from any location.</p>
<p>While often delivered as a data center service, cloud-based desktop virtualization has become mainstream and provides a more stable and scalable control point than traditional data-center-based solutions.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-keys-to-leading-large-scale-virtual-meetings/">3 Keys to Leading Large-Scale Virtual Meetings</a></p>
 No. 5: Scale-out applications 
<p>Scale-out applications are those that benefit from adding additional computing resources to satisfy increases in demand. The demand for scale-out applications has inspired organizations to migrate data center applications to cloud platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sudden shift in IT operating models has further accelerated this trend. The success of hyperscale cloud environments established a credible business case for cloud platforms and made cloud the preferred environment for hosting applications with variable usage or scale-out requirements.</p>
 No. 6: Disaster recovery 
<p>Gartner predicts that 50% of organizations will increase their budgets for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-trends-impacting-cloud-adoption-in-2020/">cloud-based disaster recovery</a> (DR) solutions by 2023</p>
<p>“The cost-effectiveness of using a pay-per-use environment to support unexpected failover requirements that cloud-based disaster recovery solutions offer is sought after in current times,” Anderson said.</p>
<p>Many solutions and approaches to support cloud-based DR services create not only demand from customers, but also many options for providers. Now is the time to deploy these solutions.</p>
 No. 7: Business continuity solutions 
<p>Business continuity ensures that business processes continue functioning before, during and after a crisis. In 2020, only 12% of respondents said their business operations were continuing as normal as a result of COVID-19, according to a recent Gartner survey.</p>
<p>Redundancies in the cloud operating environment mean that cloud environments are inherently resilient and offer availability guarantees greater than what most private data centers can support.</p>

Plus, it feels good to send a pull request to fix a bug or add a feature. This year for Thanksgiving, the team thought we would list some of the open source projects that we are thankful for.</p>

 JHipster 

<p><a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">JHipster</a> is a library for generating and deploying modern web applications and microservice architectures. While it was started as a Java API + Angular front-end application generator, it has since become a “super-generator” by being able to generate Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, Node.js, and .NET with front ends in Angular, React, or Vue (among others). Definitely worth giving a look if you’re starting a new application and you want to get it started off on the right foot with some hard-learned best practices.</p>

 Oh My Zsh 

<p>Despite tendencies to shy away from command line work, developers may still find themselves spending a lot of time in a terminal shell. <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">Oh My Zsh</a> has become one of the most popular libraries for configuring the <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/">Zsh</a>. It brings a LOT of extras, like customizing your command prompt and adding pre-packaged alias commands. I tend to use the git command aliases (like <code>gco</code> for <code>git checkout</code>) quite a bit.</p>

 HTTPie 

<p>This command-line HTTP client surpasses others by supporting things like JSON, syntax highlighting, and plugins. It may not be the sexiest project on our list, but it has almost 50k stars on GitHub (as of this post) and lots of watchers and forks. If you find yourself using <code>curl</code> or <code>wget</code> commands a lot, you’ll love <a href="https://httpie.io/">HTTPie</a>.</p>

 JPaseto 

<p>We all know that <a>JWT</a> has become a widely-adopted standard for sending security claims, but the JWT spec is also pretty loose on what cryptographic algorithm to use— even allowing for none at all. PASETOs, on the other hand, are more cryptographically resilient and easier to deploy because they are always symmetrically encrypted with a shared secret key. There aren’t a lot of libraries for creating and verifying PASETO tokens like there are for JWTs. JPaseto is a JVM-based library for creating and verifying PASETO tokens.</p>

 PList Watch 

<p>The dark horse from our list, <a href="https://github.com/catilac/plistwatch">PList Watch</a>,  is a library that watches for preference changes on macOS and has a running log of the commands you could run on a Mac to set the preference that changed recently. Running the command looks something like this:</p>

   As a big fan of open source, I’m loving the fact that .NET Core is cross-platform.

  <p>As a big fan of open source, I’m loving the fact that .NET Core is cross-platform. It opens up endless possibilities, from hobby projects, experiments, and proofs of concept, to massive high-load production applications that run on cost-effective infrastructure with high security and scalability. I usually get the simplest and cheapest $5/month Ubuntu-based virtual private server (VPS) from any cloud platform provider instead of the more complex and expensive container instances or cloud computing services.</p>

<p>I’m going to guide you through the steps on how to set up a .NET Core runtime environment, and how to deploy a .NET Core web application with Okta authentication, once you’ve got an Ubuntu VPS, all using nothing more than the Terminal.</p>

 The Benefits of Using Okta 

<p>Okta is a cloud service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. Using Okta, you don’t have to worry about implementing sign up, login and logout flows manually. In our sample app, we will set up Okta to handle our user management for OAuth sign-in. There are a few tricks to set up .NET Core to work on Linux (especially when it comes to containerization on a host like AWS or Azure), but don’t worry - you will get a good overview in this tutorial.</p>

 Prerequisites 

 
   <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu 20.04+</a> 
   A physical or virtual machine with <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu Desktop</a> 20.04+ 
   For virtualization I recommend <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> 
 

 Install .NET Core SDK/Runtime on Linux 

 .NET Core SDK or Runtime: Which One Is Best 

<p>The .NET Core runtime allows you to run applications on Linux that were made with .NET Core but didn’t include the runtime. With the SDK you can run but also develop and build .NET Core applications. Normally you would need only the runtime in a production environment and the SDK in a development environment.</p>

<p>Today we are going to build and run our sample application on the same machine. So let’s install the .NET Core SDK.</p>

 Adding the Package Repository 

<p>We need to add Microsoft’s package signing key to make the package repository trusted by the system.</p>

<p>Open Terminal and run the following commands:</p>

   <code>wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
</code>   

   <code>sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
</code>   

 Installing the SDK 

   <code>sudo apt-get update; \
  sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https &amp;&amp; \
  sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
  sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-3.1
</code>   

<p>To make sure the installation was successful, run:</p>

   <code>dotnet --version
</code>   

<p>The output should be the installed .NET Core version.</p>

 Building and Running a .NET Core application on Linux 

<p>We are going to use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools">.NET Core CLI</a> to build and run the sample application.</p>

 Copying the source code 

<p>I have prepared a sample application for the sake of this example. Let’s use <code>git</code> to copy it to our machine from GitHub.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-netcore3-deploy-linux-example okta
</code>   

 Building the .NET Core Application 

<p>Enter the folder where we just copied the source code:</p>

   <code>cd okta
</code>   

<p>Run the build:</p>

   <code>dotnet build
</code>   

<p>The first build might take a while. Then the output should be something like:</p>

 <code>Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)
</code> 

 Running the .NET Core Application 

<p>To run the application in Development mode, type:</p>

   <code>dotnet run
</code>   

<p>Running the sample application will fail because we need to set up Okta login first.</p>

<p>Output:</p>

 <code>Unhandled exception. System.ArgumentNullException: Replace {clientId} with the client ID of your Application. You can copy it from the Okta Developer Console in the details for the Application you created. Follow these instructions to find it: https://bit.ly/finding-okta-app-credentials (Parameter 'ClientId')
</code> 

 Quickly Set Up Okta Login 

<p>Log in to your <a href="https://login.okta.com">Okta Developer account</a></p>

<p>Navigate to <code>Applications</code>, then select <code>Add Application</code>.
</p>

<p>Select Web as a platform:
</p>

<p>On the next screen add the following:
Login redirect URIs: <code>https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback</code></p>

<p>Logout redirect URIs: <code>https://localhost:5001/signout/callback</code>
</p>

<p>When finished, click Done.
</p>

<p>Take note of your client credentials ( Client ID and Client secret).
</p>

<p>Open <code>appsettings.json</code> in your favorite code editor and add your credentials.
</p>

<p>You can find your Org URL in the top right corner of the Dashboard:
</p>

<p>Now the sample app is ready to run:</p>

   <code>dotnet run
</code>   

<p>Output:</p>

 <code>info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Development
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: /home/ubuntu/okta
</code> 

<p>You can now open a browser window at <code>http://localhost:5000</code> to see the application running. Also you can try logging with Okta in the top right corner.</p>

 Troubleshooting 

<p>In case you run into a Correlation Error after logging in with Okta, you need to manually set the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute to <code>None</code>, and enable SSL (HTTPS) on your server. Check out more about how SameSite affects your apps in <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/09/28/adapt-dotnet-app-for-samesite-fix">this article</a>.</p>

 Takeaways 

<p>Developing .NET Core applications on Linux is not the stuff of science fiction any more. Since Microsoft started moving away from closed-source and platform-dependent solutions, a Linux-based development environment has its advantages. I believe tools like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider">Rider</a>—also available on every platform—are mature enough to make them reasonable competitors of the classic Visual Studio IDE for Windows. I’ve successfully used Linux as my primary development environment for .NET Core for a few years now. Give it a try yourself and let us know what your experience has been in the comments below!</p>

 The GiD Report #136 — Apple’s App Store concession, Filecoin on the up and&nbsp;up <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-135-why-groups-is-the-future-of-the-internet-4e5d4e9f6007">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Apple cuts App Store&nbsp;fee  Apple v. Facebook on privacy and&nbsp;data  Filecoin is on the up and&nbsp;up  Congress v. Big Tech moderation  Stuff happens   1. Apple made news last week when it announced it would cut its App Store fee to 15 percent for most developers (via&nbsp;Mitja). <p>Objectively speaking, it’s a move that will have minimal impact on its bottom line. Apple makes most of its money from its top users — large companies that will still be paying 30&nbsp;percent.</p><p>As Mitja (<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>)&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>It’s not a big concession either: an estimated 98 percent of developers would be eligible for the 15 percent cut, but those developers generated just 5 percent of the App Store’s total revenue last year. So in total 2.5% out of&nbsp;$50B.</blockquote><p>And so Apple’s detractors will paint this as a PR move. What Apple critics are&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook online summit, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called his company’s effort an act of civil disobedience: “When a contract goes outside the bounds of the law, as Apple is doing, and has such a negative and pervasive impact on society, it’s everybody’s duty to&nbsp;fight.”</blockquote><blockquote>As for Apple’s rate cut, Sweeney said it was “a fantastic change” for many small developers. “Who it’s not awesome for is consumers,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson: “Trying to split the App Store opposition with conditional charity concessions, they — a $2T conglomerate — get to paint any developer making more than $1m as greedy, always wanting more. As clever as it’s&nbsp;sick.”</blockquote><blockquote>Coalition for App Fairness: “Apple’s announcement doesn’t even begin to rectify the abuse and monopoly behavior developers have to endure in the App Store. We need fundamental change.”</blockquote>Photo: Brett&nbsp;Jordan<p>From a more positive perspective: Baby&nbsp;steps.</p><p>It’s notable that Apple is conceding any ground at all — especially for a company that’s historically known to stick to its guns and double down in the face of even intense scrutiny over its product choices and company practices.</p><p>Apple’s in a different situation these days. Once a David to Microsoft’s goliath, Apple is now the 500 lb gorilla and so the underdog attitude isn’t as well received.</p><p>What’s clear is that Tim Cook and co. see this as a long term challenge that isn’t going away anytime&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1a046644-73d2-4df0-9ab3-bf87a1894e54">the&nbsp;FT</a>:</p><blockquote>Apple has for the first time warned investors that it faces a “material” financial risk from the regulatory pressure on its App Store, a sum that could potentially run into billions of dollars. The iPhone maker’s latest annual report, published on Friday, is peppered with new warnings and disclosures about the legal risks rising up around its business in a marked change from last year’s filing, as it was forced to acknowledge the growing political hostility against big tech companies.</blockquote><p>Ultimately, this is neither here nor there for GlobaliD. As Greg (<a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>) notes, “we’ll be looking to build our own rails regardless.”</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction">Apple will reduce App Store cut to 15 percent for most developers starting January&nbsp;1st</a>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1a046644-73d2-4df0-9ab3-bf87a1894e54">Apple warns of ‘material’ risk from App Store legal challenges</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-to-lower-commissions-for-small-businesses-on-app-store-a385a49b-9558-411d-bd1b-6cb57f2d44cc.html">Apple to lower commissions for small businesses on App&nbsp;Store</a>   2. In other Apple news, privacy continues to be a point of differentiation — particularly regarding updates to how advertisers can access user data on the iPhone. Here’s the latest. TL;DR: Facebook is not&nbsp;happy. <p>The Information:</p><blockquote>An Apple executive slammed Facebook for having a “disregard for user privacy” after the social media firm criticized ad targeting restrictions coming to the&nbsp;iPhone.</blockquote><blockquote>In an open letter to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other privacy watchdog groups, Apple’s senior director of global privacy, Jane Horvath, said Apple was making it harder for advertisers to track people across iPhone apps because “we simply think tracking should be transparent and under user control.” The coming changes, which Apple delayed in September after Facebook and others pushed back, will require an app to gain consent before using data about a user to inform ad targeting elsewhere.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook has been the most vocal critic of the change, pointing out that Apple’s own apps aren’t subject to the same rules, and arguing that restricting the ability to target will disproportionately impact small businesses that rely on companies like Facebook to reach consumers. In her open letter, Apple’s Horvath said the company doesn’t individually track users for ad targeting or work with third parties to do&nbsp;so.</blockquote><blockquote>“By contrast, Facebook and others have a very different approach to targeting,” she wrote. “Facebook executives have made clear their intent is to collect as much data as possible across both first and third party products to develop and monetize detailed profiles of their users, and this disregard for user privacy continues to expand to include more of their products.”</blockquote><p>Facebook’s response:</p><blockquote>In response, Facebook spokeswoman Ashley Zandy said in a statement that, “the truth is Apple has expanded its business into advertising and through its upcoming iOS 14 changes is trying to move the free internet into paid apps and services where they profit. As a result, they are using their dominant market position to self-preference their own data collection while making it nearly impossible for their competitors to use the same data. They claim it’s about privacy, but it’s about&nbsp;profit.”</blockquote><p>Here’s the thing, Facebook has a point. Apple’s motives around privacy might be genuine, but they’re ultimately also self&nbsp;serving.</p><p>What’s clear though is that the issue of privacy is now structurally making its way into our digital platforms, giving further credence to GlobaliD’s vision around self-sovereign identity.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/19/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit/">State, federal antitrust lawsuits likely to challenge Facebook for buying rivals and weaponizing data</a>  <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">How the U.S. Military Buys Location Data from Ordinary&nbsp;Apps</a>  <p>3. Filecoin is on the up and up since its launch (via&nbsp;Greg).</p><p><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/84121/filecoin-power-lending-block-rewards">The Block</a>:</p><blockquote>The total storage power on Filecoin has grown over 40% since a Chinese miners’ standoff in mid-October, which resulted in an upgrade to the network’s block rewards and a surge in FIL&nbsp;lending.</blockquote><blockquote>Data shows the decentralized storage blockchain, which went live on October 15, has now nearly 850 pebibyte (PiB) of effective storage, compared to 600 PiB seen around October 19 when a majority of Chinese Filecoin miners had either significantly slowed down or completely halted their growth&nbsp;plan</blockquote><p>Filecoin is cool because it’s one of the few big blockchain projects out there that promise real utility. It’s also a testament to totally new approaches to a very traditional problem in data&nbsp;storage.</p> 4. This week in moderation — we had part II of Congress v. Twitter and Facebook. <p>The Information:</p><blockquote>Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee took turns blasting Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey over their companies’ content moderation policies, the second time in less than a month that the two CEOs have testified before hostile lawmakers.</blockquote><blockquote>Democrats and Republicans were critical of the companies’ content policies for opposite reasons. Republicans want less moderation of false statements by President Trump and other sources of misinformation. Democrats want the platforms to do more to block unsubstantiated claims.</blockquote><blockquote>At the heart of the hearing is a debate over the future of Section 230, a provision of the Communications Decency Act which grants broad legal immunity to online companies — protecting them lawsuits over content posted by users. Both Zuckerberg and Dorsey said they would be open to some changes in the&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham also questioned whether the social media offerings were addictive and a threat to public health. Dorsey said one remedy would be to give users greater control over the algorithms that determine what they see online. Zuckerberg said Facebook is not built with the goal of making it addictive to&nbsp;users.</blockquote><p>In other Jack Dorsey-related news, Twitter is also getting into&nbsp;Groups:</p><blockquote>On a call with reporters, Twitter executives said the social network is also testing an audio-only group call feature called Spaces. The feature allows users to invite others to participate in or listen to audio chats — behavior that could lead to high amounts of time spent in the app. Clubhouse and a slew of other audio-based social media startups are working on similar experiences after seeing growing interest during pandemic lockdowns this&nbsp;year.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/senates-tech-ceo-interrogation-shows-parties-are-worlds-apart-822863bd-e007-4a52-8378-298995ef82c7.html">Senate’s tech CEO interrogation shows parties are worlds&nbsp;apart</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqjvQlCOq4">Matt Stoller: Obama’s HYPOCRISY On Big Tech&nbsp;Warnings</a>   5.

					 <p>Each of these people call the elephant something different because they each have a different perspective. When you think about it, an elephant&nbsp;really&nbsp;is like a big wall with a snake and spears coming out of its face, trees for legs, and a rope-like tail. Without a concise name for the sum of its parts, its meaning can be communicated, although imperfectly, by a description of each part individually¹.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Similarly, there is a new category of technology and business solutions that seeks to solve the proverbial “dog on the internet” identity problem for individuals, organizations, and connected devices. Most often called ‘SSI’ (for ‘self-sovereign identity’) or ‘decentralized identity’, these terms are often used in the same way ‘elephant’ is used—with a wealth of meaning and nuance not apparent to beginners. A review of the different terms used to reference SSI provides a helpful introduction.</p>

					 <p>‘SSI’ is the noun I’m using throughout this post to reference this new category of solutions, although there are three primary candidates used in the market today, each with a different emphasis.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Self-sovereign identity
 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a movement that claims digital identity should be just as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation. SSI is the combination of decentralized identity and trust over IP (both defined below) but also encompasses other technologies and business solutions to enable its purpose. ‘Self-sovereign identity’ was the first category-defining term to catch on, and therefore the most widely used today. But the first terms to catch on are not always the best nor the longest-lasting; groups at industry conferences² have even convened to try to come up with an alternative to ‘SSI’, to no avail.&nbsp;<a href="http://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>&nbsp;is a nonprofit that champions this name with its mission “identity for all”.<br><br></p><p>Many governments, actual sovereigns (noun), strongly dislike the term ‘sovereign’ (adjective). Businesses seeking to sell SSI solutions to governments often steer clear as well. While the name ‘SSI’ does a good job at describing the human application and aspiration of decentralized identity technologies, it isn’t clear to most people how B2B and IoT use cases fit in this framework. Finally, I’ve&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@rileyparkerhughes/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">spoken before</a>&nbsp;about how the term is too tightly associated with the blockchain world.<br><br></p><p>Some of the problems associated with the word ‘sovereign’ could go away if ‘SSI’ becomes the de facto term as I’m using it throughout this post. As identity expert Drummond Reed frequently points out, we use acronyms every day whose full names we don’t know — ATM, SMS, HTTP, ROTC, AIDS, OTC, FAQ or even GEICO or AT&amp;T, for example (if you knew the full names for all of those, kudos ).</p>

					 <p>‘Decentralized identity’ is the second most-used term to describe the category. Decentralized identity’s emphasis is much more technical in nature and seems to focus on traditional IAM use cases.&nbsp;<a href="http://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>&nbsp;(DIF) is the primary industry association &amp; standards body championing this term.<br><br></p><p>The word ‘decentralized’ can feel a bit vague because it describes what SSI is&nbsp;not (i.e., not centralized) but doesn’t explain what it is. For that reason, one needs to explain the benefits of decentralization separately:<br><br></p>  Locus of control: Accessing data from centralized databases, as occurs with other identity tech, requires access and permission from the database administrator—not necessarily consent from the subject of the data. Thus, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/software-vendor-says-data-breach-exposed-nearly-28-million-texas-drivers-license-records/ar-BB1b022l">data breaches</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dmv-drivers-license-data-database-integrity-department-motor-vehicles-1458141">misuse of data</a>&nbsp;have led to people demanding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/01/21/we-need-to-own-our-data-as-a-human-right-and-be-compensated-for-it">ownership of their data</a>. With SSI, the data subject is the one with control to consent to sharing of their data.  Autonomy: As companies die and policies change, it’s helpful to avoid single points of failure. SSI wallets are transportable between different vendors, avoiding vendor lock-in. More on autonomy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">here</a>&nbsp;and wallet portability&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">here</a>.  Public key infrastructure (PKI): Much of SSI hinges on public/private key cryptography. Trust in traditional PKI systems is rooted in certificate authorities. Identifiers are rented out by ICANN via the DNS system—a costly and centralized approach to PKI. Blockchains and other technologies enable decentralized PKI upon which SSI can be built.  <p><br>On one hand, ‘decentralized identity’ doesn’t capture the ideals of autonomy and existence that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">this blog post</a> and much of the industry appreciates about the term ‘self-sovereign’. On the other hand, organizations and connected devices don’t have their own autonomy—they must be controlled by people—so ‘decentralized identity’ may be a better fit for those use cases. In addition, while SSI decentralizes power&nbsp;associated with identity, it&nbsp;centralizes&nbsp;the storage and access to it (in a digital wallet instead of various databases across the web), which may make ‘decentralized’ a confusing word from a user experience perspective.</p>

					 <p>Trust over IP (ToIP) is the newest term used to describe the category. It’s less focused on the traditional authentication/access management/directory services definition of digital identity and more focused on trustable data/credentials. This is a more attractive term than ‘sovereign’ for governments; John Jordan, ED of Trust Services for the government of British Columbia, coined the term and is the current leader of the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a>, which focuses on building governance frameworks for trust ecosystems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like ‘Voice over IP’ (VoIP) standardized a way to securely relay audio over the internet, so too does ‘Trust over IP’ seek to standardize a way to share trustable data over the internet. But the word ‘trust’ is fraught with baggage in today’s society and has caused pushback from the identity community and beyond. It’s too early to tell whether the term ‘ToIP’ will catch on more broadly and how the market will react.</p>

					 <p>In addition to the category-defining names above, you may hear this technology referred to in a number of other, more niche ways.

					 <p>SSI enables data portability, which has led to it sometimes being called ‘portable identity’. Portable comes from the Latin&nbsp;portare&nbsp;meaning carry, which is also behind the word&nbsp;transport&nbsp;or&nbsp;port. It really means that you can take something from one place or context to another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our real-world identity is portable. I can take my driver’s license from the DMV and the context of public roadways to the financial sector and get access to banking services. I can take my university transcript from the education domain to an employer to show my qualifications for a job. SSI makes this possible online. Issuers of credentials, in my experience, feel this dynamic most strongly; after all, anything they issue can be taken and shared with other parties by the holder if they so choose.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Multi-source identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>My physical, leather wallet has several credentials inside from a number of different sources. The SSI wallet on my phone is the same way; any number of organizations can issue credentials to it. I can then share information from any combination of them to prove things about myself; thus the identity I’m presenting can be comprised of multiple sources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its strengths, multi-source identity falls short of describing some of the other important properties of SSI. For example, a Facebook Wallet or other proprietary, centralized system could be used as the basis for a multi-source identity system that provides virtually no autonomy or control to the end-user³. For more on how ‘multi-source’ relates to ‘self-sovereign’, check out a great blog post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">here</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Self-managed credentials
 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>While ‘multi-source’ describes how credentials get into a wallet, ‘self-managed’ alludes to how credentials are controlled, stored, and shared. This shouldn’t imply that each end-user&nbsp;must hold their own keys or worry about storing their credentials locally—they could theoretically contract that out to a vendor or configure some AI to assist—but it does mean that the end-user is the one in the driver’s seat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may see ‘self-owned identity’ used instead of ‘self-managed’, but you won’t see that from me or most of my peers. Although many of the implications of ‘self-owned’ (possession, control, accountability) are common with ‘self-managed’ or ‘self-controlled’, the legal construct of ‘ownership’ (property rights, right to sell, exclusivity, etc) is a dangerous one in relation to identity⁴. Because of these nuances, ‘self-managed’ and its variations aren’t widely used.</p>

					 <p>The term ‘user-controlled proofs’ is a yet unadopted term coined by Kim Cameron, author of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">“The Laws of Digital Identity”</a>, seeking to be a bit more technically accurate than terms like ‘self-sovereign’. Indeed, in an SSI model, people not only collect credentials from multiple sources, but also share information from those credentials in the form of a ‘proof’. Those proofs can be verified independently, virtually, and instantly by anyone they’re shared with. While a verifier can specify&nbsp;their&nbsp;requirements in a request to a user, the user has control of whether and how they respond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>User-controlled proofs is a good term to describe the holder’s perspective of the interaction they have with the verifier. However it’s quite technical and would likely face adoption challenges when presented to the average identity holder⁵.</p>

					 <p>Recently coined by&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/less-identity-65f65d87f56b">Tim Bouma</a>, Legally-enabled Self-sovereign (LESS) Identity&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/can-less-be-more/">stands in contrast</a>&nbsp;to the ‘crypto-anarchist’ notion of a trustless self-sovereign identity⁶. LESS implies that the identity presented to a verifier is backed by a legal framework. Perhaps it’s a credential issued by a government or regulated institution. Or maybe there’s an existing legal framework that’s represented with a credential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LESS enables verifiers to build trust beyond just the cryptographic assurance of a credential’s validity. Much of the work of the ToIP Foundation on governance frameworks is seeking to reinforce this notion. All of the projects I’m aware of with real traction are LESS Identity.</p>

					 <p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">Trinsic’s introductory SSI post</a>, I explain how real-world human identity is the combination of intrinsic (Who am I? How do I identify myself?)&nbsp;and&nbsp;extrinsic (How does the state identify me? What does my university say that I have achieved?) factors. Because that’s how the real-world works, I&nbsp;love&nbsp;the name ‘life-like identity’ to describe SSI. To drive the point home, continue that logical train of thought to ‘login with Google’. Wouldn’t it be weird if instead of buying from a store directly, there was a Google representative at every register who authenticated you and mediated the transaction? Especially if they were also recording everything you say and do and sending it back to their boss to be reviewed and analyzed. That would never fly in the real world. And I don’t think it’ll be the norm online anymore in 10 years either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Life-like identity is unfortunately not widely-used, but in many ways, it is a good umbrella term for everything else we’ve talked about in this post. This is really what we’re trying to create with this technology; solutions that respect human dignity in the interactions they have daily, just like exist in person. For more on this term, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">this post</a>.</p>

					 <p>‘Self-sovereign identity’ is an imperfect name for an imperfect, but rapidly growing and promising new category of technology and business solutions. I think it’s the best term on the table; but ultimately, the way to refer to the category will be defined over time as the dust settles through real-world deployments. The name that will emerge will likely not be the first one, but the one with the least negative baggage that balances being specific to the technology but broad enough to encompass all its variations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Taken collectively, each of the names listed in this post overlap with others in interesting ways, creating a more full picture of SSI. For example, could you have SSI without multi-source identity? Or without user-controlled proofs? Could this system ever work unless it was legally-enabled? And if we succeed at adopting SSI ubiquitously but it doesn’t bring more autonomy and dignity to our interactions online as we do in real life, did we really succeed?</p>

					   The elephant example is fun, but this phenomenon isn’t just found in cartoons; examples are also found throughout the world. Look at religions for example. The central figure of Christianity is called a variety of names in the Bible, including Savior, Son of God, Shepherd, Messiah, and more. These names each communicate different aspects of the meaning assigned to the 5-letter word ‘Jesus’. In Islam, God is believed to have&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Islam">99 names</a>.  <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">IIW 30</a>, book of proceedings, page 275 for notes on the discussion  Of course, Facebook could also build a wallet that supported individual privacy and autonomy if they wanted to! They’re just the boogyman for this example.  I own my car, so I can legally sell it (or parts of it) or rent it out in exchange for money. Can I sell my identity? Or rent out my driver’s license? No, I can’t. Nor should I be able to; identity and personal data are not property to be bargained with, but an intrinsic part of the self. Bodily autonomy is a closer metaphor for credentials than property ownership. Can you legally chop off and sell your arm? No, but you still generally have autonomy to act of your own volition with regard to your own body. So you don’t&nbsp;own your body; you use it, control it, etc.—likewise for your identity. For a better analysis on this, see <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/06/26/why-data-ownership-is-the-wrong-approach-to-protecting-privacy/">here</a>.  One objection some people take to this term is the word ‘user’ which is seen in some circles as objectifying or dehumanizing. “Only two industries have users, drugs and tech,” so the saying goes. On the other hand, I’m&nbsp;using&nbsp;a keyboard to type this sentence. I’m also&nbsp;using&nbsp;an operating system and&nbsp;using&nbsp;a word processor application. So I don’t mind referring to people who use SSI and/or digital wallet products as ‘users’. So although this name hasn’t caught on, I really like it.  In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzM_Brpk95E&amp;t=2352s">talk early this year</a>, Christopher Allen urges the community to keep the trustless identity in mind to keep in mind for more vulnerable populations who are disenfranchised by the legal regimes of which they’re a part.

<p>JK, that’s not what this post is about. </p>
      
<p>Actually that’s the title of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/we-cant-get-rid-of-passwords/">an article written in 2016</a>. </p>
      
<p>I enjoy reading stories like these. They remind us and reinforce just how far passwordless technology has come. We can’t knock the author for claiming that the world can’t get rid of passwords. Just think about the general mindset at the time. Password-based login was all the world really knew… Apple hadn’t even launched Face ID yet. Most people were still wary of using biometrics in general. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/fido2-web-authentication/">Was FIDO2 even a thing</a>?</p>
      
<p>2016 was a very different time. And despite the pessimistic tone, ZDNet managed to get a lot right. A few interesting things stand out from this piece.</p>
      
  
      
<p></p>
      
 No Mention of FIDO Authentication Standards 
      
<p>This is a key piece missing from the <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/puzzles">passwordless puzzle</a>. 2016 was still early for the passwordless movement and there were very few companies that had deployed FIDO authentication at scale. People were still exploring alternative approaches such as <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/standard/2410-2019.html">BOPS</a> and <a href="https://www.hypr.com/multiparty-computation-mpc/">MPC</a>. It wouldn’t be until 2018 when FIDO2 and WebAuthn became adopted as W3C standards. That’s when the world realized FIDO would usher in a global movement away from passwords.</p>
      
<p>Today FIDO standards are powering strong authentication for millions of users across billions of devices. Apple has introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301509/apple-safari-14-browser-face-touch-id-logins-webauthn-fido2">WebAuthn</a> into the iOS ecosystem. Android has embedded FIDO2 at the device <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/news-your-google-android-7-phone-is-now-a-fido2-security-key/">level</a>. The FIDO Alliance now boasts hundreds of members consisting of industry leaders such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and many more enterprises going passwordless.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Biometrics Were Not Meant to Replace Passwords 
      
<p>The article mentions that “In theory, you should be able to use your fingerprint or face or iris or something else like that to log in to third parties, and some of this has become realistic with Apple’s Touch ID and Windows Hello, but there are a lot of different potential biometrics and they’re available on different platforms and it will be a very long time before a user could use biometrics to the exclusion of passwords.”</p>
      
<p>This is spot on. At the time it was unclear (to most people) how biometrics were supposed to replace passwords. Some folks even thought that by simply activating Touch ID they had magically become “passwordless.” </p>
      
<p>It was unclear that mobile biometrics were primarily a passwordless user experience feature that would need to be married with open standards to actually eliminate passwords. We outlined this in our 2016 paper, introducing the world to <a href="https://get.hypr.com/true-password-less-security-white-paper">True Passwordless Security</a>. It has been a thrill to see this vision come to life as many organizations today are following this trend of combining Touch/Face ID with open standards and Public-Key Encryption.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Over-Analyzing the Role of SAML, OAuth, and OIDC 
      
<p>The article spends some time rationalizing the role of these standards for passwordless authentication. This thought process isn’t misguided, it just isn’t what these standards were meant to accomplish.</p>
      
<p>It’s true that since the widespread adoption of Single Sign On (SSO) standards such as SAML and OAuth/OIDC, the authentication industry successfully reduced the number of passwords people need to remember. Unfortunately, the popular Identity Provider (IdP) platforms have built their entire product lines on top of the password. We explore this concept in our white paper on <a href="https://get.hypr.com/decoupling-authentication-from-identity">Decoupling Authentication from Identity</a>.</p>
      
<p>The article is correct in scrutinizing the role of these standards, stopping just short of saying that authorization is NOT authentication. While it gets these ideas right conceptually, it fails to acknowledge the existence of strong authentication standards such as FIDO. We shouldn’t fault ZDNet for not “predicting the future” correctly — it’s just interesting to see how at the time the conversation was all about identity and not authentication. </p>
      
<p></p>
      
 There Were No Proof Points 
      
<p>Let’s be real about this. At the time there were no major <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/success-stories/">case studies of passwordless deployments</a>. Even HYPR was just rolling out at some of our earliest customers. Fast forward to 2020 and we have Microsoft proclaiming more than 150 Million people use passwordless login on Windows every month. That’s not even counting the billions of Android users with embedded biometrics, FIDO2 enabled devices, or the many iOS users who are using passwordless authentication every day. An Apple stat from <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/04/19/average-iphone-user-unlocks-device-80-times-per-day-89-use-touch-id-apple-says">2016</a> suggested people use Touch ID more than 80 times a day. That number is probably even higher today. </p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Calling Password Managers “a Hack” 
      
<p>The article gets this right in that it doesn’t suggest password managers will solve the password problem — only that they are a good enough band-aid for now. That is rapidly changing with some of the younger generations getting less and less exposure to the password manager. Just this summer we ran a study on password manager usage among millennials — with some <a href="https://www.hypr.com/study-password-manager-usage-millennials/">surprising results</a>. </p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Underestimating the User Experience 
      
<p>This is the only major flaw in the article that needs to be pointed out. The piece doesn’t mention User Experience (UX) at all. Not once. That’s not their fault as the common misconception at the time was that passwordless was purely a security initiative. </p>
      
<p>In reality it is the improved UX of password elimination is what has been driving its adoption and innovation. People want a faster and easier login. They want a consistent experience. They want to be extra secure without having to actually do anything extra. The reality is that the elimination of passwords has more to do with people’s desire for a better login and less to do with the actual security benefit. We can’t fault anyone in 2016 for missing this point, as it isn’t terribly obvious to everyone in 2020 either.</p>
      
<blockquote><p>So no, I don’t have a happy ending for you. I see password proliferation, password confusion and password breaches in our future as far as the eye can see. The best solution for now is a password manager, hack though it may be.</p>-ZDNet</blockquote>
      
<p>The article ends with this.</p>
      
<p>A lot can change in 4 years.</p>

<p>The Okta CLI is a new tool we’ve created here at Okta. It’s designed to streamline the process of creating new Okta accounts, registering apps, and getting started. Wwwhhaaattt, you might say?! That’s right, it’s super awesome!</p>
 
 
<p>To show you how much fun it is, I <a href="https://youtu.be/dURkaz0kBSU">created a screencast that shows you how to use it</a>.</p>
 
 

 
 
<p>For those that would rather read than watch, please read on.</p>
 
 
 Install the Okta CLI 
 
 
<p>You can find the website for the Okta CLI at <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">cli.okta.com</a>. This site has instructions on how to use common package managers on macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also use cURL:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli/master/cli/src/main/scripts/install.sh | bash</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Once you have the Okta CLI installed, you’ll need <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11 installed</a> to run your Spring Boot app.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Spring Boot App 
 
 
<p>To create a secure Spring Boot app with Okta, run <code>okta start spring-boot</code>. You’ll need to verify your email and set a password as part of this.</p>
 
 






If you already have an Okta account, you can run <code>okta login</code> first.



 
 
<p>This will download our <a href="https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-spring-boot-sample">Okta Spring Boot sample</a>, register your app on Okta, and configure it by adding your Okta settings to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Follow the instructions that are printed out for you. To summarize:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd spring-boot
./mvnw spring-boot:run</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, open your browser to <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code>. You’ll likely be logged in straight away and see your name printed on the screen.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you use another browser, or an incognito window, you’ll be prompted to sign in first.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you open <code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/Application.java</code>, you’ll see the Java code that’s used to render your name. You might appreciate how Spring Security makes authentication with OpenID Connect easy.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>@RestController
static class SimpleRestController {
    @GetMapping("/")
    String sayHello(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser) {
        return "Hello: " + oidcUser.getFullName();
    }
}</code>

 Polkadot’s ecosystem project, Patract Labs, will benefit from Ontology’s security and data management expertise <p>Ontology, the high performance, open-source blockchain specializing in digital identity and data, has announced a new collaboration with the <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> Ecosystem Project, a sharded blockchain that seamlessly connects multiple chains together in a single network. The joint venture will see Ontology develop the underlying infrastructure for <a href="https://patractlabs.com/">Patract Labs</a>, a developer of solutions for Polkadot’s Parachain Contract Ecosystem. Today’s announcement is the latest step in Ontology’s ongoing mission to build a parachain on Polkadot.</p><p>Commenting on the partnership, Li Jun, Founder of Ontology said, “The smart contract ecosystem is experiencing exponential growth — a boom that needs to be balanced with the development of comprehensive security solutions and high levels of performance in order to ensure its future success. As a result, we are proud to partner with Patract Labs to provide cutting-edge software to ensure that these requirements are met. In choosing to partner with Ontology, Patract Labs will not only benefit from our industry-renowned blockchain technology, but also from Ontology’s expertise in ensuring the highest level of security, scrupulous verification methods, and trusted data management technology. This especially applies to a Decentralized Identity (DeID) perspective. We look forward to working with Polkadot and the Patract Labs team to develop an industry-leading smart contract ecosystem.”</p><p>Patract Labs, which provides developer tools and builds solutions to grow the Polkadot Wasm-JIT smart contract ecosystem, was <a href="https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1306632441449394182?s=20">recently announced</a> as one of the first infrastructures to be funded by the Polkadot Treasury. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by Ontology and Patract Labs will see Ontology provide the Polkadot ecosystem with its underlying blockchain infrastructure Wasm-JIT, the smart contract virtual machine with high speed and performance developed in house by the company. Ontology will also help Patract Labs to integrate this Wasm-JIT technology into its Patract Network based on the existing FRAME Contracts provided by the W3F and Parity, to ensure successful technical development and implementation. Finally, Patract Labs will support Ontology in developing and deploying a transfer bridge pallet on the Patract&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Lipeng Yue, Founder of Patract Labs, said, “Joining forces with Ontology is a seminal development for Patract Labs. The technology and expertise Ontology can provide us with, in addition to the immeasurable help offered to us by Polkadot, will ensure our position as a highly competitive disruptor in the realm of smart contract solutions. We look forward to supporting Ontology in their business development efforts and building a comprehensive smart contract ecosystem with some of the best in the&nbsp;field.”</p> About Patract&nbsp;Labs <p><a href="https://patractlabs.com/">Patract Labs</a> provides solutions for Polkadot’s Parachain Contract ecosystem, provides developers with free development tools and services, supports smart contract parachains within Polkadot’s public blockchain network and the enterprise smart contract consortium blockchain based on Polkadot technology, and will also establish an ecological fund to promote the further prosperity of the Polkadot contract ecosystem.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-and-patract-labs-join-forces-to-accelerate-smart-contract-ecosystem-development-988de9978b9b">Ontology And Patract Labs Join Forces To Accelerate Smart Contract Ecosystem Development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A discussion with Markus Perdrizat, CEO of Swiss Crypto Vault and Head Custody at Bitcoin&nbsp;Suisse <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perdrizat/?originalSubdomain=ch">Markus Perdrizat</a>, CEO of <a href="https://swisscryptovault.ch/">Swiss Crypto Vault</a> and Head Custody at <a href="https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/">Bitcoin Suisse</a>, we learn about his long career in security, the importance of standards and his vision for Web3&nbsp;custody.</p> Markus, please introduce yourself and tell us about what you&nbsp;do. <p>Markus Perdrizat: I am the CEO of Swiss Crypto Vault and Head Custody at Bitcoin Suisse, responsible for more than $1B USD worth of crypto assets in highly secured custody for crypto assets. Prior to that, I was leading PwC’s Blockchain Competence Centre in Switzerland. We helped grow that over four years to help clients build secure custody and trading desks and also audit trading desks, brokerage and custody for our audit clients. At the beginning of my career, I was working at a major Swiss bank responsible for decentralized databases and data management. So I understand the challenges of having a distributed database around the globe — and what it means to provide secure, safe and high performance access to&nbsp;data.</p> What would you say was the biggest challenge in your career until&nbsp;now? <p>Markus: It’s about helping users, including professional users, understand the key properties of the system. Especially in the blockchain space, when can professional companies start using blockchain as a reliable store of financial assets or as a processing layer? How do you assess the quality of a project team working on a technology stack?</p><p>And that’s all saying that we spent a lot of time on both at PwC, but obviously also now at Bitcoin Suisse. We help our clients as a pathfinder make sense of what’s going on in decentralized finance and when it is the right time to make use of all these modern and new ways of transacting on the blockchain.</p> Decentralization versus centralization for data -, cyber — and crypto security. What’s your take on&nbsp;this? <p>Markus: What we see now is a changing society where people and commercial entities are becoming more decentralized, working from home around the globe, being more focused on the individual.And that is a change from the past, where it was more about society, family and corporate entities. This changing society also requires a change in technology and blockchain is very well positioned to support this change. And that’s why now for the last 12 years, we’ve all been talking about Bitcoin and blockchain and bringing more of the workloads into blockchain. However, we’re still at a very early stage and there are many very interesting projects out there, including Ocean.</p><p>There is a challenge in ramping up the workload that’s going into blockchain. And here we comeback to the biggest challenge I mentioned earlier, knowing where these blockchain projects are and are they ready to take on serious workloads. At the beginning, everybody will just dip their toe into these new projects, put in some tiny workload, run proofs-of-concept.</p><p>As the technologies mature, as the marketplace becomes bigger, as the security stacks or the security cracks get more experienced and build solutions up to years and tens of years, decades, trust will become&nbsp;bigger.</p><p>We see that the same shift has happened in the old world prior to blockchain, when the Internet first came on. IP-based communication started about 50 years ago. And it has taken 30 years to really come to the point where people know and trust running workloads over the Internet. And it has taken another 20 years for cloud computing to run computer workloads and storage in a more decentralized way over the Internet. And it is going to take blockchain-based computing and data processing a similar amount of time from the inception of having the first ideas about business models on top of blockchain to actually being a reliable and trusted provider of data and computing capacity.</p> What’s the main advantage of decentralization? <p>Markus: It’s obviously supporting changes in society, the shift in society that I mentioned. The main advantage of decentralization is that each participant in the decentralized economy is able to participate in exactly the way that they would like to participate. As a single person, I have a different use case, different access pattern, different requirements from a corporate entity and a small corporate entity has different use cases from a large corporate entity. And I can contribute and participate in exactly the way that fits me personally without any dependencies on&nbsp;others.</p> What’s your vision for changing custody requirements for&nbsp;Web3? <p>Markus: We’ve all been working as an industry in securing users’ private keys since the inception of Bitcoin, and this has been relying in turn on technology and processes that have been out there for a longer time, public infrastructures, hardware, security&nbsp;modules.</p><p>This is all known and familiar, but it’s also very static. When we secure a private key, when we take it offline — then the assets that are accessible through the private key are static and cannot change because of the way it’s protected. With Web3, this has to become a lot more dynamic. People have an expectation that when they own assets, with a blockchain protected by a private key, they can still participate in the economy on that blockchain.</p><p>We’ve enabled that with Staking in the Bitcoin Suisse Vault as a first step. We have Tezos staking on there and will support many more currencies with staking. With Web3, we have a large push into DeFi. Everybody’s crazy about DeFi right now. But how do you participate in DeFi with these smart contracts? That requires a bridging layer from the security of the vault to the agility of the decentralized economy. And as we move into Ocean’s value proposition, obviously, people need to be able to participate in the economy, the marketplace, the storage of their assets in real time. This means keys need to be available to sign transactions when needed, and they need to be protected from within the security of the&nbsp;vault.</p><p>So that’s bringing a challenge to us as a custody provider; that we need to provide top notch security, keeping the users’ private keys secure and offline at all times and at the same time give them the ability to sign transactions to participate in the marketplace in real time. We’re working hard, we’re putting a lot of resources into enabling that from a technology perspective. And we also work on assessing which of the projects are safe and secure and mature enough, so that we know that our clients can safely participate in these decentralized economies.</p> Can you elaborate on technical excellence for industrial and enterprise systems? <p>Markus: That’s really going back to the first part of my career in banking, and industrial systems have similar requirements. Here, it’s very important to have a long term stability and support period when a financial company or an industrial company is researching new technologies and looking to bring in new technology or products into their technology stack. They are obviously assessing the technical capabilities, they’re assessing the security of the system, but also assessing the long-term viability and stability of the platform.</p><p>When these companies build an application or an infrastructure in their environment, then there’s an expectation that typically it has to be there for three, five or even 10 plus more years. This means that having a proper track record and having a team that is able to guarantee stability is important because these kinds of companies would like to avoid having to spend immense amounts of money to just keep applications running.</p><p>They would like to focus their IT development efforts on actually writing new applications and supporting new business initiatives instead of keeping the old ones running. If the underlying infrastructure from hard operating systems and including blockchain based, decentralized infrastructures in the future is changing too frequently- or if the APIs change, if the economy changes, if the way they participate as a node changes then it always needs an update on their end, and this can be quite difficult. They can go through massive change management processes that are expensive, and they would like to avoid that as much as possible.</p><p>So as a startup, as a new technology provider going into the enterprise space, it’s important that you appeal both to the buyer, who is very eager to get technology capabilities, and also to the operator of the environment, who is very much concerned about the stability of the system, the APIs and the platform, because they will need to maintain this for up to 10 years, or more if you speak about the production line of a&nbsp;factory.</p> What do you think would facilitate the adoption for these very large and complex industrial enterprise systems? <p>Markus: The best way is when users and prospective users see and experience how it is going to improve their lives. We see the same thing with the Bitcoin Suisse Vault also on our end. That’s the best way to onboard them to your technology stack. We do this by demonstrating the Vault and by showing the capabilities of blockchain in a way that’s affecting the user. See, at Bitcoin Suisse, we’re pushing payment terminals across our market, Switzerland at this time, so that people can get first hand experience and we’re showing them how easy it is to use our high security Bitcoin Suisse Vault, including the storage for Ocean and the other coins. As a more industrial enterprise-oriented technology stack, you should have solved a problem that your clients have as part of their business or operations and be able to show that as a demo or use&nbsp;case.</p><p>You should have people who have experience doing this, including outside blockchain. And when you go to the clients, you need to speak the language of the people who solve the same problems. When you have a demonstration or use case that has a wow effect, and people immediately come to say ‘Yes, the Ocean team knows what my problem is, and they have a technology that solves my problem’, then you win. Plus, they also need to see that your platform provides the stability and long term guarantees that they need to solve the problem sustainably.</p><p>And as a side note here, “long term”, this can be 10 years plus in industrial solutions. And in many cases, maybe it’s also just two years. If you solve a shorter term problem that’s also good if there’s an expectation that it will be surpassed by yet another development later&nbsp;on.</p><p>But frequently, and that’s where I’m coming from in this industrial space and in the finance space, people do have a very long term focus and it’s always a challenge as a startup to demonstrate that you’re going to be around and that technology stack is going to keep working, even if things change in the founding team, for example, or in the industry.</p> Why are standards so important? <p>Markus: When you tackle the enterprise space, it’s important to show what security standards and what technology or ISO standards you follow, because that’s a tick the box exercise that many companies do when they evaluate which solution to onboard to. Especially in the area of security, but also in the reliability space. It’s not just about the technology expertise of the team implementing Ocean, but also having some level of familiarity with the traditional world. Because on one hand, the blockchain teams building applications on Ocean, they’re very familiar with blockchain and they will build on Ocean because of the technical excellence of the team and the protocol.</p><p>And when you go beyond blockchain projects and would like to market Ocean to people who are not yet convinced of blockchain — traditional enterprises, for example — then they need to be able to anchor that technology in terms and ways of thinking that they’re familiar with. And that frequently is along standards, i.e. for us as custodian these are cyber security standards for securing private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>There are also application development standards and programming paradigms, support paradigms, that will be important to hit. So that the commercial buyers and enterprises will be better able to relate to how the Ocean protocol works, understand the value proposition you bring and know they can rely on your&nbsp;product.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

<p>As the world deals with many challenges due to the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19, I talked to data protection expert Julian Hayes from Veneto Privacy regarding the prominence and development of contact tracing apps and how society can combat some of the privacy and data protection concerns that these platforms can entail.</p>
 <p>Julian Hayes</p> 
<p>Julian Hayes is Managing Director of <a href="https://www.venetoprivacy.ie/">Veneto Privacy Services</a>, a specialist data protection and security firm based in Dublin, Ireland. He has worked in the sphere of data protection for more than 16 years and is a specialist in app privacy &amp; security design for major consumer service industries.</p>
 Minttu: What are the main challenges you see with the uptake of contact tracing apps? 
<p>Julian: I think it is good that there is a healthy debate on the subject of contact tracing apps at this time as we have seen much analysis on the implications for users of the app and what plans authorities plan to use with the data. From the outset, we must be mindful that the main objective of such app analysis is to protect society from the risk of infection or transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp; With that in mind we must make sure that a balance is struck as much as possible to be able to protect individual citizens’ data, with that of protecting society from the virus.</p>
<p>There are two predominant models that are used for COVID-19 possible contagion detection that would be good to analyse from a security perspective.</p>
 
 De-centralised App Models: This model utilises Bluetooth or other common device-to-device based connectivity solutions, where there is no collection point of information other than on the users’ devices. &nbsp;A typical experience would be a confirmed COVID positive user would activate their status on the app as having currently or once tested positive for COVID.&nbsp; Other devices in the user’s proximity would then be alerted when and, importantly, where they had encountered a close contact with the tested-positive user’s device. 
 Centralised App Models:The centralised app model is a central point of storage for all COVID app users, detailing all close encounter contacts that the user has come in close proximity to, again via Bluetooth or other near field communication technology. Broadly speaking, it will again require an action by a user to enlist themselves on the app as having contracted COVID previously or presently, although in some models some data regarding temperature checks etc. may be processed in the service to automatically categorise individuals based on specific protocols.&nbsp;The centralised model would be the preferred model for those agencies tasked with fighting the pandemic as it will give them a detailed, holistic view as to the spread of infection. Centralised comprehensive models can be more effective but are also open to much criticism for overreaching in the data that they process or, in extreme cases, abuse of data that is processed surreptitiously for other purposes by the state or other third parties. 
 
 <p>Source: BBC News https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52355028</p> 
<p>Some points to note here:</p>
 
 Both models are likely to have better valid detection and performance in rural areas rather than urban areas due to spatial issues – i.e. less devices per square metre and generally reduced concentration of user interaction. 
 The de-centralised model is clearly more privacy friendly as it alerts from device to device, rather than through a central source, but we must consider how effective it is for reporting possible COVID infections. 
 The centralised model will have better detailed visibility for health authorities or intermediaries tasked with operating the detection tools. 
 GPS and Cell ID data (often available open source, see <a href="https://www.opencellid.org/#zoom=18&amp;lat=53.277066&amp;lon=-6.103126">here</a>)&nbsp;are really required for both solutions so as to allow geo-graphic identification of the user, even in the centralised model where it is not to be shared by the device. 
 Some research is needed into historical Bluetooth proximity – whether a device can recall Bluetooth device encounters&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to downloading the app. 
 
 M: Will these apps be the ‘silver bullet’ to combatting COVID-19?&nbsp; 
<p>J: I think it is important see this type of technology as part of the strategy to help fight this disease, along with the other more traditional methods such as social distancing, personal hygiene and the promising developments of vaccines recently. These solutions are only a part of the suite of tools that public health authorities are recommending.</p>
 M: What about concerns regarding data privacy and how the data will be used? 
<p>J: Clearly there are concerns regarding the approach of the centralised model relating to how data will be processed. However, we must remember that these state authority initiatives are undertaken with the objective to protect society in the detection of close encounters of people who have contracted COVID-19.&nbsp;We must also be cognisant that the apps in place are being developed on the basis that they will be downloaded voluntarily by people who will be informed on the permissions that are entailed in using the service.&nbsp;Provided that contact tracing apps provide good information to the user on what data is processed, for what purpose and why, and what controls they can utilise within the service, it should enable transparency and privacy-by-design.</p>
 M: What are some of the mitigations on a privacy engineering basis that can be put in place as a privacy safeguard?  
<p>J: There are many options regarding the protection of identities or processing of other personal identifiers that can be utilised in the development of these app services.</p>
<p>Some items would include:</p>
 
 Provide robust Privacy Notice and Consent upon download of the app, detailing its access rights to Bluetooth, GPS, Cell-ID or other positioning information required for effective use of the service. 
 Assigning a digital ID solution for app users that does not allow for direct identification of users of the app. This will allow for the users to share pseudonymous data rather than direct identifiers, bringing some privacy protection. 
 Digital IDs assigned to each individual user will allow for non-identifiable information to be processed as encounters occur, allowing users to pass each other and be informed of a contagion risk where necessary, whilst protecting each other’s identity.&nbsp;An example of this can be seen with <a href="https://koronavilkku.fi/en/">Finland’s contact tracing app</a>. 
 Rotation of digital IDs over a reasonable period will also add protection so as to not allow for retrospective analysis of encounters with other COVID tracing app users. Clearly there needs to be a balance struck between the efficacy of encounter detection and user privacy.

<p>Eine höhere Effizienz ist als Argument für
die Einführung von digitalen Identitäten inzwischen breit abgestützt und wurde
über die letzten Jahre mit entsprechenden Nachweisen aus Ländern in
verschiedenen Regionen der Welt untermauert i ii iii. Das Bedürfnis
nach digitalen Identitäten geht heute jedoch weit über einen Effizienzgewinn
hinaus. Digitale Identitäten werden praktisch zur Notwendigkeit, um öffentliche
Dienste ohne Unterbrechung aufrechtzuerhalten, wenn die Bekämpfung der
COVID-Pandemie über einen längeren Zeitraum ein Social Distancing erfordert.
Digitale Identitäten können E-Government-Dienste ermöglichen, die ohne
physische Präsenz rund um die Uhr zugänglich sind. Dies wurde in
Grossbritannien mit der elektronischen Identitätsplattform «GOV.UK Verify» gezeigt.
Der erste Lockdown-Monat im März 2020 löste einen zehnprozentigen Anstieg der Anzahl
neu kreierter digitaler Identitäten aus. Eine digitale Identität wurde benötigt,
um in der Startphase des Lockdowns aus der Ferne Anspruch auf einen
Universalkredit («Universal Credit») geltend zu machen [1]. Dies half dabei,
entscheidende finanzielle Unterstützung zu gewährleisten und so sicherzustellen,
dass tausende von Bürgerinnen und Bürgern inmitten der Krise Zugang zu
lebenswichtigen Dienstleistungen hatten.</p>



<p>Das «GOV.UK Verify»-Programm blieb indes nicht
von Problemen verschont. Die Adoptionsraten sind weit hinter dem Ziel von 25
Millionen Nutzern bis 2020 zurückgeblieben. Nachdem ein privatwirtschaftlicher
Ansatz gewählt wurde, haben die niedrigen Adoptions- und Nutzungsraten drei von
fünf Identitätsanbieter (sogenannte Identity Provider oder kurz IdPs) dazu
gezwungen, die Lösung aufgrund von Bedenken hinsichtlich Rentabilität nicht
weiter zu unterstützen [2]. Die Einführung eines erfolgreichen Digital
Identity-Programms ist eine langfristige Verpflichtung und es macht den
Anschein, dass der kurzfristige finanzielle Druck auf private Akteure bedeutet,
dass diese für die Rolle eines IdPs ungeeignet sind, sobald die Adoptionsraten
die Erwartungen nicht erfüllen. Während das privatwirtschaftliche IdP-Modell in
nordischen Ländern mit einer nahezu universellen Abdeckung grosse Erfolge verbuchen
konnte, hat dieser Ansatz in anderen Regionen gemischte Ergebnisse erzielt [3].
Industrieprognosen deuten nun darauf hin, dass die Pandemie möglicherweise den
Ausschlag zugunsten eines von der Regierung herausgegebenen Digital
Identity-Modells zu geben vermochte iv.</p>



<p>Unabhängig davon, welches Modell ein Land
gewählt hat, ist eines sicher: Es wird erwartet, dass digitale Identitäten in
den kommenden Jahren ein deutliches Wachstum erfahren werden und damit die Grundlage
für die nächste Welle von E-Government-Innovationen geschaffen wird. Die
Verbreitung digitaler Identitäten ist jedoch nicht Selbstzweck. Ziel ist ein
«Empowerment» der Bevölkerung. Es ist daher wichtig sich die Frage zu stellen,
was gute digitale Identität bedeutet. Als Anbieter von Digital
Identity-Lösungen orientieren wir uns bei unseren eigenen Produktentscheiden an
globalen Projekten und neuen Technologietrends. Dabei haben wir die folgenden Design-Prinzipien
übernommen, um die Interessen unserer Nutzer, sprich der Bevölkerung, in den
Vordergrund zu stellen.</p>



<p>«Privacy by Design»</p>



<p>Aufgrund des sensiblen Charakters von
digitalen Identitäten und den zahlreichen damit verknüpften persönlichen
Identifizierungsdaten ist das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit in eine Lösung von entscheidender
Bedeutung. Im Kern geht es darum sicherzustellen, dass bei der Konzeption einer
Lösung der Schutz der Privatsphäre der Bürgerinnen und Bürger höchste Priorität
hat. Procivis lässt sich von den Werten der «Self-Sovereign Identity»- sowie
der Blockchain-Bewegung leiten, die kryptographische Methoden einsetzen, um die
Kontrolle und Souveränität der Nutzer über ihre persönlichen
Identifizierungsdaten zu gewährleisten. In Übereinstimmung mit diesen Werten
muss jede neue Funktion die folgenden Merkmale erfüllen: Einwilligung und freie
Wahl, Zweck-Legitimität und Spezifizierung, Sammelbeschränkung und
Datenminimierung.</p>



<p>Anbieten von Anwendungsfällen
mit hoher Wertschöpfung</p>



<p>Von Regierungen herausgegebene digitale
Identitäten gibt es seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten. Einer der Hauptfaktoren, der
erfolgreiche Programme von anderen unterscheidet, ist der Zugang zu Diensten, die
den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern echten Mehrwert bieten. Neben der Primärfunktion
der Authentifizierung in der digitalen Welt haben Fallbeispiele rund um den
Globus gezeigt, dass die Akzeptanz stark mit der Verfügbarkeit von Diensten mit
hoher Transaktionsfrequenz korreliert. Ein solcher Dienst ist beispielsweise die
Bereitstellung von rechtsverbindlichen, digitalen Signaturen. In Estland haben
digitale Signaturen die handschriftliche Unterschrift fast vollständig ersetzt,
wobei jedes Jahr über 200 Millionen digitale Signaturen von einer Bevölkerung
von 1,3 Millionen Menschen eingereicht werden [4]. Weitere Anwendungsfälle, die
für die Einführung von digitalen Identitäten förderlich waren, sind Dienste für
den digitalen Empfang und die Verwaltung von offiziellen Dokumenten,
Zertifikaten und Lizenzen. Brasilien und Argentinien verzeichneten hohe Adoptionsraten
bei digitalen «Wallets» (Brieftaschen) für Identitätsdokumente, seit es für
Bürgerinnen und Bürger möglich ist, ihren Führerschein und ihre
Fahrzeugdokumente auf dem Smartphone zu speichern. Es waren unter anderem diese
Anwendungsfälle, die die Entwicklung unserer ersten drei Kernfunktionen – e-Authentication,
e-Signature und e-Documents – geprägt haben.</p>



<p>Nahtloses Nutzererlebnis</p>



<p>Es reicht nicht aus, Zugang zu wichtigen
Dienstleistungen zu bieten. Ebenfalls wichtig ist ein intuitives und nahtloses
Nutzererlebnis für die Bürgerinnen und Bürger. Eine Reihe von Ländern hat
beispielsweise Smartcards eingeführt, die es den Bürgern ermöglichen, Dokumente
elektronisch zu authentifizieren und zu unterzeichnen. Mehrere dieser Prozesse
setzten jedoch voraus, dass die Benutzerinnen und Benutzer über ein
Kartenlesegerät verfügten, was sich als zu komplex erwies und die Adoption behinderte.
Smartphone-basierte digitale Identitäten lösen dieses Problem, indem sie sich
auf handelsübliche Hardware und vertraute Nutzungsmuster stützen. Eine Reihe
von digitalen Behördendienstleistungen leidet zudem darunter, dass sie nur
bruchstückhaft digitalisiert sind. Beispielsweise kann in der Schweiz eine
Reihe offizieller Dokumente zwar über ein Behördenportal bestellt werden, die
Zahlungsprozesse jedoch laufen getrennt, so dass die Bürgerinnen und Bürger
nach Erhalt einer Rechnung separat eine Überweisung vornehmen müssen. Im Kanton
Schaffhausen kombinieren wir e-Payments mit e-Authentication und e-Documents in
einer Mobile App, so dass Bürgerinnen und Bürger den Prozess der Bestellung,
der Zahlung per Kreditkarte und des Empfangs ihrer amtlichen Dokumente nahtlos
durchlaufen können.</p>



<p>Interoperabilität
zum Aufbau eines Dienstleistungs-Ökosystems</p>



<p>Wie zuvor verdeutlicht, liegt der eigentliche
Wert einer digitalen Identität im Zugang zu den damit ermöglichten Diensten. Deshalb
ist es von entscheidender Bedeutung, dass die zum Einsatz kommenden Lösungen
auf offenen Standards beruhen, damit Drittparteien (des öffentlichen wie des
privaten Sektors) digitale Identitäten einfach in ihre Prozesse integrieren
können. Der Finanzsektor ist eine der Branchen, die einen enorm grossen Nutzen
aus der Verwendung von vertrauenswürdigen digitalen Identitäten ziehen kann. In
Dänemark zum Beispiel wurden von 70 Millionen monatlichen Transaktionen 40
Millionen für Banktransaktionen verwendet. Allerdings bildet eine von der
Regierung ausgegebene Identität die vertrauenswürdige Grundlage einer digitalen
Gesellschaft und kann in Bereichen Anwendung finden, die viel breiter gelagert sind
als zunächst vorhergesehen.</p>

In India, the Aadhaar electronic identity facilitated the opening of over 400
million new bank accounts. The government now transfers subsidies directly into
the bank accounts of beneficiaries, eliminating significant inefficiencies in
the country’s subsidy delivery mechanism. The Government of India reports a
cumulative saving of USD 23 billion dollars between 2013 and 2019.</p>

  <p>Some organizations may engage with customers just once or twice per year. Others might reach out occasionally or never at all. Organizations that fail to put the customer at the heart of the organization — especially during uncertain times — risk losing connections and customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The competition for gaining customers’ attention and engagement is tougher than ever,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/83053/Michael-Chiu">Michael Chiu,</a> Senior Director Analyst, as a follow-up to his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/apac/symposium-india">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>. “Organizations should examine every opportunity to engage with their customers, create new connections and add value to the relationships.”</p>
<p>Amid the uncertainty that exists today, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/improve-customer-experience-with-artificial-intelligence/">focusing on customers</a> is difficult, but necessary. During uncertain times, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-proactive-customer-experience-in-the-midst-of-covid-19/">IT leaders</a> should increase this focus in a variety of ways. Below are five impactful ideas.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-cx-trends-for-cios-to-watch/">Top CX Trends for CIOs to Watch</a></p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 No. 1: Reduce employee effort 
<p>Sixty-four percent of respondents to a Gartner survey believe that unnecessary effort prevents their company from delivering a higher-quality CX. Lowering the effort that employees must expend in their day-to-day responsibilities can have a positive impact on customer experience.</p>
<p>Some of the largest sources of unnecessary employee effort come from company policies and regulations.</p>
<p>Assess how essential these policies and regulations are and the employee effort they are generating, and for the less vital ones, consider reducing or removing them.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 2: Employ 3-2-1 
<p>The 3-2-1 method starts with three <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-measure-customer-experience/">customer experience</a> strategic priorities. For each of these strategic priorities, organizations should identify two obstacles preventing the attainment of those strategic priorities. This will result in the identification of six obstacles. Lastly, think of one tech-related business idea that would either eliminate or reduce each obstacle.</p>
<p>The resulting six tech-related business ideas will now align with the organization’s customer experience strategic priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if one of your strategic priorities is to improve the in-store experience, obstacles like scarce parking and time-consuming return processes might prevent customers from having a delightful in-store experience. Some tech-related business ideas that could address these could be a digital parking finder integrated into the store app and implementing a return-by-mail program.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1lY2M5NWZkYzJhNzgxMWViOTI4YjBlYzZkMzFjZjRjYg=="></a></p>
 No. 3: Make IT and voice of customer (VoC) a two-way street 
<p>VoC feedback comes in three types: Direct, indirect and inferred. Across all three, IT can both contribute to solutions that help collect such feedback, as well as receive this customer feedback and take action accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A critical aspect of a VoC program is actually getting VoC information into the hands of employees who can do something about it,” said Chiu.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 4: Walk a mile in your customers’ shoes 
<p>It’s often not enough to understand customers; IT leaders need to empathize with them. Opportunities to achieve this include having IT staff “be a customer” and go through the experience your organization provides to customers.</p>
<p>IT leaders can also invite customers to their staff meetings, and give them time to talk about their experiences. Some organizations choose to co-design with their customers, working alongside them to build the products, services and experiences that will ultimately be provided.</p>
 No. 5: Use customer-centric culture hacks&nbsp; 
<p>As opposed to trying to bring about a customer-centric culture via large-scale initiatives, try implementing several small changes to your culture, known as culture “hacks.”</p>
<p>Culture hacks are easy and can be implemented in less than 48 hours. They’re emotional, immediate, visible and low-effort, but not low courage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-culture-hacks-for-digital-transformation/">10 Culture Hacks for Digital Transformation</a></p>
<p>For example, ask that each meeting invitation include an answer to the question, “How will this meeting benefit the customer?” Alternatively, leave an empty chair at each meeting as a visual reminder of the customer who will be affected by the decisions made at such meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>IT leaders should discuss these five initiatives not only with the IT team, but also with those involved in customer experience. Determine which one makes the most sense to implement first, before assessing its results and moving onto others. IT leaders can utilize this current state of uncertainty to refocus on their customers and expand their organization’s knowledge of customer experience.</p>

   React.js is one of the most popular front-end javascript frameworks today.  For most of its life, React has connected to REST APIs to fetch or save data on a server.  GraphQL is a query language that aims to replace REST APIs by providing consumers with a clear description of the data in the API.  By combining these two technologies, you can quickly connect to an API with your React.js application

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>React.js is one of the most popular front-end javascript frameworks today.  For most of its life, React has connected to REST APIs to fetch or save data on a server.  GraphQL is a query language that aims to replace REST APIs by providing consumers with a clear description of the data in the API.  By combining these two technologies, you can quickly connect to an API with your React.js application.  There are many packages available for connecting to a GraphQL API.  One of the most popular is Apollo, however you can also use Axios, or even the built-in JavaScript <code>fetch</code> function.  For this application, you will use Axios, but I encourage you to check out Apollo or any other GraphQL/React packages available.</p>

<p>To secure your application, you will be using Okta’s single sign-on provider.  Okta provides a great set of tools to make integrating its service into a React application as simple as installing an npm package.</p>

<p>In React, you will learn to build an application using the public GraphQL API provided by <a href="https://www.everbase.co/editor">Everbase</a>.  The data in this API contains some information regarding exchange rates in various currencies, as well as information about countries in which those currencies are used.  For this application, you will allow the user to convert his/hermoney into another currency.  Then you will show the user some information about what countries accept that currency.</p>

 Set Up GraphQL Server as a Service 

<p>The first thing you need to do is sign up for an Everbase account and option an API Key.  This can be done on the <a href="https://www.everbase.co/account/keys">API Keys</a> section of their site.  You can log in with your GitHub account or create an account on their site.</p>

 Set Up Authentication for Your React Application 

<p>Next, you will need to set up a new Okta Application from your account administration page.  Log in to your developer’s console and click Applications, and then click Add Application.  In the Create New Application section on the next page, select Single Page App and click Next.  On the Application Settings page, give your application a meaningful name.  I named mine Exchange Rates, but you can call yours whatever you want.  Because React will launch on port 3000, by default, you will want to change your URLs to <code>localhost:3000</code>.  Then click done.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make note of your Client ID on the General Settings tab as you will need it in your application.</p>

 Scaffold Your React Application 

<p>Next, you can start to frame out your web application.  To start, access the create-react-app toolchain with the command <code>npx create-react-app exchange-rates</code> in the terminal.  This will take a minute, so now is the perfect time for a coffee break!  Once the command has finished running, you can start to install your packages for the application.</p>

<p>First, you will use bootstrap for the HTML framework.  To make bootstrap easier to use with React, you will also include the react-bootstrap package.</p>

   <code>npm i bootstrap@4.5.0
npm i react-bootstrap@1.0.1
</code>   

<p>As mentioned before, you will use the promise based Axios for your HTTP client.</p>

   <code>npm i axios@0.19.2
</code>   

<p>Dotenv will store your environment variables.  You can add the <code>.env</code> file to your gitignore for security.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

<p>React-router-dom will provide some functionality for adding routes to your application, including the secure routes you will set up under authentication.</p>

   <code>npm i react-router-dom@5.2.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will need to install the necessary Okta-React packages to make integration to Okta as easy as possible.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@3.0.0
npm i @okta/okta-react@3.0.1
npm i @okta/okta-signin-widget@4.1.0
</code>   

 Build Your GraphQL React Application 

<p>First, you can add a file to the root of your application named <code>.env</code>.  Add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE={yourOktaDomain}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_EVERBASE_API_KEY={yourEverbaseApiKey}
</code>   

<p>Here you have your necessary Okta information and your Okta Application Setup, along with your Everbase API Key.</p>

 App With Router Access and App.js 

<p>In your <code>src</code> directory, add a new file called <code>AppWithRouterAccess.jsx</code>.  Add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Route, useHistory, } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security, SecureRoute, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';

import ExchangeRates from './Pages/ExchangeRate'
import Home from './Pages/Home'
import Login from './Pages/Login'

const AppWithRouterAccess = () =&gt; {
  const history = useHistory();
  const onAuthRequired = () =&gt; {
      history.push('/login');
  };

  const baseDomain = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE;
  const issuer = baseDomain + '/oauth2/default'
  const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
  const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + '/implicit/callback';

  const loggedIn = true;

  return (
    &lt;Security issuer={issuer}
        clientId={clientId}
        redirectUri={redirect}
        onAuthRequired={onAuthRequired}
        pkce={true} &gt;
        &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home} /&gt;
        &lt;SecureRoute path='/ExchangeRates' component={ExchangeRates} /&gt;
        &lt;Route path='/login' render={() =&gt; &lt;Login baseUrl={baseDomain} issuer={issuer} /&gt;} /&gt;
        &lt;Route path='/implicit/callback' component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
};

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

<p>The primary job of this file is to define the routes in your application.  This file is also where you will set up your Okta client and integrate it into your application.  You will notice the <code>ExchangeRates</code> route is defined as <code>SecureRoute</code>.  This way, the application will enforce authentication on that route.  You also need to define a route for <code>/implicit/callback</code> to ensure that Okta’s login redirect URI has a place to land.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to update your <code>App.js</code> page with some custom code to replace the boilerplate from create-react-app.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import AppWithRouterAccess from './AppWithRouterAccess';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;AppWithRouterAccess/&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>This code will tell your application to use your new <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code> page.  You are also importing bootstrap here, as react-bootstrap requires the CSS to be imported.  This only needs to be imported once.</p>

 Header Component 

<p>Add a new folder to the <code>src</code> directory called <code>Components</code>.  Add a file called <code>Header.jsx</code> to this folder and add the following code:</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { Navbar, Nav, Form, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'

const Header = () =&gt; {
  const { authState, authService } = useOktaAuth();

  if (authState.isPending) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  }

  const button = authState.isAuthenticated ?
    &lt;Button variant="secondary" onClick={() =&gt; { authService.logout() }}&gt;Logout&lt;/Button&gt; :
    &lt;Button variant="secondary" onClick={() =&gt; { authService.login() }}&gt;Login&lt;/Button&gt;

  return (
    &lt;Navbar bg="light" expand="lg"&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Brand href="/"&gt;Lets Escape&lt;/Navbar.Brand&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Toggle aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav" /&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Collapse id="basic-navbar-nav"&gt;
        &lt;Nav className="mr-auto"&gt;
          &lt;Nav.Link href="/"&gt;Home&lt;/Nav.Link&gt;
          &lt;Nav.Link href="/ExchangeRates"&gt;Exchange Currency&lt;/Nav.Link&gt;
        &lt;/Nav&gt;
        &lt;Form inline&gt;
          {button}
        &lt;/Form&gt;
      &lt;/Navbar.Collapse&gt;
    &lt;/Navbar&gt;
  );
};

export default Header;
</code>   

<p>The header will be used on every page, which is why you create it as a component.  The component itself is fairly simple.  There are a couple navigation links to the pages you will implement shortly.  There is also a button that will change between Login or Logout, depending on the authentication status of the user.</p>

 Home Page 

<p>Next, you will provide a short landing page for users entering the site.  Add a new folder called <code>Pages</code> under the <code>src</code> directory, and add a file called <code>Home.jsx</code>.  Add the following code to that file:</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Link, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import Header from '../Components/Header'
import { Container, Row, Col, Card } from 'react-bootstrap'
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

const Home = () =&gt; {

  const { authState } = useOktaAuth();

  return (authState.isAuthenticated ?

    &lt;Redirect to={{ pathname: '/ExchangeRates' }} /&gt; :

    &lt;Container&gt;
      &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
      &lt;Row&gt;
        &lt;Col sm={12} className="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;h3&gt;Let's Escape&lt;/h3&gt;
          &lt;h4&gt;Connect.  Exchange.  Move.&lt;/h4&gt;
          &lt;h5&gt;A React Demo Use Okta and GraphGL&lt;/h5&gt;
          &lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.everbase.co/editor"&gt;GraphQL Data Available here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;/Col&gt;
      &lt;/Row&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
      &lt;Row &gt;
        &lt;Col sm={12} className="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;Card style={{ width: '21.5em', margin: '0 auto' }}&gt;
            &lt;Card.Header&gt;
              Already have an Okta Account?
            &lt;/Card.Header&gt;
            &lt;Card.Body&gt;
              &lt;Link to='/ExchangeRates'&gt;Login Here&lt;/Link&gt;
            &lt;/Card.Body&gt;
          &lt;/Card&gt;
        &lt;/Col&gt;
      &lt;/Row&gt;
    &lt;/Container&gt;
  );
};

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>The one trick here is if the user is already authenticated, you will need to redirect that user to the <code>ExchangeRate</code> route defined earlier.</p>

 Login Page and Login Form 

<p>The next step is to provide a login page for your users to use when they attempt to access the site.  First, add a new file to the <code>Components</code> folder called <code>LoginForm.jsx</code>.  The code is as follows:</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
import OktaAuth from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { Form, Button, Row, Col } from 'react-bootstrap'

const LoginForm = ({ baseUrl, issuer }) =&gt; {

  const { authService } = useOktaAuth();
  const [sessionToken, setSessionToken] = useState();
  const [username, setUsername] = useState();
  const [password, setPassword] = useState();

  const handleSubmit = (e) =&gt; {
    e.preventDefault();
    const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({ url: baseUrl, issuer: issuer });
    oktaAuth.signIn({ username, password })
      .then(res =&gt; setSessionToken(res.sessionToken))
      .catch(err =&gt; console.log('Found an error', err));
  };

  const handleUsernameChange = (e) =&gt; {
    setUsername(e.target.value); 
  };

  const handlePasswordChange = (e) =&gt; {
    setPassword(e.target.value);
  };

  if (sessionToken) {
    authService.redirect({ sessionToken });
    return null;
  }

  return (
    &lt;Row&gt;
      &lt;Col sm={3}&gt;
        &lt;Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;

          &lt;Form.Group controlId="username"&gt;
            &lt;Form.Label&gt;Username&lt;/Form.Label&gt;
            &lt;Form.Control type="text" placeholder="Enter Username" value={username} onChange={handleUsernameChange} /&gt;
          &lt;/Form.Group&gt;

          &lt;Form.Group controlId="password"&gt;
            &lt;Form.Label&gt;Password&lt;/Form.Label&gt;
            &lt;Form.Control type="password" placeholder="password" value={password} onChange={handlePasswordChange} /&gt;
          &lt;/Form.Group&gt;

          &lt;Button variant="primary" type="submit"&gt;
            Login
        &lt;/Button&gt;

        &lt;/Form&gt;
      &lt;/Col&gt;
    &lt;/Row&gt;
  );
};

export default LoginForm;
</code>   

<p>In this file, you are providing a simple login form to the user.  The trick is to override the submit function with the Okta logic.  If the user logs in successfully, you can set the session token and let the user continue.</p>

<p>Next, add a new file in the <code>Pages</code> folder called <code>Login.jsx</code>.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import LoginForm from '../Components/LoginForm'
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { Container } from 'react-bootstrap'
import Header from '../Components/Header'

const Login = ({ baseUrl, issuer }) =&gt; {
  const { authState } = useOktaAuth();

  if (authState.isPending) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  }
  return authState.isAuthenticated ?
    &lt;Redirect to={{ pathname: '/ExchangeRates' }} /&gt; :

    &lt;Container&gt;
      &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Please Login with your Okta Account&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;LoginForm baseUrl={baseUrl} issuer={issuer} /&gt;
    &lt;/Container&gt;;
};

export default Login;
</code>   

<p>Again, you are checking to see if the user is already logged in.  If they are, you can redirect them to the ExchangeRates page, otherwise present the Login Form.</p>

 Exchange Rate Page 

<p>The last step is to implement the ExchangeRate page itself.  In <code>Pages</code>, add a new file called <code>ExchangeRate.jsx</code>.</p>

   <code>import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Header from '../Components/Header'
import { Container, Row, Col, Table, Form, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'
import axios from 'axios';

class ExchangeRates extends Component {

  constructor(props, context) {
    super(props, context);

    this.state = {
      loading: false,
      currencies: [],
      user: {
        username: 'nik',
        currentCurrencyIso: 'USD',
        currentAmount: 50.00,
        currentCurrency: {}
      },
      targetIso: 'AUD',
      targetAmount: 0.00,
      countries: []
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {

    this.setState({
        loading: true
    });

    var c = this.sendQuery(this.getCurrenciesQuery())
      .then(response =&gt; {
        var u = this.state.user;
        u.currentCurrency = response.data.data.currencies.filter(currency =&gt; currency.isoCode == this.state.user.currentCurrencyIso)[0];
        this.setState({
            currencies: response.data.data.currencies.filter(currency =&gt; currency.convert != null),
            loading: false,
            user: u
        });
        this.updateTarget('AUD');
      })
      .catch(err =&gt; {
        console.log(err);
      });
  }

  sendQuery(query, variables) {
    return axios.post('https://api.everbase.co/graphql?apikey=' +  process.env.REACT_APP_EVERBASE_API_KEY, {
      query
    });
  }

  getCurrenciesQuery() {

    return '{               \
      currencies            \
      {                     \
        id                  \

        unitSymbols         \
        convert(to: "USD")  \
      }                     \
    }';
  }

  getCurrencyCountryQuery(isoCode) {
    return '{                                                   \
      currencies(where: {isoCode: {eq: "' + isoCode + '"}}) {   \
        countries {                                             \

        }                                                       \
      }                                                         \
    }';
  }

  handleTargetChange(e) {
    var isoCode = e.target.value;
    this.updateTarget(isoCode);
  }

  updateTarget(isoCode) {
    var t = this.state.currencies.filter(c =&gt; c.isoCode === isoCode)[0];

    if (t) {
      var amt = this.state.user.currentAmount / t.convert;

      this.setState({
        targetIso: t.isoCode,
        targetAmount: amt.toFixed(2)
      });

      this.sendQuery(this.getCurrencyCountryQuery(t.isoCode))
        .then(resp =&gt; {
            this.setState({
                countries: resp.data.data.currencies[0].countries
            });
        })
    }
  }

  render() {

  if (this.state.loading) {
    return &lt;Container&gt;
      &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Loading, please wait.&lt;/h4&gt;

export default ExchangeRates;
</code>   

<p>Here you are presenting the user with an exchange rate calculator and some information about the countries in which the target currency is used.</p>

<p>To populate the dropdown boxes the user will set, you will first need to grab the data from Everbase.  This is where you can use Axios to make a call to the Everbase server.  In this case, there are a couple helper methods to create the query and one for calling the Everbase server.  Since Axios is promise-based, you can use <code>then</code> rather than callbacks for processing the data that is returned.  First, you will obtain a list of currencies.  Here you are filtering the currencies to ensure that a conversion rate exists.   (Some of the currencies do not have a conversion to USD.)  Once you have that list, you can populate the dropdowns with them.  When the user changes the target drop down, the target amount is updated to reflect the exchange rate between the two currencies.</p>

<p>The second task when the user changes the dropdown is to obtain some data about the currency from Everbase.  This data will include the countries that use the currency, their capitals, populations, and the VAT rate.</p>

 Test Your GraphQL React Application 

<p>All your code is complete and you can now test your application.  In the terminal, use <code>npm start</code> to kickoff your application.  You should be presented with the Home page upon navigating to <code>localhost:3000</code>.  Click on Exchange Rates, and you will be presented with the login page.  Enter your Okta credentials and explore the exchange rates.</p>

<p>As always, you are more than welcome to share this post, and\or <a href="https://identosphere.substack.com/welcome">subscribe for weekly updates</a> on the Self Sovereign Identity landscape, with a focus on implementations surrounding open standardization processes.</p><p>We would be grateful for your <a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere">support on Patreon</a>, which will ensure the sustainability of this project over the long-term.</p> Trust Frameworks? Standards Matter. <p>Tim Bouma <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/trust-frameworks-standards-matter-47c946992f44">makes the case that Trust frameworks</a> need standards to be trusted. He points at the NIST documents about it <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8149.pdf">Developing Trust Frameworks to Support Identity Federations</a> published in 2018. He also points at the Canadian government’s definition of standards.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“a document that provides a set of agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results. Standards establish accepted practices, technical requirements, and terminologies for diverse fields.”&nbsp; He goes on to highlight a lot of the work being done in Canada and where it all sits relative to being a standard - “In closing, there are lots of trust frameworks being developed today. But to be truly trusted, a trust framework needs to either apply existing standards or become a standard itself.”</p></blockquote> The Odyssey Hackathon was last week <p><a href="https://solutions.odyssey.org/#winningsolutions">See the winners across all 21 challenges</a>.</p><p>They are actually coming to the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Interoperability-WG-a42995c37e2a4511a10aea96cdbccc38">Interoperability Working Group</a> this coming week to share results. Here is what they had to say about SSI:</p><p>A Self- Sovereign Identity can unlock the full potential of the digital global economy. The identity of people, organizations and things is relevant to any transaction, while protecting Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is of increasing importance.</p><p>SSI enables the necessary exchange of verified data before committing to (proposed) transactions, which for high-value/high-risk transactions includes the identity.</p><p>The thing that stuck out to me <a href="https://www.odyssey.org/hackathon-2020-dutch-blockchain-coalition-ministry-of-the-interior-challenge-self-sovereign-identity-in-action/">reading the web page</a> about the event was this diagram.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc13a2fa0-d11a-4244-a8f8-086426f7b092_2560x1810.jpeg"></a>  <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/11/18/get-involved-with-dinz-this-november/">New Zealand </a>is working with Maori leaders on Identity <blockquote><p>Next week we’re celebrating our first Aotearoa Digital Identity Hui Taumata.&nbsp; We’re particularly excited to be bringing you a Kapa Kōrero session with Kaye-Maree Dunne, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janeretimana/?originalSubdomain=nz">Jane-Renee Retimana</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/belindaallennz/?originalSubdomain=nz">Belinda Allen</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-tairea/?originalSubdomain=nz">Ben Tairea</a>.&nbsp; The quartet will be exploring perspectives from Te Ao Māori, and the relevance of Te Tiriti in our collective work on digital identity.</p></blockquote><p>Digital Identity New Zealand is having it’s <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-nz-annual-meeting/">Annual Meeting</a> Dec 10th&nbsp;</p> CBOR is done!&nbsp; <p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2136">Mike Jones shares</a> that CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)&nbsp; is officially a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8943">specification at IETF</a> - woohoo! and it is a key part of <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45144.html">ISO’s mDL standard</a> (date fields must use it).&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as specified in RFC 7049, is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/show/federal-blockchain-news">Federal Blockchain News</a> - Podcast talking about SSI use at CBP <p><a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/13158652/ep8-cbp-vincent-annunziato">Vincent Annunziato</a><a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/13158652/ep8-cbp-vincent-annunziato">,</a> talks about his work with The Silicon Valley Innovation Program. He is the Director of Transformation &amp; Innovation Division of the Customs and Border Patrol Office of Trade, talks about shaping blockchain technologies to make imports safer and more secure. CBP's current projects include tracking steel, oil, and natural gas imports from Canada.</p><p>Also, This didn’t go out in the email, last week, but was <a href="http://identosphere.substack.com">added on the website</a> afterwards.  <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/13158652/securekey-dhs-replacing-ssn">SecureKey was featured on this podcast</a>, talking about re-creating the US Social Security Number system based on decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials.

Each episode is around 30 minutes, and very much worth a listen to hear about what folk working in and with the US federal government are thinking about blockchain and decentralized identity.</p> Release the v1 of the <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/vc-spec-rel/">verifiable credentials specifications relationship diagram</a> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/michaelruminer/status/1328827452886540296">h/t @michaelruminer</a> “Good for anyone but especially useful when trying to jump in on the deep end.

This article provides an overview of five critical requirements to achieve mass-adoption of SSI. While they are ranked from “least important” to “essential” all of them need to be in place to gain a significant market share for the technology.</p><p>The post details 5 components necessary for the advance of SSI: Business, Technology, User Experience, Compliance, and Governance.</p> Michael Becker Interviewed Kaliya re:SSI <p>Kaliya was recently <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/2020/11/16/an-interview-on-self-sovereign-identity-with-kaliya-young-the-identity-women/">interviewed by Michael Becker</a> about SSI. You can find a summary of the interview, and a link to the audio.</p><blockquote><p>Kaliya’s purpose is to answer this profound question: “How do we own, control, manage, and represent ourselves in the digital world, independently of the BigTech companies (Facebook, Google, etc.)?”</p></blockquote> How to Issue Credentials in Trinsic Studio <p>Trinsic has released some <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">tools to issue verifiable credentials</a>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>All verifiable credentials come from credential templates. These templates specify what information should be included in a credential. Faber College would most likely want the credential template of its digital diplomas to include a graduate’s first and last name, what they got their degree in, what year they graduated, and thier GPA. Let’s begin!</p></blockquote> Launch of CredentialMaster Student Pass Announced <blockquote><p>By issuing <a href="https://credentialmaster.com/student-pass/">StudentPass self-sovereign student ID</a> before any other VC, you do three big things for students:</p>  <p>You set an ID anchor for binding other VCs to that student (like skills and achievements).</p>  <p>You can eliminate passwords and personal questions, and Recognize Your StudentTM at every interaction.</p>  <p>You give students their first Verifiable Credential, show them the value of it, and how it works.</p>  </blockquote> Videos  [<a href="https://www.aceblock.com/2020/11/12/news-lecture-why-is-ssi-becoming-a-necessity-and-what-potential-it-holds/">LECTURE</a>] Why is SSI becoming a necessity and what potential it holds?&nbsp; <blockquote><p>Problem 1: CENTRAL AUTHORITY CONTROLS ALL DATA</p><p>Problem 2: NUMEROUS SIGNUPS WITH SAME DATA</p><p>Problem 3: INCONVENIENCE OF ONLINE FORMS</p></blockquote> <a href="https://diginomica.com/self-sovereign-career-identity-conversation-meg-bear-sap-successfactors">Self sovereign career identity</a> - a conversation with Meg Bear <blockquote><p>The Velocity piece is a way for me as an individual to own my credentials, to say, these are the things that I know. And these are the things I've done. And if I can own that, I have a lot more interest in it. And I can use it in a lot more interesting ways. In the past, that might have just been something that I built as reputation within a company, I can now make that a more dynamic and portable reputation I can take with me anywhere.</p></blockquote><p>Having a look at <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Velocity-Non-Technical-Whitepaper-091120-V1.15-Published.pdf">the Velocity Whitepaper</a> it does mention they are keeping an eye on the work developing in W3C and DIF.</p><blockquote><p>The Velocity Network is a blockchain-based open source verifiable credential exchange utility layer with its basic elements and token mechanics that provides standardized communication protocols, governance, compliance and payment rails, that enable trusted, private and secured exchange of career credentials between individuals and organizations.</p></blockquote> Decentralized-id.com Updates <p>Infominer has begun publishing <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/twitter/">weekly twitter collections</a> that support this newsletter, on decentralized-id.com. In addition to those weekly lists a <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/twitter/ssi-101/">Self Sovereign Identity 101</a> collection has been published there.</p><p>There is now a page for <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/government/canada/bcgov/">BCGov</a>, <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/government/europe/switzerland/zug/">Zug ID</a>, <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/blockchain/hyperledger/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>, <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/government/europe/eSSIF/">European Self Sovereign Identity Framework</a>, <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/web-standards/gs1/">GS1</a>, and……</p> First guest post submitted&nbsp; <p>Since the beginning of decentralized-id.com, I (Infominer) have been inviting others to participate in its creation, by submitting content, or editing what’s currently published. After 2 years, finally, the site has received its first guest submission.</p><p>Contacted about mentioning <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/blockchain/dragonchain-factor/">Dragonchain’s Factor Identity on decentralized-id.com</a>, I suggested they put some links in a shared doc, and whatever information they felt would be useful. After reading the article that resulted, I was able to ask for some clarity, including their relationship with open standards, which helped to shape it’s final form.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s not entirely along the lines of the standards-based tech primarily featured, it has created something of a bridge for them to become more familiar with our work and makes it easier for the reader to understand what Dragonchain is offering in comparison to what’s happening in SSI.</p> <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/organizations/identity-foundation/keri/">Finally! A page for KERI just went live!</a> <p>Of all this week’s updates to decentralized-id.com, I’m most excited about the page highlighting resources related to Sam Smith’s Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</p><blockquote><p>A self-certifying identifier (SCID) is a identifier that can be proven to be the one and only identifier tied to a public key using cryptography alone*</p><p>* No blockchain needed (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/master/presentations/KERI_for_Muggles.pdf">KERI for Muggles</a>)</p></blockquote> Interesting News (But not necessarily SSI) <p>DISTIL is being launched by One World Identity claiming to bring together “classes of startups”&nbsp;</p><p>In the <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/distil">Digital Identity Standards Technology and Innovation Lab</a>.

But the types of information deemed ‘personally identifiable’ and the amount of control one has over them varies around the world.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/diagnostic-trends-shaping-the-future-of-digital-identification-181724c40068">Digital Caribou looks at the future trends impacting Digital Identity</a> <p>I (Kaliya) was invited to this virtual substitute for hallway conversations.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The state of the art in digital identification are trust frameworks that accommodate diverse technologies, systems and stakeholders</p>  <p>Risks remain even within the most rigorous trust framework:</p>  <p>Achieving inclusion requires addressing both technical and political dimensions</p>  <p>Trust frameworks are complicated so getting governance right requires an ecosystems approach</p>  <p>Building the future of digital identification means reckoning with an analogue past</p>   <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/marissa-mayer-is-back-and-she-wants-to-fix-your-address-book.html">Marissa Mayer is back and she wants to fix your address book</a> <blockquote><p>At launch, Mayer’s start-up is rolling out Sunshine Contacts, an address book app that relies on artificial intelligence to find and merge duplicate contacts, fill out incomplete information and continually keep that data up to date.

			 Shurong joined the team back in April 2018 as an intern and became Marketing &amp; Communication Manager after the internship.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Shurong Li. I’m from a small city, Kaiyuan (Yunnan), located in the southwest of China. After I graduated from university, I worked as a software engineer for over a year. I came to the realisation that the business sector interests me more than the technical side, so I came to France to study for a Master’s Degree in Management. Since I was a kid, I’ve always liked recommending and sharing fabulous stuff with my friends. I often ended up giving away all of my favorite candy to my friends back then because I also wanted them to experience the joy! And that is exactly what marketing does in business, and I take great pleasure in doing it. So here I am, I became a marketer sharing the joy of excellent and innovative products to those that need them.</p>

		 
	 
    Shurong and her husband took the photo at the train station of her hometown Kaiyuan     
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was looking for a six-month end-of-studies internship in 2018. As I have an engineering background, I was keen on looking for an opportunity to work in a company that involves new technology – blockchain was something that caught my eye. I came across Tokeny Solutions, a small team of eight people back at the time. I reached out to Luc, our CEO, on LinkedIn for the opportunity. Following a few interviews, luckily I got hired as an Intern!</p>
<p>There was one thing that held me back: I would need to work remotely from day one. Today, it sounds normal but a few years ago it was against the norm and I had never worked remotely before. I was worried if I would be able to do so. My family and friends were even telling me to be careful. “It wouldn’t be a fraud, would it?” one of my friends said.</p>
<p>I decided to ask an employee about how it feels working remotely, so I called Mathieu, our Business Developer. He immediately made me feel more comfortable with it. Not because he told me how good it is working remotely, but because he is the kind of colleague you would want to work with. Then I joined the team, and my intuition was right, not just Mathieu, everyone in the team is friendly and motivated. After my internship, I gladly received a long-term employment contract offer. And now it’s been almost three years since I started working at Tokeny. The only change is we grow much bigger, we have over 30 coworkers in the team, four times bigger than I joined, a truly international team with 13 nationalities.</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Challenging, exciting and fun. The thing I like the most about working at Tokeny is that you can be creative and bold to try new ideas and constantly learn new skills and knowledge, with a group of talented and smart people. When an issue arises, everyone works together effectively to solve it. As a result, you don’t feel alone as you know the team has got your back. Remote work requires more efficient communication digitally, so for those who work remotely we regularly organize visual meetings to keep track of what is going on in the team. In addition to this, there are visual coffee breaks where we can casually catch up with colleagues, which allows us to get to know each other.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I’m passionate about photography and art. My grandpa was a photographer and a filmmaker and he took me to work when I was a child. He taught me how to take good photos and videos. After a few training sessions with him, I was able to take some good pictures and videos, and since then I fell in love with photography. I find it tremendously exciting to be able to capture a beautiful and meaningful moment. I also love art and creative design, as your imagination can be visualised through paper or digital devices. Yet, I like the process of learning how to bring your imagination to life. For me, it’s a way to understand myself a bit more, and I enjoy the sense of accomplishment when I finish it.</p>

			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Have a great career, a happy family and to travel the world.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I’ve learned from The World Counts that around 9 million people die every year from hunger and hunger-related diseases. If I could, I would provide sufficient food to those who are suffering from hunger and save them from dying.</p>

<p>I think most of us are ready to put 2020 behind us, closing off final deals and crossing the finish line on projects we may never have expected to need to prioritise this year. We’ve all learnt a lot in a short space of time, not least the critical value of flexible digital infrastructure to support whatever the years ahead may bring for businesses.</p>
<p>Whilst we’re not entirely sure what’s in store for 2021 and beyond, we do know that three digital trends are likely to stay whatever happens next. The first is simply the increase in digital interactions as customers need to transact online, or now prefer its convenience. The second is the subsequent rise in cyberattacks as bad actors take advantage of the increased opportunity for manipulation. The third is the growth of remote working, which most agree is here to stay in some capacity, increasing the likelihood of privileged access over the public internet and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).</p>
<p>Here are three, important yet oft-forgotten, identity management principles to help guide us through the security, customer experience and operational efficiency challenges that these trends present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data collection – less is more 
<p>We’ve seen it with the media’s scrutiny of Covid tracing apps and social media’s role in the US election – more and more people are waking up to their right to privacy. Perhaps not all of us value our privacy as much as we should, but certainly awareness of data privacy is growing and transparency over data use is key.</p>
 <p>Screenshot: Instagram</p> 
<p>Best-practice identity management can help you practice the principle of data minimisation – essentially only asking for data that is absolutely necessary, and not keeping it for longer than needed. So if I’m signing up for a music streaming service, it may need to know some aspects of my identity – like my email address and bank details – but, according to data minimisation, would not need to know my gender. The service may prefer to know my gender so its marketing team can analyse demographics, but it is not necessary to my use of the service. Many apps, like Instagram, will make these fields optional to avoid registration abandonment.</p>
<p>It’s important to offer a self-service account management capability so that users can manage their own identity data and view what you know about them. It’s also important to be transparent around what you know and why you need to know it, in order to build trust with your customers. The good news is that many users are still happy to provide non-essential data if there is value for them in doing so. For example, if you let them know that this will enable you to personalise the service that you’re providing to them. This results in more loyal customers and more successful marketing/sales teams who can target their efforts based on up-to-date information – not information that’s been assumed or has expired in your CRM.</p>
<p>Speaking of your CRM, make sure it’s integrated with your app’s identity and access management. By integrating these systems, you avoid data siloes and wasting time and money on either updating each system individually or not leveraging the most up-to-date information for sales/other processes.</p>
<p>Finally, avoid asking your customers to provide identity credentials when it’s not necessary. By employing single sign-on (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/customer-sso/">SSO</a>) and step-up authentication, you can achieve the correct balance of robust security and seamless customer experience. SSO means that customers only need one set of login credentials to sign into all authorised services. If one particular service requires stronger authentication than the others, for example billing, then you can step up authentication for just that service (i.e. require another authentication factor, as we’ll see in the next principle).</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MFA is a basic requirement 
<p>Multi-factor authentication (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/authentication-mfa/">MFA</a>) is no longer a security gold standard; it is just standard. As a reminder, MFA is the use of more than one authentication factor (like a username/password plus a fingerprint scan). Customers generally fall into two camps – the camp that cares about their online security so will demand MFA availability, or the other camp who don’t really care and won’t go looking for it (and are therefore more likely to present a breach risk to your organisation). You must offer MFA to your users and, if you don’t enforce it, encourage them to set it up. If you don’t have MFA in place by the end of 2020, 2021 is the year you must find the time and budget for it. Not doing so may mean much more time and budget spent on dealing with a data breach down the line.</p>
<p>Remember that not all authentication factors are created equally. Some, like a password or social media login, are unlikely to be strong enough when used on their own as they can be hacked more easily than other methods. Others, like a bank ID or authenticator app time-based one-time password (TOTP), are stronger as they’re harder to hack. Whichever combinations you decide to enable for access to your application should reflect the sensitivity of the data you’re storing, the geographical location of your users and your regulatory context. It’s also a good idea to provide options, as only providing one choice will alienate certain users (e.g. some users may not have social media accounts or may be unable to provide certain biometric data).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Least Privilege 
<p>It can be hard to keep on top of which accounts have access to which systems internally, let alone with your (usually more numerous) external customers and/or partners. The principle of least privilege denotes that user accounts should only ever have the minimum access authorisation necessary to their role in the service. I’ll cover two examples.</p>
<p>The first example is with remote employees. When staff are in the office, it may be easy to identify anyone who should not be accessing your company systems and stop them before they do any damage. After all, they’d have to be sat in front of a team that knew them for an imposter. But with the increase in remote working, it’s more likely that bad actors could take advantage of the anonymity and gain unauthorised access to an account. If this does happen, you’ll want the hacked user’s account to have access to as little data as possible to minimise what information is visible/vulnerable to the hacker.</p>
<p>The second example is a business to business use case. Say you run an online service for your business partners, where several employees within the partner business need access to your service. The easiest thing to do is give everyone at the partner business an account with the same level of privilege. However, this would mean that if any of those accounts are hacked, the hacker also gains full access rights. But the accounts don’t all need access to every area, so this method presents an unnecessary risk. Perhaps only an administrator needs to have access to billing, while an ordinary member only needs enough access to upload documents. Here, different access rights levels reduce the risk of more sensitive areas being hacked. In this example, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/delegated-authority/">Delegated Authority</a> streamlines how you handle these access levels by giving the partner business administrator control over their own employee invitations. This saves both businesses time and, therefore, money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Final thoughts 
<p>With life online taking centre stage right now, digital identity is still firmly under the spotlight. How we protect and make life easier for our online users now will ultimately have a huge impact on business success, regardless of how long it takes to return to ‘normality’.</p>
<p>Of course, these principles above are only three out of a long list, but it would be wise to keep returning to these and asking yourself and your team if you continue to do enough on each.</p>

 What is Spring Data? 

<p>Spring Data is a behemoth. Spring calls it an “umbrella” framework. It ties together a large number of different sub-projects that aim to provide a consistent programming interface for everything from SQL and Postgres, to NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis. It also natively supports technologies such as Hibernate, JDBC, LDAP, KeyValue stores, Geode, and GemFire. Community modules add support for many other projects, such as Couchbase, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, Neo4j, and Apache Solr. The idea is to bring all of these technologies together with a consistent and familiar (to Spring developers, anyway) interface that makes it easy to implement and maintain applications using these technologies.</p>

<p>In a Java web service, Spring Data can provide a number of important functions. It allows the developer to quickly and easily declare data objects or entities using simple annotated Java classes. Spring Data will automatically map the annotated Java class to an appropriate persistence structure. It also provides a repository interface that manages reading from and writing to the database using an intuitive, query-like method structure. Finally, in some cases, it will even expose the data model and repository to the web, creating a REST service.</p>

<p>All of this means that, as you will see, with a few simple files, you can define your data model using a Java class, seamlessly persist it to a database, and expose that data in a secure RESTful web service.</p>

<p>Spring Data works well with Spring Boot, providing a super-efficient way to create web applications without having to code a whole lot of configuration and boilerplate code. Using Spring Boot and Spring MVC, RESTful web services can be created in minutes with only a handful of files and a few dozen lines of code.</p>

<p>Spring Data also supports reactive programming (asynchronous, non-blocking). The Spring WebFlux sub-project provides the reactive web server features for Spring Boot, and when combined with the relatively new R2DBC project (for relational databases) or Reactive Repositories (for NoSQL) you can build an entirely reactive web service.</p>

<p>The vision behind Spring Data is that, ideally, the same data model code and business logic code could be used with a variety of databases, and that switching between them would only require changing some dependencies and the implemented repository interface. In reality, this is asking a lot of abstraction. Typically, one chooses SQL or MongoDB because of features specific to that database, features that are not shared by all other databases. Fortunately, Spring Data exposes the unique, individual features of each database. Spring Data strikes a nice balance between simplification and abstraction while preserving database-specific features and deep customization.</p>

<p>That’s a TON of options. Let’s narrow it down. The first decision one needs to make is what database suits the needs of the application. In this case, you’re going to use a relational database (SQL). More specifically, you’re going to use the default Hibernate in-memory database that Spring Boot and Spring Data include by default when configuring a project.</p>

<p>This database is great for testing, example applications, and mock-ups. It’s quick and easy because it doesn’t require setting up an external database. It doesn’t persist between sessions, which for testing and for example apps, may be exactly what you need. Also, when you decide it’s time to move to a database that’s not in-memory, all you have to do is update some dependencies and add a little configuration.</p>

 Spring Data JPA Overview 

<p>Since you’re going to be using a relational database, you’re also going to be using Spring Data JPA. JPA is the Java Persistence API. JPA is a specification that outlines how Java objects can be mapped to database tables. Historically, JPA has only supported SQL databases, however, this is changing with EclipseLink and JPA 2.2. Spring Data JPA is the implementation of this JPA specification. This technology is what will allow you to create a plain Java class with a few annotations and expect it to be seamlessly mapped to and from the database.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<p>You’ll need to install a few things before you get started.</p>

 
   Java 11: This tutorial uses Java 11. OpenJDK 11 will work just as well. You can find instructions on the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/">OpenJDK website</a>. You can install OpenJDK using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> is another great option for installing and managing Java versions. 
   HTTPie: This is a powerful command-line HTTP request utility that you’ll use to test the WebFlux server. Install it according to <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">the docs on their site</a>. 
   Okta CLI: You’ll use this to bootstrap your project. Follow the installation instructions on <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">the project’s GitHub page</a>. 
 

<p>You’ll need a free Okta developer account to complete this tutorial. However, the Okta CLI will walk you through the registration process or allow you to log in using your credentials.</p>

 Bootstrap a Spring Data JPA Project with the Okta CLI 

<p>Open a shell and, in a reasonable parent folder location, and run the Okta CLI.</p>

   <code>okta start spring-boot
</code>   

<p>If you haven’t used the Okta CLI before, you’ll be prompted to create an account. If you have an Okta account already, you can sign in using <code>okta login</code>.</p>

<p>You’ll see the following:</p>

   <code>Configuring a new OIDC Application, almost done:
Created OIDC application, client-id: 0oa168nw50nxJSSmg4x7

Change the directory:
    cd spring-boot

Okta configuration written to: src/main/resources/application.properties
Don't EVER commit src/main/resources/application.properties into source control

Run this application with:
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>At this point, you can run the app.</p>

   <code>cd spring-boot
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Open a browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>CAUTION: If you get an <code>invalid target release: 11</code> error, it’s likely because you’re using Java 8. This tutorial requires Java 11. Time to upgrade! 😛</p>

<p>If you’re already logged into Okta, you’ll be directed to a page that displays “Hello: &lt;username&gt;”. If not, you’ll be directed to Okta to log in via OpenID Connect (OIDC). This is the default configuration. You’re going to change this to behavior from a client login flow to a JWT-based, resource server flow.</p>

<p>TIP: If you’re not familiar with OpenID Connect, resource servers, and all that jazz, you might want to check out <a>An Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a>.</p>

<p>Create a new Java class that will update the security configuration. This file temporarily allows all requests, effectively disabling security. You’ll change this later in the tutorial to enable JWT authentication.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/SecurityConfiguration.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(authorizeRequests -&gt;
                authorizeRequests.antMatchers("/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated())
            .csrf().disable();
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>SimpleRestController</code> static inner class in the <code>Application.java</code> file so that it doesn’t cause an error if there is an anonymous user.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/Application.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @RestController
    static class SimpleRestController {
        @GetMapping("/")
        String sayHello(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser) {
            return "Hello " + (oidcUser != null ? oidcUser.getFullName() : "anonymous");
        }
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Use <code>Control-C</code> to stop the running process if you haven’t already and run it again (up arrow on most good shells).</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Use HTTPie to test the root endpoint.</p>

   <code>http :8080
</code>   

<p>You should see the following:</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200
...

Hello anonymous
</code>   

<p>This shows that you successfully made a request to the root endpoint of the unprotected Spring Boot resource server.</p>

 Create a Dinosaur Domain Model 

<p>What this world needs right now is some gigantic, prehistoric monsters, so, in order to demonstrate how to use Spring Data JPA, you’re going to create a dinosaur domain model and a dinosaur repository.</p>

<p>The first step in creating prehistoric monsters is, of course, adding the requisite dependencies to your Maven <code>pom.xml</code> file. You’re adding four dependencies.</p>

 
   <code>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</code> is the basic Spring Data JPA project meta-dependency 
   <code>spring-boot-starter-data-rest</code> adds the REST interface capabilities to the <code>CrudRepository</code> 
   <code>h2</code> tells Spring Data that you want to use an H2 database, which will default to the in-memory database 
   <code>lombok</code> is a helper that will allow us to easily generate some getters, setters, and a constructor in your data model class 
 

<p><code>pom.xml</code></p>
   <code>&lt;dependencies&gt;

    ...

    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-data-jpa&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-data-rest&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;com.h2database&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;h2&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.projectlombok&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;lombok&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;1.18.14&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now create the dinosaur data model class itself. Notice the three annotations: <code>@Getter @Setter @NoArgsConstructor</code>. This is where Lombok is helping you to generate some boilerplate code. If you’re doing this tutorial in an IDE, you may need to enable annotation processing so Lombok can generate code for you. See Lombok’s instructions { <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij">IDEA</a> }  for more information.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/Dinosaur.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Setter;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
@Getter @Setter @NoArgsConstructor
public class Dinosaur {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    private boolean fangs;

    private int numberOfArms;

    private double weightTons;

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format(
                "Customer[id=%d, name='%s', fangs='%b', numberOfArms='%d', weightTons='%f']",
                id, name, fangs, numberOfArms, weightTons);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This defines a dinosaur with five properties:</p>

 
   <code>id</code>: the unique identifier in the database 
   <code>name</code>: all things need names, even giant prehistoric monsters 
   <code>genusAndSpecies</code>: what is the scientific genus and species? 
   <code>fangs</code>: cut to the chase, does the dinosaur have fangs? 
   <code>numberOfArms</code>: how many grasping arms does it have? 
   <code>weightTons</code>: how overwhelmingly enormous is it? 
 

<p>Now, these dinosaurs aren’t wreaking much havoc in your head. You need a way to create, read, update, and delete these dinosaurs. And don’t forget the DELETE part, that’s the mistake the movie made! If they had used Spring, they would have gotten DELETE automatically for free and, while it might not have been much of a movie, they would have survived.</p>

 Create a Spring Data Repository 

<p>Create a <code>DinosaurRepository</code>. This is the interface that will leverage Spring Data JPA to read and write the Dinosaur instances to and from the in-memory database.</p>

<p>Further, because you’re extending Spring’s <code>CrudRepository</code> repository, you will get a fully functioning REST interface automatically. If you don’t want or need the REST interface, or you want to create your own, you could subclass <code>Repository</code>.</p>

<p>There are two other relevant repository types: <code>JpaRepository</code> and <code>PagingAndSortingRepository</code>. All of these are part of a class hierarchy, building on <code>Repository</code>.</p>

 
   <code>Repository</code> is the base class. It adds the basic database functions. 
   <code>CrudRepository</code> extends <code>Repository</code> and adds the REST interface. 
   <code>PagingAndSortingRepository</code> extends <code>CrudRepository</code> and adds paging and sorting abilities. 
   <code>JpaRepository</code> extends <code>PagingAndSortingRepository</code> and adds a few JPA-related features, such as deleting batches of records and persistence context flushing. 
 

<p>Now create the <code>DinosaurRepository</code>.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/DinosaurRepository.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface DinosaurRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Dinosaur, Long&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>You’ll notice there’s not much there. If you look at the <code>CrudRepository</code> superclass, you’ll see the methods that are being implemented and exposed by the repository.</p>

   <code>public interface CrudRepository&lt;T, ID&gt; extends Repository&lt;T, ID&gt; {
    &lt;S extends T&gt; S save(S var1);

    &lt;S extends T&gt; Iterable&lt;S&gt; saveAll(Iterable&lt;S&gt; var1);

    Optional&lt;T&gt; findById(ID var1);

    boolean existsById(ID var1);

    Iterable&lt;T&gt; findAll();

    Iterable&lt;T&gt; findAllById(Iterable&lt;ID&gt; var1);

    long count();

    void deleteById(ID var1);

    void delete(T var1);

    void deleteAll(Iterable&lt;? extends T&gt; var1);

    void deleteAll();
}
</code>   

<p>Now you can test the automatically generated REST resource. Use <code>Control-C</code> to stop the running process if you haven’t already and run it again.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Then, hit the <code>/dinosaurs</code> endpoint to see the response.</p>

   <code>http :8080/dinosaurs
</code>   

<p>Since you don’t have any dinosaurs, the results aren’t very exciting. All you have is an empty array along with some HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State) and HAL (Hypertext Application Language) links.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200
...

{
    "_embedded": {
        "dinosaurs": []
    },
    "_links": {
        "profile": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/profile/dinosaurs"
        },
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/dinosaurs"
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Spring Data REST uses HATEOAS and HAL to return formatted data. Very, very briefly: HAL is a descriptive resource language that uses published links to point to resources. It allows a resource server to describe itself to its clients. You can read more about it on <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#repository-resources.resource-discoverability">the Spring Data REST page</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid exposing the REST resource entirely, you can annotate the <code>DinosaurRepository</code> in the following way. This disables the REST resource.</p>

   <code>@RepositoryRestResource(exported=false)
public interface DinosaurRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Dinosaur, Long&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>Further, if you wanted to hide only certain CRUD methods, you can use the <code>@RestResource(exported = false)</code> annotation on individual methods. Let’s say you want to disable the delete methods for the dinosaurs (cue maniacal laughing and hand wringing).</p>

<p>Go ahead and update your <code>DinosaurRepository</code> to match the following:</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/DinosaurRepository.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.annotation.RestResource;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.config.RepositoryRestConfiguration;
import org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.config.RepositoryRestConfigurer;

public interface DinosaurRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Dinosaur, Long&gt; {
    @Override
    @RestResource(exported = false)
    void deleteById(Long id);

    @Override
    @RestResource(exported = false)
    void delete(Dinosaur entity);

    @Configuration
    static class RepositoryConfig implements RepositoryRestConfigurer {
        @Override
        public void configureRepositoryRestConfiguration(RepositoryRestConfiguration config) {
            config.exposeIdsFor(Dinosaur.class);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The general idea is to override the particular subclass method to be hidden and mark them so they’re not exported. Notice that in this case, to hide the delete methods, you have to hide both of the subclass’s delete methods.</p>

<p>I also slipped another change into the file. I added the <code>RepositoryConfig</code> static class to configure Spring to return the entity IDs with the JSON. Spring doesn’t do that by default, and it’s handy to do that in this example to demonstrate the CRUD methods.</p>

<p>Before you try this all out, create some bootstrapped demo data to be loaded into the database. Create a <code>src/main/resources/data.sql</code> file that will be run upon application initialization only when the H2 in-memory database is being used.</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/data.sql</code></p>
   <code>INSERT INTO dinosaur (name, fangs, number_of_arms, weight_tons) VALUES  
  ('Terror Bird', true, 2, 100),  
  ('Ankylosaurus', true, 4, 350.5),
  ('Spinosaurus', false, 4, 500);
</code>   

<p>Remember these are recombinant, mutated dinosaurs, not actual dinosaurs, so they have extra arms.</p>

 Test Your Spring Data JPA-Powered REST API 

<p>Now, try it out. Run the Spring Boot app (<code>Control-C</code> if necessary).</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Perform a GET request on the <code>/dinosaur</code> REST endpoint.</p>

   <code>http :8080/dinosaurs
</code>   

<p>You’ll see the following (with some elements omitted for clarity):</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200
...

{
    "_embedded": {
        "dinosaurs": [
            {
                ...
                "fangs": true,
                "id": 1
                "name": "Terror Bird",
                "numberOfArms": 2,
                "weightTons": 100.0
            },
            {
                ...
                "fangs": true,
                "id": 2
                "name": "Ankylosaurus",
                "numberOfArms": 4,
                "weightTons": 350.5
            },
            {
                ...
                "fangs": false,
                "id": 3
                "name": "Spinosaurus",
                "numberOfArms": 4,
                "weightTons": 500.0
            }
        ]
    },
    ...
}
</code>   

<p>Try to delete one of the dinosaurs.</p>

   <code>http DELETE :8080/dinosaurs/1
</code>   

<p>The response should be a 405 error. HTTP 405 is “method not allowed.” Evil laughter. And, the dinosaurs take over the world.</p>

<p>To avert disaster, remove the two <code>@Override</code> methods from the <code>DinosaurRepository</code>.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/DinosaurRepository.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.config.RepositoryRestConfiguration;
import org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.config.RepositoryRestConfigurer;

public interface DinosaurRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Dinosaur, Long&gt; {
    @Configuration
    static class RepositoryConfig implements RepositoryRestConfigurer {
        @Override
        public void configureRepositoryRestConfiguration(RepositoryRestConfiguration config) {
            config.exposeIdsFor(Dinosaur.class);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Stop (Control-C) and re-start the Spring Boot app.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Delete it again using HTTPie.</p>

   <code>http DELETE :8080/dinosaurs/1

...
HTTP/1.1 204
...
</code>   

<p>HTTP 204 implies “no content.” The server has successfully performed the delete and has nothing else to say about it. If you perform a GET request (<code>http :8080/dinosaurs</code>), you’ll see one less dinosaur. Crisis averted!</p>

<p>The only thing left to do is to secure the whole thing so random foreign net-bots aren’t creating dinosaurs willy-nilly.</p>

 Implement an OAuth 2.0 Resource Server 

<p>Thanks to Okta’s Spring Boot Starter, most of the OAuth is already in place. All you need to do to activate it is update your <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class. The following code configures the application to authorize all requests using JWTs and OAuth 2.0.</p>

   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(authorizeRequests -&gt; authorizeRequests.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Remember that you or the Okta CLI put the necessary OAuth configuration for Okta in the <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file, which should look something like the following:</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id={yourClientId}
okta.oauth2.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
</code>   

<p>Stop (Control-C) and re-start the Spring Boot app.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Run a GET on the dinosaur service.</p>

   <code>http :8080/dinosaurs
</code>   

<p>It’s now locked down.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 401
...
</code>   

 Generate an Access Token JWT 

<p>You used Okta as your OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider when you used the Okta CLI. The CLI created an OIDC application for you on the Okta developer site and filled in the config details in the <code>application.properties</code> file. Your application is now expecting a JSON Web Token (JWT) when you make requests.</p>

<p>To generate a JWT, you can use the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OIDC Debugger</a>.</p>

<p>However, before you do that, you need to add a login redirect URI to your OIDC application. Navigate to the developer dashboard at <a href="https://developer.okta.com">https://developer.okta.com</a>. If this is your first time logging in, you may need to click the Admin button.</p>

<p>Click on Applications in the top menu.</p>

<p>In the panel, select the okta-spring-boot-sample application (the one that the CLI generated for you).</p>

<p>Select the General tab. Click Edit.</p>

<p>Add a new entry under Login redirect URIs: <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Save.</p>

<p>Take note of the OIDC applications Client ID and Client Secret at the bottom. You’ll need both of those values in just a moment.</p>

<p>Open the OIDC Debugger at <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">https://oidcdebugger.com</a>.</p>

<p>Fill in the following values:</p>

 
   Authorization URI: <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> (update {yourOktaDomain} with your actual Okta domain, something like <code>dev-1234567.okta.com</code> 
   Redirect URI: <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> (default value) 
   Client ID: the client ID from your OIDC application above 
   Scope: <code>openid</code> (default value) 
   State: any value (in production this is used to protect against cross-site request forgery) 
   Response type: <code>code</code> 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click SEND REQUEST at the bottom of the form.</p>

<p>You should see an authorization code.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You need to exchange this code for a token. You can use HTTPie. Don’t forget to fill in the values in brackets: the authorization code, your Okta domain, your OIDC app client ID, and your OIDC app client secret.</p>

   <code>http -f https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token \
  grant_type=authorization_code \
  code={yourAuthCode} \
  client_id={clientId} \
  client_secret={clientSecret} \
  redirect_uri=https://oidcdebugger.com/debug
</code>   

<p>You should get a JSON response that includes an access token and an ID token.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
Connection: keep-alive
...

{
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJycGZWTzd4R2hDWmlvUXdrWWha...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJycGZWTzd4R2hDWmlvUXdrWWhaSkph...",
    "scope": "openid",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
</code>   

 Access Your API with an OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token 

<p>Copy the resulting <code>access_token</code> value to the clipboard, and in the terminal where you are running your HTTPie commands, save the token value to a shell variable, like this:</p>

   <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJxMm5rZmtwUDRhMlJLV2REU2JfQ...
</code>   

<p>Now you can use the token in a request.</p>

   <code>http :8080/dinosaurs "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

<p>You should see your list of dinosaurs. 🦖</p>

 Learn More About Spring Data and Spring Boot 

<p>In this tutorial, you took a look at Spring Data in general and saw how it is an umbrella project. It encompasses a huge range of technologies that are designed to make persisting and manipulating data easy across widely divergent technologies without sacrificing technical flexibility.</p>

<p>As an example of this, you used Spring Data JPA to create a simple relational database model and repository. You used Spring’s <code>CrudRepository</code> class and saw how it automatically created a resource server from your data model. Finally, you used Okta’s OAuth 2.0 and OIDC implementation to quickly and easily add JWT authentication to your resource server. All of this was bootstrapped by Okta’s CLI.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-data-jpa-example">oktadeveloper/okta-spring-data-jpa-example</a>.</p>

  <p>Homeoffice und remote Zusammenarbeit werden durch ein weites und attraktives Angebot von cloudbasierten Collaborations-Tools begünstigt. Die aktuelle Covid-19 pandemische Situation hat zu einem großflächigen Aussetzen der Präsenzzusammenarbeit geführt. Ein nicht unerheblicher Teil der digitalen Collaboration findet - unter Access Management Gesichtspunkten betrachtet - mäßig bis schlecht organisiert statt. Wie bekommt man solche Collaborations-Szenarien (wieder) unter Kontrolle? Wie verhält es sich mit ad-hoc Szenarien? Der Vortrag wirft einen kritischen&nbsp; Blick auf Cloud-Collaboration und stellt einige hilfreiche praxiserprobte Lösungsansätze und Patterns im IAM-Umfeld dar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key Topics:</p>
<p>* Remote Zusammenarbeit und digitale Collaboration</p>
<p>* Typische Situationen: ad-hoc, Homeoffice, Beteiligungen und Partner</p>
<p>* Typische Cloud-Tool-Landschaft</p>
<p>* Patterns und Antipatterns zu Access-Management und Collaboration</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cas2020_2020_11_18_richter"></a>

Vielmehr werden alltägliche Verbraucherdienste in großem Maßstab angegriffen, was Sicherheitsprobleme für Einzelhandels-, Reise-, Lebensmittel- und Medienunternehmen schafft. Wie sehen diese Angriffe aus? Wie lassen sie sich identifizieren? Wie schützen Sie Ihre Kunden und Ihr Unternehmen vor kompromittierten Konten und dem Verlust digitaler Vermögenswerte?

  <p>Viele Organisationen stehen vor der Herausforderung Richtlinien für das Arbeiten aus dem Home-Office zu implementieren, um unter anderem eine stetig steigende Anzahl an Remote- und Hybrid-Mitarbeitern zu unterstützen. Während ein hybrides Arbeitsmodell eine interessante und aufregende Entwicklung darstellt, waren viele Organisationen nicht auf diese rasche, anfängliche Verlagerung der Arbeitsstruktur in Hybrid- oder Remote-Modelle vorbereitet. Die Nutzung einer Privileged Access Management-Lösung kann federführend dabei unterstützen, Sicherheitsauswirkungen dieser wachsenden Remote- und Hybrid-Belegschaft zu minimieren. Der Vortrag zeigt auf, wie diese neuen Arbeitsmodelle sicher supported sowie weiter ausgebaut werden können und legt dar, welche Rolle ein ganzheitlicher Privileged Access Management-Ansatz hierbei spielt.</p>

<p>Martin Kuppinger spricht über die Herausforderungen von IAM im Zeitalter der Digitalen Transformation und die sich ändernden Anforderungen, die heute weit über ein „Mitarbeiter-IAM“ hinausgehen. Er zeigt auf, wie man das IAM fit für die neuen Herausforderungen machen kann, vom Betriebsmodell zur Bedienung hybrider Zielsysteme bis hin zur Unterstützung aller Benutzergruppen wie Partner, Konsumenten und Mitarbeiter, aber auch von weiteren Identitäten wie denen von Dingen, Software-Robotern (Robotic Process Automation) oder Geräten. Gleichzeitig erläutert er auch, wie man hier einen schrittweisen, selbstgesteuerten Übergang schaffen kann, bei dem ein schneller Nutzern für das Business erreicht wird.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cas2020_2020_11_18_kuppinger"></a>

  <p>Privilege Access Management (PAM) sollte ein Schlüsselelement in Ihrer Sicherheitsstrategie sein. Daher müssen Sie sicherstellen, dass sich die von Ihnen gewählte Lösung leicht in Ihre Geschäftsprozesse und -vorgänge integrieren lässt. Erstens muss die Lösung schnell in Ihrer Umgebung implementiert werden können und möglichst wenig Reibung im täglichen Geschäftsbetrieb verursachen. Darüber hinaus muss sie sich nahtlos in andere Geschäftsvorgänge wie IGA, DevOps, Robotische Prozessautomatisierung und Active Directory integrieren, um Just-in-Time-Privilegien zu bieten, die Zero Trust ermöglichen. Außerdem muss die Verhaltensanalyse genutzt werden, um Risiken in Echtzeit zu beheben. Bevor Sie weitere Schritte mit Ihrem aktuellen PAM-Projekt unternehmen, nehmen Sie an dieser Sitzung teil, um zu sehen, wie das PAM-Portfolio der nächsten Generation von One Identity den Schutz, die Sichtbarkeit und den Umfang bietet, den Sie benötigen, um die schnellste Wertschöpfung und die niedrigsten Gesamtbetriebskosten zu erzielen.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cas2020_2020_11_18_bakos"></a>

Designed for simplicity and usability, Trinsic Studio has all the tools you need to build an SSI solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this how-to post, we will be walking through how to issue credentials in Trinsic Studio. Follow the steps below, and you’ll be issuing credentials in minutes!</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Sign up for a free Trinsic Studio account 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>To do so, go to <a href="https://trinsic.studio/">https://trinsic.studio/</a> and follow the instructions on the screen.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create an Organization 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In order to issue a credential, you must first create the Organization that will be issuing the credential. For this example, let’s say that Faber College is issuing its most recent graduate class digital diplomas in the form of a verifiable credential. To make Faber College an Organization in Trinsic Studio:<br><br></p>  Click on the “+Organization” button on the dashboard screen.  Create an Organization called Faber College. Feel free to upload a logo if you would like. For the Preferred Network drop-down, make sure you are on Sovrin Staging for this walkthrough. Click “Continue to Review”.  After making sure all the information is correct, click “Confirm”.  <p><br>And just like that, Faber College has been created as an Organization on Trinsic Studio.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create a Credential Template 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>All verifiable credentials come from credential templates. These templates specify what information should be included in a credential. Faber College would most likely want the credential template of its digital diplomas to include a graduate’s first and last name, what they got their degree in, what year they graduated, and their GPA. Let’s begin!<br><br></p>  First, click on the Faber College organization card on the dashboard screen.  Second, go to the Credentials tab and click the “+ Template” button.  Third, fill out the “Create a Credential Template” form. Since we are creating a brand new credential template, choose the “create new schema” option. Name the credential “College Diploma”. Go ahead and leave the “Version” and “Tag” boxes as they are. You can read more about each if you hover over their icons. You can also make the credentials revocable if you would like, but we are not going to do that in this tutorial. Now, add the following five attributes: First Name, Last Name, Degree, Year, and GPA. Click “Create Template”.  <p><br>With this credential template created, Faber College can start issuing credentials to its graduates.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Issue a credential 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>This is the fun part! The first graduate Faber College will send a digital diploma to is Alice Smith. To do so:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Navigate to the “Credentials” tab as Faber College.  Locate the “College Diploma” credential template.  Click on the “ISSUE” button that corresponds with that template.  Fill in all the attributes with Alice’s information.  Now you must decide how you want to send the credential. It can be by connection (which we will cover soon in an upcoming blog post), by email, or by QR code/link. We will choose to send the credential via Generate QR Code/Link.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Faber College can then send Alice her unique QR code which she can easily scan with the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> or another SSI wallet of her choice. Once she scans the QR code, Alice will have her digital diploma conveniently on her phone to easily and conveniently share with future employers or whoever else she chooses.</p>

<p>*SATIRE WARNING*</p>
      
<p>With Thanksgiving approaching, there’s a good chance you’re agonizing over what dinner topics to avoid so your holiday meal isn’t ruined. You’ve endured too much in 2020 to let a debate with your uncle ruin dinner. </p>
      
<p>Rather than stoke conflict at the dinner table, let’s inspire family togetherness by discussing a safe topic: passwords.</p>
      
<p>You read that correctly. This Thanksgiving, talk to your family about passwords.&nbsp;The world is united in an unbending dislike of passwords, so jointly denigrating them is a reliable way to promote a sense of community even among distant relatives. </p>
      
<p>Here are some conversation starters:</p>
      
  Ask your family members how many passwords they have and how much they enjoy being told to reset their passwords.  Challenge everyone to come up with a strong password, then <a href="https://password.kaspersky.com/">check how long it would take to crack</a>. The winner gets to take home leftovers.  Help your loved ones organize a walkout at their company in protest of the new 16-character complex password policy. Continue this until the company agrees to eliminate passwords.  Debate your father on the societal norms of making passwords “long and complicated” and how this archaic practice has influenced our perception of what a password is supposed to look like.  Encourage your parents to start Facebook rants with strangers about how awful passwords are.  Start a conspiracy theory about how passwords are actually usernames. Create a 2-hour youtube video explaining this and have everyone share it aggressively on social media.   Give your dinner guests advice on how to avoid reusing passwords by leveraging a password generator. Remind them to never write them down, because the safest password is the kind you cant even remember.  Collect everyone’s phone and change their unlock passcodes to !Ra*NiM/QtG__3zcFfmuKCU%fj97ztH8Da  Develop a roundtable discussion on the embarrassing yet natural inclination as humans to reuse passwords across services.  Argue with your aunt about government overreach and how the <a href="https://www.hypr.com/strong-customer-authentication-psd2/">PSD2 regulations enforcing strong customer authentication</a> are clearly an attack on your personal right to use weak passwords.  Force your dad to read a <a href="https://get.hypr.com/true-password-less-security-white-paper">white paper on passwordless security</a>, then quiz him about the nuances of standards-based authentication and Public-Key Encryption.  Argue with your niece and nephew about how much simpler passwords were “back in my day” – even though they’re only slightly younger than you.  
      
<p>There you have it. A Thanksgiving dinner everyone will remember. And in between bites of beans, greens, potatoes and tomatoes – make sure you remind people that <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-authentication/">passwordless authentication is finally happening</a>.</p>
      
<p>Unlike topics that alienate people, a rigid contempt for passwords is the underlying truth that binds people together even when they don’t agree on other matters. This is without doubt and without exception, since across the known universe, people from all walks of life can unite in their contempt for the password. </p>
      
<p>So this year, let the venom about password flow like so much turkey gravy. Your guests will thank us for the suggestion, and perhaps an unyielding hostility towards, say, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-token/">hardware security tokens</a> will make New Year’s Eve all the more memorable.</p>

 Marielle S. Gross, M.D., OB-GYN and Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, on the oversharing and myths of de-identification of sensitive health&nbsp;data <p>In the eighth episode of Voices of The Data Economy, we spoke to Marielle S. Gross, M.D., an OB-GYN and postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. In a conversation with us, she demystified the data privacy issues with the famous story of Henrietta Lacks and HeLa cells; the concerns with oversharing of sensitive women’s health data; the myths about de-identification of health data, and more. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> The Story of Henrietta Lacks and Bioethical standards <p>The story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks">Henrietta Lacks</a> could be termed as a famous bioethics and social ethics case study. It begins in the early 1950s, the United States with Henrietta Lacks, a poor working black woman who was the mother of four children. According to the John Hopkins website, in 1951, she visited The Johns Hopkins Hospital and upon examination, renowned gynecologist Dr. Howard Jones discovered a large, malignant tumor on her cervix. A sample of her cancer cells retrieved during a biopsy were sent to Dr. George Gey’s nearby tissue lab. For years, Dr. Gey, prominent cancer and virus researcher, had been collecting cells from all patients who came to The Johns Hopkins Hospital with cervical cancer, but each sample quickly died in Dr. Gey’s lab. What he would soon discover was that Mrs. Lacks’ cells were unlike any of the others he had ever seen — where other cells would die, Mrs. Lacks’ cells doubled every 20 to 24&nbsp;hours.</p><p>Today, these cells — nicknamed “HeLa” cells — are used to study the effects of toxins, drugs, hormones, and viruses on the growth of cancer cells without experimenting on humans. They have been used to test the effects of radiation and poisons, to study the human genome, to learn more about how viruses work and played a crucial role in the development of the polio&nbsp;vaccine.</p><p>However, Marielle mentions that a sample of her normal tissue and a sample of her cancer tissue were taken- infamously without her permission, knowledge, or consent. The story starts when her cells just grew like wildfire, in the culture medium, and they subsequently were known as HeLa cells. Those cells became absolutely essential to basically 20th-century medicine as they were the only cells that anybody could grow for a long time, the majority of the major developments in medicine were done utilizing those cells. Each field of medicine, you could think about that has had a major development since 1950, in most cases, where biomedicine is involved — HeLa cells were also involved.</p><p>However, the family of Henrietta Lacks still has not been compensated. It took until the 1970s before the family ended up finding out about the research even on their mother’s tissue happening. They didn’t know about their mother’s role, and developing all these key scientific advancements that have saved lives and made billions. <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/henriettalacks/upholding-the-highest-bioethical-standards.html">Further details about the bioethical standards can be found here</a> on the Johns Hopkins&nbsp;website.</p> What if Henrietta Lacks happened&nbsp;today… <p>Marielle’s argument here is that what happened to Henrietta Lacks in the 1950’s is happening to all of us- each person who’s receiving care. “I can only relate to the US healthcare system where health data is recorded digitally, through a variety of mechanisms, creating these very elaborate digital biospecimens. What makes DNA so unique — how long the code is and how little variations matter. The same thing is exactly true in terms of our healthcare records.&nbsp;“</p><p><a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/judge-dismisses-data-sharing-lawsuit-against-university-chicago-google">Why did Google and the University of Chicago get in trouble when they collaborated on healthcare records?</a> Because of the triangulation of data, and how tiny little details of who, where, when, and the combination of that with other details of medical records, instantly, people are identified.</p><p>“There’s this whole fiction of de-identification as a way of protecting people from violations and the use of their data,” says Marielle. We all are familiar with the technologies that can be implemented where we don’t have to sacrifice privacy in order to learn from our data. We can totally protect the privacy of data while extracting analytic value from it. Whether it’s blockchain or <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-data-economy-andrew-trask-privacy-preserving-ai-845c47ae4e27">privacy-preserving technologies</a>, at least in theory, would allow us to protect people’s privacy and not have to compromise on privacy, while not erasing their name from the database that connects them with their information.</p><p>“While regulations have this premise of de-identification as something that is protective of individuals, I would argue that it’s really protective of the researchers. By protecting the privacy of those individuals, what we’re doing is that we’re cutting off people from access to the benefits from their data and it is being used by third parties. Our data is being used by third parties constantly. We at best are secondary recipients of those benefits. Whereas we could in many cases, be primary recipients and rightfully so.&nbsp;“</p><p>Marielle adds that Henrietta Lacks underwent invasive procedures. And as an OB-GYN, this speaks to her because doing a pelvic exam is inherently uncomfortable and violating — even if it’s done for the right reasons to help&nbsp;you.</p><p>“Often intimate and invasive acts are done in the process of collecting information about you where the premise of that procedure is that it is being done to help you in your health care. And in reality, it is just for the purposes of collecting data. I think that we have to acknowledge that there’s something significant going on there when the procedure is no longer about nearly just helping that individuals’ healthcare interests are advanced but the systemic treatment of data as something which is constantly mined. There’s a dual purpose of that procedure. And because of that dual purpose, the part that’s not just about advancing one’s health interests, I think gives additional rights and responsibilities.”</p> Can the de-identification of data save&nbsp;us? <p>With regards to the de-identification of data, the concept here is of group&nbsp;harm.</p><p>“Part of the whole problem with the de-identification of data is that it’s cutting off that feedback loop that we want. It’s cutting off that automatic feedback to the very individual, who is part of that research. There’s no mechanism through which it is automatically feeding back to the physician of that patient, even though we studied the physician’s records about that patient. It’s not like a mystery who that person was, because even if they were de-identified for the purposes of the study, we know how easy it is to re-identify people. But we have laws that actually specifically prevent the recontact, what’s called recontacting or re-identification of the research subjects. We are preventing that from happening.”</p> Final thoughts <p>Marielle concludes, “I think the key here is to step back and not allow the constant creation and third party utilization of data about our bodies to go unquestioned. Not allow it to be so normalized as it has been in a way that has just totally snuck in under the radar convincing us that it is being collected for our benefit. This is so pervasive, both within a medical context and outside of medical context, like within your doctor’s office and in your regular home life. We’re not questioning it and we are accepting the trade-offs. I would like more people to want to discuss how their data ought to be treated and protected. What they’re owed by those who use their data for their own benefits.”</p><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>5:10 — 19:10 The background and privacy concerns with Henrietta Lacks&nbsp;Story</p><p>19:10 — 25:55 The role of regulations in healthcare data collection</p><p>26:00 — 33:00 Why de-identification of data is a&nbsp;myth</p><p>33:00 — 42:30 Oversharing of sensitive women-health data</p><p>47:06 — onwards How is data affecting marginalized groups?</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Introducing a new collaboration between Ocean Protocol and Secret Network that will provide trustless and convenient access control for Ocean datatokens as well as decentralized private compute via Secret&nbsp;Network. <p>By <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="https://scrt.network">Secret&nbsp;Network</a></p> Overview <p>Ocean and Secret have long shared a vision for unlocking the true power and value of data via decentralized and privacy-preserving technologies. Leveraging the experience of our teams and the strength of our products and ecosystems, we are excited to announce a new collaboration that will create substantial opportunities for data publishers, data consumers, and developers.</p><p>This blog post summarizes a potential path to integrate Secret Network with Ocean Protocol, currently in the research phase, so that data publishers on Ocean Market no longer have to choose between convenience versus full trustlessness.</p><p>We are also announcing Secret Network’s support for Ocean Protocol’s <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-data-economy-challenge-datatokens-edition-32bab6e7c339">Data Economy Challenge</a>, where Secret will be sponsoring an additional bonus prize and participating in judging! Read to the end of this post to learn more about this opportunity for developers.</p> Challenges <p>There are two challenges in the Ocean ecosystem that an integration with Secret Network can help&nbsp;address:</p><p>1) Publishers of data to Ocean Market can either have convenience or fully trustless operation, but not both at&nbsp;once.</p><p>Currently the url of an Ocean data service is stored on-chain. Ocean “Provider” middleware encrypts and decrypts that&nbsp;url.</p><p>(a) For a given data service, the publisher can run their own Provider, which is trustless but not convenient.</p><p>(b) Or, they can use the Provider run by the operator of Ocean Market, which is convenient but allows the operator to see the decrypted url. The operator is Ocean Protocol Foundation.</p><p>Ocean Market actually only exposes (b) right now, but the tech for (a) is a small amount of work away, with no research needed. The goal is to get both (a) and (b) at once and Secret Network can help achieve&nbsp;this.</p><p>2) Publishers of Compute-to-Data services can either have convenience or fully trustless operation, but not both at&nbsp;once.</p><p>Compute-to-data can run any script and return results to the data consumer. However, there’s a risk that the script supplied leaks sensitive data, like Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The script can be malicious or simply&nbsp;overfit.</p><blockquote>Malicious: the script has special code that sends the data to the script supplier. The supplier obfuscates this code via an easy-to-miss special import like “import sk_learn” (versus the correct version “import sklearn”). The special library wraps sklearn, but injects&nbsp;copying.</blockquote><blockquote>Overfit: the model learns too much detail so that sensitive data can be extracted from it. An extreme example is: in CART tree training, learning each branch only stops when the leaf node has a single datapoint. Or, a neural network could get overfit if it has a large number of parameters compared to its datapoints and it doesn’t do regularization in training.</blockquote><p>To address the risk of leaking sensitive data, the publisher must choose what scripts to trust. Thus it’s the same entity that risks private data getting exposed and chooses what algorithm to trust. It is their choice to make, based on their risk-reward preference. To catch malicious scripts, they simply do inspection. To catch overfitting that leads to data leakage, some algorithms are easy to trust, like averaging or learning a logistic regression model. But for more advanced modeling, it’s a bit more of a burden. If the publisher is an AI expert, they can “vet” it themselves but it takes time. Otherwise they will need to rely on a trusted third party AI expert, or community-curated scripts.</p><p>To summarize the problem. Publishers can either&nbsp;have:</p>  (a) convenience and rely on third parties to vet the scripts,&nbsp;or  (b) they can inspect for themselves which requires time and expertise.  <p>The goal is to get both (a) and (b) at once. Secret Contracts which enable privacy preserving computations can help to address these challenges.</p> User Story <p>Alice is a data consumer (buying data) and Bob is a data provider (selling&nbsp;data).</p><p>Steps 1–3 solve challenge (1) described above. Additional step (4) solves challenge (2)&nbsp;above.</p>  Bob publishes a dataset onto Ethereum via&nbsp;Ocean    (a) Bob stores his data (IPFS, S3 etc.) in an encrypted manner — platform / UX&nbsp;TBD  (b) Bob publishes a dataset on Ocean Market. This includes minting an Ocean ERC20 datatoken contract on Ethereum mainnet, with symbol LKYSQD-23 (Lucky Squid). Bob lists LKYSQD-23 for purchase on Ocean Market, with either fixed price or automatic (AMM-based) price.  (c) Bob deploys a “Secret Vault” contract for LKYSQD-23 onto Secret Network. The.decryption key from 1a) is stored in its state, and can only be accessed by LKYSQD-23 tokens of&nbsp;1b).  <p>2. Alice buys access to data by acquiring 1.0 LKY-SQD datatokens on Ethereum via Ocean Market or another marketplace /&nbsp;DEX.</p><p>3. Alice accesses&nbsp;dataset</p>  (a) Using the Secret Ethereum bridge, Alice locks her 1.0 LKYSQD-23 on Ethereum, provides a Secret Network (SN) address and signs a Metamask&nbsp;TX.  (b) Multisig committee will mint LKYSQD-23 wrapped on SN to Alice’s address to make secretLKYSQD-23 (“LKYSQD-23, wrapped by Secret”).  (c) On SN, Alice sends her secretLKYSQD-23 to the vault contact from 1c) and she’s granted access (decryption key) to the&nbsp;data.  <p>4. Alice is not allowed to access the data set (privacy), but will use data in her private algorithm</p>  (a) Using the Secret Ethereum bridge, Alice locks her 1.0 LKYSQD-23 on Ethereum, provides a SN address and signs a Metamask TX. The multisig committee mints 1.0 secretLKYSQD-23 on&nbsp;SN.  (b) Alice also deploys a Secret contract for computation, to&nbsp;SN  (c) Alice sends her algorithm as an encrypted input to the computation contract in&nbsp;4b)  (d) Alice sends her secretLKYSQD-23 and the secret contract address in 4b) to the vault contact in&nbsp;1c)  (e) Data stored in SecretVault 1c) is sent to the computation contract in&nbsp;4b)  (f) Alice receives the computation result   Secret Ocean Collaboration <p>This new collaboration between Ocean and Secret will be enabled by the following components and modules of Secret&nbsp;Network:</p> Secret Contracts <p>Secret contracts can accept algorithms and data as encrypted inputs to complete contract execution in a fully private manner.

If desired, these datatokens can be minted as <a href="https://github.com/enigmampc/secretSCRT">privacy tokens</a> as well. The bridge has a M-by-N multisig committee that observes ETH and Secret to detect lock / burn transactions and mint or unlock funds in respective chains.</p> Secret Vault&nbsp;contract <p>The <a href="https://github.com/enigmampc/secret-vault">Secret Vault library</a> can be used to create an access control contract that allows storing private keys in the state of the contact. Secret Vault contracts can be designed to expose the private keys to certain parties interacting with the contract, “unlocking” content or access. <a href="https://github.com/PadlockApp">Padlock</a> is a sample implementation of Secret Vaults for monetizing content on Web3, the result of a recent hackathon project.</p> Next Steps <p>The teams and communities supporting Secret Network and Ocean Protocol share a commitment to data decentralization and protection while leveraging the power of Web3-based technologies. As our collaboration continues, we are looking for more developers and data providers to work alongside us as well as utilize and improve our solutions.</p><p>If you’re working on complimentary technologies or products, or if you want to provide any feedback to our teams, send us a&nbsp;note:</p><p><a href="mailto:info@oceanprotocol.com">info@oceanprotocol.com</a> and <a href="http://info@secret.foundation">info@secret.foundation</a></p><p>In addition, Secret Network is excited to be collaborating with Ocean on the Ocean Protocol Data Economy Challenge: datatokens edition (DEC). Secret will be offering a bonus prize for best integration between Ocean Protocol and Secret Network, with the winning team receiving $2,000 in SCRT coins. Both Ocean and Secret communities would love to see hackers work towards addressing the challenges listed in this&nbsp;post:</p><p>Challenge 1) Publishers of data to Ocean Market can either have convenience or fully trustless operation, but not both at once. (recommended)</p><p>Challenge 2) Publishers of Compute-to-Data services can either have convenience or fully trustless operation, but not both at once. (extra&nbsp;credit)</p><p>In order to be eligible for a prize, project teams will need to open source their code and properly document their&nbsp;work.</p><p>Learn more about the Data Economy Challenge on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-data-economy-challenge-datatokens-edition-32bab6e7c339">our&nbsp;blog</a>.</p><p>Let’s continue to revolutionize the Data&nbsp;Economy!</p><p>“We’ve long admired the work of Secret and Enigma and we’re thrilled to have Secret as a partner for the Data Economy Challenge. This collaboration gives us the opportunity to add Secret’s world-leading privacy infrastructure to Ocean V3 to offer users more options for secure data sharing,” said Ocean Founder Bruce&nbsp;Pon.</p><p>“Since the original Enigma whitepaper in 2015, we envisioned the existence of secure data marketplaces that would allow users to share data securely and process it privately. Combining the privacy-preserving power of Secret Network with Ocean’s world-leading work on data marketplaces, we are finally seeing this vision become reality,” said Enigma CEO and co-founder Guy Zyskind. “Our team and the entire Secret ecosystem are excited to work in collaboration with the Ocean Protocol team and community.”</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol is an on-ramp for data services into crypto ecosystems, using datatokens. Each datatoken is a fungible ERC20 token to access a given data service. Ocean smart contracts, Ocean libraries, and Ocean-powered front-ends make it easy to publish data services (deploy and mint datatokens) and consume data services (spend datatokens). Therefore Ocean provides decentralized access&nbsp;control.</p><p>Ocean contracts run on Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum composability enables crypto wallets as data wallets, crypto exchanges as data marketplaces, data DAOs as data co-ops, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Ocean Market is like a DEX tuned for data. It’s an open-source community marketplace for data that uses Ocean datatokens. Users can publish data, buy/sell data, consume data, and stake on data (curate). Each datatoken can have automatic price discovery via its own automated market maker (AMM)&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Ocean’s “Compute-to-Data” feature gives compute access on privately held data, which never leaves the data owner’s premises. With it, Ocean Market enables monetization of private data while preserving privacy.</p> About Secret&nbsp;Network <p><a href="https://scrt.network">Secret Network</a> is the first ever privacy-enabled Layer 1 blockchain, featuring privacy-preserving smart contracts (“secret contracts”) that utilize hardware-based and software-based privacy technologies to protect data. Secret contracts are unique in that they allow for encrypted inputs, outputs and state. Data on Secret Network is private by default, public when desired. Secret Network is also open-source and permissionless — anyone can operate a node, deploy an app, or contribute to the network and its ecosystem.</p><p>Applications built on Secret Network (Secret Apps) can utilize encrypted data without ever exposing the data itself, even to the nodes in the network performing computations.

<p>An article written by Neil Evans, Account Director at <a href="https://mylifedigital.co.uk/about-us/">MyLife Digital </a></p>



<p>Connected vehicles and even connected devices such as smart devices have now moved into the mainstream, which brings data processing to the forefront. Essentially, they are generating large amounts of data which has significant value to an organisation and especially third parties. This data relates to a natural person that is identified or identifiable, thus constitutes personal data under GDPR and therefore is a challenge to manage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The Future of Smart Devices 



<p>Whilst this article focuses on connected vehicles, the premise also applies to other connected devices, be it smart speakers such as Alexa, most televisions are now smart TVs, and now home security cameras or camera doorbells such as Ring are also connected to Alexa and a mobile phone. And now, many other smart devices exist, such as a fridge or kettle; however, do people really care, or are they even aware that these devices capture personal data, and that it is potentially being shared to 3rd parties, without a user’s consent or even knowledge of what is happening with this data and for what purposes. Who knows in a few years, your vehicle will know that you are ready to start your journey as you have just put the kettle on, or you inform Alexa to turn off the lights and then to start your car to warm it up. Okay, probably not right now due to COVID, but there will become a time that this might become normal practice for some people. Who would have thought a few years back, that you could speak to a device to turn your house lights on, close the curtains or blinds, or even turn your kettle on, but this is now a reality.&nbsp;</p>



 Benefits of Connected Vehicles 



<p>There have been a few discussions about connected vehicles and the benefits of them (links below), but the same could be said of all connected devices and the benefits to the user themselves. There are obvious benefits for car dealerships, as they could understand if a component of the cars looks to be compromised and contact the owner to get them in for a service or to replace the part and increase revenue quicker. Insurance companies would benefit, as they understand how many miles the car does, whether the driver is a careful or erratic driver, and enable them to set insurance premiums appropriately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What gets me is that there are so many connected devices that still share this personal data with 3rd parties without the true consent of the individual. The only way to really understand this is to read the manufactures T&amp;C’s and who does that when they buy a new TV or Car. It also becomes much harder when you consider cross jurisdictions. Most connected vehicles or companies providing connected devices are focussed on a global market and will be required to manage different consent, depending on where the person is located. But right now, it seems to be a misuse of data, as per the ICO investigation into data brokers. So potentially this could lead to a further investigation by the ICO into manufactures of connected devices, or those that use telematic solutions.&nbsp;</p>



 Consent Capture 



<p>I believe this imposes a huge challenge to capture consent, not only for marketing but also for other purposes. i.e eCall based systems, Vehicle/Device Management, Mobile Apps, etc. This is especially the case when sharing any such data with 3rd parties, be it entertainment offerings and when connecting the device to solutions such as Spotify or even to pass data to Insurance companies.&nbsp; If this data is being used for direct marketing, then the user should have control to manage the processing of such data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a controller, the organisation, be it the manufacturer or the company that uses telematics solutions, must inform the data subject about all the purposes of the processing. So, this is where a Consent and Preference solution from the likes of MyLife Digital can really assist an organisation. It enables an organisation to capture the relevant consent, ensure transparency, and ultimately inform the data subject of the purposes of the processing to which they are being asked to consent. It provides a single platform for both the organisation and the data subject to manage and control consent from the many touchpoints, which includes the connected vehicles. This makes it all so much harder around cross jurisdictions, especially as most connected vehicles or companies involved with connected devices are focussed on a global market and will be required to manage different consent, depending on where the person is located.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at a post from Burges Salmon 1, it indicates again benefits to an organisation but does not even mention consent from the individual.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another interesting post “Research shows data privacy concerns for telematics policies” 2 Telematics is the technology used to monitor a wide range of information relating to a vehicle and sometimes referred to as a Black box by insurance companies, who use the Black Box to monitor driver behaviour. This report goes into good detail about Telematics and the benefits, and it does highlight that Insurance companies are being transparent and obtaining consent, but my personal opinion is that they are only looking at consent for their own purposes, hence not being transparent as the data is sometimes shared with 3rd parties, to whom the individual has not provided consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transparency is crucial, especially as the Supervisory authorities are now focussed on this principle, it simpler to validate and provide enforcement notices or intent to fines to organisation that are not demonstrating transparency. It is essential that connected vehicles and those that use Telematic systems engage in a way that’s totally upfront and honest when seeking to make use of personal data, for an organisations’ own use or when sharing to 3rd parties. Processes must be robust, clear and comprehensive to ensure effective and consistent compliance and build a trusted relationship. Just a gentle reminder, organisations should ensure Privacy policies are relevant, are they clear and specific, and relate to the complexity of what happens with the data and if being repurposed.&nbsp; This Privacy policy must be written in a way that a normal person would understand. If looking to use a telematic device, have you carried out a DPIA?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, understanding the lawful basis in holding of the personal data and making this clear, consistent and obvious is vital, hence Transparency and Consent are finely intertwined.</p>



<p>The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) 3 published guidelines around the processing of personal data in the context of connected vehicles and mobility-related applications.&nbsp; I would be curious to understand how many car manufacturers, car dealerships, Telematic solution providers or organisations using telematic devices, Insurance companies, or those that share 3rd party data from connected vehicles, have actually read it. However, it is worth a read.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just to back up what is implied above, these are a couple of references within the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidelines that I have picked out. Additionally, to the GDPR, the “ePrivacy” directive (2002/58/EC, as revised by 2009/136/EC), sets a specific standard for all actors that wish to store or access information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user in the European Economic Area (EEA). As recently outlined by the EDPB in its Opinion 5/2019 on the interplay between the “ePrivacy” directive and the GDPR,13 art. 5(3) ePrivacy directive provides that, as a rule, prior consent is required for the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user. To the extent that the information stored in the end-user’s device constitutes personal data, art. 5(3) ePrivacy directive shall take precedence over art. 6 GDPR with regards to the activity of storing or gaining access to this information.14 Any processing operations of personal data following the aforementioned processing operations, including processing personal data obtained by accessing information in the terminal equipment, must additionally have a legal basis under Art. 6 GDPR is required in order to be lawful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if concerned by this, then it is worth looking at the MyLife Digital Consent Preferences offering, as it can really help an organisation capture consent, transparently and compliantly and ultimately build trust with customers/prospects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/reinwarth">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>If the line "We are detective" only reminds you of "guilty pleasure" radio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReacTOXGgHE">songs</a> <a></a> from the 1980s, despite the fact that you are responsible for cybersecurity or compliance in your company, then you should read on. In any case, you probably should read on because this is a trend that is becoming increasingly important in times of growing uncertainty and loss of trust – in contracts, in companies in the supply chain, in "the Internet", and in nation-states.</p>
 Trust as the foundation for reliable assurance 
<p>Understanding, assuming, mitigating, and managing risks in our increasingly hybrid IT infrastructures is often based on the level of trust in the respective system/service/company providing required capabilities. So, we may trust companies and their good reputation. Sometimes we trust in contracts and SLAs (Service level agreements). If not, we trust in the threat of penalties for breach of contract. We may also trust third party testimonies (certifications and audits) that provide us with robust assurances that standards and control frameworks are being met. But if this is not sufficient, we appoint an auditor ourselves, and trust in a completed audit tailored to our needs.</p>
<p>The objective in the end is to achieve a level of assurance that is sufficient to adequately fulfill our risk management obligations. This is an actively managed process, performed by a range of players between IT, cloud service providers, auditors, senior management, legal departments, and many more. And it is based on the robustness of evidence and confidence in statements made.</p>
 What to do when trust is not an option? 
<p>But what we have lost this trust in assurances made in whatever form? What if our risk appetite is too low for us to be able to rely on them? And what if it is obvious that national legislation in a considerable number of countries or regions does not warrant a relationship of trust? What do we do when it cannot be ensured for organizations of all kinds that services provided, for example in the cloud, are free from the influence of third parties, especially the state? This encompasses surveillance up to and including espionage or the creation of personal profiles of customers and employees for political or for criminal reasons by a multitude of threat actors, including the service providers.</p>
<p>A classic risk management response to such a risk is "avoid". For many companies, however, this also entails abandoning parts of the business model. When talking to the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) this might be an option, but when talking to the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) "avoid” becomes rather more difficult.</p>
 Just the facts, man 
<p>What to do? Well, simply do not trust if it is not appropriate! An increasingly important trend here is “detective controls”, i.e., monitoring what is happening in the systems. Based on selected runtime information, undesired behavior (especially accesses) can be identified, and countermeasures can be taken. In hybrid environments, this may also require a comprehensive time-based and time-critical correlation of vast amounts of information from otherwise isolated systems, which is certainly not a trivial challenge.</p>
<p>However, the computing power and capacities required do exist today, and modern SOC (Security Operations Center) approaches <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lb80008">like SOAR</a> (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) are on their way to becoming a central enabler.</p>
<p>In the cloud, AWS Cloud Trail or Azure Monitor, for example, serve as sources for a massive volume of real-time performance and log data. This data must be selected, understood, and correlated in a meaningful way.</p>
 Real-time log and activity data is big data 
<p>In separating signal and noise, pattern recognition and machine learning can be used to counteract the loss of confidence by analyzing the actual activities. However, the extraction of the truly important information and a robust analysis increasingly requires experts who have been trained to deal with this.</p>
<p>Your cybersecurity team may need to be complemented by a team of data scientists/data analysts as a counterpart to the security experts. Because it's important to understand what's going on in your cloud environment. It's not just about collecting data; it's about gaining insight into what's really going on. Hybrid, real-time log and activity data is big data, so you need to apply proper processes and technology to it.</p>
<p>This raises a multitude of further questions: Which companies should take this step first? Large companies and/or those with high criticality? Companies with a multi-cloud strategy and/or smaller companies and start-ups without a mature cybersecurity team?</p>
<p>And yes, of course, with job descriptions of such demanding requirements, the problem of the skills gap in IT in general, and cybersecurity in particular, strikes again: How do you obtain this expertise for your own company? Is it really necessary to recruit actual staff for your own company or can this essential know-how be provided by a service provider? And how much domain knowledge do these data scientists need to do their job well?</p>
<p>There is still a lot to discuss. Therefore, we will address these and other questions in this interesting new topic area in a follow-up blog post. But, as a first conclusion: If we can no longer trust, this leads us back to "We are detective".</p>

<p>Automated notifications make our lives easier, safer and more efficient in a range of real-world scenarios. Low fuel warning beeps keep us from being stranded on the side of the road, security system alerts help us protect our homes, and invite notices on our Apple Watches ensure we stay on top of work meetings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Similar communications also occur in the applications world. Apps can notify other apps by sending real-time data whenever a given event happens, such as when PayPal alerts your accounting app that a customer has paid their invoice or when Twitter informs your marketing app that someone has mentioned your company in a tweet. These automated bulletins free you from the manual work of routinely checking whether a particular activity has occurred, thereby boosting your efficiency while making sure important information is fully captured.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The number of apps that send and receive automatic notifications is on the rise, in large part because of a simple yet powerful technology called webhooks. Webhooks are an increasingly popular tool that can save your company significant time and energy—and ultimately result in a better, more streamlined experience for your end users.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  The Basics of Webhooks  <p>In simple terms, webhooks, sometimes called “HTTP callbacks,” are a way for apps to communicate with one another that removes any manual effort out of the equation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now you may be thinking that you already have a tool that does this: polling requests to an API&nbsp; (application programming interface). In the polling requests model, you set some amount of time as an interval and then send HTTP requests to the server/API at every interval to see if there’s any new data. For example, suppose you need to know when a new user has been authenticated by your identity provider (which happens to be Ping!) before you can allow them to perform certain actions in your app. You would set up a polling request that would check authentications periodically, and whenever new users appear, that information would then be passed back to you. Whether a post request or a get request, that’s a lot of HTTP requests.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There are a few drawbacks to this method, however. In this “pull” model, where you’re pulling information out of the other app, the timing of the intervals can be difficult to optimize. Make them too fast and you’re wasting resources; make them too far apart and you’re slow to get updates. It’s like the kid in the backseat asking “Are we there yet?” over and over, where each question is a request to the server to say, “Hey, any update yet?” At some point the answer will be yes, but it’s an inefficient (and annoying) way to operate.</p>

<p>On Monday November 11, BlockCypher Ethereum API experienced a severe service disruption as a consequence of an unplanned hard fork on the Ethereum network. We understand that a lot of platforms and projects rely on BlockCypher APIs. And as such, we acknowledge this long interruption is not acceptable. We would like to apologize to all our customers for this situation.</p><p>In order to move forward, we would like to share the details of this incident: what happened, what we did and what action we are taking in order to have a more resilient platform so that you can build even more confidently with BlockCypher. Note that this post-mortem is only applicable to our Ethereum service, no other services were impacted.</p> Timeline   11/11/20 07:08 UTC: Our Ethereum nodes start to encounter an issue during the block merkle root verification on block 11234873. As such the sync is&nbsp;halted.  11/11/20 07:23 UTC: Our alerting system is triggered. The chain is stuck behind the tip by about 88 blocks. Notifications are sent to our engineers.  11/11/20 12:47 UTC: Cause of the sync error is identified. A merkle root mismatch at block 11234873.  11/11/20 13:58 UTC: We received information that some service providers such as Infura are also down. We realize this is we are not only experiencing a consensus error.  11/11/20 14:30 UTC: Initial attempts to debug our state&nbsp;failed.  11/11/20 14:56 UTC: A newer version of go-ethereum (1.9.19), which we already were working on, is deployed in an emergency. This version contains the fix for the consensus issue.  11/11/20 15:00 UTC: Another issue emerged with the Ethereum chain synchronisation. A “nonce too low” error during the block verification.  11/11/20 17:00 UTC: Several attempts are made in order to fix this issue including getting a newly synced Ethereum&nbsp;state.  11/11/20 17:47 UTC: We’ve identified the issue and deployed a hot fix. The chain is now syncing again. Status page is updated accordingly.  12/11/20 14:00 UTC: We become aware that our constant calls on our contract API are failing. We began syncing from scratch another Ethereum node on the latest version in order to compare the states and check the API&nbsp;calls.  16/11/20 14:00 UTC: We are waiting for the geth node to sync in order to fix the contract API. in the meantime, we realize that some internal transactions are not correctly reported.  16/11/20 22:00 UTC: The root cause of the errors is identified and fixed, we update our infrastructure.  17/11/20 6:49 UTC: Another issue with missing internal transactions is fixed. The hot fix is immediately deployed.  17/11/20 16:30 UTC: The contract issue is identified and fixed. Incident marked as resolved.   What was the root&nbsp;cause? <p>According to <a href="https://gist.github.com/karalabe/e1891c8a99fdc16c4e60d9713c35401f">Péter Szilágyi</a>, team lead at Ethereum:</p><p>Geth v1.9.7 (released 7th November, 2019) broke the EIP-211 implementation, whereby a memory area was shallow-copied, allowing it to be overwritten out of bounds. The bug was reported by John Youngseok Yang on the 15th July, 2020 and was silently fixed and shipped 5 days later in Geth v1.9.17 (20th July, 2020). This fix brought Geth back into consensus with Besu, Nethermind and OpenEthereum (and the Ethereum specification itself); however it broke consensus with earlier Geth releases.</p><p>Since BlockCypher was running go-ethereum v1.9.9 as a dependency, the sync error was triggered and our nodes started to&nbsp;stall.</p> Why was BlockCypher using geth (v1.9.9) when the latest version is (v1.9.24)? <p>As a policy, we do not update systematically to the latest version unless strictly required as it’s generally risky. We only update when the go-ethereum maintainers flag it as required. In this case the risk of forking was completely unannounced so we noticed just with everyone, when it happened.</p><p>We run a heavily patched version of go-ethereum that is tricky to maintain and take us a long time to ensure that everything is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>Luckily, we already had an upgraded version (v1.9.19) almost ready. We patched and re-tested the update as quickly as possible. However, this version had to be rushed out and some features were not fully tested, hence the subsequent issues that we encountered.</p> What were the lessons learnt and how do we prevent this from happening again?   Knowing that consensus issues might arise in older versions of go-ethereum we will track more closely the latest release, while still prioritizing stability over novelty. Along with this we are deploying new environments to test the validity of our Ethereum&nbsp;state.  Improve our incident recovery. As a result of the regression on internal transactions, some webhooks were not delivered. We will develop a procedure to allow the re-generation of internal transactions and webhook delivery.  Review other areas of our infrastructure that are currently not able to be simply replayed on&nbsp;failure.  Investigate additional automated testing on our Ethereum&nbsp;systems.  <p>This issue was the most severe <a href="https://blog.blockcypher.com/ethereum-woes-d9b2af62da67?source=collection_home---5------2-----------------------">since March 2019</a>. While Ethereum is our newest set of APIs, our mission is to guarantee a 99.999% uptime while smoothing out the wrinkles of blockchain development for our customers. In the constantly fast-moving landscape of cryptocurrencies this can often be a challenge.</p><p>We acknowledge that we are the interface between the bleeding edge and the rock-solid infrastructure we strive to offer. In this case, we failed. But based on our performance across all our services and the improvements we have in preparation, we trust you will continue to rely on us to power your applications for the years to&nbsp;come.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.blockcypher.com/blockcypher-ethereum-outage-post-mortem-2020-11-11-e292bf2f97a6">BlockCypher Ethereum Outage Post-Mortem 2020–11–11</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.blockcypher.com">BlockCypher Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As the digital identity space matures, it’s vital to have tools and tactics available to foster insights, growth and innovation. In that regard, today OWI has announced the launch of its <a href="http://oneworldidentity.com/distil">Digital Identity Standards, Technology, and Innovation Lab (DISTIL)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DISTIL is a community of individuals focused on building better user experiences enabled by digital identity. The DISTIL community will convene through a series of initiatives built around collaboration, idea generation, insights, and funding. These groups, classes, and networking opportunities include our new Immersive Experience Lab, Startup Accelerator Program, Working Groups, and Roundtables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“The vision of the new OWI is coming into focus, starting with the launch of DISTIL. This initiative represents years of planning and development,” said Travis Jarae, Chief Executive Officer of OWI, “with the support of our amazing partners, clients, and community, DISTIL will represent the epicenter for identity innovation. We’re excited for others to join as we lead this next chapter for our industry.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the launch of DISTIL, we’re excited to also announce that the first Startup Accelerator Program will meet, starting on April 5, 2021. This 12-week program will connect a hand-selected group of disruptive new startups with OWI Ventures, the early-stage venture capital firm focused on digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The companies selected for this inaugural class will receive funding through OWI Ventures. They also will gain entry to DISTIL’s Immersive Experience Lab, which provides them with access to a community of over 300 digital identity experts. With this, participating founders and entrepreneurs can connect with valued mentors in the space and access proprietary information. The goal for this connectivity? To accelerate the next wave of identity innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we all have such an opportunity ahead of us, this meeting of the minds, experience, and resources will help drive development. We can’t wait to see what comes from such unique collaboration across the sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While applications for the Startup Accelerator Program will open in the coming weeks, it’s important to note that this is only the beginning of the full breadth of what DISTIL will offer the growing community. In the weeks and months to come, we will provide more information on the Immersive Experience Lab, Working Groups, and Roundtables, which will ensure the smartest minds – including both new and seasoned veterans of the space – come together to offer insights and strategies, as the digital identity sector grows and matures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unique findings will surely result from these collaborations, ones that will only improve and empower this dynamic community.&nbsp;</p>

   Results from The New Normal: Living Life Online Volume 2&nbsp; 

<p>We’ve been examining the significant changes in online <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-consumer-survey-new-normal">consumer behavior</a> to ascertain what companies should be doing to help people access the connected world knowing that remote life won’t be going away any time soon. Our<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/112194411/industry-brief/forgerock-consumer-behavior-report-the-new-normal.pdf"> first report</a>, ForgeRock New Normal: Living Life Online, provided a look into how the COVID-19 pandemic has permanently changed the way consumers plan to use apps and services. We followed that up with insights about <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/e-voting-future-busting-myths-and-objections">voter preferences</a> and made an appeal for governments to strongly consider digital voting. And now for the sequel, which takes a closer look at what makes people tick when it comes to digital experiences.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.forgerock.com/thenewnormal">volume 2</a> of our New Normal report: Living Life Online, we discuss how the rapid adoption of digital platforms affects consumer preferences when it comes to online experiences, including how they register and login and what features are most important for retaining their loyalty. Consumers will not tolerate a tedious registration process or ongoing authentication slowing them down. In fact, they believe being locked out of an account is more infuriating than running out of toilet paper or forgetting their mask at home. We also saw that respondents are beginning to value the apps and services that protect their personal data, but they still want to be recognized and offered a personalized experience. In our new online-centered world, organizations must address these priorities that have typically been at odds with each other.</p>

 
 


<p>Here are some key findings from Vol. 2:</p>

  Almost half of consumers (46%) said they wouldn’t register for a new account if it was too difficult to sign up. 
	 Consumers have a short fuse when it comes to poor digital experiences, with 35% cancelling or deleting an app if they have trouble logging in, while 32% said they would switch to a competitive service or app. 
	 Getting locked out of accounts is more frustrating for nearly three-quarters (72%) of consumers than forgetting their mask at home (44%) or not finding toilet paper at the store (51%). 
	 Globally, consumers are turning away from traditional passwords and usernames, preferring <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> options like biometrics or multifactor authentication (MFA) to log in where available (57%). 
	 Consumers said preventing their data from being resold to third parties is a top priority when considering app features (70%). 
 <p>So what does this mean for organizations trying to engage with consumers in this new world? Consumers are demanding smooth, uncomplicated experiences. Organizations across industries have their work cut out for them if they want to keep up with rising consumer expectations for a simple, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/family-affair-personalizing-customer-experience">frictionless digital experience</a>. Identity is the key to making sure that every customer can register, access and transact easily.</p>

<p>A well planned consumer identity strategy can make tailoring the user’s onboarding experience to match the right risk and friction levels easy to accomplish. This gives less risky users a smooth, drama free registration process, while riskier users or bad actors will encounter extra steps to acquire access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A proper identity infrastructure also allows you to streamline the user authentication process, providing a context driven, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> experience. If the system understands context it can determine the best possible way to safely authenticate a user at that moment. This ensures that the user never encounters more friction than is necessary to secure the service they are accessing. With the right identity solution, you can support exceptional login experiences like <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">single sign on</a> <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">(SSO)</a> to your applications and services for your consumers.</p>

<p>Organizations that put <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">consumer identity</a> first will win. Check out our report <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/report/the-new-normal-volume-two">here</a> to learn how to put identity at the center of your digital strategy to ensure you’re making the best first impression for your consumers.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Give everyone one hour each day to work on any initiative they’d like — metric-free — to encourage innovation. Create an unproduced video of a user struggling with a system the team believes to be issue-free and role-play until it's resolved. These small yet impactful experiences can quickly reshape employee behaviors and become an integral part of driving larger-scale initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now more than ever, infrastructure and operations (I&amp;O) leaders face increased pressure to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-leadership-tactics-to-accelerate-digital-business-transformation/">support digital acceleration</a>, which is not an easy feat during a time of crisis. There is a high likelihood that I&amp;O teams are feeling transformation fatigue, so the question becomes: How can I&amp;O leaders develop a prescriptive, manageable and actionable approach to digital transformation that drives tangible results in the short term?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer: Culture hacks. They can be easily woven into an organization’s cultural fabric and serve as an effective way to encourage transformation without exhausting employees.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-culture-hacks-for-digital-transformation/">10 Culture Hacks for Digital Transformation</a></p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 A well-crafted culture hack has these core attributes: 
 
 Actionable. The hack is easily actioned in a tangible way, and is not theoretical or ambiguous in nature. 
 Low effort. The work required to prepare the hack can be completed in fewer than 48 hours. 
 Immediate. The effects of the hack are practically immediate. 
 Visible. The hack has high signaling power to the group that you’re trying to change. 
 Emotional. The hack triggers a visceral reaction. 
 
<p>“Driving cultural change at a smaller, more visceral level is far more likely to produce timely, lasting behavior improvements,” says<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/53483/Katherine-Lord"> Katherine Lord</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “I&amp;O leaders should embrace the art of culture hacking to enhance organizational agility, innovation and customer centricity.”</p>
<p>To support digital transformation efforts, create a vision of the ideal workplace culture that aligns with the broader IT organization and enterprise. Within I&amp;O, culture hacks can drive four main goals for I&amp;O.</p>
 Goal No. 1: Agility 
<p>Agility came to the forefront for some companies that were forced to become more digital when the pandemic hit. To keep up with, or even surpass, competitors, organizations must remain flexible and agile to adapt to a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cios-ask-3-questions-before-updating-strategy-post-pandemic/">post-pandemic </a>world and avoid future shocks.</p>
<p>Long-term agility can be achieved by fostering a culture where failure is embraced as a learning opportunity, rather than a wholly negative outcome. Instead of celebrating wins alone, for instance, leave room for celebrations around at least one failed experiment each quarter to ensure proper improvement for the next time. Improve agility further by holding 15-minute stand-up meetings with teams to replace traditional operational meetings.</p>
 Goal No. 2: Innovation 
<p>Innovation challenges traditional mindsets and stagnation, driving clear value-adds for I&amp;O teams. It’s also increasingly important as businesses become more digital and the “next big thing” is right around the corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider holding a hackathon focused on new infrastructure initiatives or reward people for calling out “that’s how we’ve always done it” thinking. As infrastructure evolves and becomes more distributed, culture hacks enable I&amp;O teams to move past traditional, “territorial” thinking — where I&amp;O teams are structured based on roles.</p>
<p>Instead they’ve embraced innovative ways of fulfilling digital business requirements, where I&amp;O teams solve digital challenges by capitalizing on collective skills and collaborating with one another.</p>
 Goal No. 3: Collaboration 
<p>I&amp;O leaders understand the benefits of cross-functional collaborative work but often face cultural resistance to new ways of working. It doesn’t help that traditional I&amp;O organizational siloed structures are often not conducive to cross-collaboration, something that has been compounded by the shift to remote work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To tackle this, encourage I&amp;O teams to practice the concept of opt-in teams. Rather than dictating all project assignments for your staff, let them choose a few to work on themselves to ensure ongoing engagement and that their interests are met.</p>
<p>Members of the server operations team might be interested in the organization’s new automation tools, just as the network team may have some new ideas for using DevOps to attain tangible results.</p>
 Goal No. 4: Customer centricity&nbsp; 
<p>Categorize each I&amp;O project based on the business benefit it is expected to deliver. One of the core tenets of the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/">2021 CIO Agenda</a> — winning differently — is all about how organizations must go where their customers are, which is increasingly digital.</p>
<p>From a culture hack perspective, this may take the form of placing an empty chair in the conference room (which is likely virtual right now) to ensure that the theoretical voice of the customer is represented, or even role-play a user struggling to navigate a system that I&amp;O believes has no major issues.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/infrastructure-operations-can-enable-digital-change/">How Infrastructure and Operations Can Enable Digital Change</a></p>
<p>“Identifying your preferred end state will support the change journey and goals for your I&amp;O organization,” says Lord. “Keep in mind that there is often a gap between what management perceives to be the culture and what is happening in reality.”</p>

  <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a clear description of the data and allows clients to specify what data they need, Benefits of using GraphQL include: reduced overhead,improved performance, and reduced risk of  potential errors as the API evolves. If the API enhances its functionality, existing clients won’t be affected unless they want to opt in to the new features.</p>

<p>Clients can also obtain many resources with a single request. Typical REST APIs require the client to query multiple resources as more details are required. If, for example, a user needed information about a book, the client would reach out to a <code>book</code> endpoint. If the client then required more information about the author of that book, he/she would need to query the <code>author</code> endpoint. With GraphQL, this can be summarized in one request to the GraphQL server.</p>

<p>Express is one of the most popular Node.js frameworks today. Clean and simple, it offers high performance and rapid development. In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement a GraphQL API into your Express server. You will use the npm packages provided by the GraphQL to create a new endpoint where queries can be sent. Then you will implement those queries in your Express server and return the requested data.</p>

<p>You will also need to ensure that your API is protected by proper authentication. For this task, you will use Okta’s easy and secure Single Sign-on provider to create an authorization server. This server will supply the client with a JWT that can be validated by the Express server to ensure the user has permission to access the API. To validate the token, you will use Okta’s <code>jwt-verifier</code>. This library from Okta makes authenticating the requests to your GraphQL server quick and painless.</p>

 Set up Your Okta Authentication Server 

<p>The first thing you need to do is sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer Account</a> if you don’t already have one. After you’ve completed the sign up, you will need to login and click on Applications. Click Add Application and select Service Machine-To-Machine and then Next. Give your application a meaningful name(I called mine GraphQL), and click Done. On the next page, note your Client ID and Client secret as you will need these in your application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click on API in the header and click on Authorization Servers. Okta will add an authorization for you named default. This is the one you will be using for this tutorial. Click on Default and then select Scopes. Click on Add Scope and name it api.  You can use api for the display name as well and give it a meaningful description.  For now you don’t need to check the User Consent, Default Scope, or Metadata Publish options.  Click Create to finalize the scope.  Click on the Settings tab and note your Issuer URL. You will need this in your application as well.</p>

 Create your Web Application 

<p>Next, open your favorite IDE and create a new folder with the command <code>mkdir</code>. Open this folder and run the command <code>npm init -y</code>.</p>

 Install Your Dependencies 

<p>Now you can begin installing your dependencies.</p>

<p>First, install Express. This is the backbone of your application.</p>

   <code>npm i express@4.17.1
</code>   

<p>Next, you will want to install the packages that will help support your GraphQL infrastructure. You must get both the  core GraphQL package and the Express-Graphql adapter.</p>

   <code>npm i graphql@15.3.0
npm i express-graphql@0.11.0
</code>   

<p>Next, install Okta’s JWT-verifier, which will do the heavy lifting validating the JWTs coming from the client.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@1.0.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will want to install dotenv to have a place to store your secure variables.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

 Build Your Node.js and GraphQL Web Application 

<p>First, add a file called <code>.env</code> to the root of your project. Add the following code to it.</p>

 <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientID}
OKTA_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer}
OKTA_AUDIENCE='api://default'
APP_BASE_PORT=3000
</code> 

<p>Here you are using the client Id and the issuer that you obtained from your authorization server. You are also specifying which port the application will run on.</p>

<p>Add a file to your root called <code>jwtVerifier.js</code>. This file will act as a wrapper around the Okta JWT verifier library. Add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>const OktaJwtVerifier = require('@okta/jwt-verifier')

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
    issuer: process.env.OKTA_ISSUER,
    clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID
})

module.exports = async (request, response, next) =&gt; {

    const { authorization } = request.headers;

    if (!authorization) {
        return response.status(401).send();
    }

    const [authType, token] = authorization.trim().split(' ');

    try {
        const { claims } = await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, process.env.OKTA_AUDIENCE)

        if (!claims) {
            return response.status(401).send();
        }
        if (!claims.scp.includes('api')) {
            return response.status(401).send();
        }

        return next();
    }
    catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return response.status(401).send();
    }    
}
</code>   

<p>The Okta JWT Verifier will produce an exception when the token is invalid, so you will need to catch the error and handle it in a way that is appropriate for your application. You also want to check to ensure the authorization header is present on the request and that a token has been issued. Finally, you want to ensure the claim contains a scope for <code>api</code> that you added earlier in your authorization server.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>server.js</code>. This file will be the meat of your application. Add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>'use strict';

const express = require('express');

const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql')

const jwtVerifier = require('./jwtVerifier')

const start = function (options) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        process.on("unhandledRejection", (reason, p) =&gt; {
            console.log("Unhandled Rejection at: Promise", p, "reason:", reason);
        });

        if (!options.port) {
            reject(new Error("no port specificed"));
        }

        const app = express();

        app.use(function (error, request, response, next) {
            console.log(error);
            reject(new Error("something went wrong" + error));
            response.status(500).send("something went wrong");
        });

        const schema = buildSchema(`

</code>   

<p>This file kicks off your Express server with the <code>start</code> function. To use GraphQL you must bring in the GraphQL module and tell your application to use it. You can specify whatever endpoint you like. Here you have set it to <code>/GraphQL</code>. At the bottom of the file is some sample data. The trick now is to connect the sample data to your <code>GraphQL</code> endpoint.</p>

<p>You do this by building a schema. The schema has definitions for your objects and object types. Here you have an <code>Employees</code> class, which is an array of <code>Employee</code> objects. <code>Employee</code> itself has several primitive fields attached to it. You also must define your query. Here is where you tell the client what functions are available to it via the server. In this case, you have an <code>employees</code> function that will return the full list of employees and an <code>employee</code> function that will return one employee based on a required <code>id</code> parameter. In the <code>root</code> object, you define handlers for these functions. For <code>employees</code>, you are just returning the sample data provided. For <code>employee</code>, you must collect the parameters and find the employee’s data based on the id property of the query.</p>

<p>You are also using the <code>ensureAuthenticated</code> middleware in the <code>GraphQL</code> endpoint. This will call your <code>jwtVerifier</code> and check the token presented in the <code>Authorization</code> header. Clients that don’t provide a valid JWT will be rejected with a <code>401</code> (unauthorized) HTTP code.</p>

<p>Lastly, you need to provide an entry point for your application. Create a new file called <code>index.js</code> and add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>'use strict'

require('dotenv').config();

const server = require('./server')

const port = process.env.APP_BASE_PORT;

server.start({
    port: port
}).then(app =&gt; {
    console.log('Application is now running on port ' + port);
})
</code>   

<p>This file does two notable things. First, it calls dotenv’s <code>config()</code> function. Per the documentation, this should be placed as early in the application as possible. Second, it kicks off the server using the server file you just created.</p>

 Test Your GraphQL API 

<p>You can now start your application using <code>node index.js</code> from the console. To test this, I like to use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US">Advanced Rest Client</a>, but <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> is another popular option.</p>

<p>First, ensure your authorization is working correctly.  Create a new POST request targeting the <code>GraphQL</code> endpoint.  Set your <code>Content-Type</code> to <code>application/graphql</code>.  Add the following code to your body:</p>

   <code>{
    employees
    {
        employees
        {
            id,
            first_name
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Submit the request, and you should receive a <code>401</code> back from the server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To resolve this, you first need to query your authorization server from Okta that you created at the beginning of this tutorial. Set up a new <code>POST</code> request to <code>{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token</code>. You will need to add a <code>Content-Type</code> header with the value <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. You will also need to pass the following parameters in the body: <code>grant_type</code> should be set to <code>client_credentials</code>; <code>scope</code> will be set to <code>api</code> and <code>client_id</code> should be set to <code>{yourClientId}</code> and <code>client_secret</code> to <code>{yourClientSecret}</code>. Once you have these fields complete, you can make a request to the Okta authorization server, which should return a valid JWT to you.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With your JWT, head back to your request for the  <code>GraphQL</code> endpoint and add an authorization header. The value should be <code>Bearer {yourJWTToken}</code>. Post your request again, and you should have the results passed back to you.</p>

<p></p>

 Learn More About GraphQL and Node.js 

<p>You have successfully built your GraphQL API and integrated it into Express on your Node.JS server. You can enhance your API without impacting users already using this version on your GraphQL API by simply adding new fields or functionality to your schema. You have also learned how to secure the API using Okta’s JWT Verification and authorization server.</p>

<p>This November, the State of Identity podcast gave the industry a lot to be thankful for in the way of new insights and unique perspectives. In three new episodes, our lineup of guests sparked candid discourse that shed new light on employee data management, vendor management, privacy law, and the biggest digital threats facing businesses today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Rippling: The New Frontier of Employee Identity Management 
<p>First Aired: November 19, 2020</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every business – from disruptive new startups to enterprise giants – has an expanse of employee data to both manage and to keep secure. We sat down with (virtually, of course) Vanessa Wu, General Counsel at Rippling to discuss how she has found employee data to be the secret source of nearly all your company’s busywork. She goes on to explain why employee data is becoming the new frontier in privacy law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 IDX: Identity Protection for the Digital Age 
<p>First Aired: November 12, 2020</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IDX CEO Tom Kelly joined us to take a deep dive into the current state of the identity industry. He and host Cameron D’Ambrosi sparked fresh dialogue on why privacy is more top-of-mind than ever for consumers, and steered the conversation into actionable advice on what digital threats users should look out for. If you’re not confident on what digital threats you need to keep top of mind, this is the episode you just can’t miss.</p>

<p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-134-doj-challenges-visa-plaid-ssi-is-hot-stuff-f7811bdda7cd">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Why Groups is “the future of the internet”  Big Tech antitrust momentum builds around the&nbsp;world  The Bitcoin party continues  Stuff happens  Photo: Priscilla Du&nbsp;Preez 1. Back in September, we noted the spiritual similarities between Discord’s latest pivot and GlobaliD’s vision for Groups. Now, Protocol is describing that framework as “the future of the internet.” <p>(For reference, <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-125-everyone-v-apple-discords-groups-vision-">The GiD Report #125 — Discord’s Groups&nbsp;vision</a>)</p><p><a href="https://www.protocol.com/discord">Protocol on the Discord pivot</a> (via&nbsp;Jun):</p><blockquote>Fast-forward a few years, and Discord is at the center of the gaming universe. It has more than 100 million monthly active users, in millions of communities for every game and player imaginable. Its largest servers have millions of members. Discord’s slowly building a business around all that popularity, too, and is now undergoing a big pivot: It’s pushing to turn the platform into a communication tool not just for gamers, but for everyone from study groups to sneakerheads to gardening enthusiasts. Five years in, Discord’s just now realizing it may have stumbled into something like the future of the internet. Almost by accident.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>“On one hand, it’s a lot like Slack, blending public channels with easy side-chats and plenty of ways to rope in the right people. It’s also a bit like Reddit, full of ever-evolving conversations that you can either try to keep up with or just jump into when you log in. (In fact, a lot of popular subreddits now have dedicated Discords, for more real-time chat among Redditors.) It uses simple status indicators to show who’s online and what they’re up to. But by putting all those things together, in a way that felt more like hanging out than doing work, Discord found something remarkable.”</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>“As we look back at the last few months,” Citron and Vishnevskiy wrote in a blog post announcing the redesign, “it’s clear that as people spend more and more time online, they want online spaces where they can find real humanity and belonging.”</blockquote><p>We’ve always said here at GlobaliD that your digital identity is merely the permission to act. What’s more important is what you can do with that — interacting and transacting with people, communities, and businesses — all within an ecosystem built on real&nbsp;trust.</p><p>As Greg Kidd&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>In my mind, Discord is all about Groups. This well informs us that we are hunting around in the right space trying to find our own unique combo of identity, communication, and&nbsp;money.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ol3RSIykPc">How Facebook opened Pandora’s box — Tristan Harris | Andrew Yang | Yang&nbsp;Speaks</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-societal-problem-of-only-needing-1-000-true-fans-to-be-successful-online">The Societal Problem of Only Needing 1,000 True Fans to Be Successful Online</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/junhiraga">/jun</a>— <a href="https://www.protocol.com/discord">How Discord (somewhat accidentally) invented the future of the&nbsp;internet</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/instagram-head-adam-mosseri-on-reels-ads-e-commerce-2020-election.html">Instagram’s Adam Mosseri confirms ads are coming to Reels and defends Facebook’s 2020 election&nbsp;response</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">PayPal says all users in US can now buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/blog/we-raised-some-money">We raised some money |&nbsp;mmhmm</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-3eb66608-1976-4097-97a0-f4d532f2a1b5.html">Parler exec defends allowing conspiracy theories, misinformation</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/2020-election-update.html">An update on our work around the 2020 US Elections</a>   2.

On Tuesday, the commission’s top competition enforcer, Margarethe Vestager, announced preliminary findings, accusing Amazon of illegally abusing its position in both France and&nbsp;Germany.</blockquote><blockquote>The charges focus on the way Amazon has used aggregated third-party seller data to make business decisions around its own private label products.</blockquote><blockquote>“Data on the activity of third party sellers should not be used to the benefit of Amazon when it acts as a competitor to these sellers,” Vestager&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>And though China’s government has always maintained a tighter grip on industry, it’s notable that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-regulators-prepare-to-roll-out-new-antimonopoly-rules-11605013205">they’re taking active antitrust measures as&nbsp;well</a>:</p><blockquote>China has released new draft antimonopoly rules for its online platforms, signaling an increased appetite by Beijing authorities to rein in its dominant technology companies.</blockquote><blockquote>China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it would seek feedback on rules covering a host of potential anti-monopolistic practices on the country’s digital platforms, including offering different prices to different consumers for the same&nbsp;product.</blockquote><blockquote>The release of the new draft rules, the timing of which came as a surprise to some in the market, follows on regulators’ abrupt intervention last week to halt the initial public offering of Ant Group&nbsp;Co.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripe-mozilla-others-form-tech-challenger-group-to-sway-european-policy?utm_content=article-5035&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_source=sg&amp;utm_medium=email">Stripe, Mozilla, Others Form Tech ‘Challenger Group’ to Sway European&nbsp;Policy</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/how-ants-suspended-ipo-is-related-to-chinas-digital-yuan">How Ant’s Suspended IPO Is Related to China’s Digital Yuan — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/f9dffa">Briefing: Europe Files Antitrust Charges Against&nbsp;Amazon</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-fcc-pick-fight-senate-c53a6099-7684-4994-9b5b-a83a8d22b180.html">Fight over Trump nominee could shape Biden-era FCC</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/klobuchar-potential-ag-pick-google-breakup-should-be-on-the-table.html">Google breakup should ‘be on the table’ says Sen.

Englander expects the Fed to increase the pace of bond buying, which Powell alluded to at the policy meeting earlier this month. The Fed could also “add targeted measures to encourage credit provision to struggling businesses, limited to loans on good collateral.”  <blockquote>But, but, but: Englander doesn’t see these “measures as substitutes for fiscal policy, but somewhat effective measures are preferable to no measures” for the&nbsp;Fed.</blockquote><p>Because fiscal policy is likely coming soon,&nbsp;too.</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-fatf-travel-rule-threshold-v20-summit">Why FinCEN Wants Details on All Cross-Border Transactions Over $250 — CoinDesk</a>\  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-chairman-jay-clayton-stepping-down-at-end-of-year">SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Stepping Down at End of Year — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/84255/andreesen-horowitz-backed-deel-launches-crypto-payroll-tool">Andreesen Horowitz-backed Deel launches crypto payroll&nbsp;tool</a>   4.

<p>Diagnostic is a series of essays and hosted conversations exploring the challenges of building more inclusive Digital economies. For hosted (virtual) conversations, like the one described below, Caribou Digital convenes a diverse set of experts and thought leaders with unique insights on an issue, and gives them the opportunity to explore a topic together.</p>Photo credit: Emrys Schoemaker<p>The use of digital technologies in identification systems (Digital ID) is increasingly central to the digital transformations reshaping politics, economies and societies, accelerated by the demands of COVID-19. Caribou Digital recognises digital ID as a critical pillar in building inclusive digital economies, so we asked experts and thought leaders from across four continents, diverse national contexts and from government, international development and humanitarian as well as academic and civil society contexts leading work on digital identification to share what key trends they see in their&nbsp;work.</p> Here are five takeaways from the discussion   The state of the art in digital identification are trust frameworks that accommodate diverse technologies, systems and stakeholders:  <p>The experts gathered broadly agreed that there was an increasing turn to trust frameworks in work on digital identification rather than an emphasis on specific systems — a trend that Caribou Digital’s <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/emrys-schoemaker-and-tom-kirk-introduce-caribou-digitals-new-project-to-develop-an-identity-8ec31ba61c9b">National Identity Ecosystem Mapping </a>tool aims to support. Building trust frameworks rather than systems is helpful because in determining principles and rules you can accommodate innovations in system and technology without being limited to what’s currently available.</p><p>Trust frameworks have dependencies that many contexts lack, yet even there, trust frameworks are recognised goals. As some guests noted, trust frameworks rely on the existence of authoritative sources of identification. In states with developed institutions of identity issuance such as reliable birth registration or with developed standards and compliance bodies, such as legal and governance institutions, trust frameworks have a foundation and architecture that can support the development of reliable standards for identity management. Where these institutions are weak or absent, trust frameworks have limited scope. Even in contexts where these institutions may not be as developed there is a trend towards developing trust frameworks, but that they had to work within the realities of their contexts, which often meant supporting the development of centrally located authoritative sources. For example, in the Philippines there are plans for a trust framework, but there are important first steps to be taken to develop foundational identity issuance, such as the <a href="http://rsso12.psa.gov.ph/content/about-philippine-identification-system">national ID scheme&nbsp;PhilSys</a>.</p><p>One key insight from an expert involved in developing an advanced trust framework noted that ‘you have to drive institutions to drive change’ — that the integrity of systems and trustworthiness of programs is driven by institutions, even more so than legal and policy frameworks.</p><p>2. Risks remain even within the most rigorous trust framework:</p><p>Another key insight was that risks remain even within the most rigorous trust framework — for example levels of confidence and clarity on responsibility for proofing. Tiered Know Your Customer (KYC) is one strategy for managing the risk of getting identification wrong — for example, the tiered KYC articulated by bodies and frameworks such as FATF and eIDAS reflects the fact that people may have different ways of proving who they are, so for example people may have greater confidence in someone with a birth certificate or driving license than someone with only letter of employment, and parties have to assess the risk of relying on those identity documents when deciding whether or not to trust (believe) that someone is who they say they are. The level of confidence in the credential is mostly determined by the authority responsible for and processes involved in issuing the credential — state issued documents such as birth certificates or driving licences are generally trusted more than credentials issued by private sector actors such as Facebook or&nbsp;Google.</p><p>There has been a great deal of discussion about the different roles of public and private sector actors in identity proofing, for example, whether Facebook might be a form of ID that could be used to access formal services. One important point which emerged from the expert discussion was that whether this happens is not inevitable. Indeed there was a general agreement that policy decisions are key to determining the form and nature of approaches to identity management.</p><p>3. Achieving inclusion requires addressing both technical and political dimensions:</p><p>The issue of inclusion and exclusion is a perennial issue facing digital identification, particularly for state services intended to achieve whole populations. Our guests emphasised the challenges involved in relying on state issued foundational credentials such as birth certificates in contexts where the issuing institutions may be weak or for populations whose access to them may be limited, such as the displaced and refugees who may have left them&nbsp;behind.</p><p>At a technical level, interoperability is one of the most talked about issues in digital identification, with the potential of linking separate datasets, systems and services offering opportunities for efficiency, accuracy and the inclusion of greater numbers of people in service populations. Siloed systems also limit marginalised populations such as refugees from being able to access mainstream national services — though as we have found, <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/report-launch-identity-at-the-margins-identification-systems-for-refugees-69466244fa62?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">achieving interoperability can best be accomplished through the kind of standards</a> that can be embodied in a trust framework. Experts working on COVID-19 also emphasised how linking different information systems increased social protection beneficiaries — though this <a href="https://socialprotection.org/discover/publications/space-linking-humanitarian-social-protection-information-systems-covid-19">comes with challenges</a> — particularly <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-and-management-information-systems-for-humanitarian-and-social-protection-response-b1b25e5623a2?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">increased risks to privacy and data protection</a>.</p><p>The politics of inclusion are also key, as system design — intentionally or otherwise — that fails to identify and address vulnerable and marginalised populations can lead to exclusion. As one guest said ‘if the government doesn’t want inclusivity out of a system, you won’t get inclusion’. A particular theme of this discussion was the importance of recognising that system architecture can be a key driver of both inclusion and exclusion, and that politics are translated through system design and operation. We recognise this, and our <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/emrys-schoemaker-and-tom-kirk-introduce-caribou-digitals-new-project-to-develop-an-identity-8ec31ba61c9b">national identity ecosystem mapping tool</a> is intended to map the ecosystem and support a political economy analysis to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities.</p><p>4. Trust frameworks are complicated so getting governance right requires an ecosystems approach:</p><p>Governance is a critical issue for identification systems, and particularly so for trust frameworks, given they consist of process rules and standards and must accommodate diverse actors, sectors and systems. Some emphasised the importance of independent authorities to lead on digital identification, to fulfill leadership, regulatory and accountability functions.</p><p>Governance of trust frameworks requires an ecosystem approach, one that goes beyond the focus on a single system — as one expert noted ‘you have to take a jurisdictional approach and instead of focusing on ‘systems’ focus on the jurisdiction as a whole.’ Translating the framework so that it can be understood by all stakeholders within the jurisdiction was also described as important — for example ensuring clarity over roles and responsibilities within the framework, ‘in such a way that the mutual and competing interests are served’. It’s critical to get clarity over governance right early on — as one expert noted, ‘far too often this *fight* is pushed down the track, only for it to rear its head later’. In one context, adopting the right language has been helpful — ‘shifting the policy language to ‘issuers’, ‘holders’ and ‘verifiers’ irrespective of the program or document. We’ve also found it important to be clear about terms — for example differentiating <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-difference-between-digital-identity-identification-and-id-41580bbb7563">identity, identification and digital&nbsp;ID</a>.</p><p>5. Building the future of digital identification means reckoning with an analogue&nbsp;past:</p><p>The discussion covered a range of challenges facing the deployment of digital identification, but one that kept coming up was the challenge of transitioning from old to new&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Dealing with legacy systems was recognised as a critical issue — as in most cases new systems are deployed over old systems. guests flagged critical questions such as asking ‘what existing data sets do Governments hold that can support identity proofing?’ This can identify existing credentials that can serve as proxies for identification — such as driving licenses or passports. Again, comprehensive ecosystem mapping can help identify existing systems, credentials and opportunities — as <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/kenyas-identification-ecosystem-7cbc2ee27?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">this map of Kenya’s identity ecosystem shows</a>.</p><p>This is particularly the case with identification and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, where a number of guests emphasised the importance of moving beyond standalone ID systems and engaging with the challenge of strengthening civil systems. Recognising the challenge of reforming CRVS systems, and the data protection issues involved in vital statistics management, one suggestion was to delink civil registration from vital statistics, as well as to ensure that reforms put individuals at the&nbsp;centre.</p><p>The introduction of new systems and frameworks also highlights the challenge of reforms and the pace of change. One participant noted how changing approaches to finance meant that people still used cheques so people had to find ways to accommodate them into the digital age, for example enabling cheque scanning options on mobile banking applications so the two worlds are co-existing but it’s incredibly expensive to maintain. A key task in planning transitions to digital identity is to clarify time horizons — with one participant asking ‘what can we do now and where do we want to be in 15–20 years&nbsp;time?’</p><p>This brief is an edited account of the full discussion reflecting our takeaways from this rich conversation and does not reflect the views or consensus of participants.</p> Participants   Subhashish Bhadra, Principal, Omidyar Network,&nbsp;India  Tim Bouma, Senior Policy Analyst Identity Management, Canada Treasury Board Secretariat  Kelvin Hui, Digital Health &amp; Social Protection Advisor | Project Manager at&nbsp;GIZ  Jonathan Marskell, Senior Program Officer, Identification for Development Initiative (ID4D), World Bank&nbsp;Group  Niall McCann, Policy Advisor and Project Manager, Legal Identity at United&nbsp;Nations  Nick Oakeshott, Senior Identity Management Officer,&nbsp;UNHCR  Golala Ruhani, Digital Development Policy Specialist, Swedish&nbsp;SIDA  Hannah Rutter, Deputy Director, Digital Identity at UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and&nbsp;Sport  Isaac Rutenberg, Senior Lecturer and Director, Centre for IP and IT Law (CIPIT), Strathmore University, Kenya  Emrys Schoemaker, Research Director, Caribou&nbsp;Digital  Fabro Steibel, Executive Director, ITS Rio, Professor of Innovation  Michiel van der Veen, Director of Innovation &amp; Development, Netherlands National Service for Identity&nbsp;Data  Edgar Whitley, Associate Professor (Reader) at London School of Economics  Kaliya Young, Independent Advisor, Self-Sovereign / Decentralized Identity  Some participants chose to remain anonymous   <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/diagnostic-trends-shaping-the-future-of-digital-identification-181724c40068">Diagnostic: Trends shaping the future of Digital Identification</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>COVID-19 has spurred new enthusiasm for national digital identity schemes to facilitate enhanced government services. This blog post reviews notable initiatives to date this year, and critical challenges facing the implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments have been thrust into the spotlight, as COVID-19 has brought crises to countries worldwide. This tested their ability to quickly disperse aid to individuals and small businesses, provide public services to citizens, and contain the virus’ spread. Against this background, digital identity has emerged as a critical factor for success. However, growing pains still remain, as countries struggle to react to a newly pressing need for a digital identity public service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spotlight on the US</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for a digital identity infrastructure was made particularly evident in the U.S. A national identity system has never gained traction in the U.S., despite&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/04/15/president-obama-releases-national-strategy-trusted-identities-cyberspace">some efforts from the Obama administration</a>. However, government agencies recognize the need for identity verification tools as they face rampant fraud in the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-fraud.html">&nbsp;collection of unemployment benefits</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/where-did-the-money-go-the-government-s-24118/">&nbsp;PPP loans</a>. State agencies, such as<a href="https://gcn.com/articles/2020/10/12/california-idme-unemployment-insurance.aspx">&nbsp;those of California</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://des.az.gov/sites/default/files/media/newsrelease-10-12-2020-DES-Partners-with-ID-me-to-Further-Prevent-Unemployment-Fraud-through-Advanced-Identity-Verification-System.pdf">&nbsp;Arizona</a>, have consequently hired private sector companies to facilitate identity verification services to reduce the backlog and fraud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September, a bipartisan cohort introduced the Improving Digital Identity Act of 2020 to roll out a standards-based approach to digital identity for use in private and public sectors. The bill positions identity fraud as a central motivating factor for improving digital identity infrastructure, citing over $16 billion lost in 2019 from identity fraud. One of the leading bill writers<a href="https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2020/09/bipartisan-house-bill-targets-improving-digital-identity-verification/168456/">, Jim Langevin, notes</a>, “The COVID-19 pandemic and our increased reliance on the internet to accomplish everyday tasks has made it abundantly clear that we should build out our digital identity infrastructure.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stress Test</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments in<a href="https://www.digitalfuturemagazine.com/2020/05/27/colombia-enters-the-age-of-digital-citizens-services-based-on-the-european-eidas-regulation-decree-620-2020/">&nbsp;Colombia</a>&nbsp;to<a href="https://www.digitalfuturemagazine.com/2020/05/27/colombia-enters-the-age-of-digital-citizens-services-based-on-the-european-eidas-regulation-decree-620-2020/">&nbsp;Madagascar</a>&nbsp;have also taken this moment to advance legislation for government digitization and invest in building national digital identity infrastructure. Moreover, the<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/26/world-bank-announces-mission-billion-challenge-winners-spotlighting-digital-id-for-resilient-recovery">&nbsp;World Bank has publicly championed</a>&nbsp;digital identity systems to support digital economies that have taken off due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, while COVID-19 has undoubtedly accelerated the development and implementation of national digital identity schemes globally, governments continue to face many critical challenges. Some governments are confronting critical technical setbacks and issues in private-public sector coordination and the need to ensure that data privacy regimes will protect citizens’ rights and minimize<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/digital-ids-are-more-dangerous-than-you-think/">&nbsp;the threat of widespread surveillance and cybersecurity breaches</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other countries have seen their digital identity systems stress-tested. For instance, Gov.UK Verify, U.K.’s digital identity service for government services, saw their users more than double as people attempted to claim Universal Credit for financial support. Additionally, account creations<a href="https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/articles/Scaling+up+GOV.UK+Verify+to+help+during+coronavirus+12052020091000?open">&nbsp;increased from 35,000</a>&nbsp;in a week pre-COVID-19 to a weekly average of over 80,000 account creations between mid-March to mid-May. Identity providers for Gov.UK Verify initially struggled to meet demand at scale, with queues peaking at 155,000 people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second Chances for Infrastructure&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>U.K. citizens’ need for digital infrastructure extended the lifetime of Gov.UK Verify, which had<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201903/gov-uk-digital-id-service-has-fraction-of-intended-users-and-verifies-less-than-half-successfully">&nbsp;previously faced criticism for low uptake</a>. In April 2020, funding for the service was extended for another 18 months due to renewed interest. Moreover, the U.K. government has introduced a plan for an overhaul of the digital infrastructure, including Document Checking Service, a private-public collaboration for passport authentication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia has similarly faced implementation challenges for its government identity service, myGovID, which will serve as the primary identity credential for government services and the government’s identity verification service. Initially planned for launch by May 2020, the service was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/mygov-digital-id-integration-in-limbo-as-dta-misses-target-rollout-date-550403">delayed</a>&nbsp;due to system integration errors, unsatisfactory user experience, and a lack of vendors for their “liveness detection” feature. myGovID is now planned for launch by the end of the year, while an old solution<a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/services-australia-repurposed-a-years-old-id-solution-to-meet-covid-demand-555519">, Connected ID</a>, has been revived to temporarily fill in the pandemic-caused demand surge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the U.S., U.K., and Australia, further new legislation has been highlighted as a key enabler for the continued development of digital identity. All three countries have specifically expressed interest in creating legislation governing private-public involvement. Privacy advocates will also push for clear data privacy regulation to prevent the potential insidious effects of centralized databases containing highly sensitive personal identity attributes, running from Big Brother-style surveillance to attractive honeypots for cyberhackers. The U.K. has<a href="https://tech.newstatesman.com/business/verify-2-0-industry-experts-cautiously-welcome-uk-efforts-to-overhaul-digital-identity-services">&nbsp;faced criticism</a>&nbsp;in this regard, while Australia has<a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/digital-identity-legislation-up-for-consultation-557911">&nbsp;incorporated data privacy legislation</a>&nbsp;for their Trusted Digital Identity Framework, which is currently up for consultation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments’ Growing Appetite for Identity&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this end, we expect that as government appetite for digital identity infrastructure continues to increase because of COVID-19, so too will the conversation around data privacy grow. Contact tracing serves as a clear case study, as data collected on citizens for COVID-19 can potentially blur with that leveraged for national identity databases. For example, India’s Aadhaar has been used to<a href="https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/can-big-data-fight-pandemic">&nbsp;facilitate the distribution of welfare more than it has been used for contact tracing</a>. Still, privacy concerns have stemmed from the government’s data processing practices for the mobile tracking programs that it does run for contract tracing because these practices<a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/money/why-data-privacy-must-be-safeguarded-even-in-times-of-covid-19/1963579/">&nbsp;run counter to Aadhaar privacy guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>China serves as a more concrete example. An intensive COVID-19 health codes system for contact tracing has continued to further pre-existing surveillance concerns. Because of the health codes’ high coverage of China’s population – all residents are required to have a health codes app ­– there is speculation that the government will leverage the existing health codes data<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-coronavirus-health-code-qr">&nbsp;to supplement their social credit system</a>. To this end, notable cities like<a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005703/citys-plan-for-permanent-health-codes-sparks-online-backlash">&nbsp;Hangzhou</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3100270/shanghai-adds-personal-id-its-covid-19-health-codes-joining-new">&nbsp;Shanghai</a>&nbsp;expand the potential use cases of the health codes and track more personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, contact tracing has the potential to allow governments to collect personal identity data without adhering to the same level of scrutiny over privacy that might have existed during non-crisis times. The concern is that the temporary solutions that were implemented without proper data safeguards may become permanent, creating national digital identity systems that are more invasive for citizens than helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The OWI Take</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2020 has seen strong traction in both interest and the development of digital identity programs thanks (in large part) to COVID-19. Still, there is no newly discovered silver bullet for the development of digital identity systems. In fact, while stakeholder interest — a common hurdle before 2020 — may have increased, other challenges still persist, as public-private sector coordination, technical infrastructure implementation, and privacy concerns have plagued many governments worldwide this year. Considering these challenges, we see tremendous opportunity for private sector initiatives to support governments as they continue to implement digital identity systems in what will hopefully be an efficient, transparent, privacy-preserving, and user-centric manner.</p>

  <p>Facial recognition technology is used daily by many to access their mobile phones, but acceptance of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/is-your-product-development-ready-for-zero-touch-user-interfaces/">facial recognition</a> doesn’t always extend beyond personal use. Many jurisdictions have put this technology “on hold,” as it raises complex ethical dilemmas.</p>
<p>“There is a strong negative sentiment against the use of face recognition technology. It is being seen as an invasion of privacy and a step toward mass surveillance,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/17247">Frank Buytendijk</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is more important, safety or privacy in the streets and in public buildings? The appropriate use of facial recognition technology depends on the prevailing culture, ethics, legislation and practices.</p>

<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>Currently, there are no widely used or accepted regulations governing facial recognition, which means data and analytics leaders need to turn to digital ethics to use facial recognition technology responsibly.&nbsp;</p>
 Battle issues of bias and false positives by making facial recognition more reliable 
<p>Facial recognition is far from perfect. Training bias means that facial recognition technology isn’t always equally accurate for all types of faces. For example, some facial recognition technologies may not be able to identify the race or gender of individuals correctly. This inaccuracy leads to people being misidentified.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is very easy for facial recognition to misinterpret nuanced facial expressions. For example, an expression that conveys a polite greeting in one culture may indicate confirmation or agreement in another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the reliability of facial recognition technology before deciding to make it operational. Take the time to develop sufficient countermeasures or verification procedures to battle the issues of bias and false positives.</p>

 Establish proportional use of facial recognition by evaluating less invasive technologies 
<p>Proportionality is a very important ethical concept. In a technological context, it means that an organization should use technology powerful enough to solve a particular problem, but not much more powerful. It’s important to understand why an activity is being undertaken and question the accompanying technological deployment and subsequent data creation and usage.</p>
<p>Consider whether the end goal can be achieved with a less invasive technology. “Finding the appropriate use and focusing on gathering only necessary data is key to striking the right balance,” says Buytendijk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, for a retail outlet, having security camera surveillance that can prevent instances of shoplifting seems useful, but definitely an invasion of privacy. In this scenario, a standard video-recording security camera is sufficient.&nbsp;</p>
 Restrict use of facial recognition data by establishing purpose boundaries 
<p>Data should preferably be processed for specific, deliberate, predefined purposes. Ethical issues often arise when data use crosses the originally stated purpose boundaries, also known as the “lineage of intent.”</p>
<p>For instance, facial recognition results used outside a parking lot to open the barriers and facilitate quick entry and exit of vehicles could also be used by car dealers as business leads. But that would be problematic because users did not agree to share the facial recognition data to facilitate business for car retailers.</p>
<p>For any data collected via facial recognition technology, it’s critical that data and analytics leaders explicitly determine and document its lineage of intent and restrict its use to only that predefined purpose.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-ethical-data-collection-during-pandemics/">3 Actions for Ethical Data Collection During Pandemics</a></p>
 Respond to jurisdictional differences by expanding the rights of people identified in images 
<p>The ownership of facial recognition data is a point of contention in many jurisdictions, as it is often perceived as an invasion of privacy by governments. Data and analytics leaders need to ask these important questions: “Who owns the image of your face?” “Who owns the image of the expressions you make in public?” “Are emotions conveyed correctly in the public domain?” “Does the party that creates, measures and holds the data own that data?”</p>
<p>On the one hand, facial expressions that are made in a public place are potentially available for everyone present to see, so they’re not completely private. On the other hand, facial expressions are often made subconsciously, and they are transient. They are simply not meant to be systematically captured, stored and analyzed.</p>
<p>Data and analytics leaders need to work with their legal teams to understand the intellectual property rights relevant to facial recognition images and analysis. Treat facial recognition data not from the perspective of the organization’s rights, but rather from the perspective of the rights of the people portrayed.&nbsp;</p>

   Start Planning Now to Ensure Your Customers Aren't Robbed by Resellers 

<p>We’ve all heard about the damage malicious botnets, or bots, can cause. When a bot is used for evil, it can overwhelm an entire website and stop business. We’ve recently seen an upsurge of less obviously destructive bots that have a singular purpose: to buy up your stock of the latest must-have items before your customers do and sell them back to your own customers at a markup. These bots can impact your sales and the great customer experience you’ve worked so hard to create. And, with the holiday season just around the corner, retail bots wreaking havoc on the availability of popular items couldn’t come at a worse time.&nbsp;</p>

 How Retail Bots Work 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/retail">Retail</a> bots automatically monitor stock levels of leading retailers for popular items. As soon as these items are in stock, the bots immediately buy as many of them as they can while masquerading as consumers who are making purchases on your website. The bots add the item to their shopping carts, enter shipping information, and complete payment – all in a blink of an eye. Then they repeat the process over and over again until the targeted items sell out. If you do a little online legwork, you’ll find the items popping up on online auction sites a few hours later being scalped for double or triple your original retail price.&nbsp;</p>

 The Customer Experience Suffers – and so do Retailers 

<p>This is a frustrating experience for consumers left empty-handed when online retail shelves are wiped out. Customers don’t forget it. And on top of disappointing your customers, scalpers often end up returning their ill-gotten gains to your website when they aren’t sold, costing you even more time and money in lost sales.</p>

<p>This is not good for your customers, and it’s not good for you. As we approach the 2020 holiday shopping season – &nbsp;a peak retail period – &nbsp;we expect to see much more of this activity. But there are steps you can take to prevent bots from spoiling the season.</p>

 Who is the Real Customer? Identity is at the Core. 

<p>Essentially, we are dealing with an<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity"> identity</a> problem: How do we know we are dealing with a real customer and not a bot? To answer this question, we need to examine a range of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">environmental, contextual, and behavioral factors</a> and use these to make decisions in real time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> gives you the power to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/api-security-awareness-and-moderation-are-key">unmask the bots</a>. Using a wide range of data sources, our platform can <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">make decisions in real time and adapt the login or guest checkout journeys</a> to make them more challenging when we suspect a bot is present and hassle-free for legitimate customers.</p>

<p>Don’t let retail bots ruin the holidays for you or your valued customers. Read our white paper <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/block-the-bots-to-keep-your-customers-coming-back">Block the Bots to Keep Your Customers Coming Back</a>, which looks at how a retail bot works and how you can leverage the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> to defend against bots today and as they evolve in the future.</p>

<p>The UK’s 100% dedicated agricultural bank selects HYPR to improve customer experience and enhance security for farmers and savers. This is the first deployment of HYPR by a UK bank.</p>
      
<p>Chester, UK, 16 November 2020 – Oxbury Bank, the&nbsp;dedicated agricultural bank, has selected HYPR, The Passwordless Company to provide a secure platform that will enable Oxbury customers to swiftly and securely access their accounts without a password, therefore removing the risk of sharing personal credentials.&nbsp;<br><br>As part of the deployment, Oxbury will integrate HYPR’s Passwordless Customer Authentication solution across its iOS and Android mobile applications, eliminating the need for passwords. This will allow Oxbury to streamline its login procedures without compromising security or adding authentication complexity. On login, customers will access Oxbury’s proprietary ‘OxP’ banking platform – a unique digital account that will transform the banking experience for UK farmers. The Bank’s farming and savings customers will experience simplified account management and digital onboarding, allowing Oxbury to focus on the provision of innovative and specialist banking products to support the growing needs of their customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Oxbury’s farmers and savers will join a range of enterprise customers and more than 50 million global users implementing HYPR’s True Passwordless security, a solution that replaces passwords with secure public-key encryption and smartphone biometrics to enable fully passwordless multi-factor authentication (MFA).&nbsp; By eliminating passwords, Oxbury will enable its customers to log into a range of digital services including its range of competitive savings accounts and farmer-focused Oxbury Farm Credit and Oxbury Farm Loans – up to three times faster than with legacy MFA.&nbsp;<br><br>“Now, more than ever – customers are choosing online and mobile banking over brick-and-mortar services, and with new technologies driving this change in interaction, it’s imperative that we provide seamless and secure access,” said Tim Coates, Co-Founder and Chief Customer &amp; Regulatory Officer at Oxbury. “By removing the headaches of administration and password management, we are modernising banking, without compromising security. We are giving our customers the time back to concentrate on running their busy lives and growing their businesses.”<br><br>“Organisations want scalability without fear of threat, simplicity without compromise and innovation without complexity, and the agriculture sector is no exception,” said Bojan Simic, HYPR’s Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer. “Oxbury Bank is setting the pace for other challenger banks, those that are adopting technologies that challenge legacy, password-based multi-factor authentication methods. By embarking on this journey together, we are accelerating the elimination of passwords.”</p>
      
<p>About Oxbury<br>Oxbury is the UK’s specialist agricultural bank, the only bank with a singular focus on British farmers, food producers and the rural economy. It is headquartered in Chester and operates across the UK.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oxbury gained its full UK bank licence in early 2020 and is in its final mobilisation stages with invitation-only customers before launching fully to the wider market in Winter 2020.<br>&nbsp;<br>The bank is a collaboration of experienced bankers, farmers, technology experts and agricultural entrepreneurs, with backing from the UK’s largest agribusiness firms and leading farmers. Oxbury Bank Plc is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority (Financial Services Register number: 834822).&nbsp;</p>

<p>BNP Paribas CIB, CA CIB, Caisse des Dépôts, Tokeny Solutions and The Blockchain XDEV today announced the launch of a project by combining their expertise to explore the potential use and implications of a creation of an interbank digital currency for use on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platforms.</p>
<p>The project will explore how financial transactions involving digital assets can be settled on platforms initially using Ethereum and Tezos technologies. Participants will consider particularly the implications of ‘atomic’ delivery-versus-payment settlement of tokens or regulated securities exchanged on a blockchain – where security tokens and the cash tokens exist on the same ledger.</p>
<p>The stakeholders will consider the operational impacts of this technology including the implementation of several experimentations to validate the technological interoperability of such a tool in a multi-technology context, both on public or private blockchains and the regulatory impacts on a daily situation of multi-currency and multi-actor transactions in financial markets.</p>
<p>Participants in this project are committed to comply with the applicable regulations and contribute to the on-going EU exploratory work in the area of digitalization of financial asset.</p>
<p>Moreover, the aim of the partners is to federate around this project the largest possible number of French, European and international players wishing to participate in the construction of an infrastructure and its components.</p>
<p>The project will be completed in 2021.</p>
 
 
 
 
 ABOUT TOKENY SOLUTIONS 
<p>Tokeny Solutions allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny Solutions enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments.</p>
<p>Tokeny Solutions is the leader in its field and in 2019 they were included in KPMG’s top 100 FinTechs globally, awarded Luxembourg’s FinTech of the year and raised €5mn in funding from the leading pan-european exchange, Euronext.</p>

 Das CIAM von Ubisecure ermöglicht jetzt mithilfe der Verimi-Dienste zum Registrieren, Anmelden und Nutzen digitaler Signaturen die schnelle Akzeptanz digitaler Identitäten für Verbraucher in Deutschland und ganz Europa. 
<p>BERLIN UND MÜNCHEN – 16 November 2020 – Verimi, der führende Identitätsanbieter in Deutschland, und Ubisecure, ein Experte für CIAM-Lösungen (Customer Identity and Access Management) mit Niederlassungen in ganz Europa, haben heute eine strategische Partnerschaft angekündigt.</p>
<p>(Read this press release in English <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/verimi-partnership/">here</a>)</p>
<p>Mit Verimi lassen sich die im Rahmen der Customer IAM- (CIAM) und IDaas-Lösungen (Identity as a Service) angebotenen Authentifizierungsmethoden einfach um digitale Identitäten erweitern. Ubisecure und Verimi kombinieren hierzu ihre Identitätsmanagementfähigkeiten in einer gemeinsamen Lösung, die Unternehmenskunden ein nahtloses Identitätsmanagement für ihre externen Nutzer (wie Kunden, Geschäftspartner, Bürger) bietet. Dreh- und Angelpunkt ist hierbei das datenschutzzentrierte Design nach dem “Privacy by Design-Prinzip”.</p>
<p>Die digitale Identitätslösung von Verimi bietet Verbrauchern eine validierbare, flexible und bequeme Möglichkeit, Ihre Kontakte mit Unternehmen und Behörden abzuwickeln. Bei Verimi hat der Nutzer die alleinige Datenhoheit und entscheidet, welche Daten an den jeweiligen Anwendungspartner weitergegeben werden. Alle Benutzerdaten werden verifiziert, so dass sich die Anwendungspartner sicher sein können, mit wem sie es zu tun haben, während die Benutzer von der einfachen Anmeldung bei verschiedenen Diensten profitieren.</p>
<p>Das CIAM von Ubisecure ermöglicht die schnelle Integration von Identitäts- und Zugriffsmanagementfunktionen wie Single Sign-On (SSO) und Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung (MFA), sowie den Zugang zu einer Vielzahl von vertrauenswürdigen Identitätsanbietern (IdPs) und vielschichtige Möglichkeiten zum Delegieren von Autoritäten. Es ermöglicht Arbeitsabläufe, mit denen sich eine bessere Datensicherheit, optimierte Kundenerfahrung und genauere Einhaltung einschlägiger Vorschriften realisieren lassen. Die CIAM-Lösung kann je nach Kundenbedürfnissen und -präferenzen als IDaaS-, Cloud- oder lokal installierte Software bereitgestellt werden.</p>
<p>Dienstleister in Deutschland intensivieren ihre Digitalisierungsbemühungen, insbesondere vor dem Hintergrund der aktuellen globalen Situation mit ihren vielen Einschränkungen des persönlichen Kontakts. Diese gemeinsame Lösung bietet den Kundenorganisationen von Ubisecure und Verimi branchenübergreifend die Möglichkeit, ihre Lösungen mit einem nahtlosen Identitätsmanagement zu digitalisieren, von der Registrierung bis zur anschließenden Anmeldung, und dies durchgängig über den gesamten Lebenszyklus der Identität. Beispielsweise könnte eine Bank die Lösung so einsetzen, dass ihre Kunden sich mit ihrer Verimi-ID nahtlos in alle ihre digitalen Dienste einloggen und diese Identitäten dann mit den von Ubisecure bereitgestellten Workflows sicher und gesetzeskonform verwalten können. Verimi wird von Dienstleistern wie Allianz, Deutsche Bank, Postbank, Deutsche Telekom und vielen anderen akzeptiert.</p>
<p>Roland Adrian, Geschäftsführer von Verimi sagt dazu: “Wir sind hoch erfreut, dass wir mit Ubisecure einen führenden CIAM-Anbieter in Europa als Partner gewinnen konnten. Ubisecure hat Zugang zum relevanten Markt und kennt dank seiner langjährigen Erfahrung genau die Bedürfnisse von Verbrauchern und Unternehmen.”</p>
<p>Volker Zinser, Regionsleiter DACH bei Ubisecure, kommentiert dies wie folgt: “Es ist fantastisch, die Verimi-Plattform als Authentifizierungslösung für unsere Kunden in Deutschland und anderen Ländern anbieten zu können. Sie sind führend in ihrem Bereich und haben einen ausgezeichneten Ruf für gesetzeskonforme, sichere und nutzerzentrierte Lösungen – die gleichen Eigenschaften, auf die Ubisecure bei seinen Produkten stolz ist. Die Verwendung des OpenID Connect-Standards hat die Integration unserer Technologien ermöglicht und gezeigt, dass sich Investitionen in offene Standards und Interoperabilität wirklich auszahlen.”</p>

 Ubisecure CIAM now enables rapid acceptance of digital identities with Verimi Services for registration, login &amp; digital signatures for consumers in Germany and across Europe. 
<p>BERLIN AND MUNICH, GERMANY – 16 November 2020 – Today Verimi, the leading identity provider in Germany, and Ubisecure, a customer identity and access management (CIAM) solutions expert with offices across Europe, announced a strategic partnership.</p>
<p>(Read this press release in German <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/deutsch-blog/verimi-partnerschaft/">here</a>)</p>
<p>With Verimi, digital identities can be added easily to authentication methods offered through Ubisecure’s Customer IAM (CIAM) and IDaas (Identity as a Service) solutions. Ubisecure and Verimi combine their identity management capabilities to provide a joint solution that provides customer companies with seamless identity management for their external users (such as customers, partners, citizens), with “Privacy by Design” at the core.</p>
<p>Verimi’s digital identity solution offers consumers a valid, flexible and convenient way to engage with companies and institutions. With Verimi, the user has sole data sovereignty and decides which data is passed on to the respective application partner. All user data is verified, so application partners can be sure of who they’re dealing with, while users benefit from its ease of signing up/logging into multiple services.</p>
<p>Ubisecure CIAM enables fast integration of Identity &amp; Access Management capabilities such as single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), a wide range of trusted identity providers (IdPs), and complex delegation of authority. It facilitates workflows to increase security, improve customer experience and comply with regulations. The CIAM solution can be deployed as IDaaS, Cloud, or on-premise software, depending on client needs and preferences.</p>
<p>Service providers in Germany are ramping up digitalisation efforts, particularly in light of the current global situation limiting face-to-face contact. This joint solution provides a way for Ubisecure and Verimi’s client organisations across all verticals to digitalise their solutions with seamless identity management, from registration to subsequent logins and across the entire identity lifecycle. For example, a bank could deploy the solution to allow its customers to seamlessly log into all of its digital services with their Verimi-ID, and then securely and compliantly manage those identities ongoingly with Ubisecure-enabled workflows. Verimi is accepted by service providers including Allianz, Deutsche Bank, Postbank, Deutsche Telekom and many others.</p>
<p>Roland Adrian, Managing Director at Verimi, said, “we’re very excited to partner with Ubisecure as a leading provider of CIAM in Europe. Ubisecure has access to the relevant market and with many years of experience deeply understands the needs of consumers and companies.”</p>

<p>*SATIRE WARNING*</p>
      
<p>2020 is the year for leaning into cynicism and self-reflection, so during its final weeks it’s helpful to revisit one of the Digital Era’s most burning questions. </p>
      
<p>That is – is the Internet worth participating in any longer, on any level, ever again? </p>
      
<p>Is it time to unplug?&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Emphatically, we say “No” —&nbsp;er, and “Yes” (to that second question).</p>
      
<p>A wise person once said always be thoughtful when making difficult choices (really, this one isn’t). So we surveyed a group of unnamed experts and, unsurprisingly, they concurred. Also part of the contract, they presented us with no fewer than five compelling reasons to just leave the Internet and never return, ever. These range from the frightening, to the nihilistic, to the paranoid and we’re delighted to share them:</p>
      
<p>1. Everything can be hacked. <a href="http://www.therepublic.com/2019/11/05/everything_can_be_hacked_cybersecurity_experts_explain_the_dangers_of_internet_connections/">Probably</a>. <br>I haven’t opened an email attachment in 6 months and I refuse to <a>click</a> <a>on</a> <a>any</a> <a>link</a>. Why bother? You think that just because you used an incognito browser at work that time you booked a secret trip to both weekends of Coachella, that you’re secure? Well we’ve got news for you: Coachella was canceled this year and might be next year, too.</p>
      
<p>2. The Internet is too cluttered and noisy anyway. <br>Remember the 90s Internet? AOL, Netscape, Newgrounds, Slingo. The sweet melody of dial-up Internet screeching at you. You couldn’t tell if the news was real or an advertisement —&nbsp;you were just happy the webpage actually loaded. Today’s modern, convenient Internet is too cluttered, too fast, and too reliable. There’s no sense of accomplishment for getting a webpage to load, and when it does – there’s too much information on it to make sense of anything.</p>
      
<p>3. Your Router might have a backdoor.<br>I’m not saying <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cisco-backdoor-hardcoded-accounts-software,37480.html">it does</a> or it doesn’t. But if it did would you even want to know? There was a time when all US cell phone manufacturers were nearly compelled to install a backdoor into every device via a <a href="https://www.hypr.com/clipper-chip/">special chipset</a>. Luckily the world has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies">moved on</a> from the Clipper Chip. Well I for one am not giving into the paranoia. There’s only one way to know for sure if your router is a friend or a foe. Unplug it.</p>
      
<p>4. Outside has nice graphics. <br>Content creators and streaming giants can promise 4k or 8k content. But do you really have the bandwidth for it? And are you aware that outside is constantly streaming in Ultra Ultra Ultra High-Def? If you want real high-end visuals you need to step away from the Internet and try visiting outside dot com. Going outside became a luxury in 2020. And it has great health benefits. Fresh air and whatnot. Outside is the New Internet.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>5. It’s Cord Cutting 2.0 <br>Did you swap your cable box for a streaming platform like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/pandemic-accelerated-cord-cutting-making-2020-the-worst-ever-year-for-pay-tv/">millions of other cord cutters</a>? So have I. Moving beyond cable TV is one of the biggest trends. The next big thing? Cutting the internet cord. </p>
      
<p>There you have it. The decision to pack up all of your things and leave the Internet is obvious. The reasons in support are airtight, and unassailable —&nbsp;and we listed five of them. This could be the start of a new movement. </p>
      
<p>GG, Internet.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Python has a number of different frameworks for building web applications. The choice of framework limits the choice of available web servers. Java also has a number of web frameworks but they are all based on the common servlet API which means that any framework can run on any web server which supports the servlet API.</p>

<p>You’ve probably seen WSGI mentioned before, but you might not be exactly sure what it meant or did. In this post, you will learn to write your own WSGI application and a basic WSGI server, too! Let’s get started!</p>

<p>(The dry technical details of WSGI are defined in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">PEP 333</a> and extended with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP 3333</a> to improve string handling in Python 3.)</p>

<p>PS: The code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Dr-Phill-Edwards/wsgi">GitHub</a> if you’d like to check it out</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a WSGI Application 

<p>First things first, if you don’t already have Python installed on your computer, you will need to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install a recent version of Python 3</a>.</p>

<p>Next, you need to install the <a href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">Tornado library</a> (which will be used to run the WSGI application):</p>

   <code>pip install tornado
</code>   

<p>Finally, create a project directory where all of our future code will live:</p>

   <code>mkdir ~/wsgi
cd ~/wsgi
</code>   

 How to Build a Simple WSGI Application 

<p>We will start by creating the simplest WSGI application running in a Tornado server. Create a file called <code>simple.py</code> containing the following Python code:</p>

   <code>from tornado.httpserver import HTTPServer
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
from tornado.wsgi import WSGIContainer

def application(environ, start_response):
    status = '200 OK'
    response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')]
    start_response(status, response_headers)
    return [b"Welcome to WSGI!\n"]

container = WSGIContainer(application)
server = HTTPServer(container)
server.listen(8080)
print("Listening")
IOLoop.current().start()
</code>   

<p>Let’s explain what this code does. It is necessary to import any external packages so that Python can find the code. We could have simply used <code>import tornado.ioloop</code> but then later would have had to use <code>tornado.web.IOLoop</code> in the code. Using the <code>from</code> form of <code>import</code> means that we can just use <code>IOLoop</code>.</p>

<p>The function <code>application</code> implements WSGI.  PEP 3333 refers to it as the application object. It has two parameters that are required by the WSGI server interface. These parameters are passed by the WGSI server implementation—in this case, the <code>WSGIContainer</code>.</p>

<p>The first parameter <code>environ</code> is a dictionary that contains environment variables that must be present. They must include environment variables defined by the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specification. It may contain environment variables from the operating system. It must also contain WSGI-defined variables.  These environment variables are listed in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/#environ-variables">PEP 3333</a> document.</p>

<p>The second parameter <code>start_response</code> is a function that must be called by the <code>application</code> function on each request. <code>start_response</code> takes two parameters, the response status code and a list of response headers. Each list element represents a header and is a tuple containing the header name and the header value. In the example above, the list contains one element that represents the <code>Content-Type</code> header: <code>[('Content-type', 'text/plain')]</code></p>

<p>The application object needs to define the HTTP response. It defines the status code which is a string containing a three-digit number and a message. It also needs to define any response headers in the form of a list of tuples. It then calls the <code>start_response</code> function passing it the status and headers. It then returns the response body. It must be of the Python type <code>bytes</code>, hence the <code>b</code> in front of the string.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to create a server—a Tornado <code>WSGIContainer</code> object which takes the WSGI function as a parameter. We then construct the <code>HTTPServer</code> object passing it to the WSGI container. We then need to tell the application which port to listen on, in this case, port 8080. The last line starts an <code>IOLoop</code> which will start listening on port 8080 and pass requests to the handler class instances.</p>

<p>The server can now be run using:</p>

   <code>python simple.py
</code>   

<p>The server can be tested by pointing a web browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> or using the <code>curl</code> command. The welcome message should be displayed.</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>The server can be stopped by typing Control-C.  Python will complain about being interrupted but this can be ignored.</p>

 How to Create a Python Package Containing a WSGI Application 

<p>A Python package is simply a directory containing Python files. We are going to create a package called <code>server</code> which needs to be in a directory of the same name.</p>

   <code>mkdir server
</code>   

<p>The Python package plumbing requires a file called <code>__init__.py</code> which is executed whenever the package is imported. It can be an empty file.</p>

   <code>touch server/__init__.py
</code>   

<p>A WSGI application can also be implemented as a class. Create the file <code>server/Application.py</code> containing the following Python code:</p>

   <code>class Application:
    def __init__(self, environ, start_response):
        self.environ = environ
        self.start = start_response

    def __iter__(self):
        status = "200 OK"
        headers = [("Content-type", "text/plain")]
        self.start(status, headers)
        for chunk in [b"Welcome" b" " b"to" b" " b"WSGI!\n"]:
            yield chunk
</code>   

<p>Like the <code>application</code> function we wrote above, the constructor <code>__init__</code> must have the two parameters that are required by the WSGI server interface. In our example, these are saved as class attributes.</p>

<p>The class also needs to have an iterator method called <code>__iter__</code>, which at some point must call the “start_response” function that was passed to the constructor. The <code>__iter__</code> method must also  <code>yield</code> responses—as the “bytes” type and not the “str” type you might expect . Note that <code>__iter__</code> is a generator. This is why the keyword <code>yield</code> is used in place of <code>return</code>. Tersely put, <code>__iter__</code> is a generator that yields bytes. The generator is used because the response body could be a large object such as a video. This allows the server to start sending content immediately, instead of waiting until everything is loaded.</p>

<p>If a package contains a file called <code>__main__.py</code> it becomes the entry point for the module and allows the package to be run without specifying any Python files. Create a file called <code>server/__main__.py</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>from tornado.httpserver import HTTPServer
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
from tornado.options import define, options
from tornado.wsgi import WSGIContainer
from .Application import Application

define("port", default=8080, help="Listener port")
options.parse_command_line()
container = WSGIContainer(Application)
server = HTTPServer(container)
server.listen(options.port)
print("Listening on port", options.port)
IOLoop.current().start()
</code>   

<p>This is similar to the earlier code, except that the class is passed to the WSGI container in place of the function.</p>

<p>It is bad practice to hard code the port number. Tornado provides an <code>options</code> package that allows command-line options to be defined and processed. A <code>port</code> option is defined which has a default value of 8080. It can be changed to port 80 on the command line using the <code>--port=80</code> option.</p>

<p>The server can be run specifying the port number to use.</p>

   <code>python -m server --port=8080
</code>   

<p>The program can be tested using <code>curl</code>, the <code>-i</code> option prints out the response headers.</p>

   <code>curl -i http://localhost:8080
</code>   

 Understanding the WSGI Environment 

<p>The WSGI environment dictionary contains the information required to process requests. We will copy <code>server/Application.py</code> to <code>server/Environment.py</code> while also renaming the “Application” class to “Environment”</p>

   <code>cat server/Application.py | sed 's/Application/Environment/' &gt; server/Environment.py
</code>   

<p>Next we will modify the iterator method in <code>server/Environment.py</code> to return the contents of the dictionary:</p>

   <code>def __iter__(self):
     status = "200 OK"
    headers = [("Content-type", "text/plain")]
    self.start(status, headers)
    for key, value in sorted(self.environ.items()):
        yield f"{key}: {value}\n".encode()
</code>   

<p>We also need to change <code>Application</code> to <code>Environment</code> in <code>server/__main__.py</code> so that it looks like this:</p>

   <code>from tornado.httpserver import HTTPServer
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
from tornado.options import define, options
from tornado.wsgi import WSGIContainer
from .Environment import Environment

define("port", default=8080, help="Listener port")
options.parse_command_line()
container = WSGIContainer(Environment)
server = HTTPServer(container)
server.listen(options.port)
print("Listening on port", options.port)
IOLoop.current().start()
</code>   

<p>Run the server and then use <code>curl</code> to send a GET request.</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:8080/example?user=Joe
</code>   

<p>The contents of the dictionary are:</p>

   <code>HTTP_ACCEPT: */*
HTTP_HOST: localhost:8080
HTTP_USER_AGENT: curl/7.64.1
PATH_INFO: /example
QUERY_STRING: user=Joe
REMOTE_ADDR: ::1
REQUEST_METHOD: GET
SCRIPT_NAME:
SERVER_NAME: localhost
SERVER_PORT: 8080
SERVER_PROTOCOL: HTTP/1.1
wsgi.errors: &lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='&lt;stderr&gt;' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'&gt;
wsgi.input: &lt;_io.BytesIO object at 0x1077d36d0&gt;
wsgi.multiprocess: True
wsgi.multithread: False
wsgi.run_once: False
wsgi.url_scheme: http
wsgi.version: (1, 0)
</code>   

<p>The request method is in the environment variable <code>REQUEST_METHOD</code>. You can find the components of the URL <code>http://localhost:8080/example?user=Joe</code> in the environment variables <code>wsgi.url_scheme</code>, <code>HTTP_HOST</code>, <code>PATH_INFO</code>, and <code>QUERY_STRING</code>.</p>

<p>Now use <code>curl</code> to send a POST request.</p>

   <code>curl -i -X POST -d "email=michelle@example.com&amp;password=abcd1234" http://localhost:8080/login
</code>   

<p>The contents of the dictionary are:</p>

   <code>CONTENT_LENGTH: 44
CONTENT_TYPE: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
HTTP_ACCEPT: */*
HTTP_HOST: localhost:8080
HTTP_USER_AGENT: curl/7.64.1
PATH_INFO: /login
QUERY_STRING:
REMOTE_ADDR: ::1
REQUEST_METHOD: POST
SCRIPT_NAME:
SERVER_NAME: localhost
SERVER_PORT: 8080
SERVER_PROTOCOL: HTTP/1.1
wsgi.errors: &lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='&lt;stderr&gt;' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'&gt;
wsgi.input: &lt;_io.BytesIO object at 0x1042f5450&gt;
wsgi.multiprocess: True
wsgi.multithread: False
wsgi.run_once: False
wsgi.url_scheme: http
wsgi.version: (1, 0)
</code>   

<p>The POST request sent parameters in the HTTP request body. This added the environment variables <code>CONTENT_LENGTH</code> and <code>CONTENT_TYPE</code>. The request body is contained in the environment variable <code>wsgi.input</code> which is a byte stream. This can be displayed by decoding the byte stream.</p>

   <code>    def __iter__(self):
        status = "200 OK"
        headers = [("Content-type", "text/plain")]
        self.start(status, headers)
        for key, value in sorted(self.environ.items()):
            yield f"{key}: {value}\n".encode()
        yield self.environ['wsgi.input'].getvalue()
        yield "\n".encode()
</code>   

<p>The output from the <code>curl</code> request now has the following line:</p>

   <code>email=michelle@example.com&amp;password=abcd1234
</code>   

 What are WSGI Server Considerations? 

<p>The Tornado WSGI container runs a single application. It also requires Python code to create the container and the server. A consequence of this is that the application needs to use the request method and the path to decide what content to serve.</p>

<p>There is another popular Python webserver called <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Green Unicorn</a>. It can run Python web applications, including WSGI applications, without any additional code. If the WSGI application is not a function called <code>application</code> then the function or class needs to be specified on the command line after a colon character. Again, it runs a single application.</p>

   <code>pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -b :8080 server.Application:Application
</code>   

<p>A more flexible solution is to use an Apache web server which has the <code>mod_wsgi</code> module installed. This allows URIs to be mapped to WSGI applications. A single server can run multiple applications each one handling a different URI.</p>

 How to Implement a WSGI Server 

<p>It may sometimes be necessary to implement the WSGI server side of the interface. A typical use case is writing a middleware layer that needs to perform transformation or forward requests to other servers.</p>

<p>In this example, we will implement a server that can redirect requests to different WSGI applications based on the HTTP request method and the URI.</p>

<p>Create a file called <code>server/WSGIRunner.py</code> containing the following Python code:</p>

   <code>import sys
from tornado.web import RequestHandler
from .Application import Application
from .Environment import Environment

class WSGIRunner(RequestHandler):
    headers = []
    url_map = {
        '/': Application,
        '/env': Environment
    }

    def get(self, path):
        self._set_environment('GET', path)
        if path in WSGIRunner.url_map:
            self.run(WSGIRunner.url_map[path])
        else:
            self.send_error(404)

    def _set_environment(self, method, path):
        self.environ = {
            'wsgi.errors': sys.stderr,
            'wsgi.input': sys.stdin.buffer,
            'wsgi.multiprocess': True,
            'wsgi.multithread': False,
            'wsgi.run_once': False,
            'wsgi.url_scheme': 'http',
            'wsgi.version': (1, 0),
            'HTTP_ACCEPT': self.request.headers['Accept'],
            'HTTP_HOST': self.request.headers['Host'],
            'HTTP_HTTP_USER_AGENT': self.request.headers['User-Agent'],
            'REQUEST_METHOD': method,
            'PATH_INFO': path
        }
        query = ''
        for k, v in self.request.arguments.items():
            if len(query) &gt; 0:
                query += '&amp;'
            query += k + '=' + v[0].decode()
        self.environ['QUERY_STRING'] = query

    @staticmethod
    def start_response(status, response_headers):
        headers = response_headers

    def run(self, application):
        result = application(self.environ, WSGIRunner.start_response)
        for header in WSGIRunner.headers:
            self.set_header(header[0], header[1])
        for data in result:
            self.write(data)
</code>   

<p>The class <code>WSGIRunner</code> is a Tornado request handler which implements a <code>get</code> method that has a <code>path</code> parameter containing the request URI.</p>

<p>The <code>_set_environment()</code> method is called to create the environment map required by WSGI. The parameters are the request method—in this case, GET and the path.</p>

<p>The <code>get</code> method looks up the path in a static dictionary. If the entry exists, the dictionary returns the class containing the WSGI application to run. The <code>run</code> method is called to run the application. If the path is not in the map a 404 not found response is sent using the <code>RequestHandler</code> <code>send_error()</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>start_response()</code> method is the response callback required by the WSGI interface. It has to be a static method. The <code>@staticmethod</code> annotation allows the class to define a static method that does not require a <code>self</code> parameter. The method simply stores the response headers in the static list <code>headers</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>run</code> method calls the WSGI application, passing the environment dictionary and the response callback. It then sets the response headers and writes the data returned by the application as the response.</p>

<p>Tornado will decode any query string, so it needs to be reconstructed from the request arguments.</p>

<p>The file <code>___main__.py</code> now must be changed to run the <code>WSGIRunner</code> as a Tornado application.</p>

   <code>from tornado.httpserver import HTTPServer
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
from tornado.options import define, options
from tornado.web import Application
from .WSGIRunner import WSGIRunner

define("port", default=8080, help="Listener port")
options.parse_command_line()
application = Application([("(/.*)", WSGIRunner)])
server = HTTPServer(application)
server.listen(options.port)
print("Listening on port", options.port)
IOLoop.current().start()
</code>   

<p>The Tornado <code>Application</code> gets passed an array of tuples, in this case just one. The tuple contains a URI and a class that handles it. In this case, the URI is a regular expression in parentheses that matches everything. The parentheses cause the URI to be captured and passed as a parameter to the <code>get</code> method.</p>

 Summing Up WSGI 

<p>WSGI is an interface specification for Python web applications. It is a low-level interface. Many Python developers build web applications using popular frameworks, such as Flask, Tornado, or Django.</p>

<p>If it is unlikely that the web application framework will be changed, the benefits of using the framework APIs outweigh the limitations of WSGI. If, however, the web application is designed to be deployed in different server environments, then WSGI is the only choice as it is a Python standard.</p>

<p>The biggest limitation of WSGI is that it needs to implement code conditionally based on the request method and the request URI. It also needs to extract and decode any request parameters from the environment dictionary.</p>

<p>These limitations can be overcome by using a standalone server implementation, which can invoke different WSGI applications, depending on the request method and URI. A utility class can decode request parameters and return a dictionary in a more consumable form.</p>

<p>To sum it up, while WSGI is a low-level protocol for building web applications in Python, it is often helpful to understand how these things work behind the scenes.  While you probably won’t be building any raw WSGI applications, I hope this information will be helpful to you in your web development journey.</p>

  <p>Twenty-seven percent of malware incidents reported in 2020 can be attributed to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-a-defensible-cybersecurity-program-in-3-steps/">ransomware</a>. Ransomware — cyber extortion that occurs when malicious software infiltrates computer systems and encrypts data, holding it hostage until the victim pays a ransom — can have a bigger impact on an organization than a data breach.</p>
<p>In the short term, ransomware can cost companies millions of dollars, and a potentially even greater loss over the long term, impacting reputation and reliability.&nbsp;From top healthcare providers and retailers in the U.S. to insurance providers in the Middle East, ransomware attackers are proving to be a continuing cybersecurity threat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Organizations need to focus on is preparation and early mitigation if they want to cut losses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“In some recent cases of ransomware attacks, the victim organizations have paid huge amounts to the attackers, which can be one of the reasons these attacks are getting more popular,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/89434">Paul Webber</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “Instead, what organizations need to focus on is preparation and early mitigation if they want to cut <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-security-and-risk-leaders-can-prepare-for-reduced-budgets/">losses</a> to ransomware."</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>CISOs and security leaders can reduce the likelihood of ransomware attacks, reduce exposure to vulnerabilities and secure the organization using a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/tackle-tomorrows-digital-business-security-risks/">mitigation</a> plan. This plan must cover the following six actions.</p>
 No. 1: Conduct initial ransomware assessments 
<p>Conduct risk assessments and penetration tests to determine the attack surface and current state of security resilience and preparedness in terms of tools, processes and skills to defend against attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Before you assume that payment is the only option, investigate using free ransomware decryption software,” says Webber.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 2: Enforce ransomware governance&nbsp; 
<p>Establish processes and compliance procedures that involve key decision makers in the organization, even before preparing for the technical response to a ransomware attack. Ransomware can escalate from an issue to a crisis in no time, costing an organization revenue loss and creating a damaged reputation.</p>
<p>Key people such as the CEO, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-security-questions-board-will-definitely-ask/">board of directors</a> and other important stakeholders must be involved in the preparation. In the event of a ransomware attack, it is likely that journalists and other external stakeholders will reach out to the board of directors for response to the attack, not the security leaders or CISO.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 3: Maintain consistent operational readiness 
<p>Conduct frequent exercises and drills to ensure that systems are always able to detect ransomware attacks. Build regular testing of incident response scenarios into the ransomware response plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Test, test and retest at regular intervals to check for vulnerabilities, noncompliant systems and misconfigurations. Ensure that incident response processes are not themselves reliant on IT systems that may be affected by ransomware attacks or unavailable in case of a serious incident.</p>

 No. 4: Back up, test, repeat ransomware response 
<p>Back up not only the data but also every nonstandard application and its supporting IT infrastructure. Maintain frequent and reliable backup and recovery capabilities. If online backups are used, ensure that they cannot become encrypted by ransomware. Harden the components of enterprise backup and recovery infrastructure against attacks by routinely examining backup application, storage and network access and comparing this against expected or baseline activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prepare for critical application recovery in a systemwide ransomware attack by creating specific recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) parameters, safeguarding backup storage media and accessibility.</p>
 No. 5: Implement the principle of least privilege 
<p>Restrict permissions and deny unauthorized access to devices. Remove local administrator rights from end users and block application installation by standard users, replacing this with a centrally managed software distribution facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CISOs and security leaders must deploy multifactor authentication wherever possible, especially for privileged accounts. Increase authentication logging on all critical servers, network appliances and directory services, and ensure logs are not deleted. Notify security operations teams of any unexpected activity and ensure they proactively look for unusual logins/failed authentication attempts.</p>
 No. 6: Educate and train users on ransomware response actions 
<p>Research government and regional authorities that have provided guidelines on how organizations can fortify their network infrastructure against ransomware. CISOs and security leaders can use guidelines such as these to create a basic training program for all staff in the organization. However, ransomware preparedness training needs to be customized to the organization for better results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Use cyber crisis simulation tools for mock drills and training that provide closer to real-life situations for better preparedness of end users against ransomware,” says Webber.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges of ransomware and other forms of malware are the ever-changing tactics and agendas of hackers. Having a strategy in place for preparedness can help contain the losses and protect the organization.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Cyberattacks have rapidly evolved since the advent of online transacting almost 25 years ago, with attackers continually escalating and refining their evasion techniques. While&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;and individuals continue to&nbsp;mobilise&nbsp;in an attempt to&nbsp;mitigate the global disruptions taking place around them, cybercriminals have wasted no time in exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, attackers and fraudsters call upon a sophisticated suite of tools, including human-powered click farms, social engineering, and malware – all designed to defeat traditional defenses such as&nbsp;WAFs &amp;&nbsp;CAPTCHAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will dive deeper into how&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;can keep pace with this precipitate shift and adjust their security postures accordingly, to more accurately reflect the realities of an ever-evolving threat landscape.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>Discussion&nbsp;Points:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Attack Evolution&nbsp;- navigate the automated application attack-roadmap as it has progressed from the commodification of Credential Stuffing and ATO schemes to some of the most cutting-edge examples of Manual Fraud capability.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Countermeasure Efficacy&nbsp;- discover how&nbsp;F5’s Application Fraud&nbsp;portfolio addresses the whole spectrum&nbsp;of&nbsp;eCrime&nbsp;attacks&nbsp;deterring&nbsp;cybercriminals&nbsp;who&nbsp;continually&nbsp;retool&nbsp;to&nbsp;circumvent&nbsp;traditional countermeasures.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Inverting Friction&nbsp;- understand how&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;can protect their&nbsp;customers and brand without compromising user experience or collecting PII.&nbsp;

 Introducing DIDKit <p>In order to better work with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, we’re working on&nbsp;DIDKit.</p><p>DIDKit is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). It allows you to resolve and manage DID documents, and also manage the entire lifecycle of Verifiable Credentials including their issuance, presentation, and verification.</p><p>Notably, it reuses the same codebase across command-line tooling, RESTful HTTP servers, and platform-specific SDKs to facilitate code-level interoperability and a low total cost of ownership. When building ecosystems using decentralized identity to enable verifiable information, many actors must share the same underlying data formats and processing algorithms across different roles.</p><p>We wrote DIDKit in Rust due to its memory safety, expressive type system, and suitability across a variety of systems and environments. For example, the Rust ecosystem has already explored WASM compilation targets in support of single-page apps running in browsers, and we wanted to be able to support those and also browser extensions with DID and VC operations.</p><p>The same codebase can also run nimbly on embedded systems with moderately constrained resources (memory in the megabytes and CPU in the megahertz). Finally, Rust programs are able to directly interface with production-ready cryptographic libraries, as seen with Hyperledger Ursa’s use of openssl, libsodium, and libsecp256k1.</p><p>Currently, we have a working suite of command-line tools for credential issuance, presentation, and verification. We are creating an HTTP server conforming to <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-http-api/">VC HTTP API</a>, and we have native iOS and Android libraries that are used in our Credible&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact">leave us a message</a>, and we will be more than happy to show our progress to date or show a&nbsp;demo.</p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>Once a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available for use in the United States, officials will start the process of delivering doses to states, counties and cities and will oversee their administration to citizens. This is an historically complex challenge: making sure that there are enough vaccines distributed in a quick, effective and, if possible, equitable way. The process is expected to take at least a year to complete. Because not all Americans will be vaccinated right away (some may actually simply refuse the vaccination), employers will need to obtain proof of vaccination or sufficient presence of COVID-19 antibodies before welcoming their employees back into the office.</p>

You no longer have to send precious documents away, or have them stored in multiple physical or electronic locations.</p><p>Right now, if someone wants to open a bank account, or apply for a loan, mortgage or other financial product, they have to send personal documentation, either physically or electronically. The result: company servers full of sensitive customer information, which become a prime target for fraudsters.</p><p>Our new partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions — one of the world’s largest protectors of private and confidential data — will help to validate the benefits and strengths of the self-sovereign identity&nbsp;model.</p><p>SSI isn’t just good news for consumer privacy. It should also facilitate quicker processing and lower costs for risk and compliance for businesses like banks carrying out know-your-customer (KYC) and know-your-business (KYB)&nbsp;checks.</p><p>At Nuggets, we’ve always been driven by our belief that customers should be able to take back control of their data. As relentless data breaches show, the existing model of personal data storage is&nbsp;broken.</p><p>Through this new partnership, we’re helping to fundamentally change the way personal information is shared with, and used by, financial institutions. We’re helping individuals and businesses enhance their privacy and security protocols, for the benefit of&nbsp;all.</p><p>LexisNexis Risk Solutions provide solutions for a range of industries, including insurance, financial services, healthcare and government. With offices across the world, they’re also part of RELX, a provider of information and analytics for professional and business customers in various industries.</p><p>Here’s Steve Elliot, MD of LexisNexis Risk Solutions UK &amp; Ireland, on our new partnership:</p><p>“Effective solutions that can digitally identify and authenticate a person more quickly, more accurately and more securely, can have wide-ranging benefits for individuals, organisations and society as a whole, from reducing the time it takes consumers to acquire goods and services, to widening access and reducing fraud and money laundering. It’s really exciting to think that innovations like these could help reduce the increasing prevalence of large scale breaches of consumers’ personal data. We’re really excited to be working with Nuggets to explore how SSI can help achieve those benefits whilst maximising data privacy and security for consumers.”</p><p>If you share our belief in transforming the way personal information is stored and shared, and think your business could benefit from this approach, we’d love to hear from you.

  <p>“Artificial intelligence (AI)I will automate everything and put people out of work.” “AI is a science-fiction technology.” “Robots will take over the world.” </p>
<p>The hype around AI has produced many myths, in mainstream media, in board meetings and across organizations. Some worry about <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/human-beings-ai-and-robots-to-represent-the-new-workforce-in-2028/">an “almighty” AI that will take over the world</a>, and some think that AI is nothing more than a buzzword. The truth is somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>“Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, the majority of organizations have been maintaining or even increasing their investments in artificial intelligence,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/56819">Saniye Alaybeyi</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “However, only half of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-3-benefits-of-ai-projects/">these projects</a> ever make it to production.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>AI is not only augmenting mundane jobs. IT leaders need to create value for AI by establishing business benefits such as cost reductions and operations improvement by providing practical applications of the technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gartner has identified six common myths and misconceptions about AI.</p>
 Myth No. 1: AI Is an unnecessary luxury in times of the COVID-19 pandemic 
<p>AI is emerging as an important enabler of cost optimization and business continuity during the COVID-19 crisis. Contrary to the misconception that AI is an unnecessary luxury when enterprises are struggling with cash flows and uncertain economic conditions, AI is generating revenue. It is improving customer interactions, analyzing data more quickly, generating early warnings about upcoming disruptions and automating decision making.&nbsp;</p>

 Myth No. 2: AI and machine learning (ML) are the same and interchangeable 
<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. ML requires a well-thought-out training and data acquisition strategy. AI, on the other hand, is an umbrella term for a broad set of computer engineering techniques, ranging from ML and rule-based systems to optimization techniques and natural language processing (NLP).&nbsp;</p>
 Myth No. 3: Intelligent machines learn on their own 
<p>A finished ML product gives the impression that it is able to learn on its own. However, experienced human data scientists frame the problem, prepare the data, determine appropriate datasets, remove potential bias in the training data and, most importantly, continually update the software to enable the integration of new knowledge and data into the next learning cycle.</p>
 Myth No. 4: AI can be 100% objective 
<p>Every AI technology is based on data, rules and other kinds of input from human experts. Because all humans are intrinsically biased in one way or another, so is the AI. Systems that are frequently retrained — for example, using new data from social media — are even more vulnerable to unwanted bias or intentional malevolent influences.</p>
<p>Even if your current AI strategy is “no AI,” this should be a conscious decision based on research and consideration.</p>
<p>“At the moment, there is no way to completely banish bias; however, we have to try our best to reduce it to a minimum,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/12496">Alexander Linden</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “In addition to technological solutions, such as diverse datasets, it is crucial to also ensure diversity in the teams working with the AI and have team members review each other’s work. This simple process can significantly reduce selection and confirmation bias.”</p>

 Myth No. 5: AI will only replace mundane jobs 
<p>AI enables businesses to make more accurate decisions via predictions, classifications and clustering. These abilities have enabled AI-based solutions to reach deep into work environments, not only replacing mundane tasks, but also augmenting those that are more complex.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the use of imaging <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-need-for-ai-governance-in-healthcare/">AI in healthcare</a>. A chest X-ray application based on AI can detect diseases faster than can radiologists. In the financial and insurance industry,&nbsp;roboadvisors are being used for wealth management and fraud detection. These capabilities don’t eliminate human involvement in those tasks but will eventually limit it to observing and dealing with unusual cases. Adjust job profiles and capacity planning and offer retraining options for existing staff.</p>
 Myth No. 6: My business does not need an AI strategy 
<p>Every organization should consider the potential impact of AI on its <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-chief-data-officers-guide-to-an-ai-strategy/">strategy</a> and investigate how this technology can be applied to the organization’s business problems. In many ways, AI exploitation is the same as forgoing the next phase of automation, and could place enterprises at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Even if AI is not an immediate fix to a problem, businesses should revisit the decision to not implement AI periodically,” says Alaybeyi. “Organizations need to find appropriate use cases that leverage AI’s power to augment human work, decisions and interactions, as well as other functional innovation opportunities.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next four years, 69% of what a manager currently does will be automated. In such a disruptive environment, enterprises need a reality check on how best they can integrate AI into their strategy and be ready for forthcoming disruptions.</p>

  <p>Next.js is a React framework that aims to provide the best development experience. It is feature rich, including hybrid static and server rendering, TypeScript support, built-in CSS support, API routers, and much more.</p>

<p>TypeScript is an open-source language that is built on JavaScript that allows developers to use types. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use TypeScript with Next.js.</p>

<p>Finally, you will secure your application with Okta Single Sign-On and the built-in functionality of Next.js, as well as the support of the next-auth package.</p>

 Create Your Okta Application 

<p>The first thing you will need to do is create an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta developer account</a> if you don’t have one already. The account is free, doesn’t require a credit card, and allows you to start with Okta immediately. Once you have signed up, log in to the Developer Console and click on Applications. Click Add Application and select Web. In your application settings screen set your URIs to <code>localhost:3000</code> instead of the default <code>localhost:8080</code>. Next, set your Login redirect URIs to <code>http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/okta</code>. This is the default callback URI that <code>next-auth</code> will use. Give your application a meaningful name, I named mine NextJs. Click Done and you will be brought to your application’s management screen. Click on General and note your Client ID and Client secret as you will need these in your application.</p>

<p></p>

 Create Your Next.js Application 

<p>Open your favorite IDE. For this tutorial, I used Visual Studio Code. Navigate to the folder where you wish to keep your application. Next, use the <code>create-next-app</code> task runner by using the command <code>npx create-next-app</code> and follow the instructions. After the runner is complete, open the folder it created for you.</p>

<p>Since you are using TypeScript in this tutorial you will need to set up TypeScript support. Create a new file in the root of your application called <code>tsconfig.json</code>. Next.js will automatically populate this file with its default values but you can edit them if you wish. Next, run <code>npm run dev</code> in your console and you will see instructions about installing your dependencies for TypeScript.</p>

<p>To do this, open the console and run the following commands.</p>

   <code>npm i typescript@4.0.3
npm i @types/node@14.11.8
npm i @types/react@16.9.52    
</code>   

<p>This will complete your TypeScript setup. But there are more dependencies you should add at this point. You can add <code>next-auth</code> at this point. Next-auth makes setting up any type of authentication in Next.js simple. Of course, for this application, you are only setting up Okta as an external provider. Install next-auth with the command below and you will see how to implement it later.</p>

   <code>npm i next-auth@3.1.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, for this tutorial, you will use Bootstrap for your CSS framework.</p>

   <code> npm i bootstrap@4.5.3
</code>   

 Convert Your Next.js Application to TypeScript 

<p>The task running for creating a Next.js application does not include an option for using TypeScript. Therefore you will need to manually convert your application from JavaScript to TypeScript. The process is simple and should only take a moment.</p>

<p>You have already completed the first two steps by setting up your <code>tsconfig.json</code> file and installing your dependencies. Now you will need to convert files with the <code>.js</code> extension to <code>.tsx</code>. You will need to do this for each file in your <code>pages</code> directory and any subdirectories. Any subsequent components you add will also need to have the <code>.tsx</code> file extension.</p>

 Set Up Your Authentication 

<p>Next, you’ll need to set up the authentication for external providers.</p>

<p>Before you can implement authentication, you will need to ensure that your <code>.env.local</code> file is set up correctly. Add this file to the root of your project if one doesn’t exist yet. Add the following values to it.</p>

 <code>OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENTSECRET={yourClientSecret}
OKTA_DOMAIN={yourOktaDomain}
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
</code> 

<p>Now, under your <code>pages\api</code> folder create a new folder called <code>auth</code> if one doesn’t exist yet. Add a file called <code>[...nextauth].ts</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import Providers from 'next-auth/providers'

const options = {
  // Configure one or more authentication providers
  providers: [
    Providers.Okta({
      clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTID,
      clientSecret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTSECRET,
      domain: process.env.OKTA_DOMAIN
    }),
    // ...add more providers here
  ]
}

export default (req, res) =&gt; NextAuth(req, res, options)
</code>   

<p>Finally, open <code>pages\_app.tsx</code> and replace the existing code with the following.</p>

   <code>import '../styles/globals.css'
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'

import { Provider } from 'next-auth/client'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    &lt;Provider session={pageProps.session}&gt;
      &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;
    &lt;/Provider&gt;
  )
}

export default MyApp
</code>   

<p>This code is the default Next.js code wrapped in a <code>Provider</code> class from next-auth. The provider class makes sharing the session between pages easier. You added the Bootstrap CSS in this file as well. This will enable you to use Bootstrap on your pages.</p>

 Write Your Next.js Components and Pages 

<p>Your application is set up and ready to develop. Start by adding a new folder called <code>Components</code> to the root of your directory. This will be a folder for your shared components. Add a new file called <code>Movies.tsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>export default function Movies() {

    return (
        &lt;div className="row"&gt;

            &lt;div className="col-lg-4"&gt;

                &lt;div className="card"&gt;
                    &lt;img className="card-img-top" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gDYZG%2BzDL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Card image cap"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
                    &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;h5 className="card-title"&gt;Die Hard&lt;/h5&gt;
                        &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;He's the only chance anyone has got.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div className="col-lg-4"&gt;

                &lt;div className="card"&gt;
                    &lt;img className="card-img-top" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRlNDUxZjAtOGQ4OC00OTNlLTgxNmQtYTBmMDgwZmNmNjkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_.jpg" alt="Card image cap"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
                    &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;h5 className="card-title"&gt;Die Hard 2&lt;/h5&gt;
                        &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;They say lightning never strikes twice... They were wrong&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div className="col-lg-4"&gt;

                &lt;div className="card"&gt;
                    &lt;img className="card-img-top" src="https://belgianfilmfreak.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/d0.jpg" alt="Card image cap"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
                    &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;h5 className="card-title"&gt;Die Hard: With a Vengence&lt;/h5&gt;
                        &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;Think Fast, Look Alive, Die Hard&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
</code>   

<p>This component will be displayed on the <code>Dashboard</code> page for logged-in users. It displays some of the most important movies in history to the user.</p>

<p>Next, you can add a file called <code>Unauthorized.tsx</code>.</p>

   <code>import { signIn } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Unauthorized() {

    return (
        &lt;div className="row"&gt;
            &lt;div className="col-lg-10 col-offset-1"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Hey There, looks like you reached an area you don't have access to.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt; Please sign in here.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt; &lt;button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={signIn}&gt;Sign in&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
</code>   

<p>This is the first time on the client that you are using the <code>next-auth</code> package. You are importing the <code>signIn</code> feature from the <code>next-auth/client</code> component. This function will navigate the user to a list of providers that you implemented previously. The user will then be able to click on that provider and be taken to their login screen. The <code>Unauthorized</code> component simply presents the user with a message that they reached a protected part of the site without being authenticated and routes them to the appropriate provider.</p>

<p>The last file to add to this folder is the <code>Header.tsx</code> file. This is just a banner that sits on top of each page and has a login or logout button depending on the state of the user.</p>

   <code>import { signIn, signOut, useSession } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Header() {

  const [session, loading] = useSession();

  var button;

  if (session) {
    button = &lt;button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={signOut}&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;;
  }
  else {
    button = &lt;button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={signIn}&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;;
  }

  return (

    &lt;div className="row mb-4"&gt;
      &lt;div className="col-lg-12"&gt;
        &lt;nav className="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"&gt;
          &lt;a className="navbar-brand" href="#"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;

          &lt;button className="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"&gt;
            &lt;span className="navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/button&gt;

          &lt;div className="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent"&gt;
            &lt;ul className="navbar-nav mr-auto"&gt;
              &lt;li className="nav-item active"&gt;
                &lt;a className="nav-link" href="/"&gt;Home &lt;span className="sr-only"&gt;(current)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li className="nav-item"&gt;
                &lt;a className="nav-link" href="dashboard"&gt;Movies&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;div className="form-inline my-2 my-lg-0"&gt;
              {button}
            &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code>   

<p>The simplest way to see if a user is logged in is to check if the session exists by calling <code>useSession()</code> from <code>next-auth</code>. If it does, you present the user with the option to log out using the <code>signOut()</code> function. If it does not, you present the user with a login button that ties into the <code>signIn()</code> function you used on the <code>Unauthorized</code> component.</p>

<p>You can tie everything together by creating your pages. By default, Next.js should have added an <code>index.tsx</code> file. (Well, really, it added <code>index.js</code> but you should have changed the extension to <code>.tsx</code> already.) You can replace the code in that file with the code below.</p>

   <code>import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

import Header from '../components/Header'

export default function Home() {

  return (
    &lt;div className="container"&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Movies By Nik - Find Your Next Movie&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;

      &lt;div className="row"&gt;
        &lt;div className="col-lg-12"&gt;
          &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code>   

<p>Here you are giving any user a landing page to display what your site is about and using the header to provide a login button if necessary.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to create a dashboard page. Start by creating a new file in the <code>pages</code> directory called <code>dashboard.tsx</code>. This page will need to check if the user has access to the page and display the <code>Unauthorized</code> component if not and the <code>Movies</code> component if they are. You can add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react'

import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

import Header from '../components/Header'
import Unauthorized from '../components/Unauthorized'
import Movies from '../components/Movies'

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Dashboard() {

    const [session, loading] = useSession();

    var content = session ? &lt;Movies&gt;&lt;/Movies&gt; : &lt;Unauthorized&gt;&lt;/Unauthorized&gt;

    return (
        &lt;div className="container"&gt;
            &lt;Head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Movies By Nik - Find Your Next Movie&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
            &lt;/Head&gt;

            &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;

            {content}

        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
</code>   

<p>As you learned already, the easiest way to check if a user is authenticated is to check if the <code>session</code> exists.</p>

 Test and Conclusions 

<p>You should be ready to start your application now. From the command line run <code>npm run-script dev</code> and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should be presented with the home screen for the application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next click on the Movies link. You should receive a message telling you that you don’t have access to the dashboard. Click Sign in and select Okta then log in with your Okta credentials. You should be redirected to the dashboard page showing you some of the greatest movies in history.</p>

<p></p>

<p>From here you can continue to build on your react components and develop your API to support your frontend knowing that your application is safe and secure with Okta’s authentication.</p>

  <p>Security is Culture – and culture starts with people (not technology!) The complex topic of SAP-security is a massive challenge for the almost 500.000 companies worldwide using SAP. The challenges are the same for everyone, and it is the combined corporate responsibility of the C-Level and all employees to protect the enterprise from threats. These core applications can be secured by focusing on the 3 main attack vectors: People, Processes, and Technology. Within this keynote, Jochen Fischer shares what needs to be done to define clear ownership and responsibilities for SAP-security. Enabling people to understand the risk in SAP is fundamental to design a sustainable strategy that is based on the individual risk profile of each individual company. It is time to stop the monkey business when it comes to mission-critical topics like security. As independent expert, Jochen Fischer provides state-of-the-art methodologies to deliver the right people the suitable skills required to protect SAP without burning money on tools that have no or limited effect on corporate cyber resilience.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_fischer"></a>

The latest national cybersecurity and defence strategies of several governments explicitly mention AI capabili-&nbsp;ties. At the&nbsp;same time, initiatives to define new standards and certification procedures to elicit users’ trust in AI are emerging&nbsp;on a global scale. However, trust in AI (both machine learning and neural networks)&nbsp;to deliver cybersecurity tasks is a double-&nbsp;edged sword: it can improve substantially cybersecurity practices, but can also facilitate new forms of attacks to the AI applica-&nbsp;tions themselves, which may&nbsp;pose severe security threats. We argue that trust in AI for cybersecurity is unwarranted and that,&nbsp;to reduce security risks, some form of control to ensure the deployment of ‘reliable AI’ for&nbsp;cybersecurity is necessary. To this&nbsp;end, we offer three recommendations focusing on the design, development and deployment of AI for cybersecurity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_taddeo"></a>

  <p>This talk aims to share the experience achieved during&nbsp;Q-Secure Net, a 2020's project co-financed by the European Institute of Technology (EIT) and Italtel, Cefriel, Politecnico di Milano, CNR, UPM and Telefonica. Q-Secure Net will provide a cost-effective and flexible network solution for&nbsp;unconditionally secure communication services&nbsp;based on&nbsp;Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)&nbsp;thought for fiber-optic networks.</p>
<p>The talk will also present an application of&nbsp;Blockchain Atomic Swaps&nbsp;for the exchange of securities and cryptocurrencies, developed in the project and based on QKD. Atomic Swaps have great potentials for financial scenarios regarding securities, crypto exchanges and cryptocurrencies but have specific security threats.</p>
<p>The QKD market is expected to grow over $980 million by 2024. In the long term, the QKD will be strategic for the design of new architectures in many sectors like telco, defence and transports and 5G sectors. QKD's infrastructural security and its ability to mitigate cyber-risks, also allow a whole new class of approaches and applications for Decentralised Finance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QKD Features</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capabilities for Fintech applications</p>

					 <p>Not to mention, open standards make good business. The ICP/IP protocol the internet runs on is an open standard that beat out the proprietary Microsoft protocols. HTTP is another standard—any browser can visit any website because of it. Bluetooth is another standard—any headphones can connect to any phone, which makes both the headphones and the phone more valuable as a result.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Standards enable the Trinsic platform to interoperate with other self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials platforms. For example, if the State of California were to use Trinsic to issue digital driver’s licenses, any business or organization that needed to verify those licenses (such as a pharmacy when people pick up certain prescriptions) would not need to necessarily use the Trinsic platform to do so and vice versa. Any developer that uses the Trinsic platform—including <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">Trinsic’s APIs</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>, and the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>—will inherit <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-commitment-to-interoperability-ahead-of-iiw/">interoperability with solutions</a> that also implements open, community-driven SSI standards.</p>

					 <p>Standards also enable us to avoid vendor lock-in. The State of California probably doesn’t want to force all its constituents to download a specific company’s digital wallet to store the driver’s license. Instead, it will want its citizens to have the freedom to choose from a variety of apps. (It may help to imagine if the whole internet was run by Microsoft, and you had to have a Microsoft device in order to access government services. That wouldn’t fly, because at that point Microsoft would be a monopoly.)<br><br></p><p>Not only would the State of California probably want its constituents to be able to choose from a variety of digital wallets, it would want its constituents to have the ability to leave their current wallet provider and switch to another at any time they wish without losing their credentials during the transition. The Trinsic Wallet is one of the first SSI digital wallets to provides its end users with the <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">import/export of credentials</a> functionality.<br><br></p><p>There are two kinds of standards that Trinsic implements to enable interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in: data model standards and protocol standards.</p>

					 <p>Computers are very precise, so it’s important they have a model for how data is structured. For (an oversimplified) example, if you had a database that stores data like this:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>

					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Then you will run in to problems if you try to insert the following into the database:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				{e-mail: ‘Joehd@gmail.com’, date_of_birth: ‘10/22/91’, f_name: ‘Joe’, zodiac: ‘aries’}			</p>

					 <p>If you needed to share user databases with other people in an industry, you would need to form a standards body (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">W3C</a> or <a href="https://www.computer.org/">IEEE</a>, etc.) to agree on what data will be collected, what order it appears in, how it’s spelled, punctuation, etc. The more specific the use case, the easier it is to standardize.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two fundamentally important standards that Trinsic uses, both developed at the W3C:<br><br></p>  <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs): DIDs are the identifiers used in SSI. They don’t store any data. Think of them as a username, a phone number, an IP address, or any other identifier—except they don’t need a central registry to authorize them. In SSI, every person has a new DID for each relationship they have. And the issuers of credentials have a public DID with a reputation so verifiers can trust it.  <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable credentials</a>: This is data that an issuer attests about you and signs with their DID. This same thing happens with the DMV in real life—they issue you a credential that others can verify is legit. Only now, there’s a digital version in addition to the plastic. Verifiable credentials answer the question “says who?”.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Protocol 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Once we’re using the same data model, we must figure out how to communicate. Theoretically, I could export my verifiable credentials out of my wallet onto a thumb drive and upload them into your wallet (if it supports the verifiable credentials data model), so you can check them out. But clearly, using common protocols is better than that.</p>

					 <p>DIDComm is an important standard protocol that lets a DID have secure communications with another DID. DIDComm started in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> community and recently moved to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>. Every action the Trinsic platform enables, whether it be creating secure connections or verifying a credential, uses some number of DIDComm.</p>

					 <p>At the core of the Trinsic platform is the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>. The .NET implementation is a collection of implemented standards based on the Hyperledger Aries RFCs (Request for Comment) documents. This is a project that is meant to make apps and clients that can interact with a variety of distributed ledgers. All of the protocol specifications can be found in the&nbsp;aries-rfcs&nbsp;repo here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A protocol is a step-by-step process to accomplish a task. If it’s not followed exactly correctly by either side, the process will fail. I’ll give an example of a university issuing a student ID to someone.<br><br></p>  School sends a&nbsp;credential offer&nbsp;to&nbsp;student<br><br>  Student responds with a&nbsp;credential request&nbsp;to the school, to confirm<br><br>  School sends a&nbsp;issue credential&nbsp;message to the student, which includes the credential  <p><br>Trinsic doesn’t have to implement every Aries RFC. But if we implement a feature that can be done in a way that follows an RFC, we will follow the RFC to do so so that it’s interoperable with other implementations.</p>

<p>IOTA Identity Alpha Release: A standard framework for Digital Identity.</p><p>Decentralized Identity (or Self Sovereign Identity) is a popular topic in the field of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) with over 75 implementations of the DID standards being submitted to W3C. It is an enabling technology for DLT, as it allows the creation of trust through identification in an online setting. This is crucial for both the internet and DLT as identifying who you interact with online can prevent many cases of fraud, disinformation, and distrust. With IOTA Identity we make an important step towards the adoption of both IOTA and DID due to the unique ability to pay and identify in the same feeless protocol. If you are not yet familiar with the concepts described above, we highly recommend reading our <a href="https://files.iota.org/comms/IOTA_The_Case_for_a_Unified_Identity.pdf">whitepaper</a> or watch our latest<a href="https://youtu.be/4YnGFHhxua8"> EclipseCon talk</a> on the&nbsp;subject.</p><p>In this blog, you will find the alpha-release of IOTA Identity, open-sourcing our Selv app, and the announcement of the Identity X-Team. For those that participate at Odyssey Momentum, we also prepared a hackathon package near the bottom of this&nbsp;blog.</p><p>IOTA Identity Alpha&nbsp;Release</p><p>We are excited to announce the release of IOTA Identity Alpha. At this stage, the proposed standards for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) are implemented in full. The implementation of these specifications is a fundamental layer for building an SSI framework. You can find the code in <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/">our repository identity.rs</a>. This contains both the full Rust implementation and <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/tree/main/libraries/wasm">Web Assembly (WASM) bindings</a>, which can be used both in the browser and Node.js environments in Javascript / Typescript. The current Alpha release is an early version and does not contain the level of documentation, code examples, and higher-level functionalities that we would ideally like, but that will be improved upon in the next few&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>For the remainder of the year, the team will focus on improving the IOTA Identity framework to prepare for the full 1.0 release. We will implement a higher-level library that wraps most of the complicated functions into easier, but less flexible functions. This should be sufficient for most of the applications that you might build on top of the IOTA Identity framework, otherwise, you can always access the lower level functions directly. In addition, we are working on implementing DID communications messages that allow different devices, programs, and platforms to interact in a standardized manner, allowing your custom apps to directly interface with Selv or other compatible applications. Lastly, we will improve upon the documentation and make it easier to use the framework.</p><p>Once again, I would like to thank huhn#8105, Thoralf#3558, and Tensor#2912 for their amazing work on identity.rs under the <a href="https://fund.iota.org">Ecosystem Development Fund</a> (EDF) grant with the support of our amazing colleagues at the IOTA Foundation such as Devin Turner and Daniel Thompson-Yvetot.</p><p>Selv</p><p>As part of the hackathon package, we are <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/selv-mobile">open-sourcing the Selv app</a>. Selv is the identity wallet developed by the IOTA Foundation. It is currently used for the <a href="https://selv.iota.org/demo/app">Selv: Health passport</a> demo and will be used for multiple demos. It allows people to store and share verifiable credentials with the demo websites or peer-to-peer with other Selv users via a QR-code. This is only the beginning for an identity wallet but should allow sufficient functionalities for an IOTA Identity based hackathon project. The repository includes a useful <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/selv-mobile#how-to-add-custom-credentials">tool </a>for generating new verifiable credentials and an associated QR Code which you can render on your pc and scan with the Selv app to transfer directly into the app. This workflow allows you to develop your own SSI demo with just a few commands.</p><p>Open sourcing the app was a long-promised step we still had to take, but it was delayed due to some required code restructures that were hard to prioritize during all our other work. Fortunately, we have recently received amazing community code contributions from Eike Haß, who is doing his master thesis about Selv. Adjacent to the IOTA Identity developments, we will be making more improvements on the tooling around Identity to foster the ecosystem.</p><p>Odyssey Hackathon Package</p><p>Tomorrow marks the kick-off of Odyssey Momentum, the 4th installment of the largest DLT/A.I. hackathon in the world. Last year, we saw nine teams who used IOTA in their solution, of which three teams won their respective challenges. As Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a popular topic at Odyssey to resolve the many different challenges, we have been hard at work at preparing a bunch of earlier than planned releases related to IOTA Identity in time for the hackathon.</p><p>We have prepared a minimum viable SSI stack for the participants of tomorrow’s Odyssey Momentum. The release of IOTA Identity Alpha contains the following components:</p><p>Rust</p>  Rust Implementation of the DID and VC&nbsp;standard  Publishing and Reading DIDs from the IOTA&nbsp;Tangle  <p>Javascript (WASM)</p>  WASM Bindings for the DID and VC&nbsp;standard  Publishing and Reading DIDs from the IOTA&nbsp;Tangle  Works on Node.js and the&nbsp;Web  Contains Typescript typing  <p>Selv app</p>  Open-source SSI&nbsp;wallet  Can store and verify credentials  QR code scanning to download, share and verify a credential  <p>If you have any questions during or after the hackathon about IOTA Identity, join us at <a href="http://discord.iota.org/">discord</a> and join the #identity-discussion channel. At Odyssey, you can also request assistance from our Jedis Dave de Fijter and Sebastian Heußer or tag them at the Odyssey Momentum&nbsp;Discord.</p><p>This is also an excellent opportunity for anyone else to familiarize yourself with IOTA Identity as we will soon be announcing further inquiries into the topic together with our community. We believe that IOTA Identity will not only impact how we use our identity from a technical perspective but also how we perceive our own identity and connect to the world around us. We look forward to exploring not only technological but also social and economic implications of SSI in the long-term together with our community. Stay tuned for more information on how to get involved!</p><p>X-Teams</p><p>In addition to the code releases, we are also happy to announce the launch of the IOTA Identity Experience Team. The X-Team members are active contributors to the ever-growing IOTA Ecosystem. Many of them already have personal projects that are planning to build on IOTA Identity such as <a href="https://society2.com/">Society2</a> and <a href="https://www.deposy.org/en/">Deposy</a>. X-Team members speak as a voice for the community. Working alongside IOTA Foundation members they will become intimately involved in preparing tools, libraries, and documentation for the IOTA Identity framework.</p><p>Everyone is invited to apply to the IOTA Identity X-Team and help pave the road for IOTA Identity to have the best experience in the DLT and IoT space.

<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> is a stable identifier in form of an URI that introduces a level of indirection for key management and managing other useful information such as service endpoints. It means, you can rotate and add properties related to your DID and validators can find out about those changes. Trust is usually rooted in a Blockchain but some DID methods exist that don’t require any on-chain transactions. Consequently, when we speak about a DID, then we need to be more precise and also speak about the particular DID method of that DID which defines the CRUD operations on a target system such as Ethereum. Depending on the privacy, security, scalability and other guarantees, developers can choose from a variety of different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>By resolving a DID a validator can typically discover the authoritative keys for different purposes or more generally, a set of verification methods for that DID. An Ethereum account could be a verification method as well. Service endpoints are extensible by design, so you could define your own ones if needed. However, the DID community has agreed on a set of well known service endpoints. Amongst them, the DIDComm service endpoint solves the how-to-reach-me problem and can be used to establish a secure communication channel with the other party. Despite there are only a few limitations of what properties can be associated with a DID, privacy regulations such as GDPR need to be considered very carefully.</p> If I had a Phone Book with DIDs&nbsp;… <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages</a><p>So, what happens if you had a corporate registry (or phone book) where all companies had their own DIDs and please note, the phone book should not expand on individuals for privacy reasons. You would be able to start to interact with them or more specifically with their agents by just knowing their DIDs. An agent is a piece of software that runs on behalf of their controller and manages DIDs, their associated private keys, relationships with other agents and other credentials. The <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/daf">DID Agent Framework (DAF)</a> was developed by the identity team at ConsenSys AG (former uPort) and provides an agent framework for different architectures (frontend, backend, mobile, hybrid deployments using method delegation such as to support remote KMS/HSM). These agent-to-agent interactions will be secured using state-of-the-art cryptography regardless of the chosen transport channel. This approach is called <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/guide/">DIDComm Messaging</a> which originated in the Hyperledger foundation and is now being specified as V2 by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) as a pre-standard. DIDComm Messaging provides a secure communication channel between two agents. After a channel has been established, well defined message-based sub-protocols can be used to make more sense of the interaction, e.g., to increase the trustworthiness of the other&nbsp;party.</p> How to trust the Phone Book&nbsp;entries? Illustrates different steps in an agent-based system<p>The Hyperledger Aries project has defined a couple of DIDComm Messaging sub-protocols as Hyperledger Aries RFCs to build a decentralized reputation network based on the global <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) standard and specifications developed in DIF such as <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">DIF Credential Manifest</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">DIF Presentation Exchange</a>. Reputation is established by issuing, collecting, revoking, verifying the provenance of attestations and proving control over attestations which use the W3C VC data model. Be it the company’s home address, group membership, relationships with other company departments or with the umbrella company, subscriptions, contracts with other parties, invoices — literally, there is no limitation in what can be attested. Agents can be integrated with existing systems and work flows to enforce policies (e.g. based on attestations), obtain consent and acquire additional input data at certain steps in these sub-protocols.</p><p>If none of the existing sub-protocols in HL Aries fit, one could define a new sub-protocol. If the problem to solve is general enough, e.g. because it is used by a larger community such as by Baseline, it will be possible to register these sub-protocols in the didcomm.org registry for more visibility. It is certainly possible to use DIDs and VCs without DIDComm Messaging and add a domain-specific service endpoint to the DID that offers the&nbsp;service.</p><p>Other approaches exist that allow bi-directional binding DNS names to DIDs. For example, this can be accomplished by signalling support for the <a href="https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/">DIF DID Configuration</a> specification in the service endpoint section of the DID. The endpoint would point to a JSON file hosted under a well-known URL of that domain that contains cryptographic binding between the DID and the domain protected by existing TLS certificates (i.e. Internet PKI). This ensures that a specific DID belongs to a web origin, e.g. example.com, in a fully GDPR-compliant manner.</p><blockquote>did = agent.discoverDid(‘www.acme.com’)</blockquote><p>Nevertheless, this approach can be combined with the aforementioned HL Aries approach to build trust beyond DNS because we all know that the trust layer of the Internet is broken. However, leveraging the existing Internet PKI could be a good starting point to discover DIDs for certain domains until more natural trust anchors such as the <a href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/1._panel_-_daniel_du_seuil.pdf">European Commission (ESSIF)</a> or <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/gleif-uport-test-verified-data-exchange-in-financial-and-commercial-transactions/">GLEIF</a> start to build a trust framework rooted in DIDs and&nbsp;VCs.</p> Is this Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI)? <p>You might have noticed that we have not mentioned the term Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) so far. This is because DIDs, VCs and DIDComm Messaging don’t necessarily require an end-user wallet to have useful applications which are typically associated with SSI. However, people could use the same approach to provide end-user apps (mobile, PWA, browser extensions, web services) that operate as their own agents to manage their SSI&nbsp;wallets.</p> Relationship with&nbsp;ENS <p>DIDs and VCs are great for off-chain use cases but they are not great on-chain. This is where <a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name Service (ENS)</a> still can make sense. ENS is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. On the other hand, if all you need is off-chain verification of an Ethereum account and that the account belongs to a company, then you don’t need ENS. Also note that ENS has a few design flaws which can be mitigated when an agent-based system architecture is&nbsp;used:</p>  DNSSEC oracle is not always up-to-date (specifically when the domain owner changed) which represents a security vulnerability.  Stored ENS records are hashes but they are not salted (for practical reasons), so it is questionable if this complies with&nbsp;GDPR.  Most ENS records are not verified, e.g., everyone could claim anything.  No L2 solution exists for updates (not yet) and therefore higher transaction costs can be expected.  No version history of ENS records is kept (without examining the ledger state history itself), e.g., it is not easy to find an older version of a public key which could be useful in order to (re-)verify historical data.  <p>If a system already uses ENS, then it could make sense to use ENS, DIDs, VCs and DIDComm Messaging together by adding a DID TXT record to an ENS entry. So, developers could use the ENS name as a lookup key to find other DIDs. Then, they could find out more about the reputation of that ENS name, or execute other off-chain protocols with their agent. A dedicated DID registrar contract for ENS might not be required because the linkage between the ENS name and the DID could be verified off-chain by other means (e.g.,&nbsp;VCs).</p> The DIDComm-agent Way&nbsp;… <p>The technologies described in this article can be used with SSI but are not strictly limited to end-user focused use cases. Further, DIDs are not necessarily competing with ENS and in certain cases can be a complementary solution.</p><p>Agents (through their DIDs) should be the starting point of every interaction between all types of entities across organizational borders. To make most sense out of an agent-based system architecture usually the following steps are required:</p>  Make DIDs discoverable.  Your agent discovers their&nbsp;DID.  Establish a DIDComm Messaging connection with their agent using their&nbsp;DID.  Execute higher-level sub-protocols through the DIDComm Messaging connection between your and their&nbsp;agent.  <p>By implementing this approach you will get a modular extendable way of implementing key (and other properties such as Ethereum accounts) rotation, service discovery, securely connecting systems with zero trust and enriching your business workflows with decentralized reputation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/trusted-p2p-messaging-with-dids-didcomm-and-vcs-398f4c3f3cda">Trusted P2P Messaging with DIDs, DIDComm and VCs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Organizations face challenges in scaling <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/2-megatrends-dominate-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2020/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> projects because they lack the requisite skills, collaboration, tooling and know-how to create and manage a robust, production-grade AI pipeline.</p>
<p>Through 2023, Gartner estimates that 50% of IT leaders will struggle to move their AI projects past proof of concept (POC) to a production level of maturity.&nbsp;To reduce this high failure rate, organizations need to build the right roles for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-habits-of-organizations-with-successful-ai/">AI success</a>.</p>
<p>“In many organizations, data scientists are still wearing too many hats due to a dearth of talent across other roles,” said<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/41189"> Arun Chandrasekaran</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner, during his session at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/symposium-spain">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 AI is a team sport 
<p>To successfully operationalize and scale AI initiatives, organizations need to build diverse AI roles and skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“AI is a team sport,” said Chandrasekaran. “On their AI team, CIOs and technology innovation leaders need to have data scientists, data engineers and complement the team with AI architects and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/understand-3-key-types-of-machine-learning/">machine learning (ML)</a> engineers. Together they can envision, build, deploy and operationalize an end-to-end ML/AI pipeline.”</p>
<p>That team should never operate in isolation and should collaborate with business domain experts, IT experts, and other relevant staff and stakeholders to deliver successful AI initiatives.</p>

 Roles of AI architects and ML engineers 
<p>Finding the right resources and how they work together as part of the AI team becomes pivotal for the success of AI projects. Two newer roles are complementing the AI team: AI architects and ML engineers.</p>
<p>The AI architect is laser-focused on the transformational architecture efforts that AI introduces. Their primary responsibility is to orchestrate the deployment and management of models in production and provide inputs on the applicability of ML and deep learning models within AI’s various disciplines, such as natural language processing or image recognition.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz00N2ZiMjJlNTFmNWExMWViYmRlMmRiODA5ZDk5OGE3YQ=="> </a></p>
<p>Because ML is the most utilized AI initiative, organizations are also increasingly hiring ML engineers as part of the AI team. They can move ML solutions in production and optimize the environment for performance and scalability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through 2023, the ML engineer role will be the fastest-growing role in the AI/ML space. Gartner estimates that today there is one ML engineer for every 10 data scientists, and it will likely change to between 5 and 10 by 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“ML engineers need to ensure that AI platforms deliver against technical and business SLA requirements,” said Chandrasekaran. “ML engineers are expected to be the connecting fabric with data scientists from an IT perspective and ensure their ML models run well in production.”</p>

<p>Over the past months Mydex CIC has been <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/">working for the Scottish Government</a> on a strategy for implementing and scaling a system of ‘smart entitlements’ for the citizens of Scotland.</p><p>The Smart Entitlements concept is very simple. Its goal is to create a common, easy approach for citizens to access public services that is consistent across multiple service providers. To achieve this, it provides citizens with the ability to store their personal information in an Attribute (or personal data) Store which they own and control. Using this Attribute Store, citizens are able collect, receive and keep verified data about themselves and subsequently allow its reuse (if relevant) when they seek to access or use other public services.</p><p>Practically speaking, under the proposed system service providers would a) generate a secure electronic tokens that verify facts about a citizen (such as proofs of their address, age, disability or educational qualification), b) provide these tokens to citizens to be held safely in the citizen’s own attribute/personal data store, so that c) citizens can share these tokens with other service providers, under their control, as and when they are&nbsp;needed.</p><p>The benefits could be&nbsp;immense.</p>  Citizens would have to spend much less time and effort trying to find, present and prove information — filling in endless forms — and would also find the process less stressful and yes, sometimes less humiliating.  Organisations could use the process to reduce unnecessary data processing, verification of data entered into forms, all the duplicated effort, and errors that come from forms, enabling them to do more with&nbsp;less.  And the Government itself would benefit from the creation of a safe, efficient, privacy-protecting data sharing infrastructure that would support its inclusive growth and wellbeing agenda, while providing it with the digital capabilities to respond to new situations as they arise — such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  <p>In a separate project we proved that, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">technically speaking, it is indeed feasible</a> for service providers to generate verified attributes and for citizens to store them in an Attribute Store. (A ‘verified attribute’ is any piece of information about a person or performance that has been generated or checked by a responsible trustworthy body and made available to another party in such a manner as to be trustable as a specific attribute.) This approach is already being put into practice <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">in other projects</a> working with groups of organisations serving the same&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>But is such an approach operationally feasible? Could it work at scale? And how to achieve that&nbsp;scale?</p> A roadmap for&nbsp;success <p>The good news is that we have identified a way to achieve all the&nbsp;above.</p><p>It involves some technical things like creating metadata standards to make sure data is machine readable and to ensure clarity about levels of assurance about the data ( including descriptions of how the data was collected, created, protected and verified). But essentially, it boils down to identifying a good place to start (for example, focusing on attributes that are widely used by many services and are easy to mint and share) — and then getting on with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Crucially, it is do-able, now. There are no critical technical, operational or legal obstacles stopping Scottish Government from being able to implement this approach with immediate effect which is why they are able to move ahead with their Beta Phase during&nbsp;2021.</p><p>The details of this approach are laid out <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Smart-Entitlements-Research-Recommendations-and-Report-for-the-Scottish-Government-FINAL.pdf">in this report</a>. But its core features are&nbsp;simple.</p><p>First, Scottish Government agencies, departments and initiatives such as the National Entitlement Card, local authorities, housing associations and the Scottish Qualifications Authority have all the data that’s needed to deliver critical mass. Other bodies and agencies, such as Social Security Scotland, can always add additional data to the system as it grows and matures, as well as accessing verified attributes (with citizens’ permissions) for their own service provision purposes.</p><p>By enabling these agencies and departments to share data via citizens’ Attribute (personal data) Stores, the recommended approach minimises dependencies and maximises agency for the citizen. It can be done, now, by the Scottish Government without needing the permission or cooperation of other bodies. And it enables the Government to independently pursue its own agenda and policies.</p><p>Second, it can be done without major disruption and risk. The recommended strategy does not require any significant changes to existing back office systems that provide attributes or consume them. Instead, it connects these existing systems with a new piece of infrastructure (Attribute Stores) that join the data dots, adding a new layer of capability, flexibility and opportunity as they do&nbsp;so.</p><p>At the same time, it can proceed incrementally, taking one step at a time, so that the risks of big leaps into the unknown are avoided. Instead, it allows for a test-and-learn approach that builds momentum, impact and benefits over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Third, taking this incremental step-by-step approach brings immediate benefits for the uses of data that are initially prioritised while setting the right course for the future. The more service providers, verified data points and citizens that are involved, the more it builds the infrastructure and capabilities needed to bring further benefits. Once this infrastructure and processes have been put in place, an increasing number and range of attributes and attribute providers can be added incrementally, thereby expanding the number of use cases that can be supported and benefits that can be realised.</p><p>Fourth, in doing this, it generates powerful win-wins. All the key stakeholders involved — citizens, service providers and Government — benefit from doing&nbsp;it.</p><p>The Scottish Government is now <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/">launching a Beta Phase</a> to take this initiative to its next steps. The opportunities it presents are&nbsp;huge.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-way-forward-for-personal-data-6251d1503bdd">A Way Forward for Personal Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The world is caught between high expectations, futuristic fears, and non-legally binding recommendations on how to proceed with AI development and management. This means that although technologies are advancing and that many use cases are being proven effective to support enterprise data management, security, interactions with customers, and many more customized solutions per industry, most organizations are hesitant to board the AI train. For many, they do not feel they have enough guidance to launch a future-proof AI project. For the moment, all we have is a growing collection of AI governance frameworks from reputable groups such as the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai/principles/" title="OECD">OECD </a>and the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/640163/EPRS_BRI(2019)640163_EN.pdf" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>. These provide valuable insight into what concepts should be front and center of any AI project and are the precursors to legislation. But better will be when governments and regulators clearly specify what is required for a robust, trustworthy, and human-centric model to be developed and used in a business context.</p>
 Edging Closer to a Regulation 
<p>On October 20th 2020, the European Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20201016IPR89544/parliament-leads-the-way-on-first-set-of-eu-rules-for-artificial-intelligence" title="European Parliament Vote">voted on and accepted</a> recommendations on what should be addressed in a future legislation, the proposal of which is expected in early 2020. <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0186_EN.html#title3" title="Guiding Principles">The guiding principles</a> that were agreed upon are: a human-centric and human-made AI; safety, transparency, and accountability; respect for privacy and data protection.</p>
<p>A risk-assessment that defines different levels of risk caused by an AI system may be used to further regulate high-risk AI technologies. The higher the risk a system poses because of malfunction, malicious action, or because of its intended purpose, the higher the regulatory oversight and responsibility an implementing organization could carry. This is one option that could help facilitate the proposed requirement of human oversight at any time for high-risk AI technologies.</p>
<p>A separate proposal discusses a "<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0178_EN.html" title="Future-oriented Framework">future-oriented civil liability framework</a>" that would clarify and reconsider liability of self-learning algorithms in relation to developers, implementing organizations, and users. The Product Liability Directive (PLD) is one regulation that could serve as a starting point, and eventually be adapted to offer protection regarding digital and AI-based products. The framework that defines liability will have to be extended to include distinctions of frontend and backend operators, both of which would be held liable proportionately to the degree of control that each holds with the model's operation. Overall, liability should be proportionate with a model's risk, which requires clearly defined risk categories that models can be assessed by. Insurance coverage must also adapt, and the proposal suggests that the European Commission work closely with the insurance sector to find policies that offer sufficient protection.</p>
 Learn How to Prepare 
<p>These proposals are promising in that they show movement by the European Parliament, edging closer to a regulation. But these proposals did not have any surprises in them -- they are a natural extension of the European AI governance conversation. AI governance will continue to formalize, and if you want to know how to get started, join KuppingerCole's <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cybernetixworld2020" title="AI Workshop at cybernetix.world 2020">workshop on AI Governance on November 24th at cybernetix.world 2020</a>.</p>

 Dilemma of Smart Wallet and Different Approaches <p>Writer: Xiang&nbsp;Yao</p><p>From Subscribe: Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend</p><p>Hi, friends. It’s been two months since the last update. Yield farming has attracted so much attention and also has a significant impact on the development of Smart Wallets. As I mentioned in the last column, the Smart Wallet operators will stop unrestricted subsidy, and they need to find new approaches for continuous growth. Several means were proposed, such as using targeted subsidy, building a billing system, and finding L2 integration solutions.</p> Response to congestion <p>The good news is many smart wallets are taking positive&nbsp;actions.</p> Gas policy&nbsp;updated   Dharma has ended unrestricted subsidy for all transactions except for specific ones.&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.dharma.io/update-to-dharma-gas-policy/">link</a>  Authereum has asked the new users to pay the deployment fee.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/authereum/gas-policy-update-2-650fc4faf549">link</a>  Argent only pays for security operations.  Dapper will no longer be subsidizing gas for non-Dapper Labs developed games. Some non-core CryptoKitties functions and <a href="https://medium.com/dapperlabs/gas-policy-update-for-dapper-ethereum-117a7474a423">will no longer subsidize</a> gas for the ‘approve’ function on CryptoKitties. <a href="https://support.dapperlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055953573-Gas-Policy-Update-Sept-24-20-">link</a>   Layer 2 solution integrated   Gnosis just released the Safe Multisig on the xdaichain. <a href="https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4552860-how-to-use-the-gnosis-safe-on-xdai-with-metamask">link</a>   New blockchain supported   MYKEY features TRON Network as the third smart contract layer.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/mykey-the-first-smart-wallet-on-tron-starts-a-public-beta-come-to-claim-airdrop-9eea5cd31fa9">link</a>   A new competitor with a low-cost creation&nbsp;feature   Loopring updates optimized the wallet smart contacts reducing the cost of creation. <a href="https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-monthly-update-2020-09-a6c4fae84146">link</a>   What did wallets&nbsp;do? <p>I’ve been keeping an eye on each smart wallets’ development, especially on their response to the high network fee problem. This section will talk about my observation about active smart wallets and thinking in the next section — sort by the number of registered users.</p> Dapper Labs <p>It seems that Dapper Labs is making a concentrated effort to build its public ledger, Flow. However, they still own the most users among all smart wallets, reaching 38,000, and has a stable growth(nearly 40 new users per day) not affected by the congestion. One reason is the contract is quite simple and only spend 135k gas, less than other wallets. Many new users come in most congestion days, such as Sep. 3rd, nearly 150 newcomers signed up to enjoy free transactions.</p><p>However, like other wallets, Dapper cut the subsidies. It only provides limited free transactions for Crypto Kitties, and users need to pay for the transaction pass for other types of transactions.</p> Argent <p>The number of Argent users increased from 20,000 to 30,000 rapidly in only two months starting from June, which seems they can get the first chair over Dapper soon. The unexpected congestion blocked the process. In the beginning, all transactions in the Argent app is free, but the <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/blog/gas-fair-use-policy-update/">“painfully high gas price” cost them $400K only in July</a>. They used three ways to achieve balanced costs and revenues.</p>  Users need to pay for most transactions. The transfer and Dapps’ actions will charge users in ETH, DAI, USDC, BAT, ZRX, WBTC, REP. However, Dapps can offer free gas to Argent users, as Maker&nbsp;does.  Explore Layer 2 solutions. Argent announces that they’re researching Layer 2 opportunities and working with the best team in the space. This would benefit for the high cost of the gas&nbsp;fee.  Introduce commissioned aggregated trade. Argent <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/blog/the-best-way-to-trade/">launched a massive upgrade</a> that users can trade any token pair at the best market rate, earning <a href="https://www.chainnews.com/articles/997517812123.htm">a 0.15% commission fee</a> from each transaction.   MYKEY <p>MYKEY is deployed in multiple public chains based on <a href="https://github.com/mykeylab/keyid-eth-contracts/tree/master/contracts">KEY-ID protocol</a>. On Sep. 9th, it <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/mykey-the-first-smart-wallet-on-tron-starts-a-public-beta-come-to-claim-airdrop-9eea5cd31fa9">features TRON network</a> as the third infrastructure after EOS and Ethereum and reaching 6,000 new users in the first&nbsp;month.</p><p>TRON’s integration makes it cheaper to deposit and withdraw USDT. The cost will be covered by MYKEY relayer, so users enjoy the free transaction.</p> Gnosis <p>Gnosis has a <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-protocol-and-xdai-partnership-1de0e48fb14b">partnership </a>with xdai. As part of the partnership, Gnosis has invested in the xDai Ecosystem Fund to become significant holders of the STAKE Governance token. The xDai chain is an EVM based Ethereum sidechain following Proof-of-Authority consensus.</p><p>After that, Gnosis <a href="https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4552860-how-to-use-the-gnosis-safe-on-xdai-with-metamask">released </a>the Safe Multisig on the xdaichain to provide instant transactions with low network&nbsp;fees.</p> Dharma <p>Dharma is against the trend that in the most congestion period, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dharma_HQ/status/1288853793493250048">subsiding Uniswap trade transactions since July 30</a>. “Never miss a trade. Never pay for gas.” The <a href="https://twitter.com/Dharma_HQ/status/1288853801776984064">slogan</a> ends <a href="https://blog.dharma.io/update-to-dharma-gas-policy/">on Oct 23</a>, defining “Never” as 86&nbsp;days.</p><p>However, the free use of Uniswap brings unexpected trouble. Uniswap airdropped 400 UNI to all users who had been using its product. Unfortunately, Dharma users <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/retroactive-airdrop-excludes-proxy-contract-users-e-g-dharma-matcha-etc/1222">are not eligible to claim UNI token</a> because only addresses which directly called the Uniswap contracts were considered users. 2,833 Dharma users were affected. Dharma carried out a <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-excluded-proxy-contract-airdrop-phase-1/">Retroactive Airdrop proposal</a> to retroactively distributes 400 UNI to 12,619 distinct addresses who interacted with Uniswap via a proxy contract. Now it’s in the <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2">voting&nbsp;stage</a>.</p><p>In the meanwhile, Dharma has updated <a href="https://blog.dharma.io/dharma-2020-q4-roadmap-update/">Q4 Roadmap.</a> The infrastructure is reconfigured, and after that, Dharma is purely a Smart Wallet rather than a DeFi&nbsp;product.</p>  1. Debit Card Deposits will be unavailable for 1–2 weeks while we build out the new feature set mentioned above  2. <a href="https://blog.dharma.io/introducing-the-dtoken/">dTokens</a>are being deprecated permanently as a means of earning yield in&nbsp;Dharma  3. Our Compound integration (aka Yield tab) and P2P payments system are being temporarily retired   Monolith <p>Monolith <a href="https://medium.com/monolith/closing-the-loop-on-defi-with-monolith-c4954339cda1">integrates </a>fiat-to-crypto exchange to close the loop on&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>It seems there’re no new users since June 1st in the <a href="https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/UaFym3IA7e1qZivL9TNqodqzUbf0tPrdOyXdbBRx">DuneAnalytics</a>. However, it’s a feature to avoid high gas fee. Monolith breaks new wallet creation in two steps: first, create accounts when Ethereum gas price is low; second, initialize when the user registers. The initialization spends much lower gas than deployment, enabling Monolith unaffected by high gas price. And I think it’s a good model case for other projects.</p><p>The most important thing for me is <a href="https://twitter.com/TokenBrice/status/1317123330877566976">TokenBrice</a>, the community manager of Monolith, is stepping down. Best wishes to&nbsp;him!</p> Authereum <p>After changing gas policy three times <a href="https://medium.com/authereum/ethereums-rapidly-changing-gas-market-and-sponsored-transactions-on-authereum-70f496f132a9">1</a><a href="https://medium.com/authereum/gas-policy-update-6c320e28558a">2</a><a href="https://medium.com/authereum/gas-policy-update-2-650fc4faf549">3</a>, Authereum announced <a href="https://medium.com/authereum/authereum-is-out-of-beta-bb66be4f75ad">Authereum V1</a>. However, new users need to pay for registration, and the transfer is not free&nbsp;anymore.</p> Loopring <p>Welcome to the show! Loopring wallets are still delivered to beta-testers, so I cannot make a reasonable evaluation. See the <a href="https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-monthly-update-2020-09-a6c4fae84146">post</a> and look forward to the public&nbsp;version.</p> Around the&nbsp;wallets   Snapshot <a href="https://twitter.com/SnapshotLabs/status/1317366931502944257">added support</a> for EIP-1271 so users can vote from a smart contract wallet. However, I failed and got “Wrong Signature Error.” Now the issue is being&nbsp;fixed.  <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/6b15a3da608cb49e271d6f7a9fe8422629bb4c0c/EIPS/eip-3023.md">EIP-3023</a> was proposed to provide a registry for checking if a contract is a user wallet. This can avoid sending mistakes and statistical errors.  Layer 2 solutions based on zkRollup have rapid progress.  Matter Labs and Curve <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/curve-zksync-l2-ethereums-first-user-defined-zk-rollup-smart-contract-5a72c496b350">unveiled </a>a zkSync L2 smart contracts testnet with Curve Finance as the first resident&nbsp;dapp.  Hermez published its <a href="https://blog.hermez.io/the-hermez-white-paper-is-out/">whitepaper</a>.

Also, they spoke out their consideration of <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/the-road-to-l2-interoperability-718ff69ec822">L2 interoperability</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/the-optimistic-rollup-dilemma-c8fc470ca10c">Optimistic Rollup</a>.

What’s the next&nbsp;step? <p>The gas price is quite low now but we’ll never go back. As I mentioned in the last post, we can’t enjoy free transactions on Ethereum anymore, unless…?

 Overview of Smart Wallet Development <p>Writer: Xiang&nbsp;Yao</p><p>From Subscribe: Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend</p> Abstract <p>Smart Wallet is a path to mainstream for the cryptocurrency. Using a smart contract as an account to interact with blockchain in place of using the private key, Smart Wallet makes it easier to use DeFi and various dapps on blockchain for average users. Smart wallets are rapidly emerging on Ethereum since 2017, namely <a href="https://wallet.gnosis.pm/">Gnosis Multisig</a>, <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Gnosis Safe</a>, <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/">Argent</a>, <a href="https://monolith.xyz/">Monolith</a>, <a href="https://mykey.org/">MYKEY</a>, <a href="https://www.dharma.io/">Dharma</a>, <a href="https://www.meetdapper.com/">Dapper</a>, and <a href="https://authereum.com/">Authereum</a>. Nearly 100,000 accounts are created by these smart wallet operators, holding more than billions of dollars. There’s an obvious trend that more Smart Wallets are designed for consumers, which drives the change in the pattern of blockchain account.</p> The Development of Smart Wallet on&nbsp;Ethereum  What is Smart&nbsp;Wallet? <p>Smart Wallet is the user interface and its underlying smart contract-based blockchain account. With well-designed account logic, Smart Wallet brings exciting features.</p> Stage 0: Crypto Entry before Smart&nbsp;Wallet <p>People use crypto wallets to interact with underlying blockchain. It’s a key management tool, a blockchain browser, and a dapp store where to view and use blockchain applications, such as transfer, staking, lending, etc. Currently, people use the custodial wallet or non-custodial wallet. The essential difference between them is who has the full control of the account, or precisely the private&nbsp;key.</p><p>The custodial wallet offers a traditional internet account rather than a blockchain account. User need to trust the custodian. In contrast, a non-custodial wallet gives back full control to the user, but meanwhile the user can’t enjoy the feature as same as internet products, such as account recovery, transfer limit, whitelist, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>That’s why we need Smart Wallet. With a proximity to the experience of Internet products, Smart Wallet is the potential path to realize such tasks using the smart contract.</p> Stage 1: MultiSig, Smart Wallet for Enterprise <p>Smart Wallet is not a new concept since Multisig Wallet is Smart Wallet indeed. Date back to 2015, Gavin Wood made the first implementation[1] of the MultiSig wallet. Since then, Gnosis, BitGo, Mist, DS Group, Parity made their implementation.</p><p>The goal of MultiSig wallets is to enhance security by a smart contract. The assets are owned by the smart contract, requiring multiple parties predefined to agree on transactions before execution. MultiSig wallets can avoid single failure risk of private key&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>Gnosis Multisig, the most widely adopted MultiSig Wallet, has nearly 4,000 users and has stable growth. Most of them are accounts for crypto funds, companies, exchanges, and foundations. Few individual users use MultiSig wallet unless he/she is a hardcore user or has much&nbsp;money.</p> Stage 2: Gasless, Smart Wallet for&nbsp;Customer <p>Smart Wallets for the customer are emerging rapidly in 2019. According to DuneAnalytics, the Smart Wallets for customers are launching one after another. Argent, Monolith, MYKEY, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Dhamar, and Authereum all go live in 2019. The number of users gained in 2019 is nearly 44,000, while in the first five months of 2020, the number of new users achieves 47,000, showing the sound momentum of&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The trend of user growth of Smart Wallets can be seen in the figure&nbsp;below.</p> The difference between the two generations’ Smart&nbsp;Wallets <p>The biggest difference between the 2nd-generation &amp; the 1st-generation Smart Wallet is that all 2nd-generation Smart Wallets adopts meta-transaction to lower barriers for normal people, or we can say the Smart Wallets for customers is a gasless wallet, so the user doesn’t need to care about the transaction fee. There’s a relayer collecting user’s signed transaction and send it to the blockchain. The relayer service is usually provided by the Smart Wallet’s operator; however, it’s a trustless and permissionless service, which means the relayer can’t forge or tamper with the transaction, and everyone can deploy own relayer without authorization.</p><p>The other difference is reflected in account recovery, transfer limit, transaction batch,&nbsp;etc.</p> Brief Comparative Analysis of Mainstream Smart&nbsp;Wallets  Overview <p>What does the Smart Wallet look like? They’re quite different because they’re designed for different demands. Here’s the brief view of the selected Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Features <p>Every Smart Wallet listed here is a well-designed product with features. Each product needs to be described in detail to fully understand its functionality. However, some features are common: account recovery and gas abstraction.</p> Account Recovery <p>Most of the Smart Wallets(except for Monolith, but in the <a href="https://medium.com/monolith/your-monolith-account-is-due-for-an-upgrade-35b1814a01ed">latest blog</a>, they have a plan to upgrade the protocol to realize recovery function. ) support account recovery, which means you can reset your account through other means. This is quite different from traditional crypto wallets. And most of them provide official recovery service, assist the user in recovering the account after authenticating the user by email or bioinformatics.</p> [In addition from Brice’s comment, who’s working for Monolith]  Since day one Monolith provides account recovery, through the seed phrase only the user knows. We do not have a recovery service yet (like Argent's Guardians).  However, since the seed is known to the user, one can at any time take full control over their wallet without needing Monolith app/services using MetaMask and Etherscan:  <a href="https://medium.com/monolith/importing-using-your-monolith-wallet-with-metamask-and-etherscan-a22862283929">https://medium.com/monolith/importing-using-your-monolith-wallet-with-metamask-and-etherscan-a22862283929</a>  Gas Abstraction <p>All the Smart Wallets here use gas abstraction to enable the wallet gasless. And most of them provide limited free use. Outside of the free scene, they use a different way of charging users, such as service fee account, the ticket for transactions, or charge by cost per transaction.</p> Investors <p>Most of the Smart Wallets are being invested by investment institutions, while two of them raise funds through ICO. The total amount of financing reach $100M, but it should be noted the fundraising are is not entirely for the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Security <p>All the smart contracts of the Smart Wallet are audited, and most of them have a bug bounty program. However, the initiatives can increase security, but they cannot fully guarantee it. Here’s the information. What’s more, security is very complicated and needs expertise to understand. Next, I’ll write a feature article to analyze the security of Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Challenge for Smart&nbsp;Wallets  Security Issue <p>Compared to normal wallets, smart contract introduces new risks to Smart Wallets. To prevent from being hacked, the smart contract should be well audited as far as possible. Besides, the admin key risk still exists while the admin key is intended to upgrade the contract or terminate an emergency. Referring to defiwatch’s (<a href="https://defiwatch.net/">https://defiwatch.net/</a> )attempt, an analysis like smartwalletwatch is necessary to make users aware of the&nbsp;risks.</p> Pricing Model <p>Smart Wallets use meta-transaction to enable gasless transaction while the transaction fee is paid by the relayer. However, the relayer needs to charge the user for sustainable development. It’s important to design a sustainable pricing model to lower barriers of using blockchain, such as allowing deposit through&nbsp;fiat.</p> Compatibility <p>Smart Wallets face many compatibility issues, such as compatibility with new token standards, compatibility with web portals, compatibility with off-chain signatures. Fortunately, new protocols like WalletConnect &amp; EIP-1271 enhance compatibility, but there’re still many UX&nbsp;issues.</p> Next Step of Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trends <p>#1 Smart Wallet Weekly. I’ll publish the latest weekly progress of Smart Wallets, including the growth figures, new features, and new cooperation.</p><p>#2 Analysis of Smart Wallet. I’ll publish the in-depth analysis report of the selected Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p><p>#3 Smart Wallet Connect.

<p>Writer: Xiang&nbsp;Yao</p><p>From Subscribe: Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend</p> Background <p>Last week, I published the first <a href="https://smartwallet.substack.com/p/smart-wallet-new-paradigm-for-blockchain">article</a>, which briefly introduces the overview development of Smart Wallets. A critical suspicion on Smart Wallet is that the assets are custodial, which indicates the wallet operator can dispose of the assets. In this article, I will analyze the Smart Wallet’s sovereignty and give some examples of how to control your wallet&nbsp;fully.</p> What is sovereignty? <p>Sovereignty means the user can fully control the account. For EOA, the one who owns the corresponding private key has sovereignty. If the third party holds the private key, the account is custodial. For contract accounts of Smart Wallet, sovereignty is much sophisticated because of the logic of diversity. However, it can be judged from three aspects: (1) What’s the highest authority of the account? (2)Does a designated third party(trustee) have a way to take over the account or freeze the assets? (3)Does the user has a way to send ANY transactions WITHOUT the permission of a third party? (4)Is the account contract upgradable, and is it rejectable?</p> What can a trustee do with the account and&nbsp;assets? <p>Most Smart Wallets enable account recovery and emergency operations via authentication off-chain, which means a designated third party(trustee) can change the owner of the account. The trustee can be the wallet provider, a hardware wallet, a seed phrase on paper that user assigns, such as the other wallet the user owns, families, and trusted friends. Different Smart Wallets grant the trustee(s) different authorities:</p>  Change the owner of the&nbsp;account.  Add a new owner of the&nbsp;account.  Assist in accelerating the security&nbsp;process.  Freeze or restrict the&nbsp;account.  <p>The introduction of a trustee has increased the robustness of the account but also increases the risk of trust. However, the trustee’s authority is restricted and may be canceled, so users still have the highest authority.</p><p>In the contract level, the trustee can be anyone. Still, most products only have a defaulting trustee operated by the wallet provider who authenticates users via email, phone number, and identity documents.</p> What’s the highest authority of the&nbsp;account? <p>The account owner has the highest authority of the account, who can change the state of account arbitrarily and forcibly. Though a trustee has some privileges to change the account owner or freeze it, the account owner can disrupt the flinching behavior and remove the trustee(s). The account owner is a private key or a group of keys with pre-defined logic and may be saved in several&nbsp;forms.</p>  The owner is a private key that is kept offline. — e.g.,&nbsp;MYKEY  The owner is a private key that is kept locally (e.g., in the smartphone) but CANNOT be exported. -e.g., Argent,&nbsp;Dharma  The owner is a private key that is kept locally and can be exported. -e.g.,&nbsp;Monolith  The owner is a private key that is kept on the cloud and can be exported. -e.g., Authereum  The owner is a (k,n) threshold of private keys while some can be exported. e.g., Gnosis,&nbsp;Dapper  <p>All crypto wallets are trying to protect the private key to avoid loss, and Smart Wallets have different methods to reduce the single point&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Of all these products, smart design in MYKEY is what I’m most interested in introducing. MYKEY separates the authority into the administrative authority and operational authority. The admin key has the highest authority but cannot perform normal transactions; thus, it can always be kept offline. With the delay mechanism and the assistance of Emergency Contacts, the compromise of an administrator’s key will still not cause fatal&nbsp;damage.</p> Can I send transactions without the wallet interface? <p>Smart Wallets use meta-transaction to broadcast the transaction. Anyone with a valid signature can send the transaction. Typically, most users use the wallet interface to send transactions that rely on the relayer service by the wallet provider. What if the provider stops relayer service? Smart Wallets give different solutions. For most Smart Wallets, the signing key is the owner key or one of the owner keys. For MYKEY users, the operation key is&nbsp;instead.</p>  The signing key can be exported so users can package transactions without the wallet. e.g., MYKEY, Monolith, Gnosis,&nbsp;Dapper  The signing key cannot be exported, but users can extract raw signatures from the wallet. e.g.,&nbsp;Argent.  The signing key nor the signatures can be exported, so users need to change the key through the trustee(s). e.g.,&nbsp;Dharma  <p>Unlike ordinary wallets, Smart Wallets only sign transactions; the transaction package and broadcast are done by the backend service. Sending transactions without relying on the wallet interface makes it possible to stay liveness when the wallet provider doesn’t work. However, it’s hard to package transactions with etherscan or CLI clients(geth, parity…) for ordinary people, so this only works for the hardcore players. Argent gives a good demonstration for avoiding service interruptions, but there’s still a threshold. Most users are not able to dispose of their&nbsp;assets.</p> What can I do if I don’t want to upgrade the contract? <p>Smart contracts in Ethereum are immutable by default. However, for some scenarios, to add additional features or fix potential vulnerabilities, most projects create upgradeable contracts. Therefore, it threatens the account security.</p><p>Most Smart Wallets have a modular design, and the upgrade means enabling a new module, or enabling a new module and disabling the old one. Enabling or disabling a module needs authentication, but most of the Smart Wallets will force users to upgrade. Otherwise, they cannot use the wallet anymore unless they use the exported owner key to control the&nbsp;account.</p> How to make a perfect&nbsp;upgrade?  What’s a perfect&nbsp;upgrade? <p>The perfect upgrade guarantees trustless, secure, and it’s better with fewer&nbsp;costs.</p> How to make it trustless? <p>Trustless means users are free to choose. In terms of implementation, the upgrade needs authentication, or there’s enough long time for users to migrate to another&nbsp;account.</p> Who can make an&nbsp;upgrade? <p>The contract allows a “privileged user” to approve a new contract. Currently, the “privileged user” is the wallet provider. It can be an EOA or MultiSig account. There are no apparent trends that Smart Wallets will change to DAO governance.</p> Are the users forced to&nbsp;upgrade? <p>By design, users have the right to choose to upgrade or not. There’re two main implementations.</p>  The upgrade is not global, and each user authenticates for an&nbsp;upgrade.  The upgrade is global but has a long enough waiting period, any user with doubt can migrate&nbsp;account.  <p>In reality, users cannot use the wallet without accepting an upgrade in case 1 and may miss the warning notification in case&nbsp;2.</p> Is the upgrade immediately? <p>The upgrade process requires a public notice period so that more users are likely to get informed. The waiting period can be on-chain or off-chain, while the former is more secure, and the latter is more flexible for emergency cases.</p><p>However, most Smart Wallets don’t have a standardized upgrade process. MYKEY has a <a href="https://security.mykey.org/contract-upgrade">webpage</a> to list the upgrade rule and upgrade&nbsp;history.</p> How to make it&nbsp;secure? <p>Secure is the most critical issue for the wallet. A lot of efforts should be made to guarantee the assets are safe. Security audits and bug bounty are common&nbsp;methods.</p> Security Audit <p>The outstanding security institutions are well auditing all Smart Wallets, it’s important to make every planned upgrade well audited before upgrading. Most Smart Wallets hasn’t disclosed every audit reports&nbsp;yet.</p> Bug Bounty <p>It’s essential to put the source code to the examination of more experts, that’s why we need a bug bounty. In June 2020, Open Zeppelin <a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/argent-vulnerability-report/">disclosed a vulnerability</a> of Argent and helped them to fix the vulnerable smart contract. Open Zeppelin gets the reward of High severity, which is up to $25,000. As far as I know, <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/argent-bug-bounty/">Argent</a>, <a href="https://hackerone.com/monolith">Monolith</a>, <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/tagged/bug-bounty">Gnosis</a>, <a href="https://security.mykey.org/bug-bounty-program">MYKEY</a>, and <a href="https://support.authereum.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043760793-Does-Authereum-have-a-bug-bounty-program-">Authereum</a> have their bug bounty programs.</p> How to make it&nbsp;cheaper? <p>The cost of the upgrade is a less-discussed issue. In case the upgrade is global, then it’s not a problem. However, if the upgrade needs every user’s agreement, meaning that it needs 1 billion additional transactions for 1 billion users’ upgrade. Is it reasonable and practical? Is rollup technology helpful with&nbsp;that?</p> How to fully control a Smart Wallet&nbsp;account? <p>No operating manuals will be given to let you “escape from” your Smart Wallets. I just want to point out the direction and key points. Not all Smart Wallets are listed&nbsp;below.</p> Argent <p>It’s important to own a guardian by yourself, in case you lost your phone, and the official guardian doesn’t work. You can use <a href="https://security.argent.xyz/">https://security.argent.xyz/</a> to do so. Metamask, Ledger Nano, and Trezor are supported presently.</p> MYKEY <p>Always keep safe of your recovery phrase(the admin key), in case MYKEY doesn’t work properly, follow the <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/nirvana-plan-for-better-protect-users-assets-c80cac231ad">Nirvana Plan</a>, and use the <a href="https://github.com/mykeylab/mykey-tx-tool">tools</a> to control your accounts.</p> MONOLITH <p>Take care of your seed phrase, and read this&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/monolith/your-monolith-account-is-due-for-an-upgrade-35b1814a01ed?source=collection_home---2------2-----------------------">article</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>Most Smart Wallets guarantee sovereignty while there’s still much room for improvement. In the normal state, users can take control of their identity and property. Extra attention needs to be paid to the upgrade process. Smart Wallets can provide a more transparent and standardized upgrade to ensure trustless and&nbsp;secure.</p> About Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend <p>Smart Wallet Trend is a newsletter where you can find news, insights and fresh ideas about Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p><p>My name is Yao Xiang, currently a researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab.</p><p>Feel free to contact me via comment or <a href="mailto:freeyao@mykey.org">send 📧email</a> to me directly.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/how-to-get-sovereignty-of-your-smart-wallet-f256674cb751">How to get sovereignty of your Smart Wallet?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab">MYKEY Lab</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Throughout the world, cloud deployments are experiencing unprecedented growth. By now, enterprises are well aware of the cost savings and operational efficiencies gained by moving workloads to the cloud. In turn, cloud providers have improved their uptime and reliability. What has made this journey possible for many organizations, especially large enterprises, is the adoption of DevOps.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

 When regulation, new tech, and public opinion&nbsp;converge <p>On May 25, enforcement begins under the European Union’s General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). This long-awaited regulation attempts to put the genie of digital personal data back in the proverbial bottle. Web companies were the first to realize the potential goldmine that is user data and began building businesses around it, attracting users and profits through a model of free services that generate data to sell or consumers to target. ~20 years into this model, public opinion and law-makers have realized the huge costs we’re suffering by letting people be turned into the product. Data breaches and abuses are perhaps the most visible, but huge inefficiencies and massive power in the hands of a few internet monopolies may be just as impactful.</p>From Larry Diar <a href="https://diar.co/volume-2-issue-17/">https://diar.co/volume-2-issue-17/</a><p>Many businesses are scrambling to meet the new compliance standards. It’s a sweeping regulation that impacts any business operating in the EU, collecting data from EU citizens, or doing any business in the EU, so the impact is global. Interested observers are waiting to see how some of the more vague language will be interpreted and how aggressively regulators will pursue potentially massive fines (up to 4% of a company’s global revenue). Meanwhile, a few are pondering a very different set of questions: how do regulations built for Web2 complement the new models we are building for&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>New cryptographic and decentralized technologies — most notably blockchains — have the potential to build data privacy into the core of digital systems. Developed while the GDPR and similar regimes were being drafted, the spirit of the technology and regulations are kindred: more control in users’ hands, more responsibility required of 2nd and 3rd parties. But it’s unclear in ways how the ‘letter of the law’ will apply to this new technology.</p><p>Thinking about how these simultaneous legal and technological changes, and shifts in social expectations, interact is key to planning for a more privacy-preserving future. While there are a few apparent incompatibilities — for example, the right to be forgotten on an immutable ledger — good design principles that help all parties make informed decisions can let these operate well together. Regulations and new technology that aim for ‘privacy by design,’ along with mounting public pressure for good data controls, can combine to usher in a new age of data privacy and user-control.</p> Private protections via public&nbsp;ledgers <p>Blockchains like Ethereum are public ledgers: they store pieces of data on a shared system that anyone can access, and nobody can delete. One of the things this enables is a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/magazine/beyond-the-bitcoin-bubble.html">‘identity layer’ for the Internet</a>, giving users control of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>This would change the dynamics of digital interactions, likely altering the currently popular model of collecting and monetizing vast amounts of consumer data — the practice that led to regulations like GDPR. This new dynamic is now possible because decentralized technologies can let us build a decentralized consensus around who somebody is, rather than relying on centrally built and managed silos like Facebook or governments.</p><p>There’s an irony to using a public ledger to enable and protect private data. If personal data were put on Ethereum, that data would be permanently public for all to see and use. That is, of course, not what we’re doing at 3Box. As detailed in our <a href="https://medium.com/uport/privacy-preserving-identity-system-for-ethereum-dapps-a3352d1a93e8">approach to privacy-preserving identity</a>, this new system relies on a public ledger but minimizes what data is actually put&nbsp;there.</p><p>All that needs to be stored on-chain is decentralized identifier (DID), which is just a random string of characters. It’s currently not explicit whether these addresses will be classified as personal information under GDPR. Some precedent and the treatment of IP addresses suggests it may, at least in some cases. However, the DID itself tells nothing about the user: it is simply a random public address that a user claims control of through a private key in order to interact with others via a decentralized identity.</p><p>The personal data associated with a DID is controlled privately by the user. This data can be stored on private servers and encrypted so nobody but the user has access, can be pseudonymous so even when the user shares it doesn’t tie to their identity, and can be deleted anytime the user chooses. The only thing public is coded ‘pointers’ between the users DID and servers where the information is&nbsp;stored.</p><p>Multiple keys are used so that even pseudonymous identities can’t be correlated. In 3Box’s system, a user can have many keys linked to a given identity and many identities, giving many ways to manage sharing or pseudonymity.</p><p>This combination does require <a href="https://medium.com/@lyricalpolymath/web3-design-principles-f21db2f240c1">thoughtful design </a>to help users, who act as their own data controller. Personal data does not need to be stored publicly — but it certainly can be. Many products, proposals, and open source projects would enable users write personal data to a blockchain if they chose to, and once this is done it cannot be undone. While we cannot control what’s possible in a world of open-source software, we can help developers and users <a href="https://medium.com/uport/different-approaches-to-ethereum-identity-standards-a09488347c87">make good decisions</a>. GDPR does not really anticipate situations in which the user is their own controller, and their own legal obligations to themselves.</p><p>Done right, users never have to disclose their personal data publicly and get all the benefits of an immutable, user-controlled transaction history. As one example of the flaws of today’s system: <a href="https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/ftc-credit-report-mistakes-1270.php">21% of credit reports have erroneous data in them. </a>Immutable transaction records would enable proof of origination to prevent this (and the billions of dollars spent each year on identity resolution, with companies trading user data back and forth), while not requiring that users ever disclose their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>This system isn’t just more secure, it can be more private and far more powerful. Not just for users, but for businesses too: it will make it possible for companies to deliver the same or richer user experience without the risk &amp; cost of holding customer&nbsp;data.</p> Adoption through value, not just compliance &amp;&nbsp;tech <p>It’s great that the EU is taking serious steps to curb data abuses, and GDPR may have a significant impact on corporate responsibility. It’s doubtful it will lead to wholesale shift in how data is treated today, with it primarily in the control of organizations. And while public opinion seems to be shifting to demand more security and privacy, convenience and complacency still reign in many&nbsp;cases.</p><p>To shift Web3 to a user-centric model, with data truly in the hands of users, will require something more: value. The new model and technologies we are creating ultimately need to show their worth not through ethics and laws but through products and services that give people and organizations obvious value. And while we have work to do, our model will provide enormous reasons for identities of all types to&nbsp;adopt:</p>  Save users from identity theft and data breaches (Equifax alone cost an estimated $4bn) and protect organizations against cybercrime, estimated to be $<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/12/10/2017-roundup-of-internet-of-things-forecasts/#771dd60c1480">6tn </a>by&nbsp;2021  Give consumers a route to some of the $100bn+ that Facebook &amp; Google collect in ad revenue, and businesses a more effective way to discover and serve their highest value customers  Make large data sets &amp; rich customer histories available to startups, reducing barriers to competition  Give users infinitely granular <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_eurobarometer_240615_en.pdf">control </a>over their devices, accounts, relationships, and digital&nbsp;services  Reduce the 83% of adults who worry about identity theft, and the 40% who lose a password every&nbsp;week  <p>The GDPR in Europe may lead to some huge steps in curbing data breaches and giving users more control. It remains to be seen how regulators will treat public ledgers, a relatively new and unconsidered technology, but we’re confident they are complementary. The identity models being built on blockchain tech can not only enable the privacy and security the law aims for, but can drive widespread adoption of data rights and protections well beyond what the regulation calls&nbsp;for.</p> Join the conversation in the <a href="http://chat.3box.io">3Box discord community</a>.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/3box/entering-the-age-of-data-privacy-7c3451ed3a57">Entering the age of data privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/3box">3Box</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>At 3Box we live and breathe identity, and while GDPR and data abuses like Facebook’s may be concerning, they have also brought some welcome attention to the issues of digital privacy and data control. As we push ahead to a self-sovereign future, I wanted to share how I think of the 3 parts of identity in our increasingly digital, interwoven society.</p> 1. Reducible identifier <p>Identity as a concept is difficult — even scholars in the field can’t agree on a definition. They do agree, though, that identity for each of us is not singular and static but rather plural and dynamic. Who we are changes over time and contexts. However, we as people and societies and institutions need something concrete to pick me out from the crowd of others, even others who may share my same name. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153">Seeing Like a State </a>James Scott calls this ‘legibility.’ When we get past local communities and the Dunbar number, we need to make society understandable. We reduce things to lists and bits of information, and one of the must fundamental bits of information is who we&nbsp;are.</p><p>We need a legible, concrete, reducible identity. This leads to passports, social security numbers, and other root identifiers from the physical world. Much of the work in the identity industry is around verifying and authenticating who somebody is in this regard, whether through knowledge questions, facial or bio metric scan, or proof that they know a password or hold a private&nbsp;key.</p> 2. Contextual identification <p>While reducible identification is critical to anyone trying to keep track of a group, it doesn’t actually tell us much about the person who has been identified. Context about that reducible identity gives orientation to who the person (or otherwise) actually is. Traditionally this may include where somebody lives (driver’s license), who their parents are, what tribe (including nationalities, teams, gangs, political affiliations, religion, etc) they are a part of, or who their employer is — anything you might fill out on a test or census form. More recently, this would include a person’s social graph (Facebook friends, LI contacts) and location&nbsp;data.</p><p>This may be static or dynamic information, but it’s not ephemeral — it roots them in time and space. As we move to a more digital-first world, and hopefully soon <a href="https://medium.com/uport/entering-the-age-of-data-privacy-7c3451ed3a57">a self-sovereign world</a>, we talk often of capturing this contextual information as ‘attestations’ or ‘<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/">verifiable claims</a>’ to our root (reducible) identity, giving us a way to bring all the context about us together in a powerful, private, verifiable (trusted) way.</p> 3. Dynamic&nbsp;identity <p>A reducible identifier and contextual identification provide a way to differentiate each other, to verify who somebody is and know some categorical details about them. But they do not tell you who somebody is. The richness of our identity is captured in the multitude of behaviors, preferences, relationships, interactions, histories and even thoughts. Only here can true identity — the plural, dynamic identity — be seen. One persons preferences and behaviors may contradict each other over time, and often do, so this cannot be captured in a reducible and ‘verifiable’ context. It is only captured when our goal is to understand who somebody is deeply, rather than pick them out from a crowd of&nbsp;others.</p><p>In today’s world, data reflecting who we are is being generated and captured constantly. With much of our lives online and in our phones, and sensors cheap enough to put on everything, nearly all our interactions with the external world can be turned into digital data. In fact, our internal ‘data’ — health, mood, biological patterns is now logged as well. This is infamously captured and monetized by Facebook and others, but it is also incredibly powerful. If <a href="http://uport.me">put in control of users and creators of data</a>, we can build a world that lets us use this rich data to truly understand the people around us far better than ever before, and as far more than bits of reducible and contextual information.</p><p>In fact, with rich, full identity data, we could understand our dynamic selves far better than previous identity construct have allowed us. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310">Homo Deus</a> Yuval Harari envisions a breakdown of the singular ‘self’ into a multitude of biological signals and patterns and interactions, changing the very notion of identity — perhaps an indication of why this concept proves so hard to nail&nbsp;down.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/3box/the-3-parts-of-identity-in-a-dynamic-world-f94724c2bae9">The 3 parts of identity in a dynamic world</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/3box">3Box</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The machine learning deployment, integration, and release pipeline is unique and unlike any typical software, application or detection life cycle. A SOC has a blend of infrastructure, team dynamics, disparate logs and data sets, a SEIM, ticketing systems and a need for analytics to better serve and improve their defenses, cyber security posture and incident response. Proper implementation of using machine learning for cyber security defenses can be done with both team and engineering integrations. This talk will walk through an example of machine learning implementation for the SOC in an enterprise environment with lessons learned and best practices.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_10_lodge"></a>

  <p>Experts define Operational Technology (OT) as&nbsp;«hardware and software that detects or causes a change, through the direct monitoring and/or control of industrial equipment, assets, processes and events.»</p>
<p>OT differs from IT, in terms of functionalities, the culture of operators and threats. In recent months, we witness an increasing convergence of IT and OT systems.&nbsp;This area is a novel and rapidly expanding one for both cybercrime and industry.&nbsp;Recent IBM’s 2020 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index summarizes that attacks targeting operational technology (OT) infrastructure increased by over 2000 per cent in 2019 compared to the previous year.&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these trends: it is the digital accelerant of the decade and accelerated companies’ digital transformations by approximately a global average of 6 years.</p>
<p>For example, one of the impacts of COVID-19 –at least until a vaccine is discovered– is the reduction of on-site staff. In the case of OT systems, this put a strain on the already limited resources and required an increase in external connectivity. The result is the numerous industrial plants exposed to, for example, ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a bird-fly point of view, IT and OT are still missing a holistic approach that includes cybersecurity, physical security and cyber-physical security, an integrated cyber-risk estimation and governance models able to span across IT and OT domains. Overall the primary need concentrates around as reconciliation of IT Security (typically built on Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability paradigm) with OT Cybersecurity (which fundamental properties are instead Safety-Reliability-Productivity).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status of IT and OT security</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long term impacts of the pandemic on the digital transformation agenda of industry</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main challenges and trends for the IT and OT security</p>

  <p>Cyber resilience, a term often heard but never fully understood, has made headlines for many years. Nonetheless, we are still confronted with ransomware attacks that lead to the standstill of organizations, as evidenced in the 2017 Maersk attack or the declared state of emergency by the mayor of the city of New Orleans in December 2019 after the city was hit by a cyberattack.</p>
<p>Many organizations perceive cyber resilience as yet another regulatory topic to be addressed by the IT department or the IT security teams, ignoring the regulatory requirements deriving from stakeholders such as the European Central Bank, or the need to interlink cyber preparedness with business continuity efforts and the much-needed support not only by the business departments but also the C-suite.<br>All this stems from an incomplete understanding of cyber resilience and what added value it can offer to an organization. The presentation aims to close this knowledge gap by highlighting key regulatory requirements, and how these can be addressed in coordination with key decision-makers. It will also provide insights into future regulatory developments with a specific view on the EU legislation. The presentation will also talk about testing approaches for cyber resilience, such as the TIBER-EU (Threat Intelligence-Based Ethical Red Teaming for the European Union) framework.</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<p>1) After completing this session, the participant will be able to refer to relevant CR regulations and put them into context and everyday use and to understand expectations from the FS regulators.<br>2) After completing this session, the participant will have knowledge about how CR is applied in other FS organizations, and what tools and methods exist to assess CR readiness.<br>3) After completing this session, the participant will be able to discuss key CR topics with senior management to promote the importance of CR, and to make a business case for it.<br>4) After completing this session, the participant will be able to refer to available resources on the internet to deepen his/her knowledge of CR.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_10_minkmar"></a>

  <p>You likely have an identity governance and administration (IGA) solution in place to address data privacy and regulatory requirements. “Identity governance” refers to identity needs like&nbsp; access request approvals and certifying user access levels, and “administration” refers to the back-end user account provisioning processes in place to meet those needs. In this blog, we’ll look at the requirements that have driven the adoption of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance and administration</a>, how the changing identity landscape is posing challenges for legacy IGA solutions, and how modern IGA approaches fill those gaps.</p>

 Why You Need an Identity Governance and Administration Solution 

<p>You have to manage user access requirements, ensure compliance with an ever-increasing number of regulations, protect your organizational data and intellectual property, and maintain a seamless customer experience across multiple devices. IGA solutions have evolved over the years to address this broad set of needs.</p>

<p>A robust identity governance and administration solution should enable the certification of appropriate user access levels and allow you to govern that access with policy-based controls. Additionally, it should enable your security and compliance teams to handle access requests, access approvals, and role administration. An effective IGA solution should also help your organization achieve regulatory compliance.</p>

 IGA Landscape Challenges&nbsp; 

<p>You’ve likely had your existing identity governance and administration solution in place for a long time, and you’ve seen the identity landscape change drastically around it. Accelerating changes in enterprise technologies, cyberthreats, and the user landscape are putting growing pressure on traditional IGA solutions and, in turn, on your security and compliance teams.</p>

<p>The identity landscape today encompasses a growing number and type of users, accounts, devices, applications, and systems. Applications and systems are no longer just on-premises. They live in a dizzying hybrid of on-premises, cloud, and SaaS environments – and your users, encompassing your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">consumers</a>, and partners, access them from many different devices and networks. On top of these complexities, you’re protecting your data and users against an increasing number of internal and external threats while the number of compliance regulations mounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You’re left with a critical question: Can your IGA solution keep up?&nbsp;</p>

  Identity Silos Leave you with Poor Visibility<br>Enterprise IT environments become more complex every year, increasing the number of applications and systems you provide user access to. Most legacy identity governance solutions don’t connect and manage all applications, especially with systems living in a hybrid of on-premises and cloud environments. Combined with your user identity information scattered across multiple identity silos, this can lead to poor enterprise user access visibility, a lack of context, and an inability to recommend appropriate access privileges, like entitlements and role assignments. It’s difficult to secure identities, user access and maintain compliance when you don’t have – and can’t achieve – complete visibility. 
	 Compliance Becomes Challenging<br>Your IGA solution should enable you to understand who has access to what, but with fragmented visibility, your security and compliance teams don’t have the information needed to be compliant with the increasing number of regulations. Longstanding regulations like the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a> (HIPAA) and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3763">Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)</a> have been joined by new legislation like <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) and the <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a>, are increasing the pressure on your security and compliance teams. Breaching these regulations comes at a high cost. Noncompliance with SOX can cost organizations up to $25 million in fines as well as criminal or civil prosecution. It’s estimated that <a href="https://dataprivacymanager.net/5-biggest-gdpr-fines-so-far-2020/">$192 million</a> in GDPR violations have been levied against companies since the legislation went into effect.&nbsp; 
	 Resources are Exhausted <br>Identity governance solutions are expected to work across multiple siloed environments with tens of millions of access privileges spread across legacy and modern applications on both on-premise and cloud environments. Automation is critical to preventing your teams from over provisioning or granting inappropriate access privileges. Unfortunately, many legacy systems can’t be automated, resulting in an overflow of access requests for your team. Requests that require manual, human reviews and fulfillment. 
 <p>The shortcomings of existing&nbsp; IGA solutions can lead to identity governance fatigue and leave your organization more vulnerable. When considering a new, modern IGA solution, here are a few best practices to look for:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  AI-Driven IGA Solution - A modern identity lifecycle management solution that simplifies and automates the access request, access approval, certification and role modeling processes. By leveraging an AI-driven analytics engine, the solution identifies and applies appropriate user access, automates high-confidence access approvals, recommends low risk accounts for certification, re-certifies high-risk accounts, and automates the removal of unnecessary roles.&nbsp; 
 <p>A solution that automates access and governance controls to more easily manage the demands of today’s dynamic workforce throughout the entire users’ lifecycle.</p>

  Data Agnostic - A solution that does not include data bias, a data model that reflects the entire user access landscape. A solution that provides the ability to contextually examine all identity-related data, identify and recommend the right level of user access rights via high, medium, and low confident scores while providing the ability to apply appropriate birthright and or leaver user access rights to accounts, applications, systems, roles, and entitlements across the enterprise.&nbsp; 
 <p>A solution that reduces overall request volumes by predicting appropriate user access at the right time, to the right resources.&nbsp;</p>

  Extensible Data Model - A solution with a highly scalable identity model for managing all users, devices, and things. A solution that enables data aggregation from diverse identity authoritative sources combined with an identity relationship model. A data visualization model that automatically identifies contextual relationships across users, devices, and things.&nbsp; 
 <p>A solution that automates identity orchestration and automation across <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a>, identity governance, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity management</a> via AI-based remediation recommendations.&nbsp;</p>

Biometric solutions are our best&nbsp;answer. <p>The ways in which employees access corporate systems have changed dramatically. The shift to remote working, alongside the sheer volume of devices being used to access private networks, must be the wake-up call to reevaluate and modernize security strategies.</p><p>The security perimeter has shifted from the office to user end-points, and now finally to the end-user itself and their identity.

   Zero trust and IAM from the cloud as the foundation of hybrid IT must be simple 
<p>Most companies today rely on a hybrid IT infrastructure: Existing on-premise solutions are extended with flexible best-of-breed SaaS solutions. This improves flexibility and agility, but also increases the scope for cyber attacks due to the growing number of digital identities. For example, the Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report 2020 showed that attack patterns that target end-users - such as phishing and the use of stolen credentials - lead the attack rankings again. With obvious numerical sequences and the multiple use of passwords, consumers - employees as well as customers - also make it easy for attackers. These new broadened IT infrastructures, which are becoming more and more complex due to numerous identities and new devices - keyword "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) - require a new security concept: Zero-Trust.</p>
 What is Zero Trust? 
<p>The idea behind Zero-Trust is simple: Never trust, always verify. In concrete terms, this means that every access to the corporate network - whether by a user, a device or an application - must be constantly verified depending on various factors. Companies should therefore be able to answer the following question at any time and ideally in real-time: Who is allowed to log on to which service via which device at which time and how, and what (un)critical content can be accessed?</p>
 Answer the "trust question" automatically 
<p>To answer this question, risk-based access decisions involving both the user and the device in use are automatically made using machine learning. For example, users can be secured using Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication (AMFA), which typically involves entering a password followed by a choice of various other factors. For devices, the system checks whether the device is a managed, registered device and also includes location factors. Among other things, the combination of user and device checks results in a risk score that decides on access.</p>
<p>In order to make these complex decisions automatically in real-time, a central control point (access proxy) is required as a core component of the zero-trust architecture. The more data this control point has at its disposal and the more systems and information from third-party solutions are integrated, the better risk scores it can determine, make decisions based on policies and provide secure access to systems and data quickly.</p>
<p>For example, Okta has an extensive integration network with more than 6,500 pre-built integrations, including Proofpoint, which among others provides anti-phishing software to analyze email traffic. By integrating with Proofpoint Okta can incorporate information to determine the risk score, including denying access to victims of phishing attacks and Very Attacked Persons (VAPs) or allowing access only based on very strong multi-factor authentication.</p>
 Easy is Right – for admins and users 
<p>IT security solutions are often circumvented or levered out whenever possible if they are not simple and intuitive. For example, if a customer fails to change his or her password and is no longer able to access a shopping account, customers often choose another provider with a simpler user experience to make purchases. But also a well-intentioned high password complexity can have a negative impact on both experience and security. When a 15-character alphanumeric, case-sensitive password with special characters is required and which must be changed each quarter, passwords are often written down in one or more places. The attempt to improve security then turns into the opposite. This is why the guiding principle for identity and access management (IAM) is easy but secure is right.</p>
 An identity platform for B2E, B2C and B2B from the cloud 
<p>In the past, often different platforms were used for workforce and customer IAM. However, this means at least twice the complexity, twice the effort to integrate and build policies, and a loss of control due to too many identity providers (IdPs), which further increases the attack surface.</p>
<p>A single directory as a central access system that integrates all systems and applications provides IT managers with the foundation for centralized access management and the ability to implement SSO and multi-factor authentication (MFA) across the board. Furthermore, workflows can be defined according to the most diverse B2E/B2B/B2C use cases with little or no additional programming effort, i.e. low code and no code. This means, for example, that it is possible to define what should happen in certain login scenarios: sending a welcome message, registering and verifying as a user or making an entry in the central CRM database or trigger a process to verify the identity e.g. by validating their national ID cards.</p>
<p>A central cloud-based service (IDaaS) simplifies and accelerates implementation and integration time, enables IT teams to assign access securely and quickly, shortens time-to-market and value, and offers high and flexible scalability and short response times to constantly changing requirements.</p>
 The following applies to the user experience: The simpler, the better 
<p>The success and acceptance of security solutions depend on user experience (UX). With cloud-based IAM, MFA and single sign-on, IT security is perhaps for the first time in a position where an increase in security goes hand in hand with an increase in convenience. Users no longer need to have countless passwords on screen and update them regularly; simple user interfaces and the use of biometrics and apps for verification contribute to an uncomplicated and secure log-in experience.</p>
<p>In addition, by linking access authorization to risk scores and context factors such as location or criticality of resources, Okta enables the authentication chain to be adapted for the best possible user experience: If, for example, a validated user is located within a secure corporate network and uses a registered, trusted device, he or she can gain access to non-critical resources under clearly defined rules without having to authenticate at all - simply and securely.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>In a world where everything has to move faster and faster, security and user experience are becoming the most important criteria for whether consumers trust a solution or use a service, and thus determine the long-term success of organizations in the digital space. Zero-trust concepts paired with identity and access management help companies to realize IT security and UX as a powerful combination.</p>

<p>Munich / Hamburg, November 11th, 2020 – CRIFBÜRGEL and IDnow (www.idnow.io), a leading provider of Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions, announce their cooperation in the field of digital onboarding.</p>
<p>With the growing demand for digital identification, IDnow and CRIFBÜRGEL are taking the next step together towards a simple, fast and fully digital onboarding. CRIFBÜRGEL is now integrating IDnow’s solutions into its PHYON onboarding platform to offer customers a seamless, simple process. IDnow’s identification methods perfectly complement the innovative concept of CRIFBÜRGEL’s new platform: a media break and the time required for verification in physical channels is often seen as a reason for a purchase to be aborted. Therefore CRIFBÜRGEL and IDnow now offer a new solution for the eGaming and Gambling industry as well as for insurance, finance and other transactions with high security requirements.</p>
<p>“We are very much looking forward to working with CRIFBÜRGEL and supporting their platform with our digital verification solutions. Completely digital processes are absolutely essential and complete a portfolio like CRIFBÜRGEL’s. Digital identification not only increases conversion rates for companies and saves costs, but above all is a key factor for end customer satisfaction,” says Sebastian Bärhold, Co-Founder Business Development at IDnow.</p>
<p>“Companies appreciate our advanced solutions for customer identification and credit assessment. With our comprehensive digital onboarding offer, we help them to make customer travel as pleasant as possible. Media disruptions are prevented, cancellation rates are reduced and thus revenues are increased. By cooperating with IDnow, we can offer our customers another important component in the identification process,” says Dr. Frank Schlein, Managing Director at CRIFBÜRGEL.</p>

<p>The efficiency case for the roll out of digital identities has been well established, with evidence emerging from countries across geographies over recent years i ii iii. However, the need for digital identities today extends beyond, becoming a near-necessity to keep public services functioning uninterrupted with prolonged periods of social distancing forced by COVID. Digital identities can enable E-Government services which are accessible remotely and 24×7. This was on display in the United Kingdom’s with the GOV.UK Verify digital identity platform. The first month of lockdown in March 2020 triggered a 10% rise in the number new digital identities being created  to remotely file Universal Credit claims at the start of the lockdown in March 2020  [1] . This helped deliver crucial financial support to ensure that thousands of citizens could access vital services in the midst of the crisis.</p>



<p> The GOV.UK Verify program has not been without its issues. Adoption rates have fallen well short of the 25 million users by 2020 target.  Having taken a private sector led approach, the low adoption and usage rates have forced 3 out of 5 identity providers (IdPs) to stop supporting the solution due to concerns regarding its profitability  [2] . Rolling out a successful digital identity program is a commitment for the long haul and it may seem that the short-term financial pressures faced by private actors may make them unsuited to perform the role of IdPs in cases where uptake falls short of expectations. While the private sector IdP model has seen huge success in the Nordic region, with near universal digital identity coverage, this approach has been met with mixed results in other geographies  [3]. Industry projections now suggest that the pandemic might just have tipped the balance in favour of a government issued digital identity model iv. </p>



<p>Irrespective of the model adopted by a country, one thing is for certain; digital identities are expected to see significant growth in the coming years, laying the foundation for the next wave of E-Government innovation. But the proliferation of digital identities is not an end in itself, empowering citizens is. It is thus highly pertinent to deliberate extensively on what constitutes good digital identity.  As a digital identity solutions provider, we look to global projects and emerging technology trends to inform our own product decisions. Along the way, we have adopted the following design principles to place the interests of our users (the citizens) at the forefront. </p>



<p>Privacy
by Design</p>



<p>Given the sensitive nature of digital identity and the extent of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) involved, public trust in a solution is paramount. At the core of this is ensuring that the solution is designed with citizen privacy as a priority. Procivis has been guided by the values of the Self-Sovereign Identity and Blockchain movements that leverage cryptographic techniques to ensure user control and sovereignty over their PII v. In line with this, every new feature must tick the following boxes; consent &amp; choice, purpose legitimacy &amp; specification, collection limitation and data minimization. </p>



<p>Offering
high-value use cases </p>



<p>While government issued digital identities have been around for nearly two decades, one of the primary factors setting apart successful programs from others, is access to services that citizens value. Beyond offering the primary functionality of authenticating yourself in the digital realm, cases from around the world have shown that adoption is strongly correlated with the availability of services with high-transaction frequencies. One such service is the provision of legally binding digital signatures. In Estonia, digital signatures have all but replaced wet signatures, with over 200 million digital signatures being submitted every year by a population of 1.3 million people [4]. Other use cases that have encouraged adoption include services that permit citizens to receive and manage official documents, certificates and licenses digitally. Brazil and Argentina have seen significant adoption of digital identity wallets since permitting citizens to store their driver’s licenses and vehicle documents on their smartphones. These are amongst the cases which have informed the development of our first three core features – eAuthentication, eSignatures and eDocuments. </p>



<p>Seamless
user-experience</p>



<p>It
is not just enough to provide access to vital services; it is also important
that the user-experience for a citizen is intuitive and seamless. For instance,
a number of countries introduced smart cards, which permit citizens to
authenticate and sign documents electronically. However, several of these
processes relied on also possessing a card reader, which proved prohibitively
complex and impeded adoption. Smartphone based digital identities address this
issue by relying on commodity hardware and familiar user journeys. Furthermore,
a number of government digital services suffer from being digitized in
fragments. For example, in Switzerland a number of official documents can be
ordered on a government portal, but the payment processes are separate,
requiring that citizens make a wire transfer after receiving an invoice. In the
Canton of Schaffhausen, we combine ePayments with eAuthentication and
eDocuments on a mobile app, permitting citizens to go through the process of
ordering, paying for via credit card and receiving their official documents all
in one seamless flow. </p>



<p>Interoperability
to build an ecosystem of services</p>



<p>As highlighted above, the true value of a digital identity lies in the access to services that it can enable. It is thus vital that solutions rely on open standards that make it easy for third parties (public and private sector) to integrate digital identities into their processes. The financial sector is one industry that finds immense value in leveraging a trusted digital identity. In Denmark for instance, out of the 70 million monthly transactions, 40 million were used for banking transactions.&nbsp;However, a government-issued identity forms the trusted foundation of a digital society and can find applications in quarters far broader than initially envisioned. </p>

<p>v Procivis’ digital identity solutions deployed in the Swiss Canton of Schaffhausen does not use blockchain technology. &nbsp;Decentralized identifier (DID) standards are still in development and have thus been determined to lack the maturity for deployment in a production environment. The solution however is guided by the principles of decentralization which keeps citizens in control of their personal data.</p>

<p>Decentralized identity has matured as foundations, working groups, and consortiums emerged to align standards across companies. However it has diverged significantly from the early days when it was closely aligned with the Ethereum developer community. We see potential to accelerate global impact on underserved populations by bringing these communities together. If there is something you want to build at the intersection of decentralized identity &amp; crypto, we’d love to hear from you.</p><p>Email: isaac@bloom.co | team@bloom.co</p><p>Telegram: @IsaacPatka</p> <p>This is the blog post version of the talk I gave on October 30 at the EthOnline impact event</p><p>"Decentralize it with smart contracts" could have been the theme of the crypto space in 2017 and 2018. Lending, trading, derivatives, credit bureaus, and identity were all being coded in Solidity and deployed on Ethereum testnets. Some efforts have worked, some have fizzled, and some have branched off in different directions.</p><p>Decentralized Identity is a prime example of an effort from the early days of Ethereum that has matured significantly, but independently of the rest of the crypto space.</p><p>The true value of Decentralized Identity is the ability to identify everyone, even where data is lacking. Hundreds of millions of people globally are excluded from traditional identification systems. Institutions see these individuals as high risk, and expensive to onboard. Unique, localized dynamics for credit and fraud further add to the problems of financial exclusion.</p> They don't need on-chain identities <p>While these individuals are perfect candidates to be onboarded directly into an adaptive and decentralized approach to identity, they don't need on-chain identities - yet. The key detail here is that smart contracts don't solve any problems that these individuals face.</p><p>Problem 1: How do we uniquely identify individuals, when they might not be registered with any government systems, or are in a market where government identifiers are frequently stolen &amp; impersonated?</p><p>Solution: We can uniquely identify people with a public-key infrastructure.</p><p>Problem 2: How do we source data to strengthen individual identities where data is lacking?</p><p>Solution: We can leverage traditional and alternative data sources, as well as environmental data, such as P2P relationships and everyday interactions. We can associate this data with public keys associated with individuals.</p><p>Problem 3: How do we ensure Decentralized Identity complies with emerging legal frameworks for privacy &amp; personal information?</p><p>Solution: We don't store any identifiable information on chain, even at the direct request of a user.

  <p>Digital leaders tend to think of digital transformation and acceleration in terms of technologies, business outcomes, process changes and their impact on people. But they often overlook the massive disruption that kind of transformation generates for leadership — and the enormous impact they can have on the success or failure of their organization’s digital transformation.</p>
<p>Those who are most successful exhibit seven standout characteristics. Kasey Panetta, Senior Content Marketing Manager at Gartner, sits down with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/12240/Mary-Mesaglio">Mary Mesaglio</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, to discuss the seven traits of these highly successful digital leaders and why it’s so important that they be curious about new things, understand the difference between creativity and innovation, and never consider digital to be the outcome.</p>
 Listen to interview 
<p>For the full interview, listen to the podcast below or read the transcript that follows, which has been edited for clarity and length.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37663"]</p>
 No. 1: Digital leaders are neophiliacs 
<p>Neophilia is a term for people who are naturally attracted to newness. Neophiliacs are always ready to explore new situations, tend to be more open to making and embracing new opportunities, and are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-digital-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming-in-the-next-5-years/">curious about new ideas</a>.</p>
<p>There are downsides to being a neophiliac, but it's necessary for digital leadership because the rate of obsolescence and the rate of change in the information technology field are not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">Why Now Is the Time to Accelerate Digital</a></p>
 No. 2: Digital leaders invent, but also copy 
<p>This trait requires leaders to pick areas to innovate while also borrowing from other areas. Digital leaders are very selective about where they invent, which is generally in areas where they want to be better than everybody else. But they're also excellent about copying because they are not trying to invent everywhere.</p>
<p>Digital leaders are clear on where they need to be exponentially better and where they can copy, since that's not the reason people buy from the organization. It’s <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/avoid-these-9-corporate-digital-business-transformation-mistakes/">not effective to dabble</a> in a lot of innovation efforts. Instead, leaders should be very clear in the areas it’s okay to copy.</p>
 No. 3: Digital leaders eschew industry boundaries 
<p>It can be a trap to consider the organization’s point of view, innovation possibilities, business model or digital transformation based on industry point of view. Many high-performing digital leaders, like Facebook, Amazon and Google, aren’t concerned with what industry they're in. Rather, they're concerned with what gap they can fill for customers. Their customer is at the center of what they do, not traditional industry boundaries.</p>
<p>Industry delineations like “financial services” can be unhelpful in determining new opportunities because they focus on what’s there, rather than what’s not there. The best innovation opportunities are often in the space between existing stuff. An industry lens does not help with filling that space with interesting new offerings. But a customer-needs view might.</p>
 No. 4: Digital leaders appreciate that innovation is more than just creativity 
<p>There is this notion that innovation and creativity are interchangeable, so if you have people with great ideas, boom, you get innovation. In reality, creativity is just one of five behaviors that you need to bring innovation to market. Creativity will generate the ideas, but you also need a challenging behavior to question, “Why would we do this? Is this really useful? Would someone buy this from us?”</p>
<p>Alongside challenging behavior, you’ll need collaboration to pull together disparate parts of the business and various disciplines. The fourth behavior is construction, which is the actual building part. Finally, you need people who will commercialize this innovation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does digital help you get to your destination? Because digital is not a destination</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To truly innovate and bring something to market, you’ll need all five of these behaviors, not just creativity. It’s important to audit your team and make sure you have skill sets in each area. It’s easy to overrepresent certain behaviors.</p>
<p>For example, during COVID-19 you might end up with more challenging behavior because people are simply fatigued, or your team might be great at coming up with a concept, and terrible at actually selling it on the market. Identify the gaps and pull in teams to fill them.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/digital-workplace-trends-you-cant-ignore/">Digital Workplace Trends You Can’t Ignore</a></p>
 No. 5: Digital leaders build teams with high AQ 
<p>Intelligence quotient (IQ) and emotional quotient (EQ) are fairly well known, but fewer leaders measure the adversity quotient (AQ). AQ measures human resilience and the capacity to come back from being dealt a blow. High AQ lends itself to better employee retention that is critical for digital leadership, because the nature of digital transformation often disrupts the way people work by breaking rules and overturning old assumptions.</p>
<p>To increase their resilience in high-pressure situations, high-performance athletes are often coached to visualize the positive and the negative “What would it feel like to bite the gold?” But also, what are some of the things that could happen to throw me off my game? What if the lineup is broken up, or I get a splinter in my foot the day before? It’s envisioning all potential obstacles and “practicing how I might come back from those” that can help with resilience.</p>
<p>Build AQ by introducing a little bit of unexpectedness or coaching and exploring different challenges and changes. Give people tools to deal with obstacles so that they're not thrown off their game entirely when things don't happen exactly according to plan. This trait is more important than ever because resilience is what we need to sustain us through the long, chronic phase of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
 No. 6: Digital leaders never consider digital to be the outcome 
<p>Digital is just a tool, it is just a means to an end. Nobody digitalizes just to be digital, just as nobody transforms just to transform. Be sure to clearly define and articulate the reason for digitalizing. If you digitalize without that kind of extra-clear hard-edged goal, you can end up in bad places.</p>
<p>For example, lots of people don't like online grocery shopping because they like browsing the shelves or they find it annoying to have to click on every single item or they want to be surprised by something they hadn't thought of and impulse buy.</p>
<p>To protect against “doing digital” just for the sake of being digital, consider what you’re trying to optimize or what are the desired outcomes. Maybe you want to make more money or increase margins or improve transparency or make things more secure. Does digital help you get to your destination? Because digital is not a destination.</p>
 No. 7: Digital leaders geek out on technology and so do their people 
<p>This is an often-underrated trait. Digital leaders actually do need to know a lot about technology to be able to evaluate where the opportunities lie. This is especially important when understanding what AI or other technologies can offer you or the possible impacts on the organization. However, it's not just leaders who should embrace their inner geek, but also their people.</p>
<p>Consider asking employees what they do with their free time. Perhaps they are doing something cool with Raspberry Pi or maybe someone else regularly writes a technology blog on their own time, and they've never mentioned it in a corporate or a professional environment. This might surface interesting responses, especially for younger employees who may have more free time, that might be useful for digital initiatives.</p>

 The GiD Report#134 — DOJ challenges Visa/Plaid, SSI is “hot&nbsp;stuff” <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-133-for-big-tech-it-doesnt-matter-who-wins-the-election-unless-you-re-facebook-c5e8d2dda9cc">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we’ve got this&nbsp;week:</p>  DOJ challenges Visa/Plaid acquisition  Wired’s overview of Biden administration on&nbsp;tech  Privacy’s continued prominence from Prop 24 to Tim Berners-Lee  Digital identity’s billion-dollar valuation  Harvard: self-sovereign identity is “hot&nbsp;stuff”  Paul’s Convenient Decentralization Theory  Stuff happens   1. There’s been a large focus on Big Tech antitrust but the DOJ’s lawsuit challenging Visa’s planned acquisition of Plaid shows that antitrust sentiment applies universally. Photo: cottonbro (pexels)<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visa-s-planned-acquisition-of-plaid-11604591434?mod=hp_lead_pos4">the WSJ</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>The department brought the case in a Northern California federal court, alleging the deal would eliminate the nascent but significant competitive threat that Plaid poses to Visa in the online debit market. The acquisition would allow Visa to unlawfully maintain a monopoly in online debit, leading to higher prices, less innovation and higher entry barriers for online debit services, the department alleged.</blockquote><blockquote>“If allowed to proceed, the acquisition would deprive American merchants and consumers of this innovative alternative to Visa,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the department’s antitrust chief.</blockquote><blockquote>“American consumers and business owners increasingly buy and sell goods and services online, and Visa — a monopolist in online debit service — has extracted billions of dollars from those transactions,” Mr. Delrahim&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>A Visa spokesman said the lawsuit is “legally flawed and contradicted by the facts…The combination of Visa and Plaid will deliver substantial benefits for consumers seeking access to a broader range of financial-related services, and Visa intends to defend the transaction vigorously.”</blockquote><p>Greg’s thoughts:</p><blockquote>The Justice Department is finally beginning to understand how the game is&nbsp;played.</blockquote><p>And here’s Dan&nbsp;Primack:</p><blockquote>Thought bubble: DOJ claims that Visa is already a “monopolist,” as evidenced by Mastercard’s alleged inability to capture more than 25% of the online debt services market. But it also argues that Plaid is poised to threaten Visa, thus raising some doubt as to how strong Visa’s stranglehold really is in the first&nbsp;place.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand: DOJ obtained communications from a top Visa executive who said that Plaid “threatens Visa” in terms of debut, analogizing it to an underwater volcano that has explosive potential despite being barely&nbsp;visible.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visa-s-planned-acquisition-of-plaid-11604591434?mod=hp_lead_pos4">Justice Department Files Antitrust Lawsuit Challenging Visa’s Planned Acquisition of&nbsp;Plaid</a>  Tim Wu: <a href="https://superwuster.medium.com/reviewing-ben-thompsons-stratechery-45b545dd959">Reviewing Ben Thompson’s Stratechery</a>   2. As we noted the other week, regardless of who wins the U.S presidential election, issues concerning antitrust, privacy, Section 230 reform, moderation/misinformation will remain top of mind for policymakers. <p>Wired has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-broke-internet-can-joe-biden-fix-it/">a good overview of what that will look like under a Biden administration</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>).</p><p>Here’s the scoring&nbsp;system:</p><blockquote>Because it’s been a long week, I’ve scored them from one Joe-Biden-eating-ice-cream (not happening) to five JBEICs (bank on&nbsp;it).</blockquote><p>On antitrust (5&nbsp;JBEICs):</p><blockquote>So whether we’ll see bold, aggressive, consequential antitrust enforcement and rulemaking against Big Tech during the Biden administration, or just modest, incremental, possibly-doomed-in-the-courts stuff, is still up in the air. What’s for sure is that we’ll see something. Antitrust gets five out of five&nbsp;JBEICs.</blockquote><p>Privacy law only gets 2 JBEICs given a divided government:</p><blockquote>On the other hand, it’s Congress, it’s a very complicated topic with a ton of money on the line, and it’s Mitch McConnell with a Democratic president, so we shouldn’t get our hopes up too high. But a federal privacy law next year is still a possibility. I give it two out of five&nbsp;JBEICs.</blockquote><p>Expect adjustments to Section 230 but not fundamental reform (3&nbsp;JBEICs):</p><blockquote>However, there’s another category of legislation concerning Section 230 that is much more viable. I think of these as Section 230 “hook” bills, because they try to hook Section 230 onto other legislative goals. The best example of this is the EARN IT Act, introduced by Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republican Lindsey Graham. The law would force companies to “earn” their Section 230 protections by submitting to an elaborate regime meant to make sure they aren’t facilitating the spread of child sexual abuse materials. Other bills similarly would condition Section 230 immunity on some other set of criteria that may have little to do with the underlying point of law. So while fundamental reform is probably off the table, we could see edits to Section 230 at the margins.

Even if Wired downplays the chances of national privacy legislation, privacy will continue to be a big focus for local governments, businesses, and most importantly, users. <p>Indeed, California successfully passed Proposition 24, which aimed to close some loopholes from California’s original 2018 privacy legislation.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/one-clear-message-voters-election-more-privacy/">Wired</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>):</p><blockquote>Companies have many ways of profiting from collecting and accessing our data. Few involve money directly exchanging hands in a sale. The law approved Tuesday targets the companies once able to evade regulation by claiming they “share” but don’t “sell” data. CPRA combines the concepts of sharing, selling, and monetizing data. It requires companies to disclose what they’re collecting from users and with whom they’re selling or sharing the data, and it requires them to allow users to opt out of having their data collected, whether or not it’s “sold” in the literal&nbsp;sense.</blockquote><blockquote>CPRA creates a new category of Sensitive Personal Information (SPI), including race, sexuality, religion, and health data. Businesses must disclose to users if they plan to collect, share, or sell SPI. Once informed, users can prevent companies from sharing SPI. It also allocates $10 million to a new California Privacy Protection Agency that will enforce the&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, the language of the 2018 law left the door open for companies to require users to opt out of tracking from each site they visit rather than end tracking with one swoop. CPRA allows users to employ a global opt-out, such as a Do Not Track tool, but also to allow tracking selectively.</blockquote><p>Privacy as a value proposition also continues to build momentum on the business side of things. Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee just signed on some huge clients for his latest privacy project including the BBC, the NHS, and NatWest&nbsp;Bank.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/tim-berners-lee-attracts-nhs-bbc-natwest-to-inrupts-solid-platform.html">CNBC</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>):</p><blockquote>Inrupt, founded by Berners-Lee and CEO John Bruce in 2018, is aiming to develop technology that gives people control of their data, allowing them to choose where their data is stored and who has access to&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>The start-up announced Monday that it had launched an enterprise version of its Solid platform. Built with scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Solid allows users to create Personal Online Data Stores, or Pods, that they can then share with third party-apps if they&nbsp;wish.</blockquote><blockquote>Bruce <a href="https://inrupt.com/enterprise-server-release">wrote in a blog</a> that the NHS, for example, was using the platform to allow patients to store their personal medical data on Pods, as well as data from health apps on their phone or other&nbsp;devices.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s going to drive groundbreaking new opportunities that not only restore trust in data but also enhance our lives,” claimed Berners-Lee, who is Inrupt’s chief technology officer.</blockquote><p>We’ve talked about TBL’s project in the past and what really stands out is how spiritually aligned it is with the work we’re doing here at GlobaliD.

And digital identity will continue to gain prominence in the new Web. Now the market is starting to price in just how valuable that proposition is. <p>For instance, Stripe-backed Fast just notched a billion-dollar valuation. Here’s Fast CEO Domm Holland on digital identity:</p><blockquote>E-commerce was projected to be $5 or $6 trillion this year, and that was pre-COVID. And we all know that COVID has done nothing but amplify e-commerce. It grew by 30% quarter-over-quarter recently. So if we just won checkout, that’s already an incredibly large business. But really, there’s so much more value we can unlock with consumers and we definitely want to be providing more. I think that conviction spurs us on. But we’re never ever going to drive that value for consumers if we don’t execute on checkout first. For the time being, sure, we’re competing with fintechs. And it will always be a core part of our business. But if we become the identity network, you can’t quantify what that would be&nbsp;worth.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/fast-a-startup-backed-by-stripe-discusses-billion-dollar-valuation">Fast, a Startup Backed by Stripe, Discusses Billion-Dollar Valuation</a>  <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fast-checkout">Fast has a plan to reinvent online shopping.

Of course, the movement around self-sovereign identity takes that one step further. And according to Harvard, it’s “hot stuff”right now. <p>Here’s <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">the Harvard&nbsp;blog</a>:</p><blockquote>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is hot stuff. Look it up and see how many results you get. As of today, I get 627,000 on Google. By that measure alone, SSI is the biggest thing in the VRM development world. Nothing I know has more promise to give individuals leverage for dealing with the organizations of the world, especially in business.</blockquote><p>Also Harvard:</p><blockquote>The easiest tool to imagine is a wallet, or a wallet app (here’s one) with some kind of dashboard.</blockquote><p>It’s understandable then why Civic is <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-secure-identity-is-now-civic-wallet/">phasing out it’s identity app and merging it into its wallet</a>.

Speaking of decentralized identity, Paul wrote a neat piece on what he calls The Convenient Decentralization Theory. <p>Here’s <a href="https://pstav.medium.com/the-convenient-decentralization-theory-aece8ef2f31c">Paul</a>:</p><blockquote>In todays world, money, data, and identity largely live in a federated world, meaning that certain powers hold the vast majority of this information in silos. But just as the movement from “harvested ice” and “plant ice” in the early 1900s to refrigerators in the 1930s brought on unimaginable benefits and autonomy to people and businesses, so too I’d say the convenient decentralization theory&nbsp;applies.</blockquote><blockquote>The bitcoin movement, which has been taking off long before COVID, is moreso in the spotlight due to monetary policy concerns exacerbated by the epidemic. It’s brought to light just how easy it one day could be to create protocols for decentralized solutions and allow people to be more autonomous with their money and&nbsp;value.</blockquote><blockquote>The same ethos and technologies that apply to the bitcoin movement can apply to the data we generate online and the way we hold our digital identities. In short, web 3.0 and the ethos it brings will usher in a world where online trust will be re-imagined through decentralized online identities, the way our data is stored and monetized will be decentralized and yield direct payments to individuals, and the way we exchange and create value will be significantly easier than it is today (especially for the underbanked). Can you imagine the goodness that will come out of these movements? We’ve just but scratched the&nbsp;surface.</blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a>— <a href="https://pstav.medium.com/the-convenient-decentralization-theory-aece8ef2f31c">The Convenient Decentralization Theory</a></p> 7.

<p>Back in March 2019 Ubisecure’s Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) service, <a href="https://rapidlei.com/">RapidLEI</a>, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/profileaddress-legal-entity-identifier/">announced a partnership</a> with Austria-based data marketing specialist, ProfileAddress. Under its ‘<a href="https://www.register-lei.com/">Register-LEI</a>‘ brand, ProfileAddress joined RapidLEI’s Registration Agent (RA) programme as an RA for Austria, Germany and the UK. From 2020, Register-LEI’s services have been offered in additional markets, and it has become a global RA.</p>
<p>I caught up with CEO Michael Fux to discuss the current state of the LEI world and his vision for the future of Register-LEI.</p>
 Francesca: Let’s start at the beginning. Why did ProfileAddress decide to get started offering LEIs to its customers? 
<p></p>
<p>Michael: In 2017, a friend of mine who was working with a private bank in Liechtenstein mentioned problems with the registration of an LEI for his private wealth clients. We then set out to solve these problems. At first we applied to the GLEIF [Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation] as an LOU [Local Operating Unit], but quickly realised the advantages of working with RapidLEI as our LOU instead and focused on our quality of service and customer support as a RapidLEI Registration Agent.</p>
 F: And of course I have to ask, why did you choose – and continue to choose – RapidLEI as your LOU? 
<p>M: The choice was and is easy to make. Register-LEI stands for high-quality service based on state-of-the-art technical implementations. RapidLEI offers exactly that. Further, we aim to offer our customers excellent support and can ourselves rely on the support of the RapidLEI team. Finally, we both continually look for improvement to all services to ensure the highest standards of customer care.</p>
 F: What impact do you think the current global situation has had on LEIs? 
<p>M: In some countries, including Austria, you can benefit from tax advantages by investing in securities. However, this is subject to a positive annual result, which may be a problem in times of crisis. In those countries the rate of newly issued LEIs may drop. On the other hand, fresh money is being pumped into the economy to support it, which can lead to devaluation and inflation. This effect can be compensated for by buying stocks, and for that we need the LEI system and safe trading.</p>
 F: Do you foresee any trends for LEIs looking into 2021 and beyond? 
<p>M: The number of registered LEIs will generally grow. The rate of increase will depend on the situation in the individual market. However, the focus should also be on ensuring lapsed LEIs are renewed, so that organisations do not find themselves unable to trade at critical times [due to an invalid LEI and relevant regulations].</p>
 F: What’s next for Register-LEI? 
<p>M: Right now we are teaming up with KSV1870 (“Kreditschutzverband est. 1870”, one of Austria’s leading economic platforms with innovative, digital solutions) with the aim to become market leaders in Austria next year.

<p>There’s a saying – “You can put lipstick on a pig but it’s still a pig.”</p>
      
<p>Well, you can put the word “passwordless” on a password, but it’s still a password.</p>
      
<p>This might be the strangest thing I’ve seen in 2020. Passwordless products that support password-based multi-factor authentication (MFA).&nbsp; </p>
      
<p>If that’s conceptually difficult to understand, you’re not alone. Our customers don’t quite get it either. At a high level it looks something like this:</p>
      

      
<p>Basically, in these scenarios a password-based authentication is used as the front door gateway into a user experience managed by a passwordless platform. I know that sounds confusing. Stay with me.</p>
      
<p>The general idea is that “passwordless platform” acts as a middleware between a multi-factor mobile authenticator app, the user’s workstation, and the identity &amp; application layers. On the back-end, there may also be a password rotation mechanism for increased security. Rather than providing a proprietary <a href="https://www.hypr.com/app">mobile app that provides passwordless MFA</a>, the “platform” functions as more of an abstraction layer behind the login experience. </p>
      
<p>This gives the end-user a choice in which mobile app they can use alongside a password to log into their workstation, while also removing the requirement of a separate mobile authenticator.</p>
      
  
      
<p>Giving the user more choice over their preferred authentication method is great but it is unclear to me what the value this is supposed to provides for an enterprise. What’s wrong with this approach?</p>
      
<p>You are still using passwords<br>The fundamental flaw with this methodology is that it does not eliminate the use of passwords. The end-users still need to remember a password. The applications still rely on password-based authentication. The back-end is still storing passwords. I’m not sure this can even be called a “passwordless” initiative.</p>
      
<p>You now have another password tool to manage<br>As if the identity management stack wasn’t complicated enough, the addition of an orchestration layer to oversee 3rd party MFA products introduces yet another tool you need to use. I’ve seen passwordless products positioned as a “superior policy management layer” that gives enterprises more control over the login experience. But how is that eliminating the password? And why is a separate product required to do this? Could the admin just use the policy management systems already built into their existing identity provider?</p>
      
<p>You slow down your passwordless initiatives<br>I would bet that this approach actually slows down a company’s passwordless initiative. If you are not providing a mobile app for users to login without a password, and you’re keeping passwords enabled at the front door, what expectation is there to go passwordless? There really is no incentive for the end-user to stop using their existing authentication methods.</p>
      
<p>You spend twice as much on MFA<br>Buying a passwordless platform and marrying it to a legacy MFA app delivers none of the benefits of password elimination, while maintaining all of the password costs.</p>
      
<p>If you’ve come this far and are still confused… it’s okay. So am I. We’ve talked about <a href="https://www.hypr.com/comparing-passwordless-marketing-passwordless-mfa/">the many differences between passwordless marketing and passwordless MFA</a> – but this topic creates a whole new level of messaging confusion. I’m not sure this approach can be called passwordless by any measure. It seems like a more complicated way to use password-based multi-factor authentication. </p>
      
<p>In fact it reminds me of a Rube Goldberg machine:</p>
      
 

 
      
<p></p>
      
 What Passwordless Authentication should look like: 
      

      
<p>At HYPR we believe that <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-authentication/">True Passwordless MFA</a> should happen end-to-end. From the user’s mobile device, to their workstation, all the way up to the identity and application layers – passwords can and should be eliminated at every step of the way. It’s that simple. </p>
      
<p>You can put lipstick on a password. But at the end of the day, it’s still a password. </p>

  <p>When COVID-19 changed how the world did business, organizations shifted into survival mode and pushed for a focus on digital products. As businesses <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-digital-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming-in-the-next-5-years/">shifted tactics</a>, customers made it clear that not only did they like the shift to digital, they’d prefer to stay there for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seventy-six percent of CIOs reported increased demand for new<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/"> digital products</a> and services as a result of COVID-19 and 83% expect that to increase further in 2021, according to the Gartner CIO Agenda 2021. Along the same line, 65% of CIOs saw an increase in the use of self-service by customers/citizens, and 79% expect that usage to grow in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is especially true among top-performing organizations, with nine out of 10 pursuing <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/digital-workplace-trends-you-cant-ignore/">digital channels</a> and nearly 75% introducing new digital products faster. And it seems to be working. Organizations that increased their use of digital channels to reach customers or citizens are 3.5 times more likely to be top performers than trailing ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These changes allow organizations to maintain and develop deeper relationships with established customers at a time when new customers are tough to find. More digital products and services or self-service avenues encourage established customers to spend more, despite a lack of in-person touchpoints. These digital avenues will also enable organizations to extend sales and service hours without requiring more staff.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>COVID-19 might dominate the headlines, but it’s just one of eight key macro factors that will reshape business in this decade. The global pandemic will have long-lasting and far-reaching impact on the business world, but other shifts in macrobusiness environment areas — such as systematic mistrust, weakening international relationships and climate change — have not gone away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-functional-leaders-should-know-about-scenario-planning/">Executives </a>will have to grapple with a host of other challenges during the 2020s, but from that maelstrom will rise new business opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic arrived at a time when economies were already on the edge,” said<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18594/Mark-Raskino"> Mark Raskino</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/symposium-spain">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>. “A decade-long boom, generated substantially from inexpensive finance and lower-cost energy, led to structural stresses such as highly leveraged debt, crumbling international alliances and bubble-like asset prices. These were overdue for a reckoning.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 No. 1: Global pandemic&nbsp; 
<p>The impact of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">COVID-19 </a>will depend heavily on how long the pandemic lasts. A shorter time frame means that people will revert more quickly to pre-pandemic ways of operating. For example, after 9/11, people reverted to normal flying behavior three years later. If the pandemic persists, it’s more likely to have long-lasting societal effects. For example, the Great Depression impacted food habits for decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about how the pandemic will affect societal behaviors like personal hygiene and personal space norms, social gatherings and family interactions, the savings ratio and consumer buying habits.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 2: Market crash and recession&nbsp; 
<p>Although COVID-19 served as the visible catalyst for the 2020 market crashes and subsequent recovery, the reality is that the markets were already fragile and precarious. In fact, Gartner found that in 2018 and 2019, half of CEOs were anticipating and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/use-this-3-phase-framework-to-navigate-the-covid-19-downturn/">preparing for an economic downturn</a>, which makes this recession unique to those in 2002–2003 and 2009. However, no one anticipated the deep damage caused by COVID-19, with a crash followed by persistent volatility.</p>
<p>Look to exploit remote work and e-commerce for better infrastructure and target requisitions to accelerate the digital business journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 No. 3: Systemic mistrust&nbsp; 
<p>Even before COVID-19, global consumer and citizen trust was at an all-time low. Now, closed borders, fights for vaccines, and arguments over masks and rules, combined with a mistrust of “other”— even previously close trading partners — threaten to widen the gap. However, it’s possible that over the long term, a common enemy in the virus will inspire empathy, common purpose and cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, executives should consider whether consumers will continue to be loyal to long-standing brands or shift to those that have supplies of limited goods. CEOs had to make difficult decisions in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Evaluate whether those actions irrevocably shifted attitudes toward the brand. A more personal connection — such as an open, authentic and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-proactive-customer-experience-in-the-midst-of-covid-19/">empathetic email to customers</a> — might help overcome distrust.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 4: Weak productivity&nbsp; 
<p>Slow productivity growth and a lack of focus on efficiency and productivity has been at odds with the economic growth of the past decade. COVID-19 further reduced productivity by complicating business operations. The cost of operating in a socially distanced world is increasing costs, requiring significant reengineering to return to pre-COVID productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set bold goals for productivity that necessitate reinvention.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 5: Environment concerns&nbsp; 
<p>At the very start of 2020, climate change was moving to the forefront of framing long-term business strategy and plans. Although temporarily overshadowed by COVID-19, half of CEOs still see climate change as a factor impacting their industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by temporary environmental wins caused by lockdowns and reduced travel, although you can look to these outcomes for inspiration on how to adjust work permanently. Keep in mind that major infrastructure projects designed to mitigate climate change could be delayed in some geographies by a redirection of funding to stimulus packages, requiring alternative carbon reducing strategies to be invented.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 6: Talent shortage&nbsp; 
<p>Despite an increase in unemployment rates globally, key talent shortages will continue to plague executives. While COVID-19 has increased unemployment and underemployment, it has not created <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lack-of-skills-threatens-digital-transformation/">new pools of in-demand talent</a>. Even small shortfalls of critical talent will corrode or destroy market positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reconsider what types of skill sets will be needed in the post-COVID-19 world, and begin or increase reskilling programs during downtimes. Introduce agile learning as a core management philosophy and consider ways to widen the talent availability pool by rethinking remote work or gig economy options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-the-workforce-you-need-post-covid-19/">Build the Workforce You Need Post-COVID-19</a></p>
 No. 7: Technology advancement 
<p>Technology advancement will, of course, have a large effect in the coming decade. AI, blockchain, quantum computing and the mass arrival of machine customers will change how organizations and societies operate. There will be more frequent market disruptions and the emergence of what comes after digital: Autonomous business. This will change the landscape of the decade.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>ForgeRockers are a passionate and powerful crew! We showed what we can do to make a difference in our communities during our recent Global Action Week where we took time out of our regular schedules to give back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Employees across the globe put on their masks and ventured out into their communities to clean up parks and schools, feed the hungry, mentor, volunteer at animal sanctuaries, advocate for STEM programs in schools, or support the elderly. The pandemic meant a course correction for some of our ideas, but together we logged more than 200 volunteer hours service worldwide over the course of five days.&nbsp;</p>

 ForgeRockers Give Back&nbsp; 

<p>“While this year has been a tough one for everyone, we recognized that it was more important to our employees than ever to give back to the communities, organizations and initiatives that meant the most to them. I am extremely proud of the CSR team’s ability to react to the changing environment and still host a dynamic and rewarding Global Action Week that has empowered so many ForgeRock employees to take action and make a difference.” - Ben Hutchings, CSR Lead &amp; People Program Manager</p>

<p>"I hiked about 42km in the Lake District over three days carrying everything we needed for the trip in our backpacks. During the hike I used the app Charity Miles to raise over $500 for a global organization called Girl Up. I chose Girl Up, as they are a movement to advance girls' skills, rights, and opportunities to be leaders. As someone who identifies as female within both the STEM industry, and hiking community - both areas where female representation is the minority - this is an important cause I feel particularly close with.” - Becky Maund, Senior Support Engineer</p>

<p>“I spent the day volunteering at Odd Man Inn Animal Refuge in Washougal, WA. They are a nonprofit farm sanctuary, adoption shelter, and wildlife rehab center. Odd Man Inn has a special place in my heart for taking in abused animals that have no other place to go. I had the pleasure of making sure all of the animals were happy, healthy, comfortable, and felt safe and right at home by cleaning their living quarters, passing out meals, and providing pets with the love and pampering they deserve.” - Krismy Botkin, Software Engineer</p>

<p>“I took a two man canoe down to the Bristol Harbour and taped some bin bags to the front seat of my canoe, and with the power of oars and a small net I paddled across the harbour cleaning rubbish from the water. Being in the center of the city, it can often fall prey to people mistaking the river for a garbage bin. This is a shame because there is actually a lot of wildlife on and under the water. By the end, I was tired but extremely satisfied with the amount of refuse I had collected. It's something I'd definitely do again.” - George Knight, HR Technology &amp; Data Manager</p>

<p>“A few coworkers and I spent the morning cleaning up Dolores Park in San Francisco. Many San Francisco residents don’t have yards or gardens, so public parks become our refuge when we want to (safely) get some fresh air. A lot of work goes into maintaining these spaces, and I felt that it was important to give back to the place that has helped my mental and physical health during this time.” - Greta Sohn, Content Marketing Manager</p>

 ForgeRock Learns 

<p>In addition to actively giving back to their communities, ForgeRockers also participated in a speaker series. Throughout the week, we hosted four virtual discussions. We learned about busting the mental health stigma from Tara Robinson from <a href="https://changesbristol.org.uk/">Changes Bristol</a>. We also spoke with <a href="https://www.tiffanydawson.co/">Tiffany Dawson</a> about how to promote gender equality in STEM. Felisia Castaneda from <a href="https://www.recology.com/recology-san-francisco/">Recology San Francisco</a> taught us how we can all make small changes that impact the environment. And we closed out the week with a powerful discussion about racism and DE&amp;I with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinwithane/">Kevin Withane</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 550 Hours Dedicated&nbsp; 

<p>By the end of the week, we had spent more than 200 hours volunteering and more than 300 combined hours learning. Global Action Week is a terrific extension of our purpose as a company to help people access the connected world - safely and simply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m so proud of our collective efforts and can’t wait to see what we accomplish next year!&nbsp;</p>

			<p>In the last article we looked at <a href="https://tokeny.com/opportunities-and-challenges-in-private-markets/">the opportunities and challenges in private markets</a>. In this article we assess whether blockchain technology could answer these challenges and spawn a new era for the private market industry.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology is now recognized as a suitable infrastructure to issue, transfer and manage securities across capital markets. Immutable and programmable, blockchain based solutions provide a resilient and highly transferable infrastructure and one that is accessible for private market players. Essentially, for market participants to unlock the benefits of this new technology they need to be aware of two innovations:</p>
 A NEW INFRASTRUCTURE 
<p>Blockchain technology has created a new method of transferring value that has challenged and will continue to challenge the traditional makeup of financial markets. By tokenizing assets, many of the typical, low-value and expensive operations can be automated in security offerings. This innovation essentially allows the transfer of value from one party to another in a more secure and efficient way than is seen in traditional capital markets.</p>
<p>More specifically, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), the concept of a financial ecosystem living digitally on a distributed infrastructure, has been booming in 2020. 12 This innovation has largely been developed on the Ethereum network and has been used to drive participating parties to lend and borrow through DeFi protocols. For the moment, the usage and activity surge has been driven by holders of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, who have dealt directly with DeFi protocols without the need for any intermediary. Stablecoin usage has been a key driver for DeFi, along with users of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In the summer of 2020, tokenized Bitcoin on the Ethereum network overtook the amount of Bitcoin on the Lightning Network, the layer built on the Bitcoin blockchain to allow two parties to transact with one another. It is a notable moment for the DeFi boom, but hurdles remain for those with security tokens and real assets to interact with DeFi, as the responsibilities of issuers and the rights of investors must be enforced.</p>
  
 COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT: ONCHAIN FINANCE 
<p>For financial actors to interact with this new network, there are two tools that are required for them to leverage all the advantages of blockchain technology. The first aspect that’s required is the need for firm’s to apply control and compliance to this shared infrastructure. Since 2008, regulations have been getting stricter and stricter for market actors These regulations have been getting stricter and stricter for firms to follow and they have been eating into the profitability of financial institutions. Onchain Finance represents the notion of applying compliant centralized finance on a decentralized infrastructure, meaning the stakeholders (issuers, agents, investors) are represented on the blockchain and the market rules and regulations are complied with and improved on this new infrastructure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In its simplest terms, Onchain Finance consists of two blockchain-based technological layers:</p>
 Permissioned Tokens&nbsp; 
<p>These are the representations of a security that can be traded via blockchain technology. As such, they are permissioned and the transfers are controlled by a set of smart contracts deployed on the blockchain . This ensures token holders meet KYC and eligibility rules defined by the issuer (via their legal team) and enables the dynamic white listing of investors across the entire life of the security token.</p>
 Onchain Identities&nbsp; 
<p>For permissioned security tokens to be distributed to eligible investors, it’s essential for investor identities to be known. Onchain identities, acting almost like an investment passport that’s reusable from offering to offering, are created and maintained on a blockchain infrastructure. These identities are created on behalf of all parties in the subscription and transactional process of security tokens (issuer, KYC provider, security token administrative agent and obviously, investors). Investors are able to make their information known to third parties on request and can enrich their data with relevant qualifying information such as accreditations, KYC checks, proof of identity etc.</p>
 THE BENEFITS OF DIGITAL CURRENCIES 
<p>The second aspect is the usage of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or a stablecoin issued by a financial institution to solve the price volatility problem. Stablecoins offer a solution but do not give the level of assurance that’s required for traditional players to fully adopt the blockchain. As previously noted, stablecoin use has risen, but not amongst the traditional financial players. This requirement is known, too. CBDCs are currently under development by the world’s largest nations. These government issued currencies would provide the level of assurance needed for traditional players’ confidence to operate with blockchain technology and act as a gateway into asset tokenization.</p>
<p>These pieces to the puzzle will enable blockchain to transform private markets by delivering three core benefits for the industry:</p>
 Data transparency 
<p>The digitization of private market securities is likely to deliver improvements with regards to data transferability and therefore market transparency. Information about the issuer and the characteristics of a certain asset could be improved, along with the potential to improve the dissemination of information. This could improve price discovery for market participants but also sustainable finance or impact investments more broadly, an area which is heavily reliant on trustworthy information. By bringing visibility over currently opaque value chains, proofs of sustainability could easily be embedded into tokenized securities or security token (ratings, green labels, etc) and thereby significantly improve the level of confidence that investors can place into this kind of investment.</p>
 Distributed market 
<p>By replacing the currently restricted and fragmented market infrastructures with a globally shared one, issuers can target a wider group of investors from around the world who in turn have broader investment options at their disposal. Moreover, it is about providing global reach to issuers as opposed to restricted markets and also improving investability from the investors perspective, a win-win situation. Indeed, once hosted on a blockchain, a security token can be accessed by eligible investors in the blink of an eye across the globe using any connected device. This is potentially a significant opportunity for those in private markets as issuers can take advantage of a global network with little added cost and capital formation for issuers is improved as they have more investors to target.</p>
 Transfer of value and improved liquidity 
<p>Due to inefficient markets infrastructure, privately issued securities are difficult to trade and are therefore notoriously illiquid. The use of blockchain allows value to circulate seamlessly by bringing digital trust, as it solves for the “double spending” problem. More transparency and a greater dispersed information within the market, along with immutability and the utilization of a faster and more efficient transfer of value will contribute to the improvement of private market liquidity. Value that’s currently locked up in assets will be freed and traded between eligible investors on a seamless and accessible infrastructure.</p>
<p>The new development of a decentralized infrastructure poses some very attractive benefits for operators in private markets. Particularly in the secondary market, where private markets are currently restricted on both the buy and sell sides, this new infrastructure could bring in a new era in private markets. We discuss how the whole topic area in the ebook we published with PwC, click the image below&nbsp;to download.</p>

			 We Turned Three – What Have We Achieved So Far? 
<p>Last month we celebrated our third birthday. Alongside sharing our celebrations with the team and our friends, I thought it would be a good point to take a moment to reflect on our story, mission and what we have achieved to date.</p>
 Tokeny’s origins: 
<p>We started Tokeny Solutions in 2017 with the vision of making capital markets more accessible through the improvement in private markets liquidity. How did we envisage making this a reality? Through blockchain technology.</p>
 Why? 
<p>We remain steadfast in our vision of why we are doing this. Due to the lack of infrastructure, private market assets and prices are difficult to locate, which has resulted in an opaque and illiquid market. By digitizing the full lifecycle of a security we are providing new paths to liquidity through a seamless, transparent and accessible experience.</p>
 Where are we today? 
<p>Today, we have the complete software solutions for the issuance and management of security tokens on both the buy side and sell side. We have tokenized more than 27B$ of assets within 40 use cases and our solutions are tried and tested by a multitude of different asset classes and financial institutions.</p>
 Where are we going? 
<p>What remains missing is the distribution piece. The arrival of qualitative and compliant assets on a global blockchain infrastructure will help many services providers and marketplace operators to emerge and scale. By using new technology, actors can solve long standing problems in the industry and new players will emerge. We are working hard to make this vision a reality.</p>
<p>This is a short excerpt taken from the blog I posted last week, you can read the full version&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/three-years-of-tokeny-solutions/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Husvo4q_ZK6XDQLpVKbnY6qcUaqCLxY3TaR2sujWSGhMpKiSg9h7QhIzJEcY1tmcv52hH">here</a>.&nbsp;As always, below you will find a summary of the top news in the digital assets industry.</p>

As a bonus he decided to say <a href="https://twitter.com/Sheldrake/status/1324732000633262081">on twitter</a> Kaliya’s expertise was narrow, so she decided to <a href="https://identitywoman.net/interdisciplinary-expertise-for-self-sovereign-identity/">share some of her background</a> to clear up any confusion.&nbsp;</p> Decentralized-ID.com Updates! <p><a href="https://twitter.com/infominer33">Infominer</a> has been working on curating has some great pages covering companies in the industry.

This reduces wallet holders to a passive role, which at best delivers suboptimal utility to the holder, and at worst can reinforce the unhealthy power asymmetries between institutions and people that exist today.</p><p>Interactive connections solve this problem by creating a two-way street between a wallet holder and an institution. Instead of a passive responder, the wallet holder is a peer who can initiate actions of their own. In addition, wallet holders can interact not only with institutions, but also with other wallet holders, to communicate securely and share verified information [using DIDComm V1].</p></blockquote> Indicio is a finalist for the DHS Digital Wallets User Interface Challenge.&nbsp; <blockquote><p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-is-a-finalist-for-dhs-digital-wallets-user-interface-challenge/">goal of the DHS Challenge</a> is to design a user interface (UI) so that the process of using a wallet to access and perform these functions is clear, intuitive, consistent, and efficient.</p></blockquote><p>This contest was announced in September and had a very tight turnaround.

<p>At Spruce, we’re building a product suite to manage all aspects of the data supply chain. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> Rust VC/DID&nbsp;Library <p>We are currently working on a project called DIDKit: a cross-platform toolkit for using DIDs and VCs with our Rust libraries at the&nbsp;core.</p>  We have been able to utilize the core credential flows of Issue, Present, and Verify using DIDKit, currently supporting RSA and Ed25519 signature systems with more to&nbsp;come.  We currently support <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did-key</a>, but are starting work on support for did-tezos, did-btcr, did-web, and did-peer.  We are helping to write tests for the DID Test Suite at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID Working&nbsp;Group</a>.   Tezos DID&nbsp;Method <p>The Tezos DID Method makes a pragmatic trade-off between usability, security, and privacy, allowing any Tezos-based address to have a useful&nbsp;DID.</p>  Our current draft of the Tezos DID Method can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://did-tezos-draft.spruceid.com/">here</a>.  We have been reviewing this with members of the Tezos ecosystem and members of the decentralized identity ecosystem to ensure usability, security, and&nbsp;privacy.  We have started the implementation of the&nbsp;method.  We intend to submit this as a Credentials Community Group work item with our partner TQ over the next few&nbsp;weeks.   Credible   We are completing the integration of our Rust libraries into our native mobile applications through the Flutter cross-platform framework.  We have begun scoping the cloud wallet and single-page app target aspects of Credible.   Keylink   We have begun work on Keylink, which links existing enterprise accounts to keypairs.  We have a working MVP demonstration which uses Keycloak as the identity provider and Keylink as the relying party for signing with Ed25519&nbsp;keys.  Keys are stored in an encrypted SQLite database for the MVP, but we intend to integrate with cloud KMS systems such as Amazon KMS in the&nbsp;future.  We intend to release Keylink open source as it&nbsp;matures.  <p>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact">leave us a message</a>, and we will respond within 24&nbsp;hours.</p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>Before the pandemic, most organizations moved their digital strategies forward at a steady pace. Leaders either wanted proof of success and didn’t feel great urgency to invest more in digital or the organizational culture seemed resistant.</p>
<p>But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, many employees started <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ask-these-questions-before-deploying-remote-access-technology/">to work remotely</a> and organizations ramped up digital engagement with customers. Surveyed corporate directors increased the development of digital products and services to maintain and accelerate their customer engagement, and help them reach their revenue growth targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz05NTlhZjA0MDE0NDgxMWViYWJhYTBhNTZkNmU3ZDRjZg=="></a></p>
<p>The way forward for them was to increase, rather than decrease, the speed of<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/prioritize-digital-business-initiatives-to-accelerate-into-the-future/"> their digital business initiatives </a>and to elevate funding for IT to support this acceleration.</p>
<p>The survey found that 87% of corporate directors deemed technology as having a transformational role in addressing strategic business priorities. Sixty-seven percent of corporate directors expected budgetary increases in technology, and the majority of them anticipated a 6.9% increase in their current IT budgets as a result of the acceleration.</p>
 Why is digital strategy acceleration important now? 
<p>Digital business acceleration is important now for three reasons:</p>
 
 COVID-19. The pandemic demonstrated the value of digital initiatives in e-commerce, deliveries, supply chain virtualization, process automation and other activities, especially where physical activities were no longer possible. 
 Costs and operations. The recession has driven the need to overhaul costs and streamline operations. 
 Results. The rapid responses to the pandemic make accelerating digital business seem feasible and also critical for the survival of a company. 
 
 Boards of directors position the CIO as a partner in digital strategy&nbsp; 
<p>To respond to this crisis and its aftermath, the role of the CIO as an advisor to the board on digital business issues will also increasingly change. More than half of boards of directors said that CIOs will serve as partners with senior business leaders, while over a third look to the CIO to lead digital business issues alone.</p>

 Knock, knock. Who’s there? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To most Americans, the question is a pathway to laughter. To many Sub-Saharan Africans, on the other hand, the matter of who’s who can be painfully complicated, inconvenient, or potentially transformative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">494 million</a>&nbsp;people do not have a form of identification, which is as much as 45% of the population. In other words, almost half of the Sub-Saharan Africans cannot prove who they say they are, thus walled off from access to public services and social welfare such as education or healthcare, denied the right to vote, and left ineligible to participate in any formal financial transactions or economic activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Cash. Cash Who? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implications of identification on livelihoods are more pronounced in the region because, among the many challenges mentioned above, Sub-Saharan Africa has historically hosted the biggest population underserved by the financial sector. </p>
<blockquote><p>Despite steady growth over the past years,&nbsp;<a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=1228">less than one-third</a> of adults (age 15+) in the region own at least one financial account, compared with the world average of 67.1% and 93.8% in North America. Without an ID, individuals and businesses have no options but to rely on cash transactions.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financially speaking, for individuals, having a digital identity means&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/toward-new-impact-narrative-financial-inclusion">building resilience</a>&nbsp;— coping strategies in the face of life uncertainties and changes. It could be done through activities like instant online saving, instead of having to choose between finding a reliable savings club, spending hours traveling to a bank, and keeping cash under the pillow. It also significantly eases the process of participation in pension schemes and receiving qualified subsidies. The value of digital identity to individuals is more than resilience building; it’s also about seizing opportunities. By leveraging financing tools such as loans or investments, individuals have higher chances to survive and thrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the business front, having an identity as the business owner helps with financing for business needs, such as a planned expansion or weathering an unplanned pandemic, through formal financial arrangements with&nbsp;<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.617.4016&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">more competitive interest rates</a>. It also builds business credit history, which is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/blog/10-stats-explain-why-business-credit-important-small-business">especially meaningful</a>&nbsp;to small to medium enterprises. Moreover, having a credible online presence verified by the government agencies or a third-party IDV service provider can be a critical part of customer acquisition in today’s global economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, financial inclusion banks on identification, and to Sub-Saharan Africa, digital identity will turbo-charge inclusive financial growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No Time Like the Present 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers have&nbsp;<a href="https://faculty.babson.edu/lcdstein/research/stein-yannelis-freedmanbank.pdf">found</a>&nbsp;that financial inclusion interventions have a larger effect on people who open bank accounts earlier than those who do so later. It takes time for the enabling effect of digital identity on financial inclusion to occur, and so does the digitalization of identity. The writer argues that now is the best time to assess the needs for designing and rolling out digital identity systems that serve both the currently documented and undocumented in the region. The region can leverage the existing and continuously developing mobile networks and data and privacy regulation frameworks and follow in the footsteps of a few pioneer countries in the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SIM connection rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to grow from 77% in 2019 to 86% by the end of 2025, at a CAGR of 4.3%, and the mobile internet user rate from 26% to 39%, at a CAGR of 9.7%, according to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GSMA_MobileEconomy2020_SSA_Eng.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;published by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/">GSM Association</a>. The rising mobile penetration level lays a solid foundation for the potential continent-wide rollout of mobile identity, whose worldwide addressable market was valued at $34 billion through 2022, per OWI’s&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/product/mobile-identity-the-34-billion-opportunity/">research in 2018</a>. The high mobile penetration rate also means plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SCT_Report_R_WebSingles.pdf">opportunities</a>&nbsp;leveraging tools such as mobile money for transactions among individuals and businesses and government-sponsored cash transfer programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A reliable digital identity system also needs to be backed by a strong data and privacy regulation framework. By 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://unctad.org/news/data-and-privacy-unprotected-one-third-countries-despite-progress">half</a>&nbsp;of the African countries have had data and privacy legislation in place, and 61% have set up e-transaction laws, with the number&nbsp;<a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2019/12/24/kenya-now-has-a-data-protection-law-what-does-this-mean-for-netizens/">on a gradual rise</a>.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, several countries in the region have already taken the first stab at the digital identity system. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europeanceo.com/world-view/electronic-identification-cards-herald-a-digital-future-for-ghana/">Ghana</a>&nbsp;began its national registration and issuance of electronic ID cards to citizens in 2018;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/kenya-creates-africas-first-national-digital-id-scheme/">Kenya</a>&nbsp;is creating a population-wide identity scheme in Africa, a US$60 million program; and earlier this year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/loans-credits/2020/02/18/nigeria-digital-identification-for-development-project">Nigeria</a>&nbsp;launched the Digital Identification for Development Project with a US$115 million credit from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA). The identity digitization initiatives in these countries are not only meaningful for financial inclusion. They serve as trailblazers for their neighboring countries, especially given the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/digital-identity-for-all-push-in-africa-now-has-clarity-and-political-will-id4africa-executive-director">increasing demand</a>&nbsp;for digital identity and digital assets driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and its&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239797">disproportionate economic impact</a>&nbsp;among households.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the rising mobile penetration, the promising regulatory landscape, and the countries carrying the torch, there are hurdles to clear. For instance, there’s still room for modification in regulation. It is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/no244_0.pdf">found</a>&nbsp;that many of the data and privacy laws are not as comprehensive as international regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Some of the rights enforced by GDPR such as the right to data portability, which&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/data-protection-and-privacy-laws">mitigates the risk</a>&nbsp;of locking consumers into a single service provider, is not covered in these laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, while policymakers and other stakeholders, like international organizations, should be careful when evaluating costs and feasibilities, the benefits of acting sooner rather than later are self-evident. With the data collected from digital identity systems, from simple data like population and gender ratio, to more complicated data points like health and socio-economic statistics, Sub-Saharan African policymakers will be<a href="https://theconversation.com/poor-data-affects-africas-ability-to-make-the-right-policy-decisions-64064">&nbsp;better positioned</a>&nbsp;to conduct evidence-based research and make data-informed policies. In addition, better infrastructure supported by government initiatives will help attract private-sector players both at home and abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital identity can be a transformative force in advancing regional criticalities such as financial inclusion in the public and private sectors. The sooner we take action, the faster we may bring changes to communities in need.</p>

  <p>Fraud is a major cost to businesses worldwide and it is on the rise. In it’s 2019 annual report, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) put a specific focus on methods such as elder fraught, credit card fraud and confidence/romance fraud, emphasizing the growing occurrence of intentional deception in cybercrime. Companies of all industries face the same challenge: The complex and constantly changing world of fraud detection.&nbsp;The Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platform (FRIP) market is mature and growing and the solutions in this space are quite diverse. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that many companies are unable to cope with the plethora of opportunities in this segment.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/choosing_the_right_fraud_tool"></a>

  <p>The question of how much control to retain versus how much to give up is something that occupies the minds of parents, management consultants, and often coaches. A high level of control helps achieve specific objectives, but, at the same time, it may lead to a complex bureaucracy that slows down self-initiative, entrepreneurship, and general productivity. A high level of empowerment, on the other hand, fosters creativity and ownership, but it may lead to unmanageable or risky outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the world of identity and security, organizations across all sectors also face this conundrum. Managing identity involves both controlled (stateful) and autonomous (stateless) security tokens.&nbsp;</p>

  Stateful tokens are opaque and can be de-referenced by a central authority only after request (token introspection). The authority manages the state of the token, including revocation. The token depends on the availability and performance of the authority. 
	 Stateless tokens are self-contained and can be "unpacked" by any party with the appropriate key material. Stateless tokens can be processed with or without the availability of an authoritative service.&nbsp; 
 <p>Knowing which to use is often straightforward, but sometimes what you really want to deploy is something in between.</p>

 A Closer Look at Token Swapping Use Cases 

<p>Exposing open services and APIs to external clients is a perfect use case for stateful tokens. Because external clients can be located anywhere and security tokens can travel over many networks, more control is needed. With stateful tokens, you can have opaque tokens that don’t carry sensitive content, always introspect tokens against a central authority, and revoke tokens as needed to provide a high level of control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a> architectures that require security checks at every stage, including each microservice-to-microservice call, using stateless tokens makes more sense. That’s because they don’t depend on a central authority, which could impact the ability to scale and to continue operations if the authority is unreachable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Token swapping describes the ability to exchange one security token for another in a different, enriched, or restricted form. A gateway can function as the "token swapper." It intercepts requests, validates tokens, and generates new tokens either by itself or in conjunction with other services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let’s look at the example of a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services">financial</a> company exposing APIs to partner organizations. Such a scenario requires a higher level of control and the ability to revoke granted access, so, for these external clients, the financial institution issues stateful tokens. Token swapping allows the company to use those stateful tokens on the front end but then switch to stateless tokens for scalability and other benefits within their microservices environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you swap a stateful token for a stateless token in the right way and at the right time, you can achieve that delicate balance between control and autonomy to better suit your purposes.</p>

  <p>In the aforementioned scenario, ForgeRock Identity Gateway, deployed as a north-south gateway, validates stateful OAuth2 tokens by introspection with ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">Access Management</a>, ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">Identity Cloud</a>, or any other OAuth2 authorization server. After validating the stateful token, Identity Gateway then generates a stateless JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the identity information the downstream services need to proceed autonomously.</p>

<p>Self-contained JWTs are a compelling token type for scenarios that require a high level of scaling, do not have a strong dependency on external services (such as the authority), and can tolerate the absence of token revocation capability. For many microservices scenarios, this is a very effective use case for token swapping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Local JWT validation can also be conducted by service meshes, such as Istio, or by ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">Identity Gateway</a>, deployed as an east-west gateway, or Microgateway with the JwtValidationFilter. Note, however, that service meshes support self-contained JWTs but do not integrate well with stateful OAuth2 and remote token introspection. Furthermore, JWTs consumed by service meshes like Istio need to have the appropriate content, which can be built using token swapping. The "token swapper" can aggregate the appropriate JWTs.</p>

<p>Token swapping is not limited to stateful OAuth2 to JWT token swapping. You can create transformations using other token types – such as OpenID Connect, SAML or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">SSO</a> tokens – and services like the security token service (STS). You can also enrich tokens with user roles, entitlements, or attributes obtained from the authority.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To learn more about balancing control and autonomy with token swapping, read about the following useful components: <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/JwtBuilderFilter.html">JwtBuilderFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/JwtValidationFilter.html">JwtValidationFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/IdTokenValidationFilter.html">IdTokenValidationFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/OAuth2ResourceServerFilter.html">OAuth2ResourceServerFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/TokenTransformationFilter.html">TokenTransformationFilter</a>.</p>

<p>With token swapping, you can expand your options for obtaining the right balance in the control versus autonomy dilemma—at least in the identity and security realm. Parents, philosophers, and management will have to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Last month’s <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) was held entirely online for the second time in its history. This bi-annual unconference, typically hosted in Mountain View, CA at the Computer History Museum, connects a wide variety of people from across the globe focused on solving the hard problems around digital identity. As an unconference, the attendees set the agenda each day. The format is focused on open collaboration which creates a real and rare opportunity to organically discuss not only the latest technology developments, but also the surrounding social, political and legal implications.</p><p>This year, over 400 attendees from across the globe participated in IIW31. It was a great showcase of both the work and progress being achieved across a variety of open standards and open source communities.</p><p>Although there is too much to cover in one write up, we wanted to highlight MATTR’s pick of the three major&nbsp;themes:</p>  KERI comes into the spotlight  Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity   KERI comes into the spotlight <p>One of the technologies that received a great deal of attention this year was Sam Smith’s <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> (KERI). Sam first introduced this topic over a year ago, and it’s evident that a lot has happened since then to bring these ideas and concepts to&nbsp;life.</p><p>KERI attempts to address the self-certifying aspect of identifier-based systems such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Central to this technology is the concept of Key Event Logs (KELs) which are maintained by each user in a distributed identity system. Key Event Logs contain digitally signed messages of all key management related transactions done by the user, and can be used not only to prove control over your identifier, but also shared with other external ‘witnesses’ who can independently validate and prove that you control your identifier. In practice, this means that KERI identifiers and keys are not “ledger-locked” — they are fully portable and can be validated using any ledger, distributed database, or other verifiable data registry.</p><p>In a session called “<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/2E/_KERI_for_Muggles">KERI for Muggles</a>”, Drummond Reed and Sam Smith identified 7 main characteristics that make KERI useful for identity:</p>  Self-certifying identifiers  Self-certifying Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Witnesses for Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Pre-rotation as simple, safe, scalable protection against key compromise  System-independent validation  Delegated self-certifying identifiers enable enterprise-class key management  Compatibility with the GDPR “right to be forgotten”  <p>There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=12A/_KERIfying_DID_Methods_%26_KERI_for_Interop">number</a> of <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13E/_DIDn%27t:_did:un_and_overlap_between_DIDs_%26_KERI">additional</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14A/_Verifiable_Trust_Bases:_How_to_make_the_web_of_trust_new_again_with_KERI">sessions</a> that dived into advanced KERI topics, including how KERI can create interoperability between different <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a> and solving the operational concerns related to bringing these ideas to life. There are <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keripy">ongoing</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keriox">open-source projects</a> at the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) which are driving this work forward. We look forward to the positive change this will bring to our ecosystem, particularly in reducing our technology’s strict dependence on specific infrastructure like distributed ledgers.</p> Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems <p>Following on from <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">IIW30</a>, there was a continued theme around the bridging of W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) with existing identity protocols on the web today such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), which are mainly used in federated identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Evolution of existing protocols such as OIDC allows existing infrastructure providers to make adjustments to their implementations in order to start using new technology, rather than having to tear it all down and rebuild. The goal here is to build as much as we can upon previous work while addressing a number of significant shortcomings around federated identity as it exists today. We’ve covered <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">this topic</a> before, so needless to say, we’re committed to solving this problem and we were extremely supportive of the continued discussion around these issues at this&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>A key component of this approach is the ability to allow existing identity solutions to issue and verify Verifiable Credentials. One way to achieve this is to extend the OpenID Connect protocol to enable more portable digital identity. Instead of using OIDC as a bearer token between an Issuer and Relying party, we can create a client-bound assertion that’s held in a user’s digital wallet. To that end, we <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1F/_OpenID_Connect_Credential_Provider">introduced</a> an approach that we’re calling <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, which turns traditional Identity Providers (IdPs) into credential providers. It modifies current authentication/issuance flows used by OpenID Connect to allow IdPs to issue assertions that are re-provable and reusable for authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-relation information and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the “wallet” layer between issuers and relying parties. There was great participation in this discussion from some of today’s existing Identity Providers, and one of the outcomes from this IIW is that the specification will be contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item, where it will be further developed by the community there.</p><p>There was also a great deal of interest around the evolution of <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP). The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">SIOP chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect specification was written in a way that clearly tried to leave room for some of the user-centric design concepts that are quite popular today, but given that it was first introduced in 2014, it lacked the context of today’s technologies such as DIDs and VCs. ُThere’s a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues/1180/siop-laundry-list">laundry list</a> of topics to cover here, so kick starting this effort has been a matter of breaking down each component and coming up with potential solutions. We identified 3 main problems that SIOP aims to&nbsp;address:</p>  Enabling portable identities between providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR&nbsp;problem</a>  Dealing with different deployment types of OpenID providers  <p>There are a number of insights we can gain by addressing each of these issues separately, and bringing them together to form more robust solutions. It was exciting to see that there are <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14B/_SIOP_-_progress_on_the_laundry_list_(wrt_DID)">many people</a> interested in revisiting SIOP and trying to address the underlying issues with federated identity. The work will continue to develop at the OpenID Foundation AB working group, so the conversation doesn’t stop at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>In related news, there was some <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13J/_The_Web_Platform,_Privacy_and_Federation_(thoughts_on_WebID)">collaborative</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=20C/_Browsers,_Privacy_and_Federation_(Cookies,_WebID,_CHAPI,_etc)">dialogue</a> with Google’s <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> technology, which aims to explore how browsers can help solve the user privacy problem of cross-site cookie tracking on the web. Given that the IIW community is deeply focused on issues of security and user privacy, it made a lot of sense for those working on WebID to connect with people working on OpenID Connect, as well as the W3C community working on the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI). The team developing Chromium discussed the possibility of adding a minimal set of browser APIs to work with CHAPI. Having something like CHAPI supported directly by the browser would allow for a more friendly user experience, allowing a credential holder to choose the provider of their identity (instead of being dictated by the relying party) and enabling better credential storage synchronization. The discussion here is really just a starting point, and we’re looking forward to seeing how WebID incorporates this approach and continues to work with the IIW community as the work develops.</p> SSI maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity <p>It’s been nearly 15 years since Kim Cameron wrote the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of Identity</a>, and over 4 years since Christopher Allen first laid out the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 Principles of SSI</a>. In the time since then, thinking has evolved a great deal around how to bring the power of SSI to users. This work has not only included building out the foundational technologies, but also addressing the practical tradeoffs between convenience, usability, and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As these technologies get deployed in the real world, what’s emerging is the fact that what we call ‘SSI’ (Self-Sovereign Identity) is more a set of guiding principles in how we would like digital identity systems of the future to behave like or be based around, rather than a concrete checklist where you can say this technology is SSI. As it is, there are always new ideas about how to bring these principles to life in real world applications. This continued to be a hot topic at this IIW, including:</p>  Scaling peer communications  Scaling blockchains  Scaling privacy   Scaling peer communications <p>Besides all of the ongoing work on KERI, there were a number of updates surrounding technology enabling peer-to-peer communication. There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1J/_DIDComm_Messaging_V2_-_Where_we_are_and_what_to_expect">few</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=21D/_DIDComm_Mediator_Agents_(v1_%26_v2)_-_Intro_and_where_open_source_projects_are">sessions</a> dedicated to giving the community an update on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a> protocol, showing that the specification is maturing to a point where it will be stable enough to broadly implement. In addition, Daniel Hardman of <a href="https://www.evernym.com">Evernym</a> presented a thought provoking <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=23G/_Discovery:_Solving_the_Kobayashi_Maru_of_SSI">session</a> on the intersection of privacy and discoverability on the web, which he calls “The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru">Kobayashi Maru</a> Problem of&nbsp;SSI”.</p> Scaling blockchains <p>The team at <a href="https://consensys.net">Consensys</a> presented an interesting <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/3E/_Better_DID_Mehtods_with_Zero_Knowledge_Proofs_(ZKPs)%3F_-_Privacy_Preserving,_Globally_Verfiable_DIDs">proposal</a> for a new DID method based on <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK Rollups</a>. In recent years, there has been a big push in the community to reconsider the use of ledgers and minimize what information is made public, especially when it comes to identifying individual people. While there has been a lot of interest in DID methods that don’t use any blockchain or ledger infrastructure, Consensys and many others continue to explore the use of ledgers due to their unique properties, such as the ability to offer global resolvability. Although it’s early stages for this work and there is no codebase yet, there was a lot of interest from those in the community looking to use blockchain-based DID methods. Their approach would give DIDs global resolvability with the potential to keep the DID “off ledger” and privacy preserving, making it ideal for persons using DIDs. As mentioned earlier, the work on KERI is also helping to illustrate how we can continue using decentralized ledger technologies in a way that preserves user sovereignty and data portability.</p> Scaling privacy <p>As a followup to last IIW, we provided an introduction to multi-message signatures and an overview of recent developments made around using <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+ Signatures</a> for selective disclosure in JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials. We <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April of this year. Since then, steady progress on open-source implementations and technical specs have resulted in a number of additional enhancements to the privacy preserving characteristics of zero knowledge proof based credentials, including the ability to have blinded subject credentials and domain bound proofs. In addition to progress on the technical specification, there have been significant developments on open-source implementations from a number of independent organizations. This progress has made the case for privacy-preserving credentials and selective disclosure stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p> Summary <p>SSI and decentralized digital identity are maturing at a steady pace, but we still have a lot of work ahead to solve the difficult problems around trust, privacy, and scalability that come with deploying systems in the real world. We’re excited to see progress on the critical issues move forward as the work happens across so many different communities and areas of interest.</p><p>As always, we’re incredibly grateful for the work that <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Young</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a>, and the team at IIW are doing to bring together different perspectives and to host important discussions which are open, respectful, and always illuminating. As for MATTR, you can usually find us on <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal">GitHub</a> and working within organizations like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>, and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> to push forward the vision for a more open and accessible internet. We will see you all at&nbsp;IIW32!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/highlights-of-iiw31-c36883cb70db">Highlights of #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Identity Server 2020.2 is released today, including SSO 8.6 and CustomerID 5.6. 
<p>At the core, software development should be incremental, where small changes are delivered quickly, with high quality and continual improvement in mind.&nbsp;There should be several elements: the correction of some deviations, some feature improvements, some maintenance and ideally a new feature or two. Inside this release we have a little of all of these things for you, and we have focused on a new feature. Check out the release notes&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/Identity+Server+2020.2+Release+Notes">here</a>&nbsp;for an in depth view of things. In brief, we have ensured our internal retooling functions well – and it does – we’re pleased with the ability to deliver code improvements quickly in a highly automated and testable manner. During this development cycle we delivered several patches to resolve deviations in our CustomerID application which also helped us to iron out the last wrinkles in the new CI. This allowed us to accommodate the security improvement required by Suomi.fi and create the SSO 8.5.1 patch in very short order.</p>
<p>Working with several customers, we elected to focus on Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) as an addition to our many authentication methods. Many of our customers create their own UI and already&nbsp;have&nbsp;the ability or desire to create their own Quick Response (QR) code, which can ease user onboarding, although you can still offer the secret as a text string. So we set-about the task of code creation inside the SSO application,&nbsp;including the API control functions and logging functions essential to any SSO authentication.</p>
 Continuing to the end of 2020 
<p>Within the product, we are going to do some incremental improvements in the last months of 2020. There are some additional tooling changes that will ensure that we can bring updated&nbsp;third-party libraries&nbsp;into every release we make. We are also adding a section into the Release Notes, as requested, covering the life-cycle management of external components (like which Tomcat is in use, when will PostgreSQL being updated next etc). In late 2019, the OpenID foundation finalised their CIBA (Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication) method into CIBA Core 1.0. So while we had implemented a pre-spec version of CIBA in the summer of 2018, we now need to make a couple of small changes to our Ubisecure Backchannel Authentication Adaptor (UBAA) to be Core 1.0 compliant. We expect to integrate several new external authenticators via UBAA in the first half of 2021 and then open the adaptor methodology up to all of you – easy integrations to SSO is coming soon! In the next week or so, we will publish our 2020.3 pre-release notes – the goals and intentions of the team for the final development cycle of 2020.</p>
<p>This iteration, IDS 2020.2, has been tightly focused and IDS 2020.3 will be very focused as well. Additionally, we are working on the scoping and predictability of our engineering as well as adding communication of upcoming development plans; for example pre-release notes as details against top line roadmap items and life-cycle management found on the release notes. The goal is to ensure that we can understand your needs and dependably place them into a development timeline. Coupled with the new CI and automated release testing we have done over the prior year, I am confident that we will continue to support and serve our customers the best possible code and new feature additions on a predictable schedule.</p>
<p>As we move forward to the end of the year, our team continues to work remotely with business as usual. All of us at Ubisecure hope that all of you, your colleagues and families are well and can tolerate this social isolation. We are looking forward to a return to normal office days, coffee breaks and being able to meet you in person. Until that happens, we are happy to engage with you virtually. So if you have any questions over this release, or upcoming work, please don’t hesitate to contact your account team or our support department. We are happy to help with anything around your identity solution needs.</p>

<p>In early November, <a href="http://know.oneworldidentity.com/">KNOW Identity</a>&nbsp;dove into the world of data-driven marketing. At this digital event, experts in digital identity, adtech, and martech gathered to explain how data, privacy, and security are the highest priorities while also enhancing and customizing the user experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each session was packed with vital insights from industry operators, but a few standout takeaways included:</p>
 
 Brands must continue to collect opt-in consent and information on their customers to personalize the ads being served. However, with new user privacy regulations (and more on the horizon), there are many methods and algorithmically-focused solutions that need to be adopted with these changes. 
 Truly anonymized data is extremely rare to encounter – differential privacy methods such as pseudonymization can help reduce the risk of exposing PII data within an organization and beyond. 
 All companies need some level of identity resolution to tailor brand interactions to the specific customer. More and more privacy-minded consumers and regulation are driving new ways of building and storing the relevant data points to create these experiences. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Will the Cookie Monster Crumble Quality Marketing? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first session of the event,&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/cookie-monster-marketing/">Will the Cookie Monster Crumble Quality Marketing?</a>, tackled how tailored advertising and recommendations are growing in demand from modern consumers. Today, brands are shifting to new methods of marketing without relying on deterministic and probabilistic cookie data. Brian Silver (President at LiveIntent) and Brad Davis (CEO at DataLucent) chatted about the future possibilities among consent-based user experiences in a mobile-first world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;Let’s talk about the challenge of getting consumers to provide accurate survey data that you’re relying on. How have we changed? COVID has fundamentally shifted everything, so how do you get this data from customers? Do you depend on a service such as Facebook? Or is there still a lot of in-person, one-to-one communication to get folks to opt-in?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DataLucent:&nbsp;It depends on the brand, as they have various levels of relationship with consumers directly. Customers are typically intermediated from [CPG] brands directly, except in social communities where consumers opt-in to participate. In contrast, companies like airlines or online retailers have a direct relationship with consumers. Those relationships can be directly leveraged to market to consumers with known relationships with brands. Other brands who are intermediated from their customers require a kind of two-stage process where we develop panels, whether those are panels predicated on social media presence or whether we use their field activation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means folks are actually in bars and restaurants recruiting consumers to take surveys, join panels, and incrementally share more data as their relationship matures and develops with a brand itself. This is a lot more straightforward when you’ve got a direct relationship with consumers. But in both instances, the brands are very concerned about reputational risk. This impacts channel strategies and marketing communication strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;It’s all about where data comes from, especially in this new privacy-centric world. What is your view on data and where it comes from? What steps can brands take now that browsers are eliminating third party cookie capabilities?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LiveIntent: From a digital ecosystem perspective, no one is upset that policy is starting to take shape from the consumer perspective. Even though CCPA is far from perfect, at least it’s beginning to drive towards the consent of the consumer’s wishes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you think back to 2002-2003 when CAN-SPAM came, you had no way to unsubscribe before that. That is one method of opt-in or opt-out that changed the entire email marketing game. It still continues to be altered and puts the consumer’s ability to say what they want and what they don’t want.&nbsp;I think that there’s a massive opportunity for all of us from the brand side and the publisher’s side to understand: what does it take for you to be consumer complaint?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing that becomes increasingly important is that there need to be direct corporate connections in a first-party world. There need to be frameworks established and put into place for brands and publishers to transact together again with the consumer’s consent. Being transparent, first and foremost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[So I ask of our audience,] have you started to understand what it means to be in a first-party world? LiveIntent sent out a survey to marketers and found only 32 percent of our entire panel said they were doing something about it and understood what they needed to do. </p>
<blockquote><p>With a finite amount of time to go, we’re encouraging people to wake up, begin to comprehend that there are things that you can do today, and don’t wait for other people to tell you what to do to move forward.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
 
 Master Class: Privacy and the Science of Anonymized Data 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our next deep-dive session,&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/masterclass-privacy-anonymized/">Master Class: Privacy and the Science of Anonymized Data,</a>&nbsp;Brandy Walsh (Data Ethics Privacy Attorney at Acxiom) broke down how companies can deliver privacy to their customers without sacrificing user experience. With an increasing focus on privacy-preserving data acquisition, companies are reevaluating how they learn about their customers without exploiting individual and personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acxiom:&nbsp;One of the first steps to building a privacy-focused processing approach is defining anonymous data. So what is anonymous data? Data that we thought was anonymous before is now personal information. It’s tough to navigate this space currently, as we don’t have a concrete definition within the common known privacy laws. So if you intend to define it within your organization, you’re kind of on your own to come up with something concrete that applies specifically to your use of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[If anonymous data is difficult to harness,] you may want to take a pseudonymous approach. Conveniently, however, a pseudonymization is almost identically defined within CCPA and GDPR. It’s a form of data that may start as personal information. Still, it is subsequently transformed into a data set that isn’t attributable to that specific consumer, particularly the one from which it’s derived without additional information. The additional information is typically a connector key that’s kept somewhere else, even with a third-party processor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brandy then highlighted a few techniques to start pseudonymizing PII data within your organization – be sure to watch her full presentation here to learn more about integrating this into your own organization’s data processing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Don’t Track Me Bro’: The Future of Identity Graphing 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the final session of the day, OWI brought together an all-star panel in&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/dont-track-me-bro/">Don’t Track Me Bro’: The Future of Identity Graphing</a>. With support from our partner&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/">FullContact</a>, Christopher Harrison (CEO at FullContact), Jenna Pilgrim (Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Streambed Media), and Brian Burke (VP of Product at Infutor) took to the virtual stage. They broke down how the evolving data privacy landscape will shift how companies work with personal data and how identity graph providers and their clients are adjusting to an uncertain landscape in the face of both regulatory and technological headwinds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;Can you give us the lay of the land on what is comprehensive identity graphing in marketing? What is identity resolution?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FullContact:&nbsp;In this context, your identity represents who you are to companies and the brands you interact with. Each of these are interactions in which you have an experience. Then, as a part of that experience, you’re sharing a part of yourself with those companies. There are little pieces of yourself or little contact fragments of you, and to that company, that’s your identity. That’s how they know who you are. The graph component is just a tool to store each of those little contact fragments and the relationships among them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity resolution is the flipping of that. Now that you have an identity graph and all these different components of who you are to that brand, resolution is the ability for that company or brand to recognize you. It’s now utilizing that data. For example, when you call your favorite airline and they immediately know who you are and you avoid the call tree, that’s identity resolution. </p>
<blockquote><p>So if you want a great customer experience with this brand or company you love, you have to have identity resolution for them to service you. It really means that every company needs that capability and has to be good at any resolution, but it also means every company is a data company in some ways.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;What are the big trends right now from a product standpoint, also for identity resolution, graphing, and identity and for marketers in general that you’re starting to see and build toward?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infutor Data Solutions:&nbsp;Some of the trends are being driven from a legislative side. We’ve got consumer privacy trends starting in Europe with GDPR and then more recently in the US with CCPA, and potentially future legislation, including other states looking to adopt privacy. That’s certainly a trend that impacts what may come about in the future as it pertains to identity resolution. That, along with the “walled garden space,” we have trends around removing the usage of third-party cookies. More recently, there’ve been some announcements around mobile ad ideas and what may happen with mobile ad tracking. And so, as a data provider, it’s a constant challenge to stay abreast of those challenges, see past what’s coming, and see what the trends will be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;Let’s talk a bit about building consumer trust. What are you seeing amongst users, and has this shifted over time?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Streambed Media:&nbsp;With the shift in adtech and privacy legislation over the last six months, the question we have to ask ourselves is, why are we waiting to be legislated out of the identity space? Or rather, why are we waiting for new legislation to push against what we’re doing or to try to find new ways to keep doing what we were already doing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think we need to make a clear distinction between the things that make a consumer a consumer and the things that make them a data point on a spreadsheet. I think you are not your PII: you are not your passport number or your credit card number, or your address. Streambed takes a privacy-first look at how we collect consumers’ activity data without needing to know who the consumer is, and the only way that that can move forward is in an open-source environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FullContact:&nbsp;Ultimately, real people should be in control of their information. But I think, if you take a look at martech and adtech specifically, the foundations themselves are pretty broken to allow for that and only that. Many foundational things have to change, and that’s going to take time. You need innovative companies like [Streambed] to develop new ideas, and we need to invest in those new ideas for those foundational layers to change. We have to accept that the state of the system right now is where many of those controls are not in place to either gather consent, get a commission, or create transparency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s going to take companies that really care about this and that lean into it. I think that those that do lean into the privacy-focused programs, transparency, actually implementing the privacy change, and seeing it as a tailwind for their business, are the ones who’ll succeed in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Next Up? 
<p>After this conversation, the OWI team is looking forward to seeing how the identity industry drives further marketing and advertising advancements. There’s always more to dive into (we recommend you&nbsp;<a href="http://know.oneworldidentity.com/">secure your seat</a>&nbsp;now at our next digital event).

   CDR is here! But don’t panic if your bank isn’t quite there yet. We can help with our new ForgeRock CDR Open Banking Accelerators. 

<p>Well, it’s finally here. The Australian government’s<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0#:~:text=On%2026%20November%202017%2C%20the,and%20control%20over%20their%20data.&amp;text=Consumer%20data%20relating%20to%20mortgage,shared%20after%201%20November%202020."> Consumer Data Right</a> (CDR) regulation is taking effect – in phases – starting with bank loans and personal information for the Big Four banks. The rest of the industry will follow suit in 2021.</p>

<p>Understandably, the rollout of yet another new regulation tends to be met with a bit of resistance. But <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services/cdr">CDR</a> has some significant upsides for banks that fully embrace the open standards requirement that come with it. It’s been argued that the open standards can lead to a new wave of greater innovation and consumer services. Here are three ways banks can benefit from CDR:.&nbsp;</p>

<p>#1. CDR can pave the way to greater uniformity of security and boost consumer confidence. Third-party global banking integrations have been quite loose with regard to security in the past. Lacking application programming interface (API) openness, some developers have resorted to insecure “screen scraping” techniques that left consumer data vulnerable. CDR requires openness, mandating industry-standard, security-conscious protocols that will increase consumer confidence in the way their data is handled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>#2. CDR can lead to better customer and user experiences (CX/UX). Everything today is digital and online. Even processes previously handled exclusively face to face – like new customer onboarding and enrollment – can now be done remotely, without ever having to set foot in a branch office. Since many customers have an online-only relationship, the digital experience must be optimized. This means speed and security need to be core components of the offering, ensuring that there are no data loss or sync issues between your bank and a third-party provider. Secure uniformity and openness of APIs can help support this.</p>

<p>#3. CDR can help monetize data for new consumer services. A core focus of CDR is putting consumers in charge of their data. But this doesn’t eliminate opportunities for new service offerings and partnerships between banks and third-party API developers or other financial services organizations. When done properly, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/kuppingercole-leadership-compass-identity-api-platforms">opening up your APIs</a> – and by extension, customer data –&nbsp; can lead to new revenue opportunities.</p>

<p>But before any of this can happen, you need to become compliant with CDR. Maybe you’re already there, but is the job really done? Was it a struggle to become compliant because of the legacy IT systems you have in place? Will that solution scale to your current needs, as well as the evolving and changing CDR standard?</p>

<p>No matter where you are in the compliance journey, ForgeRock has solutions – called “Accelerators” – that can help. Let’s take a more detailed dive into some of the specifics so you can see for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock recently released <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/cdr-open-banking-accelerators">CDR Open Banking Accelerators</a> to help drastically speed up compliance with the Australian Government's CDR mandate. These accelerators make it easier for you to comply with CDR mandates by providing a fully compliant container-based reference implementation, along with comprehensive documentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our accelerators are designed to minimize integration efforts, by deploying into your production environment rapidly and in an automated way. Identity architects, DevOps, developers, and project managers report that our accelerators have saved them up to two thirds of their total implementation time and cost. CDR Open Banking Accelerators can help you achieve a rapid ROI and improve the customer experience at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock CDR Open Banking Accelerators also ensure that the APIs used by financial providers prioritize customer authorization when sharing data with other requested providers. We designed the tools to adhere to CDR guidelines outlined by the Australian government.</p>

<p>ForgeRock can help you overcome compliance hurdles. Here’s how the CDR Open Banking Accelerators addresses four primary use cases within the Open Banking framework:</p>

  Gives Data Holders a plug-and-play, CDR-compliant endpoint, where Accredited Data Recipients can dynamically register themselves. 
	 Provides Data Holders with a compliant, centralized consent engine enabling Accredited Data Recipients to request access to customer data. 
	 Provides Data Holders with a MetaDirectory Cache Data Model and Sync Engine to create and maintain the required copy of the Registry. Provides Data Holders with a fine-grained <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/authorization">authorization</a> service based on customer consent. This Core Banking API enables you, as an accredited Data Recipient, to access data the customer consents to. 
 <p>You can decide to simply comply with the CDR regulation, or you can use it as a springboard to compete in the new Open API economy. ForgeRock firmly believes that, in the near future, the quality of CDR implementations and broader API offerings will be a determining factor for customers choosing new services. As Data Recipients begin to offer innovative services using banking APIs, customers will start to expect to make use of these third-party services. Plus, non-mandatory APIs help progressive organizations like yours capitalize on the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services/open-banking">Open Banking</a> revolution, so it’s a real opportunity to grow and evolve your business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re grateful to our trusted partner<a href="https://www.middleware.co.nz/#/"> Middleware NZ</a>, whose knowledge of the Australian banking market and technical acumen helped make the CDR Open Banking Accelerators a reality.</p>

<p>With a modern identity and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a> (IAM) platform, you can transform your customers’ user experience. They’ll be able to control who can access their data and what can be done with it. And by empowering your customers, you’ll open up new and exciting innovation opportunities for your organization.&nbsp;</p>

Last month, the circulation of USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI increased by 299 million, 306 million, 301 million, and 26 million. The circulation of TUSD decreased by 194&nbsp;million.  USDC has stepped out of Ethereum and has been deployed on Algorand and Solana, with a supply of more than $30&nbsp;million.  BUSD continues to grow on the&nbsp;BSC.  Stablecoins have attracted the attention of global regulators. The European Commission, the Financial Stability Board, and the IMF have issued regulatory frameworks or&nbsp;reports.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past month(September 26, 2020 ~ October 25, 2020, same below, the data report of the natural month will be provided from next&nbsp;month).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $1.510 billion to $22.13&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past month, Tether additionally issued 299 million USDT on Ethereum. The circulation of USDC, BUSD, DAI, PAX, HUSD, and GUSD increased by 306 million, 301 million, 25.6 million, 74.89 million, 96.12 million, and 510,000. The circulation of TUSD decreased by 194&nbsp;million.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last month, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all decreased by&nbsp;215,000.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT decreased by 253,000 and the number of holding addresses of USDC increased by 33,000. The number of other stablecoins holding addresses has not changed&nbsp;much.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last month increased by an average of 6.55% compared to the previous&nbsp;month.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous month, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;11.83%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last month decreased by an average of 28.82% from the previous&nbsp;month.</p> 2. Stablecoin stepped out of&nbsp;Ethereum <p>About 70% of stablecoins still choose Ethereum as the main issuance platform, and except for USDT which chooses to be issued on multiple blockchains, most stablecoins choose Ethereum as the only issuance platform. During the continued congestion of Ethereum, in addition to the steady increase of USDT on Tron, stablecoins have gradually stepped out of Ethereum. USDC chose multiple smart contract platforms to deploy, while BUSD began to expand within its ecosystem.</p> USDC has been deployed on Algorand/Solana <p>The Centre Alliance announced several pieces of cooperation information in September and October, announcing that it would deploy USDC assets on Algorand, Stellar, and Solana. Among them, the supply on Algorand and Solana has reached $7.180 million and $25 million, and USDC on Stellar will be issued in the first quarter of&nbsp;2021.</p> BUSD continues to grow on&nbsp;BSC <p>As a stablecoin asset issued by Binance, BUSD not only exists in the form of ERC-20 on Ethereum but is also deployed on Binance Chain (BEP2) and Binance Smart Chain (BEP20). With the progress of mining on BSC, the number of holding addresses of BUSD on BSC has exceeded 9,100, which is the same as the number of holding addresses of BUSD on Ethereum. Since the bridge of assets is provided by Binance Exchange, it is not easy to count the supply of BUSD on each blockchain. However, according to bscscan, the supply of BUSD on BSC should have exceeded $40 million, among which the amount of BUSD on Pancake exceeds $18&nbsp;million.</p> 3. Stablecoins attracted global regulatory attention <p>As early as 2019, stablecoins have attracted the attention of global regulators. The concept of ‘GSC’ was first formally proposed in the ‘Global Stablecoin Evaluation Report’ of the G7 Stablecoin Working Group in October 2019. ‘Global’ mainly refers to the stablecoin spanning multiple jurisdictions. The Bank for International Settlements also released a report on strengthening cross-border payments in July 2020, suggesting that CBDC and global stablecoins can provide potential assistance for cross-border payments.</p><p>The rapid growth of stablecoins in 2020 has even attracted the attention of global regulators. The European Commission, the G20 joint FSB, and the International Monetary Fund have successively issued regulatory reports on stablecoin.</p> European Commission announced the regulatory framework for encrypted assets and stablecoins <p>The European Commission published the final draft of the regulatory framework for encrypted assets on September 24. The report is 168 pages long and elaborates on the background of the proposal, the current status of the development of encrypted assets, and the regulatory recommendations for stablecoins.</p><p>The report pointed out that although the scale of the encrypted asset market was still small and did not pose a threat to financial stability, this situation may change with the emergence of ‘GSC’. Because ‘Global Stablecoin’ has stable value and uses the network effects generated by companies promoting these assets to seek wider applications. The European Commission will create a comprehensive and holistic EU ‘stablecoin’ framework for encrypted assets that are not covered by the EU’s existing financial services legislation to mitigate the risks identified by the Financial Stability Board, especially financial stability risks.</p><p>The plan still needs to be considered by the legislative counterparts of the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European&nbsp;Council.</p> The G20 joint FSB released a stablecoin regulatory report <p>On October 23, the FSB released the “Regulation, Supervision, and Supervision of the ‘GSC’ arrangement” report, which made high-level recommendations for the supervision, supervision, and supervision of the ‘GSC’ arrangement.</p><p>The FSB pointed out that the so-called ‘stablecoin’ is a specific type of encrypted assets that had the potential to improve efficiency in the delivery of financial services by linking their value to one or more other assets (e.g. sovereign currencies) to solve the high volatility of ‘traditional’ encrypted assets, but at the same time could pose risks to financial stability, especially in the case of mass adoption. Stablecoins have the potential to improve payment efficiency and promote financial inclusion, but the use of ‘GSC’ may have a huge impact on the justice of many countries.</p><p>The FSB was established after the G20 Summit in 2009. It was officially commissioned by the G20 to provide observation reports and policy recommendations for the global financial system, sponsored and led by the Bank for International Settlements.</p><p>The G20 is working with the IMF, the World Bank, and the BIS to discuss the complexity of the GSC in terms of practice and technology, including design and interoperability, and assess the potential and challenges of CBDC in cross-border payments. By the end of 2022, the G20 will work with the IMF, the World Bank, and BIS to complete the framework for regulating stablecoins and research on the design, technology, and experiments of&nbsp;CBDC.</p> The IMF issued a report showing that CBDC has potential, but it cannot solve all&nbsp;problems <p>A report issued by the IMF on October 16 stated that CBDC may benefit those countries that wish to increase control over their monetary policy, but it will not solve all&nbsp;crises.</p><p>The IMF pointed out that new digital currencies including CBDC and GSC had attracted regulatory attention. CBDC and GSC can reduce transaction costs through competition, broaden service channels through mobile devices, and promote financial inclusion. The cross-border use of digital currency will also bring risks and policy challenges. For countries with economic downturns, CBDC is not a panacea solution. It cannot save those countries with high inflation rates or similar domestic problems.</p><p>The report concluded that CBDC had not yet qualitatively changed the global pattern of currencies, but it may intensify the effects of currency substitution and currency internationalization. And if the GSC and the existing currency have the same accounting unit, it may have a currency effect similar to that of CBDC, and at the same time, there is a potential threat to financial stability. If a new GSC with an independent accounting unit appears (e.g. a new currency with a basket of currencies as a reserve), it can also provide better financial services, but it will have a more profound impact on global currency and financial stability.</p> Tips <p>This is what we’re sharing in this MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report, welcome to stay tuned for follow-up crypto stablecoin reports.

<p>Over the past few months Mydex CIC has been working for the Scottish Government on a project to test whether an ‘attribute led’ approach to public service provision can work. <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/05/13/digital-identity-scotland-prototype-draws-to-a-close/">The good news is: it can indeed work</a>, and that opens up a whole new world of opportunity for citizens, Government and service providers.</p><p>Under the approach we tested, public sector organisations provide individuals with verified attributes (details about them which have been checked using rigorous processes). Individuals store these attributes in their own Attribute (or personal data) Store, and can then share these attributes with other public sector service providers as and when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>We need this sort of approach because. when applying for and using public services, the personal data citizens need to provide can range over many different aspects of their lives, to some depth (in some cases). Creating the infrastructure for sharing verified attributes means that the right bundles of data can be put together quickly, efficiently and safely — in ways that protect the citizen’s data and privacy. (<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">Verified attributes are bits of information</a> about individuals that have been generated or checked by responsible organisations using robust, widely accepted processes.)</p><p>By equipping citizens with the means to accumulate and share this information in a safe, easy and secure manner it is possible to achieve significant reductions in friction, effort, risk and cost for both citizens themselves and service providers.</p><p>In the prototype work we tested all the independent components that need to work together to deliver a resilient, scalable system. This system is designed to place citizens at the centre of data sharing about themselves, empowering them with their own attribute store, with the ability to reuse verified data about themselves on an ongoing basis. Key areas of work included testing different ways of authenticating the identity of participants, ensuring the robustness of all necessary technical underpinnings (such as APIs), working with citizens to design user-journeys that are easy and intuitive, and addressing related communications issues.</p><p>For those interested in the details, <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Attribute-Prototype-Report-new.pdf">the full report is available here</a>.</p> Taking the next&nbsp;steps <p>Thanks to the success of this prototyping work the Scottish Government is now able to move on to the next stage:<a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/"> a ‘beta phase’</a> that will test the operation of this approach in practice. If this beta phase is successful, it could bring far ranging benefits to citizens, service providers and Government, making it much easier and cheaper for public services to be provided and used whilst improving outcomes and the speeding up of access to services citizens&nbsp;need.</p><p>But it also has bigger implications. The provision of Attribute Stores by which citizens can receive and share these Verified Attributes changes the architecture of personal data collection and use — moving it from a situation where service providers are the only ones gathering and storing the information they need, with citizens holding none of this information, to a situation where some of the data service providers need is stored separately from them (in the citizen’s Attribute Store) and accessed when needed. <a href="https://futurescot.com/digital-identity-service-could-be-used-from-birth-to-create-lifetime-records-for-every-scot/?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=97043733&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D1gas4oYmIQVhegdjVUK8L5-zuu18ngjg7HV6aIJE83InLTdOCiojxuOK0zStkqtr6tpUiDTsVe6V7OJH5hRz0PQ3ag&amp;utm_content=97043733&amp;utm_source=hs_email">For a press article on this, see&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>In the longer term, the creation of this new, independent layer of data sharing infrastructure could radically change how exactly how our digital economy works. What’s needed for this however, is an effective implementation strategy. We’ll discuss this in our next&nbsp;blog.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">Proving Verified Attributes Work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology is Now Officially a Technical Provider for Enterprise Solutions through Cointelegraph Consulting  May this be just the beginning. <p>For a thorough adoption of blockchain technology, the road must go through enterprises — this is something we have always known at Ontology, and with the recent addition by Cointelegraph Consulting to its technical provider list after a rigorous screening, we are more confident than ever that enterprise solutions will be a cornerstone to not just the success at Ontology, but the entire blockchain industry as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/advertise#:~:text=Cointelegraph%20is%20the%20leading%20media,million%20unique%20visitors%20per%20month.">With over 5 million unique visitors each month and over 17 million page views</a>, Cointelegraph has rapidly established itself as one of the media anchors in the blockchain space. But the readers it attracts aren’t merely traders, enthusiasts, or bitcoin fiends — rather, Cointelegraph has quietly established itself as a legitimate mediator between established enterprises and blockchain technology providers. As a result, a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/consulting">consulting arm</a> was launched that aims to “…connect the world between blockchain and traditional institutions of all sizes by bringing wider adoption of digital assets and enterprise-grade blockchain solutions through education and professional consulting services.”</p><p>In many ways, this match between Cointelegraph Consulting and Ontology was a predetermined match, as illustrated by the pre-existing enterprise case studies implemented by Ontology. The most recent example, with Daimler Mobility, saw the implementation of Ontology’s DeID to allow users to customize and personally manage their automotive experiences regardless of the car they’re sitting in. A decentralized identity solution is at the forefront of blockchain technology and provides unlimited potential for organizations since much of the digital trend these days revolves around data &amp; identity protection.</p><p>Another example of the pre-existing enterprise implementations is Ontology’s partnership with Kaiyun Motors and OGQ. By providing the technical support for a public chain, Kaiyun Motors has been able to store over 2 million data sets ranging from claims on autonomous vehicles, to real-time wear and tear data during last-mile logistics. Not only has this potentially saved lives on the road, but it has also possibly drastically cut down costs on claims and overdue maintenances for Kaiyun Motors. As for OGQ, Ontology’s public chain has recorded over 250 million pieces of digital asset content that have been uploaded on OGQ and granted over 14 million content creators to immutable possess their digital property such as emojis, images, videos, music, new fonts, stickers, and memes to&nbsp;fans.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.sagamarket.io/"> SAGA market</a> is another real-case application for Ontology’s public chain as over 200,000+ users and 10,000+ ecosystem partners rely on SAGA to access streams of decentralized data ranging from foreign exchanges to meteorology.</p><p>In addition to these in-depth case studies provided, Ontology also offers a series of enterprise solutions in the following sectors:</p>  <a href="https://ont.io/automotive">Automotive</a>: Component Authentication, simplifying the supply chain, and automating claim processes.  <a href="https://ont.io/marketplace">Data Marketplace:</a> Lowering transaction costs, adding a layer of security, improving data quality, and ensuring proper data&nbsp;access.  <a href="https://ont.io/attestation">Data Attestation:</a> Certification of data and identity, as well as providing proof of existence.  <a href="https://ont.io/finance">Digital Finance:</a> 5,000+ transactions per second, ONT ID to simplify the KYC&nbsp;process.  <p>Moving forward, Ontology will be <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/consulting/vendors">officially listed</a> on Cointelegraph’s vendor page, as will be the case studies we mentioned above in addition to others. By focusing on decentralized identities, Ontology is able to provide a wide range of use cases for enterprises of all sectors. This doesn’t even take into account the newly launched <a href="https://ontscore.com/">OScore</a>, a self-sovereign credit evaluation system based on user data stored on the Ontology blockchain — which also fully integrates with ONT ID to give users an added layer of identity protection, and control over who gets to access their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>We look forward to potential new use cases of implementing Ontology’s robust set of technical solutions for enterprise-grade problems.

Everyone is pretty much focused on one thing right now. Today is election day in the U.S. And while for some, a result either way amounts to an existential crisis, for Big Tech, it doesn’t really matter who&nbsp;wins. <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-doesnt-much-care-who-wins-2020-election-5265548d-df6a-4a24-b387-1f0e147056ed.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The big picture: Individuals in tech are as passionate and fingernail-biting about Tuesday’s election as any other Americans. But the path ahead for the massive companies that have seized the industry’s reins over the past decade will only alter incrementally based on the polls’&nbsp;outcome.</blockquote><p>On regulations:</p><blockquote>Trump’s term saw a dramatic shift toward government action against tech firms. The Justice Department has sued Google, action against Facebook by states and the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly imminent, and investigations of both Apple and Amazon remain&nbsp;open.</blockquote>  These processes are all ostensibly non-partisan and theoretically unaffected by a change in administration.But in practice, a new attorney general could soft-pedal or even scrap the Google&nbsp;suit.  Democrats have their own reasons for pursuing action against the big companies — but unlike Republicans, they’re less focused on claims of censorship and more on the concentration of corporate power and the spread of misinformation.  <blockquote>The bottom line: Whoever wins the White House, scrutiny of tech’s allegedly monopolistic behavior will continue.</blockquote><p>A Biden presidency could see the issue of privacy elevated, but given everything else going on at the moment, don’t expect it to be a priority in the short&nbsp;term:</p><blockquote>Tech companies control the hardware and software that shapes our public and private communications, and that has placed them at the center of a million controversies.</blockquote>  We hold them responsible when their platforms become channels for misinformation and hate speech, and we blame them when their collection of personal data becomes intrusive or&nbsp;harmful.  <blockquote>Democrats have typically been readier than Republicans to favor stricter privacy rules and tougher controls on online misinformation, and if they win the White House and Congress, they might find ways to advance legislation that has long been&nbsp;stalled.</blockquote>  But a Democratic administration would have a long list of priorities ahead of such&nbsp;action.  <blockquote>Be smart: Some tech leaders — most prominently, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg — have practically begged the government to enact nationwide (and preferably lenient) nationwide laws on privacy and content moderation. They’d love to stop winging their way through one ethical minefield after another and just play by some standard, easy-to-follow rules.</blockquote><p>A Biden administration likely won’t focus as much on platform bans such as TikTok and WeChat, but tensions with China will continue and a divided internet is still on the&nbsp;table:</p><blockquote>The bottom line: Regardless of who wins the U.S. election, tech leaders expect U.S.-China tensions to continue, since each side sees the other as a long-term existential threat — but they also hope in the short term to keep getting what they need and selling what they&nbsp;can.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/trumps-campaign-website-hacked-by-cryptocurrency-scammers/">Trump’s campaign website hacked by cryptocurrency scammers — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/dutch-hacker-trump-twitter-account-password/">President Trump’s Twitter accessed by security expert who guessed password ‘maga2020!’ — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W85QiwL7qiU">Krystal and Saagar: The WORST Moments From The Big Tech Congressional Hearing</a>  <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/scoop-polls-show-support-for-tech-antitrust-action/">Scoop: Polls show support for tech antitrust action</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/for-tech-ceos-capitol-hill-is-now-mandatory-c0da9092-f9af-4e5c-a24d-04867979dccc.html">For tech CEOs, Capitol Hill is now mandatory</a>   2. And so regardless of who wins tomorrow (or whenever they figure out the results), there’s still a pandemic going on. 2021 will see us continue building on all the trends from&nbsp;2020. <p>Here’s Ina&nbsp;Fried:</p><blockquote>The big picture: As mentioned above, tech faces pressures on the privacy and antitrust fronts, but the pandemic has also accelerated the digitization of even the most change-resistant parts of society, including health&nbsp;care.</blockquote><p>And Karen&nbsp;Weise:</p><blockquote>“It is a ‘big, getting bigger’ moment in general we’re seeing. Which ties in, of course, to the antitrust focus and stuff that’s happening right now. The pandemic is obviously aberrational, but we’ve seen that everything reinforces existing patterns in many&nbsp;ways.”</blockquote><p>Nothing we didn’t already know. 2021 will be an exciting year for GlobaliD.</p> 3. If election results won’t have much of an impact on Big Tech’s path, a Biden win could hurt Facebook. <p>According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-facebook-has-the-most-to-lose-from-biden-democratic-victories">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>If Democrats sweep to power next week, as several pollsters predict, Facebook’s already lowly political fortunes are likely to take a sharp turn for the worse, Democratic congressional staffers and lobbyists say.</blockquote><blockquote>While the entire tech industry is fighting off demands by lawmakers for more regulation, Facebook is especially hard up for friends in Democratic circles, which could leave it on the outside as a possible Biden administration and Democratic Congress debate the future of the tech industry. Inside Facebook, some executives are bracing themselves for a tougher time if the political pendulum swings away from the Republicans, said a person familiar with the company’s thinking.</blockquote><blockquote>In recent years, Democrats’ ire toward Facebook has grown because of a perception that the social media app has become a conduit for President Trump and right-wing groups to spread disinformation and dehumanizing speech. They are still seething over Facebook’s failure to identify and block Russian actors from spreading disinformation to aid Trump during the 2016 presidential election.</blockquote><blockquote>“Facebook is seen as having sucked up to the Trump administration and had a profoundly negative effect on the culture of America and — in particular — of political dialogue,” said Blair Levin, a Washington-based policy analyst for New Street Research, a boutique Wall Street research&nbsp;firm.</blockquote><p>The end&nbsp;result?</p><blockquote>But a swing in political power to the Democrats could further minimize the company’s role in critical debates looming in Congress over the next year. Those debates are expected to include proposals to reform antitrust laws, aimed at making it easier for regulators to force tech companies to unwind their past acquisitions and to change the legal immunity that protects them from lawsuits over user-posted content. On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was among a handful of tech CEOs who appeared at a Senate committee hearing to discuss Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides that legal immunity.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-fb-3q-earnings-report-2020-11603992607?mod=djem10point">Facebook Posts Record Revenue Despite Ad&nbsp;Boycott</a>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2020-earnings-204642328.html?mc_cid=6fb48796ba&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">Facebook is losing users in the US and&nbsp;Canada</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-facebook-has-the-most-to-lose-from-biden-democratic-victories">Why Facebook Has the Most to Lose From Biden, Democratic Victories</a>   4. Speaking of Facebook, they recently launched their new streaming game app, but it won’t be available on&nbsp;iOS. <p>Because Apple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/26/facebook-launches-cloud-games-on-desktop-and-android-but-not-on-ios.html">won’t allow&nbsp;it</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook could bring cloud gaming to iOS if it enables the new product on the mobile web version of its service, but the company wants users to go to its apps instead, said Jason Rubin, Facebook’s vice president of special gaming initiatives.</blockquote><blockquote>“We don’t want people going to web Facebook 20 times a day. We have a great app,” Rubin said. “We would have to use Apple’s technology and browser on iOS, and that isn’t optimized to the benefit of cloud&nbsp;games.”</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook cloud gaming on iOS would allow iPhone and iPad users to find out what games their friends are playing, see lists that show top games on Facebook or play games with Facebook-unique features, Rubin&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“In many ways, consumers are being hampered,” Rubin&nbsp;said.</blockquote> 5.

Congrats to Indicio — who are a stage one finalist in The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) Trusted User Interface for Digital Wallets Challenge <p><a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-is-a-finalist-for-dhs-digital-wallets-user-interface-challenge/">Indicio</a> (via&nbsp;Maya):</p><blockquote>A digital wallet is an application that enables people to use verifiable digital credentials to prove who they are and to share information about themselves in a trustworthy, secure way, without the need for third parties to hold or manage that information.</blockquote><blockquote>The goal of the DHS Challenge is to design a user interface (UI) so that the process of using a wallet to access and perform these functions is clear, intuitive, consistent, and efficient.</blockquote><blockquote>On Tuesday, October 27, 2020, Indicio and the two other finalists presented and discussed their wallet designs before a panel composed of representatives of the DHS Science and Technology Directorate, DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, US Customs and Border Protection, US Department of Education, and the US Department of&nbsp;State.</blockquote><blockquote>To become a stage one finalist, Indicio had to demonstrate that the wallet could be used to obtain a verifiable credential from an issuer, such as a Digital Permanent Resident Card from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. That credential had to be acquired in a way that demonstrated consent, and presented for verification to a verifier in a way that allowed for selective disclosure of personal information. The solution had to support the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Verifiable Credential Data Model</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DID) standards/specifications</a>.

					 <p>As the developer platform for verifiable credentials, Trinsic has focused on abstracting the complexities of advanced open source technologies and protocols away into easy-to-use APIs &amp; SDKs used by hundreds of developers. We’ve also pioneered digital wallets in both technology and user experience, releasing the first wallet to achieve multi-vendor interoperability and introducing the iconic card-like UI which has other vendors around the world following suit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we are pleased to launch the next big innovation for our developers and mobile app users.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Introducing interactive connections 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>At Trinsic, we seek to provide developers with the best, most flexible tooling for implementing any use case. That’s why after <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">pioneering connectionless credential exchange</a>, we’re now pleased to support connections that are more useful and powerful than ever before. This brings flexibility and additional functionality to the hundreds of developers and companies that build on Trinsic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Current digital wallet implementations fall short of the vision of self-sovereign identity (SSI) because they only allow wallet holders to respond to, not initiate, interactions with institutions. This reduces wallet holders to a passive role, which at best delivers suboptimal utility to the holder, and at worst can reinforce the unhealthy power asymmetries between institutions and people that exist today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive connections solve this problem by creating a two-way street between a wallet holder and an institution. Instead of a passive responder, the wallet holder is a peer who can initiate actions of their own. In addition, wallet holders can interact not only with institutions, but also with other wallet holders, to communicate securely and share verified information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive connections are supported in the new Trinsic Wallet 3.1.0 release available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streetcred-identity-agent/id1475160728">App Store for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.streetcred.apps.mobile">Play Store for Android</a>. Like the other features in the Trinsic platform, interactive connections will continue to evolve over time based on the needs of our developer community. We’ve implemented four new features that help us get closer to the rich interactions people should expect with SSI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Proactive credential sharing  Interoperable chat messaging  Activity log  Connection invitation   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Sharing your credentials proactively 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Historically, wallet holders couldn’t share information from their credentials unless someone requested it through something called a verification request (or ‘proof’/’presentation’ request). That means you wouldn’t be able to share, for example, your business card with a new connection, or your address with someone who needed directions to your home, unless those people somehow conjured up a presentation request to send you first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can now share information from your credentials in a way that others can verify instantly conveniently from the Trinsic Wallet. When sharing credentials proactively, make sure 1) you and your connection are using the same network and 2) both of you have the Trinsic Wallet mobile app open throughout the credential sharing process.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Interoperable chat messaging 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Basic messaging functionality has been highly-requested ever since we removed messaging during our rebrand from Streetcred ID to Trinsic. It was a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">favorite feature of many</a>. Use cases range from the practical—eg., what if your name was misspelled in a credential offer—to the critical—developers in the UK and USA have created local contact tracing solutions using messaging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We chose to implement the feature using DIDComm—specifically the Aries Basic Message <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0095-basic-message">RFC 0095</a>—and display it in a chat-like interface on the Trinsic Wallet. That means messaging is interoperable between Trinsic and any other Aries-based implementations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Integrating communication and credential exchange tightly in a single experience ensures developers have the tools they need to create rich experiences with their users. The Trinsic API supports messaging (in beta) and has been used to send thousands of messages by a handful of developers. Our next release will include full messaging support in the API, SDKs, and documentation.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Activity log 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A historical log of activities with a given connection can now be found in the chat interface of the mobile application. You can view:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  messages you’ve sent or received  credentials you’ve shared or received  credentials others have shared with you  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our beta testers unanimously preferred embedding the activity inline with chat messages. At Trinsic, we frequently call upon familiar mental models to explain complex topics, like we did by introducing the credential card design to the market. Displaying historical credential exchange in a chat-like format invokes a similarly familiar mental model, making credential exchange even more accessible to people everywhere.</p>

					 <p>You can now connect with anyone by creating your own connection invitation. Instead of waiting for a QR code to scan, you can now create your own QR code. You can also send a connection invitation to someone through email, SMS, WeChat, or whatever your preferred method of communication is.</p>
