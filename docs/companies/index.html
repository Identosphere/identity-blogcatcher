<p>“Disinformation. Misinformation. Malinformation. These terms get used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing.” </p>



<p>That distinction matters when designing resilient infrastructure that supports trust.</p>



 
 Misinformation is false or misleading information shared without intent to deceive. 



 Disinformation is deliberately deceptive content, often politically or financially motivated. 



 Malinformation is factual information used out of context to cause harm. 
 



<p>Most of our efforts to address these problems focus on content, activities like fact-checking, moderation, and takedown requests. And those are important. But after sitting through multiple sessions at <a href="https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2025/">WSIS+20</a> last month, I came away thinking about the architectures that enable or undermine digital trust in the first place. (Did you see my post <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/07/29/wsis20-and-identity-governance/">last week</a> on learnings from WSIS+20?)</p>



<p>Remember, trust doesn’t start with content. It actually starts with infrastructure.</p>



<p>The people in those WSIS+20 rooms weren’t talking about disinformation in the abstract. They were talking about humanitarian workers in the field, where timely, accurate, and secure information can be a matter of life and death. They talked about public health campaigns, peacekeeping missions, and journalists trying to survive in an environment where lies move faster than truth. And in almost every session, it became clear that the technical underpinnings of the Internet—especially in crisis and conflict settings—are being overlooked.</p>

 Identity is part of the equation 



<p>While identity wasn’t explicitly discussed in these sessions, it’s a critical part of establishing authenticity, which in turn helps build trust. IAM systems can’t prevent disinformation, but they can help validate source integrity and support accountability.</p>



 
 Verified senders can be identified without compromising privacy. 



 Digital credentials can establish provenance for content or data. (Shout out to the <a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a> work here!) 



 Attribute-based access can help ensure information reaches the right people in the right roles. 
 



<p>I’m not promoting centralized control or surveillance. What I want is to build confidence in the systems we rely on to make decisions, especially in high-stakes environments.</p>



 Disinformation and infrastructure resilience 



<p>Something I thought about as I settled down with my notes after the event, though it wasn’t phrased this way quite like this during any of the sessions: When infrastructure fails, it doesn’t just disrupt services; it disrupts the foundation of trust that identity and information systems rely on. Several sessions at WSIS+20 focused on resilient digital infrastructure, especially in the context of sustainability and the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Speakers from IEEE, CERN, and disaster risk reduction agencies reminded us that resilience is more than just a technical property; it’s what enables everything. Disinformation thrives when infrastructure fails. That includes failures of availability, integrity, and interoperability. When identity systems falter, the ability to authenticate sources, validate messages, and maintain digital trust during crisis response suffers, too.</p>



 
 Digital infrastructure often isn’t designed to serve people in remote or underserved areas. 



 Technical standards don’t always account for multilingual or multi-platform accessibility. 



 Short-term, market-driven decisions prioritize scalability over long-term resilience. 
 



<p>Standards developers and IAM professionals know this at a technical level. Heck, I wrote about this a few weeks ago in a post on <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/07/01/resilience-in-standards/">resilience in standards.</a> But what’s often missed is how infrastructure failure becomes a governance issue. When people lose trust in digital systems, they distrust more than just the failed platform. They also start to distrust institutions and even each other.</p>



 Resilience isn’t for other people 



<p>IAM systems face similar challenges: do we build for edge cases, or optimize for the majority? Whose threat model are we prioritizing? How do we balance user experience with verifiability?</p>



<p>Just to make it more complicated, there is the fact that technology designed to protect can also exclude.</p>



 
 Overly strict verification requirements can lock out vulnerable populations. 



 Misapplied protections can be used to suppress journalism or advocacy. 



 “Safety” features can become surveillance tools in the wrong hands. 
 



<p>Even well-intentioned systems can marginalize people when their design doesn’t include a wide range of needs and experiences.</p>



<p>If we want to fight disinformation at scale, we need to stop thinking of it as just a content problem. It’s an infrastructure problem. And digital identity experts and standards architects have a role to play.</p>



 Closing the loop: From resilience back to disinformation 



<p>The sections above touched on how resilient, inclusive infrastructure supports digital trust. But let’s not lose sight of the central theme: disinformation. It spreads most easily where infrastructure is brittle, trust is low, and identity signals are weak or absent. That’s why the work of IAM professionals and standards developers matters—not just for security or compliance, but for defending the conditions in which truth can survive.</p>



 So, what can identity professionals do? 



<p>I love it when a plan comes together, and the plan here is to think about fighting disinformation and improving the resilience of our systems.</p>



 
 Treat resilience as a design goal: Build IAM systems that account for low-connectivity, low-trust environments. 



 Make authenticity an architectural concern: Support verifiable claims, provenance metadata, and strong-but-private identifiers. 



 Engage in governance conversations: Push for feedback loops between standards bodies, policymakers, and civil society. Ask who is being served and who isn’t. 
 



 And what can standards architects do? 



 
 Define and document trust assumptions: Clearly state what the system assumes about message integrity, source authenticity, and the broader infrastructure. Make those assumptions visible and testable. 



 Design for degraded conditions: Create standards that support verifiability even when connectivity is intermittent, metadata is partial, or infrastructure is compromised. 



 Include threat models beyond fraud: Consider disinformation campaigns, information suppression, and adversarial use of identity signals in your threat models. 



 Build consultation into the process: Include journalists, humanitarian responders, civil society groups, and policy experts in standards development. Their use cases will expand your view of what “interoperable” and “resilient” really mean. 
 



 Building for trust means building for everyone 



<p>Trust isn’t just about whether users believe your system is secure. It’s about whether they believe the Internet is still a place where truth can be found and relied upon. That belief erodes when digital systems exclude marginalized, underserved, and underrepresented users, whose experiences and threat models are often left out of design decisions. And that erosion creates fertile ground for disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation to take root.</p>



<p>This connection wasn’t made explicitly in the WSIS+20 sessions, but it became clear to me: trust in digital systems isn’t separate from trust in public discourse. If we want to defend the truth, we have to build systems that serve the whole public, not just the easy parts of it.</p>



<p>If we want to fight disinformation at scale, we need to stop thinking of it as just a content problem. It’s an infrastructure problem, and identity has a role to play.</p>



<p>This work is messy. It spans disciplines, sectors, and priorities. But if we want trustworthy systems, we have to build them with and for the people who rely on them most. That starts with looking beyond our immediate use cases and asking harder questions about who benefits, who’s left out, and what it means to build for trust in a world where truth itself is contested.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest<br>[00:00:04]</p>



<p>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity — from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 What Is Disinformation, Really? 



<p>[00:00:29]</p>



<p>Disinformation. Misinformation. Malinformation.</p>



<p>They may sound similar, but these terms have crucial differences. And if we want to design digital systems that truly support trust and accountability, those differences matter.</p>



<p>This week, I’m sharing an unexpected takeaway from my time at WSIS+20 in Geneva. I left that event with a strong belief that disinformation isn’t just a content problem — it’s an infrastructure problem.</p>



<p>And that infrastructure includes identity.</p>



 



 Defining the Terms 



<p>[00:01:05]</p>



<p>Let’s start with some clear definitions — because words matter.</p>



 
 Misinformation is false or misleading information shared without intent to deceive. Think: hearing a rumor and passing it along without realizing it’s untrue. 



 Disinformation is intentionally deceptive, crafted and spread to influence behavior or opinion, often politically or financially. 



 Malinformation is true, but used maliciously — like doxing someone or leaking sensitive context to cause harm. 
 



<p>Most efforts to combat these focus on content — fact-checking, takedowns, moderation policies. And that work is vital.</p>



<p>But what I heard in the WSIS sessions wasn’t just about policies. It was about digital infrastructure.</p>



 



 Real-World Impact: Why Infrastructure Matters 



<p>[00:02:00]</p>



<p>Here are a few stories that helped this hit home:</p>



 
 Humanitarian workers struggling to communicate securely in conflict zones. 



 Journalists fighting to survive and tell the truth amid algorithmic lies. 



 Peacekeeping missions and public health campaigns racing to get accurate information out before disinformation spreads faster. 
 



<p>In all these cases, trust didn’t hinge on whether someone flagged a tweet. It depended on whether the underlying systems could support or sabotage the truth.</p>



 



 Technical Failures Become Governance Failures 



<p>[00:03:02]</p>



<p>If your network goes down, people will turn to unofficial channels.<br>If your logs are incomplete or timestamps unverifiable, message integrity falls apart.<br>If your system can’t authenticate a sender, how do you know whether or not to act?</p>



<p>That’s not just a technical failure — it’s a governance failure.</p>



<p>And when people lose trust in digital systems, the consequences ripple outward:</p>



 
 Trust in platforms erodes 



 Trust in institutions falters 



 Trust in each other breaks down 
 



 



 Where Identity Comes Into Play 



<p>[00:03:45]</p>



<p>Interestingly, identity wasn’t a primary topic in most disinformation sessions. But it kept showing up — just at the edges.</p>



<p>Because when you ask:</p>



 
 Who sent this message? 



 Has it been tampered with? 



 Is this authentic? 
 



<p>You’re really asking identity questions.</p>



<p>Identity systems can help us answer those questions without sacrificing privacy, by:</p>



 
 Establishing provenance 



 Enabling verified senders to be trusted faster 



 Supporting credentials that show who said what, and when 



 Ensuring information flows to the right people at the right time 
 



<p>While identity and access management alone can’t solve the disinformation crisis, they’re essential tools in restoring trust in the systems where that information travels.</p>



 



 Designing for True Resilience 



<p>[00:04:50]</p>



<p>Another recurring theme at WSIS+20 was resilience. Not just uptime and backups — real resilience.</p>



<p>How systems perform in messy, unpredictable, even dangerous environments.</p>



<p>Sessions on sustainability, infrastructure, and disaster response included speakers from IEEE, CERN, physicists, and others who manage risk daily.</p>



<p>One takeaway stuck with me:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Resilience isn’t just technical — it’s a social contract.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When resilience breaks down, we’re breaking that contract. We’re designing for the well-connected, the resourced, the mainstream — not for:</p>



 
 Remote communities 



 Multilingual populations 



 Low-trust or high-risk environments 
 



<p>And identity systems? They struggle with this all the time.</p>



 



 Exclusion Creates Fertile Ground for Disinformation 



<p>[00:06:02]</p>



<p>Strict verification protects against fraud. But what if you’re a displaced person without documents?</p>



<p>In trying to protect, we often exclude. And where people are excluded, disinformation grows.</p>



<p>Because people turn to what’s available. If trustworthy systems aren’t available — or don’t work for them — they’ll turn to anything that is.</p>



<p>So bringing this back full circle, disinformation thrives where:</p>



 
 Systems can’t verify sources 



 Users don’t trust what they see 



 Infrastructure fails or excludes 
 



<p>If your digital trust infrastructure — identity included — only works in ideal conditions, then you’ve built perfect conditions for disinformation.</p>



 



 Why Identity Standards Matter 



<p>[00:07:01]</p>



<p>Identity and access management (IAM) standards matter because they define the defaults.</p>



<p>They determine:</p>



 
 What’s interoperable 



 What can be verified 



 Whether truth can be seen, heard, and trusted 
 



<p>So if you’re an identity professional, what can you actually do?</p>



 



 What Identity Professionals Can Do 



<p>[00:07:25]</p>



<p>Here are some tangible steps to start with:</p>



 
 Treat resilience as a design goal<br>Consider low-connectivity and low-trust environments. Build for those, too. 



 Make authenticity an architectural concern<br>Support verifiable claims, embed provenance, and use privacy-preserving identifiers. 



 Engage in governance conversations<br>Don’t outsource this to policymakers. Collaborate with:
 
 Standards groups 



 Civil society 



 Policymakers 



 Employers 
 
 
 



<p>Ask hard questions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who’s being served? Who’s being left out?</p>
</blockquote>



 



 For Standards Architects: You Are My People 



<p>[00:08:20]</p>



<p>If you work on protocols, specs, or standards, here’s your to-do list:</p>



 
 Define layout and trust assumptions<br>Spell out what the system presumes about message integrity and infrastructure. 



 Design for degraded conditions<br>Don’t assume perfect metadata or nonstop uptime. 



 Think beyond fraud<br>Include disinformation, suppression, and misuse in your threat models. 



 Build consultation into the process<br>Bring in:
 
 Journalists 



 Emergency responders 



 Civil society leaders 
 
 
 



<p>Their use cases will expand your understanding and improve your solutions.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts: Trust as a Design Mandate 



<p>[00:09:30]</p>



<p>Trust isn’t just about security. It’s about whether people believe in digital systems at all.</p>



<p>When systems exclude people — by design or by neglect — trust erodes.<br>And in that erosion, disinformation thrives.</p>



<p>That’s what stood out to me most at WSIS+20.</p>



<p>If we want to fight mis-, dis-, and malinformation, we can’t just treat it as a content problem.</p>



<p>We must treat it as an infrastructure problem.</p>



<p>And identity professionals and standards architects?<br>We’re part of the solution.</p>



<p>It’s messy work. Cross-disciplinary. Politically thorny. Often frustrating.<br>But if we want trustworthy systems, we must build them for everyone — not just the easy users.</p>



<p>So keep asking:</p>



 
 Who’s benefiting? 



 Who’s being left out? 
 



<p>Make it explicit. Even if it’s uncomfortable.</p>



<p>What does it really mean to build for trust, in a world where truth itself is constantly contested?</p>



<p>Food for thought. And thank you for listening.</p>

<p>Real estate professionals in Canada are under increasing pressure to detect financial crime risks, verify source of funds, and document transactions with greater accuracy. This article explores how firms can modernize AML compliance and implement seamless ID and fund verification to align with new FINTRAC expectations in 2025.</p>
 
 In recent years, Canada’s real estate market has become a focal point in the country’s fight against money laundering. From the Cullen Commission in British Columbia to new enforcement guidance from FINTRAC, regulators are calling for stronger controls on source of funds (SoF) verification, politically exposed person (PEP) screening, and recordkeeping across all phases of real estate transactions. 
<p>Whether you’re a broker, law firm, developer, or mortgage specialist, the message is clear: AML in real estate is no longer optional or reactive – it must be continuous, defensible, and digitally enabled.</p>
 AML Risk in Canadian Real Estate 
<p>According to the Cullen Commission’s findings, real estate has been used extensively to launder proceeds of crime through:</p>
 
 Anonymous corporate ownership structures 
 All-cash or mortgage-free purchases 
 Layered legal or nominee arrangements 
 Limited scrutiny on source of wealth and funds 
 
<p>As a result, FINTRAC and provincial regulators now expect:</p>
 
 Identity verification of buyers, sellers, and intermediaries 
 Screening for PEPs and sanctions lists 
 Verification of source of funds for high-risk transactions 
 Retention of detailed records for compliance audits 
 
 Challenges Facing Real Estate Professionals 
<p>1. Fast-Moving Transactions<br>
Closings often occur in days, not weeks, leaving little time for thorough due diligence.</p>
<p>2. Multi-Party Workflows<br>
Agents, lawyers, lenders, and title insurers all play a role, but often lack a unified system for compliance.</p>
<p>3. Paper-Based Verification<br>
Manual document checks or emailed PDFs increase human error and audit vulnerability.</p>
<p>4. Increasing Expectations Without Clear Tools<br>
Few real estate platforms offer seamless AML functionality built-in—leaving professionals exposed.</p>
 How iComply Helps Canadian Real Estate Professionals 
<p>iComply provides a purpose-built compliance platform that streamlines real estate onboarding, risk screening, and documentation across all stakeholders.</p>
 1. Identity Verification &amp; Screening 
 
 Verify buyer, seller, or trustee identity via secure, edge-based document checks 
 Screen for sanctions, PEP status, and adverse media in real time 
 Reduce onboarding friction with a white-labeled portal 
 
 2. Source of Funds Verification 
 
 Collect proof of funds documents (bank statements, pay stubs, letters of employment) 
 Trigger enhanced due diligence for high-risk geographies or transaction sizes 
 Maintain encrypted document trails for FINTRAC review 
 
 3. Multi-Party Case Collaboration 
 
 Connect agents, lawyers, and underwriters in a single compliance file 
 Assign responsibilities and review logs within the platform 
 Avoid duplication and data leakage 
 
 4. Audit-Ready Logs and Reporting 
 
 Track all actions taken, documents reviewed, and risk decisions made 
 Export audit logs to support FINTRAC reviews or provincial regulator inspections 
 
 Case Insight: Vancouver Brokerage 
<p>A mid-sized real estate firm in Vancouver adopted iComply to improve due diligence on international buyers. Results:</p>
 
 Reduced average onboarding time by 60% 
 Detected three high-risk entities linked to offshore trusts 
 Passed a FINTRAC examination with a favourable rating 
 
 What to Expect in 2025 
 
 Mandatory SoF Checks: FINTRAC is expected to formalize source of funds verification as a standard requirement for higher-risk real estate transactions 
 Shared Responsibility Models: Regulators may clarify roles and expectations across brokers, lenders, and counsel 
 Provincial-Federal Alignment: Expect closer cooperation between real estate councils and federal AML authorities 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Real estate firms that adopt proactive AML strategies today will be best positioned to grow, protect clients, and weather increasing regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>Speak with iComply to see how we help Canadian real estate professionals verify clients, screen for risk, and ensure every transaction is compliance-ready.</p>

 The European Union passes major regulation to allow the private sector to read eIDs via Near Field Communication. 



<p>In a significant milestone in the evolution of Europe’s digital identity framework, the European Commission has adopted <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/1208/oj/eng">Regulation (EU) 2025/1208</a>, which authorizes private sector companies to access key data stored in the chips of electronic identity documents (eIDs), most notably the bearer’s portrait (DG2) via <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">Near Field Communication (NFC)</a> technology.</p>



<p>The regulation, which amends the original Commission Decision 2025/1218, came into force on July 10, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With NFC, identity verification moves from passive image capture to active chip-based validation, fundamentally transforming how businesses can confirm identities across onboarding journeys.</p>



 What’s changed and why it matters. 



<p>Until recently, access to the chip on EU member states’ national ID cards and biometric passports was largely restricted to border authorities. With Regulation 2025/1208 now adopted, private entities can legally read the facial image stored in DG2, provided the holder consents, using NFC technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This opens the door to more accurate, secure, fast, and automated identity proofing across industries like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">financial services</a>, insurance, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gaming</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">telecom</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/nfc-based-id-verification-shared-mobility/">mobility</a>, without compromising on privacy or regulatory integrity.</p>



 Let’s break it down: What’s in the chip? 



<p>eMRTDs (electronic Machine-Readable Travel Documents), such as biometric passports and eID cards, store personal data in a secure chip embedded in the document. This structure follows the globally recognized <a href="https://elibrary.icao.int/product/421430">ICAO 9303 standard,</a> developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which ensures interoperability and security across international borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The chip’s contents are organized into Data Groups (DGs), each designed to hold specific types of information:</p>


 
 
 
 DG1: Machine-readable zone (MRZ) data (e.g. name, date of birth, document number)&nbsp; 
 

<p>Private sector access? Yes.<br>Use case: Retrieve electronic data from ID holder in secure way.</p>

 
 
 
 DG2: Biometric facial image (high-resolution portrait of the bearer) 
 

<p>Private sector access? Yes.<br>Use case: Biometric match to selfie.</p>

 
 
 
 DG3: Fingerprint data (accessible only to border and police authorities) 
 

<p>Private sector access? No.<br>Use case: Reserved for border and police use only.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p>By reading the encrypted data directly from the chip, IDnow’s NFC-enabled verification confirms the authenticity and integrity of the document and the portrait photo, ensuring the person presenting it is its rightful holder.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine you’re checking into a hotel after a long flight. You’re tired, hungry, and just want your key. But instead of fumbling with paperwork, the receptionist simply scans your passport and boom, your details are verified, and you’re all set. No typing. No waiting. No drama.</p>
<p>That seamless experience? It’s powered by passport recognition, a rapidly evolving technology that’s rewriting how we verify identity in real time.</p>
<p>So what’s under the hood of passport recognition, and why does it matter for businesses, governments, and consumers alike? Let’s explore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Passport Recognition? 
<p>Passport recognition refers to the automated process of scanning and extracting information from a passport’s data page using computer vision and AI. It’s often part of a broader ID document recognition SDK, which can process various identity documents beyond passports, such as driver’s licenses or national IDs. It allows machines to identify and authenticate passports with high accuracy and often in seconds.</p>
<p>The core components include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ocr/">Optical Character Recognition</a> (OCR) to extract name, passport number, expiry date, etc.
<p></p> 
 Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ) decoding, where standardized passport data is stored.
<p></p> 
 Document validation using holograms, microprint, and UV patterns.
<p></p> 
 Face matching, comparing the passport photo to a live image or selfie.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Think of it like giving computers the ability to read and verify your passport like a border officer, only faster and with fewer errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Traditional Passport Checks Don’t Cut It Anymore 
<p>Manual passport checks are vulnerable to:</p>
 
 Human error (typos, missed fakes)
<p></p> 
 Delays at airports, hotels, or secure facilities
<p></p> 
 Fraud through forged or tampered documents
<p></p> 
 
<p>In a world where speed and security matter equally, automated passport recognition offers a compelling alternative.</p>
<p>Quick stat: According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 73% of travelers prefer to use biometrics instead of passports for identity verification. That number is growing fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Passport Recognition Technology Works 
<p>Let’s lift the hood and see how the magic happens.</p>
 Step-by-Step Passport Recognition Process: 



Step
Description


1. Image Capture
A camera or mobile device captures the passport’s data page.


2. MRZ Detection
The system locates and isolates the machine-readable zone.


3. OCR Extraction
Characters from the MRZ and other fields are read via OCR.


4. Data Validation
The system checks for authenticity: font, format, expiry date, etc.


5. Face Match (Optional)
Compares the passport photo with a live selfie or stored biometric.



<p>With today’s advanced AI, the whole recognition flow wraps up in under three seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passport Recognition vs Traditional OCR: What’s the Difference?

<p>Passport recognition is not just OCR on steroids it’s an entirely smarter approach built for identity assurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Industries Benefiting from Passport Recognition 
<p>From airports to Airbnb, industries across the board are embedding this technology into their platforms. Here’s where it’s making waves:</p>
  Travel &amp; Border Control 
 
 Automated border gates (e-gates)
<p></p> 
 Self-check-in kiosks
<p></p> 
 Immigration pre-screening
<p></p> 
 
<p>“With passport recognition, airports can reduce processing time by up to 40% during peak hours.” SITA Air Transport IT Insights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Healthcare &amp; Insurance 
 
 ID verification during telehealth appointments
<p></p> 
 Onboarding for digital health insurance
<p></p> 
 Prescription fraud prevention
<p></p> 
 
  Banking &amp; Fintech 
 
 KYC during account registration
<p></p> 
 Cross-border remittance validation
<p></p> 
 Preventing identity fraud in loan applications
<p></p> 
 
  Hospitality &amp; Rentals 
 
 Faster hotel check-ins
<p></p>

<p></p> 
 
  Education &amp; Exams 
 
 Verifying student ID for international admissions
<p></p> 
 Securing online proctoring systems
<p></p> 
 
<p>The bottom line? If you deal with real humans and legal identity documents, passport recognition can tighten your security and smooth your UX.</p>
<p></p>
 The Power of Passport Recognition + Face Verification 
<p>On its own, passport recognition is impressive. But pair it with face verification, and the security multiplies.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 User scans their passport using a smartphone or webcam.
<p></p> 
 System extracts data and photo from the passport.
<p></p> 
 User takes a selfie or a live video.
<p></p> 
 The system uses AI to verify the passport photo against a real-time selfie.
<p></p> 
 Verification result is returned within seconds.
<p></p> 
 
<p>This combo stops impostors in their tracks, including those armed with stolen documents or digital fakes.</p>
<p> Bonus Tip: Want higher fraud resistance? Add <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">id document liveness detection SDK</a> capabilities to confirm the person behind the document is physically present not a still image or a video spoof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advantages of Using Passport Recognition in 2025 
<p>Let’s get specific about the benefits:</p>
  Speed 
<p>Verifies documents in under 3 seconds. Perfect for high-traffic systems and instant KYC.</p>
  Accuracy 
<p>Uses deep learning and AI to extract data with up to 99% accuracy even from worn or wrinkled documents.</p>
  Compliance 
<p>Helps meet global identity regulations like:</p>
 
 <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> (Europe)
<p></p> 
 eIDAS (EU)
<p></p> 
 KYC/AML (Global finance)
<p></p> 
 HIPAA (U.S. Healthcare)
<p></p> 
 
  User Experience 
<p>No long forms. No typos. No delays.</p>
<p>Just scan, verify, done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-World Case Study: How Banks Use Passport Recognition 
<p>A leading European neobank integrated passport recognition into its digital onboarding.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
 
 Manual ID verification took 6–12 hours
<p></p> 
 20% drop-off due to long wait times
<p></p> 
 
<p>After:</p>
 
 Verification in under 60 seconds
<p></p> 
 Conversion rate improved by 37%
<p></p> 
 Fraud attempts decreased by 45%
<p></p> 
 
<p>Talk about ROI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges to Watch Out For 
<p>While powerful, passport recognition isn’t without its hurdles.</p>
  Low-Quality Images 
<p>Crinkled pages, bad lighting, or glare can cause recognition failures. Always guide users to scan in good light.</p>
  Document Forgery 
<p>Some fake passports can bypass simple OCR-only systems. That’s why layered security with AI, facial matching, and liveness detection is a must.</p>
  Device Limitations 
<p>Older mobile devices may struggle with camera quality. Make sure your SDK supports fallback options or minimum device specs.</p>
<p></p>
 Choosing the Right Passport Recognition SDK 
<p>Not all tools are created equal. Here’s what to look for in a solid passport recognition solution:</p>
 
  MRZ extraction &amp; validation
<p></p> 
  Face matching capability
<p></p> 
  Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)
<p></p> 
  Real-time results (&lt; 3 seconds)
<p></p>

<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe that technology, when put to good use, has the power to transform lives and communities. That’s why, when <a href="https://www.bell.ca/">Bell Canada</a>, one of our valued customers and a longstanding champion of youth mental health, invited us to join their annual fundraising golf tournament for <a href="https://kidshelpphone.ca/">Kids Help Phone</a>, we enthusiastically accepted.</p>
 More Than a Game: An Event with Impact 
<p>Every year, Bell Canada brings together the brightest minds from across IT, InfoSec, Fraud, and business leadership for an event that’s about so much more than golf. This gathering is the single most critical fundraising event for Kids Help Phone, the national organization at the forefront of supporting youth in crisis. As the only 24/7 e-mental health service for young people in Canada, Kids Help Phone provides an essential lifeline to children and teens, many of whom have no other support system.</p>
 A Staggering Statistic and a Shared Mission 
<p>A representative from Kids Help Phone shared a striking figure at this year’s event: 75% of children and youth reaching out to the helpline disclose things they’ve never told anyone else. For some, Kids Help Phone is their only resource in moments of vulnerability, fear, or confusion. This statistic underscores the vital importance of the organization’s work, and why sustained support matters.</p>
 Partnering for Good 
<p>For 1Kosmos, participation in this event went far beyond sponsorship. It represented an opportunity to walk alongside Bell Canada in championing cybersecurity, mental wellness, and community care, pillars that are deeply aligned with our own values. It was inspiring to connect with leaders and teams from across the technology spectrum, all united by the goal of uplifting youth and shaping a safer, more supportive future.</p>
 Thank You, Bell Canada and Kids Help Phone 
<p>We extend our deepest thanks to Bell Canada for their vision and leadership in supporting Kids Help Phone, and to the tireless staff and volunteers who make a real difference in the lives of young Canadians every day.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we look forward to continuing our partnership and our shared commitment to protect, empower, and uplift, on and off the golf course.</p>
 Learn More &amp; Keep Kids Safe Online 
<p>To discover more about the essential work of Kids Help Phone or to get involved, visit their website or reach out to their team. We’re grateful to all our partners and peers who joined us on the green in support of children in need.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, our commitment to protecting and empowering the next generation extends beyond secure identity solutions. That’s why we created our “1Kids” video series, a fun, educational program designed to teach kids the basics of online safety and cybersecurity. From spotting phishing scams to protecting personal information, these episodes help kids and families navigate the digital world confidently and securely.</p>
<p>Check out the <a>1Kids</a> video series to help the young people in your life stay safe online, and join us as we continue building a safer, more supportive future for all children.</p>

			 Apex Digital 3.0 is Live – The Future of Finance Starts Now 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>To truly scale tokenisation, we need a global force at the heart of capital markets. A player with the reach, trust, and operational strength to be able to bring all stakeholders out of fragmented and manual systems into the future of on-chain finance.</p>
<p>That player is Apex Group.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Apex Group launched Apex Digital 3.0, the digital infrastructure that seamlessly bridges traditional finance with on-chain finance at scale.</p>
<p>This is a turning point for our industry. Apex Digital 3.0 is not a product, it’s a movement to transform global finance, redefine distribution, and unlock liquidity. For the first time, a global asset servicer now offers blockchain-powered infrastructure for tokenisation and stablecoins, covering everything from regulatory setup, structuring to issuance, compliance, servicing, and global distribution.</p>
<p>In today’s market, launching a tokenised product is slow and fragmented. Issuers must juggle multiple providers, face regulatory complexity, and often wait months, only to end up with limited liquidity and poor distribution. It’s impossible to scale that way.</p>
<p>With Apex Digital 3.0, we’ve changed the game. Everything is integrated. Tokenising existing assets or natively issuing ones on-chain can be done within a few weeks. What’s more, Apex Group clients, who already entrust them to operate over $3.5 trillion in assets, can now move on-chain seamlessly, without changing the tools or workflows they know.</p>
<p>To them, it simply feels like an upgrade, and they will gain new capabilities. It includes 24/7 subscriptions, redemptions, and transfers; access to multiple secondary trading venues and borrowing or lending in a real-time DeFi application. No disruption. Just a next-generation investor experience.</p>
<p>What truly sets Apex Digital 3.0 apart is its ability to bring all stakeholders together, including issuers, investors, allocators, and distributors. Tokenised assets can connect directly with existing investor pools, including through multiple distribution channels and physical events like Apex Invest. This dramatically enhances both liquidity and distribution, solving one of the most critical and long-missing pieces in the industry.</p>
<p>Tokenisation finally works, at scale. Tokeny’s technology is the foundation of this transformation. We’re delivering blockchain capability that integrates across the entire value chain and fund lifecycle, enhancing the experience and value for all of Apex Group’s clients.</p>
<p>Daniel and Luc are proud to be appointed to lead Apex Digital 3.0, powered by the full strength of the Tokeny team. Our mission becomes bigger: To transform financial markets and unlock access for all. Just as Microsoft put a computer on every desk, we’re building the digital infrastructure to put private assets in every portfolio, bringing the future of finance to everyone.</p>
<p>This marks a brand new chapter, and we’re proud to be writing it with you!</p>

 1. Can I have confidence to hold&nbsp;Aergo?   Confidence should be grounded in understanding the current direction and internal activity of the&nbsp;project.  Aergo has undergone major changes and is now transitioning into HPP (House Party Protocol), a more modern and AI-aligned infrastructure.  A Living Roadmap is actively maintained, offering transparent updates about progress, team deliverables, and launch timelines.  Investors are encouraged to review the roadmap and evaluate their belief in the foundation’s vision.   2. Why migrate from Aergo to&nbsp;HPP?   A major community governance vote in March 2025 (AIP-21) resulted in overwhelming support for migrating Aergo into HPP, representing a new direction.  The goal of HPP is to modernize the infrastructure, introduce AI-native functionality, and align with current market needs, particularly in areas such as modular architecture, agent-based execution, and scalability.  HPP maintains the legacy of Aergo while positioning the ecosystem for growth in the next 3–5&nbsp;years.  The community vote saw near-unanimous support and had higher participation than many larger market-cap projects.   3. How will the token migration from Aergo to HPP work on exchanges?   The migration process is exchange-dependent. Each exchange may handle the conversion differently (e.g., automatic swap, opt-in, withdrawal only).  The team is working closely with major partners and will provide detailed guidance as each exchange finalizes its&nbsp;plan.  Community members should stay tuned on official channels (Telegram, X) for updates related to their preferred platforms.   4. When is HPP mainnet launching?   The public mainnet is targeted for Q3 2025, which is ~3 months earlier than initially projected in the March&nbsp;AIP.  The testnet has already been completed, and the private mainnet is now live, with developer tools being actively rolled&nbsp;out.  The team is deliberately not announcing an exact date to maintain flexibility and ensure&nbsp;quality.  Rushed deadlines can cause avoidable bugs and quality&nbsp;issues.  Precise dates can lead to price manipulation through derivatives trading or “sell-the-news” behavior.   5. Why keep the launch date&nbsp;private?   HPP is a digital product, not constrained by logistics like physical goods or theater releases.  A flexible launch date allows for rigorous QA and performance testing before going&nbsp;live.  Avoiding a public date also prevents speculative volatility, as many traders use fixed timelines for leverage and price&nbsp;swings.  The team prioritizes quality and stability over&nbsp;hype.   6. When is Booost launching on&nbsp;HPP?   Booost is already deployed on testnet and is currently running on the private&nbsp;mainnet.  While technically live, its public launch is imminent, pending final readiness checks.  Booost’s integration is a key milestone in showcasing HPP’s support for identity verification and anti-deepfake primitives.   7. What is VaasBlock building on&nbsp;HPP?   VaasBlock is building W3DB.io, a Web3-native intelligence and verification platform.  Think of it as a cross between IMDB, Crunchbase, and CoinMarketCap, focusing on projects and individuals.  Community members can contribute by: verifying project and team data, training AI models, and tagging and labeling datasets.  In return, they can earn token&nbsp;rewards.  HPP was selected as the base layer due to its multi-chain design, existing exchange access, and built-in support for AI-integrated workflows   8. What’s the “next big news” that could make Aergo&nbsp;pop?   The community member’s question assumes a correlation between announcements and price, but this is rare unless connected to major macro headlines or&nbsp;figures.  That said, the HPP mainnet launch is arguably the most significant upcoming milestone in terms of long-term fundamentals.  However, no one can guarantee whether it will result in a price “pop” — and speculation shouldn’t drive strategic decisions.   9. Why is engagement low? What about marketing?   A community member voiced concerns about low social media engagement and marketing visibility.  The team responded with the following key points:<br>1) HPP does not engage in artificial engagement tactics like bots or paid shill armies.<br>2) Most projects with unusually high engagement have manipulated metrics, which don’t reflect real community or product traction.<br>3) VaasBlock uses a marketing effectiveness score that evaluates campaigns based on their actual impact (price, volume, etc.) rather than vanity&nbsp;metrics.  According to that model, Aergo/HPP ranks in the top 20% of current Web3 projects.  The team is focused on building lasting value, not temporary hype.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-19-token-roadmap-and-exchange-fb4486211a7d">[Aergo Talks #19] Token, Roadmap, and Exchange</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>U.S. nonprofits must now comply with AML regulations that require verifying partner organizations, grantees, and key stakeholders. This article explores how NGOs can implement efficient KYB workflows that support transparency and risk management – without compromising mission alignment or donor confidence.</p>
 
 Nonprofits and NGOs operating in the United States are increasingly being drawn into the regulatory spotlight. While historically exempt from many financial compliance requirements, today’s nonprofits – especially those with international operations, grant-making activities, or large donation flows—must now consider how to comply with know-your-business (KYB) and AML standards. 
<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have flagged the misuse of charitable organizations as a financial crime risk, prompting increased expectations for due diligence and transparency.</p>
 AML Expectations for U.S. NGOs in 2025 
<p>Although not all nonprofits fall under Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations, those that:</p>
 
 Partner with foreign NGOs 
 Disburse grants or funds abroad 
 Receive high-risk donations or funding 
 Operate in or near sanctioned jurisdictions 
 
<p>…are expected to implement stronger controls for:</p>
 
 Beneficial ownership checks of partners and grantees 
 Screening for PEPs, sanctions, and adverse media 
 Documentation of financial flows and governance structures 
 
<p>Many large donors and financial institutions now require NGOs to demonstrate AML and KYB compliance as part of their funding eligibility or banking relationships.</p>
 Key Challenges for Nonprofits 
<p>1. Mission vs. Compliance Tension<br>
Nonprofits often fear that intrusive checks could alienate partners or deter grassroots engagement.</p>
<p>2. Resource Constraints<br>
Lean teams and limited budgets make enterprise-grade compliance tools impractical.</p>
<p>3. Complex Partnership Networks<br>
Sub-grantees and foreign affiliates may operate with different legal, cultural, or documentation norms.</p>
<p>4. Donor and Reputational Risk<br>
Failure to vet grantees properly could result in diverted funds, scandal, or funding suspension.</p>
 How iComply Supports KYB for Nonprofits 
<p>iComply offers a configurable KYB solution tailored to the needs of donor-driven and mission-aligned organizations.</p>
 1. Entity Verification for Partners and Grantees 
 
 Validate EINs, incorporation status, and legal representatives 
 Confirm banking and operational legitimacy 
 Request and review key documentation (bylaws, governance structures, etc.) 
 
 2. UBO Discovery and Risk Screening 
 
 Identify the real owners or controllers of partner organizations 
 Screen individuals and entities against OFAC and international sanctions lists 
 Flag politically exposed persons and adverse media links 
 
 3. Low-Friction Onboarding 
 
 Send white-labeled onboarding requests to partners and affiliates 
 Guide users through structured KYB flows without requiring technical expertise 
 Preserve relationship integrity with customizable language and guidance 
 
 4. Risk-Based Review and Recordkeeping 
 
 Automate risk scoring and escalation rules 
 Maintain audit-ready logs of verification outcomes and partner engagements 
 Export data for funders, auditors, or internal governance reviews 
 
 Case Insight: Global Health NGO Based in DC 
<p>A U.S.-based nonprofit distributing grants in Latin America implemented iComply’s KYB workflows for vetting sub-recipients. In less than 8 weeks:</p>
 
 Verified over 40 active partners 
 Flagged 2 entities with incomplete governance disclosure 
 Met due diligence standards required by a new multilateral funder 
 
 What to Expect in 2025 
 
 Funder-Led KYB Standards: Multilaterals and private foundations will increasingly expect NGOs to vet grantees with audit-ready procedures 
 BSA and IRS Alignment: Expanded clarity on nonprofit AML responsibilities may emerge from the U.S. Treasury or IRS 
 Reputation Risk Enforcement: Media and donor scrutiny will intensify around due diligence failures 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Nonprofits must build AML resilience without compromising their mission. KYB automation offers a path to greater transparency, donor confidence, and regulatory alignment.</p>
<p>Connect with iComply to learn how we help NGOs and nonprofits build trust through streamlined, values-aligned compliance.</p>

				  Indicio’s flagship product supports the issuance, holding, and verification of SD-JWT VCs, Europe’s choice of Verifiable Credential for privacy-preserving digital identity in the European Union Digital Wallet (EUDI).  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>By 2026, the European Union has mandated that every member country provide its citizens, residents, and businesses with a secure, interoperable digital wallet so that they can use Verifiable Credentials to prove who they are and share information across borders, platforms, and services, online and offline, across all EU member states.</p>
<p>For its Verifiable Credential format, the EU will use SD-JWT VCs.</p>
 What is&nbsp; SD-JWT VC? 
<p>The acronym stands for Selective Disclosure JSON Web Token Verifiable Credential. </p>
<p>A JSON Web Token is a standardized way to share digitally-signed information between parties. Selective disclosure means that this information can be shared selectively, thereby enabling a party to restrict the data they share to the specifics needed for a given purpose. Verifiable credential means the JWT includes the specific data formats as well as validation and processing rules required to express Verifiable Credentials.</p>
 Why is this important? 
<p>Simply put, it enables data privacy and increases security.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand this is by looking at how we share information to access resources using physical credentials, like a driver’s license.</p>
<p>To verify age for purchasing an age-restricted item, a person would present a physical ID that contained their date of birth, typically a driver’s license, passport, or national ID card. But in presenting that ID, the person verifying it would be able to see all the personal data on the ID. </p>
<p>In an age of identity theft, this is no longer tenable. But it is also unacceptable in terms of data privacy. Selective disclosure is non-negotiable for the European Union. EU data privacy law —&nbsp;GDPR —&nbsp;requires organizations minimize the data they collect, process, and store to fulfill a specific purpose; selective disclosure makes minimization easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to issue and verify SD-JWT Verifiable Credentials with Indicio Proven</p>
<p>Access Indicio Proven, either using its interface or its API, and connect your existing IAM, CRM, HR software, identity provider, API, or database. Select the SD-JWT VC from the menu and start issuing credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven’s verifier software automatically accepts SD-JWT VCs, so you have&nbsp; immediate interoperability with all EU digital wallets..&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Why go with Indicio Proven for your EU credential solution? 
<p>Indicio was the first to demonstrate interoperability between SD-JWT VC and AnonCreds credentials in a single workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll shortly enable similar interoperability with mdoc/mDL and W3C VC credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, if you want to interoperate globally, Proven has proved itself in the real world.</p>
<p>There are two other important reasons for choosing Indicio Proven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It enables you to scale rapidly to any level of issuance or verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has the most powerful governance solution in the marketplace, allowing you to easily orchestrate credential roles, trust lists, and workflows in hierarchical ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because governance is cached as a machine-readable file for each credential issuer, holder, and verifier, offline verification is possible using BLE, NFC, or Wifi Aware.</p>

 The Rising Threat of Candidate Fraud  
<p>Remote work has drastically changed hiring, unintentionally creating new opportunities for fraud. Reports indicate a significant jump in fraudulent activity, with some analyses suggesting one in six applicants for remote roles show signs of fraud. Experts project that by 2028, AI-generated job applicant profiles could account for one in four candidates globally. This surge in remote onboarding fraud poses serious threats, including financial losses, security risks, and legal issues. To combat this, strong identity verification is now essential for modern fraud prevention.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The rise in candidate fraud is costing businesses a fortune and putting their security at risk. That's why strong identity verification isn't just a good idea — it's essential for keeping your company safe.</p> 
<p>Here's what you need to know:</p> 
  
  The growing problem of candidate fraud, especially with more and more people working remotely.  
  The tricky tactics fraudsters use, from made-up qualifications to convincing deepfake impersonations.  
  The serious risks candidate fraud poses, impacting your company's finances, reputation, legal standing, and daily operations.  
  Actionable strategies and best practices, including robust identity verification, to protect your organization.  
  
 Types of Candidate Fraud: Breaking Down the Tactics  
<p>Fraudsters use various clever methods to get into organizations. Understanding these tactics is key to building effective defenses.</p> 
  
  Fake Qualifications Fraud: This involves candidates fabricating resumes, exaggerating qualifications, or providing false references to secure a job they're not fit for. This can include inventing work histories or boosting grades.  
  Synthetic Identity Fraud: A more advanced technique, where fraudsters combine real and made-up personal information to create a new, seemingly legitimate identity. This makes detection harder for standard background checks.  
  Deepfake-based Impersonation: Leveraging AI, fraudsters generate realistic video and voice simulations to impersonate real people during video interviews, making it very difficult to tell if the person is genuine.  
  Stolen Identity: Criminals steal legitimate job seekers' personal data and use it to apply for jobs and pass checks. This victimizes the individual whose identity is stolen and risks the hiring company onboarding a malicious person.  
  
 Understanding the Business Implications of Candidate Fraud  
<p>The fallout from candidate fraud goes far beyond just a bad hire, affecting many different parts of a business.</p> 
  
  Financial Losses: Bringing on unqualified individuals can lead to lower productivity, mistakes, and potential financial liabilities due to misconduct or poor performance, directly hitting your company's bottom line.  
  Reputational Damage: If it comes out that your company hired people with fake credentials or if fraudulent activity becomes public, it can severely damage trust among clients, partners, and the general public, harming your brand's reputation.  
  Legal and Regulatory Noncompliance: Failing to properly check candidates can lead to not following industry-specific rules and data protection laws, resulting in significant legal penalties and hefty fines.  
  Security Breaches: Fraudulent employees, especially those with bad intentions, pose a direct risk of data theft, loss of intellectual property, or other critical security breaches that can have devastating effects on your organization.  
  Operational Disruption: Having unqualified or fraudulent staff can disrupt workflows, require expensive extra training, and lead to higher employee turnover, all of which hinder efficient business operations and how you use your resources.  
  
 Hiring Fraud Prevention Tactics for Human Resources  
<p>To effectively fight the growing problem of candidate fraud, HR departments need to adopt proactive and strong prevention strategies.</p> 
 Implement a Top-Notch Identity Verification Solution That Follows Best Practices  
<p>Putting a comprehensive identity verification solution in place is absolutely crucial. Such a solution should simplify and automate identity-proofing processes, offer additional re-verification steps at important moments, and accurately verify identities while balancing strict security with ease of use for candidates. This includes verifying candidates during onboarding.</p> 
 Stronger Interviewing Techniques  
<p>Go beyond basic interviews and add more advanced methods:</p> 
  
  Conduct live technical assessments to truly verify claimed skills.  
  Make video interviews mandatory and use technology to check for deepfakes and AI-generated voice simulations.  
  Cross-check social media profiles for anything odd or inconsistent with the information provided.  
  
 Background Screening Enhancements  
<p>Boost your background screening processes:</p> 
  
  Use reputable third-party background check providers that employ advanced fraud detection techniques.  
  Consider continuous employee monitoring even after the initial onboarding to spot any suspicious behavior or changes.  
  
 Use Zero Trust &amp; Identity Security During Hiring<br>  
<p>Embrace modern security approaches like zero trust authentication and identity security throughout the entire hiring process and beyond. The "never trust, always verify" philosophy of zero trust is perfectly suited to combat hiring fraud.</p> 
  
  Implement passwordless authentication during the hiring and onboarding process to eliminate a common attack vector: Traditional passwords are a weak link, easily compromised through phishing or brute-force attacks. By using passwordless methods, such as FIDO passkeys, you significantly reduce the chance of credentials being stolen by fraudsters trying to gain unauthorized access to candidate portals or internal systems during the hiring phase.  
  Integrate zero trust authentication principles and FIDO passkeys to ensure continuous verification of identity and access: With zero trust, every access request, whether from an applicant or a newly onboarded employee, is treated as untrusted until proven otherwise. This means continuous authentication and authorization checks, ensuring that even if a dishonest individual somehow gains initial access, their movements within your systems are constantly monitored and restricted. FIDO passkeys offer a highly secure, phishing-resistant, and user-friendly way to implement strong authentication, ensuring that only the verified individual can proceed through each stage of the hiring and onboarding journey. This minimizes the risk of a fake job applicant ever gaining a foothold in your network.

 Candidate Fraud Real-World Cases  
<p>The threat of candidate fraud isn't just theoretical; it has real, tangible consequences for businesses worldwide. These aren't isolated incidents but a growing trend that highlights the critical need for advanced identity verification and constant vigilance.</p> 
<p>The HYPR blog post, "<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/hypr-unmasks-fake-it-worker">HYPR Unmasks a Fake IT Worker: North Korea Isn't the Only Threat</a>," shares a firsthand account of how HYPR successfully stopped a potential fraud attempt involving a highly sophisticated impersonator. This incident clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of robust identity verification in a real-world situation. The fraudster presented a convincing resume and tried to mimic legitimate behavior, but HYPR's system was able to detect the deception, preventing a potentially damaging security breach.</p> 
<p>Beyond individual cases, broader patterns of hiring fraud illustrate the severity of the problem:</p> 
 The North Korean IT Worker Scheme  
<p>Reports detail how fraudulent IT workers, sometimes linked to state-sponsored activities, infiltrate companies using fake identities. They pose as remote software engineers, using fake profiles and stolen identities to gain employment. These schemes often aim to steal data or funnel illicit wages back to their countries, posing both financial and national security risks.</p> 
 Financial Sector Impersonation  
<p>The financial sector has seen cases where individuals with false credentials or stolen identities gained access to critical systems. Such incidents lead to significant financial losses, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. Impersonators might use fake certifications to get roles in sensitive departments, then exploit their access for fraud or data theft.</p> 
 The Rise of AI-Generated Resumes  
<p>With generative AI tools, companies now regularly encounter applicants submitting entirely computer-generated resumes and cover letters that are hard to distinguish from genuine ones. Additionally, deepfake technology enables interview fraud where candidates use AI to create convincing video and voice simulations for remote interviews, making it difficult to identify genuine candidates.</p>

<p>Strong authentication and verification processes are no longer just an option; they’re an absolute necessity. Hiring fraud is constantly evolving, with new and more sophisticated tactics emerging daily. Traditional background checks and manual verification methods simply aren’t enough to keep pace with the cleverness of modern fraudsters.</p>

  Fraudsters use many different methods, including fake qualifications, synthetic identities, deepfake technology, and stolen personal data.  
  The business implications are severe, covering financial losses, harm to reputation, legal non-compliance, and security breaches.  
  Implementing a comprehensive identity verification solution, improving interviewing techniques, enhancing background checks, and adopting Zero Trust principles are all crucial for effective prevention.  
  
 Conclusion

  ‘STEM for ALL’ : Thales Joins the Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS) Programme 
prezly

Thu, 07/31/2025 - 14:52


             
 As a Sponsoring Organisation with SgIS, Thales will provide Singaporean undergraduate students scholarships in a comprehensive programme that includes internship, mentoring and a starting career with Thales.  
 With this initiative, Thales is extending its ‘STEM for ALL’ programme to Singapore, the first launch outside Europe, with its dedicated mission to advance STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education amongst youth. 
 In its inaugural intake, four nominated scholars will undertake engineering or research roles in strategic sectors including air traffic management, public security, cybersecurity and digital identity, working within Thales businesses and research labs like the Thales Digital Factory. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 
©&nbsp;Thales

<p>With engineers comprising one-third of Thales Singapore’s 2000+ employees, the Group has a strong interest in promoting STEM education and growing the next generation of engineering talent. On 29th July, Thales was proud to join SgIS as a Sponsorship Organisation at its launch event and to present awards to the scholars, aligning with the government’s mandate to develop young talent in Singapore’s strategic sectors. </p>
<p>Established in 2012, SgIS is an initiative which partners government and industries to nurture a strong core of Singaporean talent in 16 strategic industries which include Aerospace &amp; Aviation and Engineering. It is the only government-led, multi-industry scholarship under the Ministry of Education which provides talented Singaporean students access to close to 150 Sponsoring Organisations, giving them development opportunities as they further their studies and begin their professional careers. </p>
<p>Throughout May and June, over 100 potential candidates with diverse skillsets were introduced to Thales by SgIS and invited to an Open Day to get to know Thales’ businesses. From this, over 40 were taken through rigorous technical assessments, following which 12 were further shortlisted for panel interviews with Thales experts and business leaders to further assess their technical expertise and leadership attributes. </p>
<p>Four talented candidates from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) were the final recipients of the Thales award. Currently at different stages in their university education, the four students will progressively join the cybersecurity and digital identity, public security, air traffic management and Thales Digital Factory teams over the next 2 years.</p>
<p>Expanding the Thales Group’s STEM for ALL Programme to Singapore</p>
<p>In early 2025, Thales, through its endowment fund Thales Solidarity, launched its STEM for ALL programme in France and Belgium to foster vocation in scientific fields to remarkable young students. </p>
<p>By partnering the SgIS programme, Thales is extending the Group’s ambition in endorsing STEM education worldwide by reinforcing academic excellence. Singapore is the first country outside of Europe to have a STEM scholarship programme under the STEM for ALL umbrella.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thales recognises the&nbsp;essential role that science and technology&nbsp;play in furthering human progress and creating a world that is safer, greener and more sustainable. Many of the younger generation are passionate about making an impact and we are constantly looking for talented individuals, skilled in STEM, to help bring this ambition to life.” said Emily TAN, Country Director &amp; Chief Executive, Thales in Singapore. “The scholars we selected have strong technical skills which we hope to nurture when they join the Thales family. I believe that their enthusiasm to learn, coupled with the mentorship opportunities and experiences within Thales, will provide a good starting point for their careers.”</p></blockquote>

  <p>Digital applications constantly deal with identities. It’s important to verify identity at the application’s front door through authentication. Several mature and sophisticated techniques and standards for user authentication, such as <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/">Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)</a>, allow a trusted identity provider (IDP) to securely authenticate the user before allowing access to an application.</p>

<p>However, front door authentication is not the only context in which identities must be verified.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenarios:</p>
 
   Update your email address through a bank’s customer service 
   Recover the userID/password through HelpDesk 
   Securely perform a transaction at a retail Point of Sale (POS) system 
   Authenticate with browser-constrained devices, such as smart speakers 
   Authenticate from a shared kiosk 
 

<p>In each of the above cases, though the identities need to be verified, it might not be possible or appropriate to have the user perform authentication through an interactive login interface such as a web browser.</p>

 How applications handle identity verification today 

<p>While it’s popular to leverage secure IDP and standards to provide initial authentication through a login interface, identity verification in places such as above is built in an ad hoc manner. Depending on design, some applications do this inefficiently with a terrible customer experience, while others are less secure and vulnerable.</p>

 Let’s step through identity verification scenarios 

<p>Consider identity verification needs where you can’t rely on a traditional user authentication process, such as when multiple parties or browser-constrained systems are involved. Let’s examine those cases and identify identity security pitfalls.</p>

 Update email address for bank accounts 

<p>Consider a user calls customer service to update the email address associated with their bank account. Often, the helpline personnel ask the user for certain personally identifiable information ( PII) answers such as last name, date of birth, and last 4 digits of social security number. Upon verification, the helpline personnel updates the email address through the customer care application, which performs privileged operations on the bank’s identity database to change the user record.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are problems with the approach.</p>

<p>First, the customer experience is not great. The customer also needs to provide PII information for verification, which an attacker can guess or obtain using <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/social_engineering">social engineering</a>. This can easily lead to an account takeover, where a fraudulent actor can successfully pass the verifications and infiltrate the account with a new email ID.
The second issue is that the customer care application needs to change the user profile from the backend without authentication. The application would typically use powerful credentials to perform such a privileged operation. For example, an application can obtain and use a token with user management privileges to call the user update API. Such a token allows updating user accounts in the banking system directory, but it can be misused if the token leaks.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to get some form of token that provides the application with just enough privilege to update only the calling user profile? That way, it could adhere to the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege">least privilege</a> principle of security.</p>

 Point of Sale (POS) payment 

<p>This is another interesting scenario. When a user tries to pay in the retail Point of Sale (POS) system with a bank account, they won’t be comfortable signing in to their bank account on a shared device and providing their credentials.</p>

<p>Instead, it would be ideal if the POS system allowed secure payments with an alternative form of verification, where the user does not need to provide their credentials in a public system!</p>

<p>Can we do something to decouple user authentication from the application?</p>

 Use CIBA to verify identity transactions securely and consistently 

<p>The idea is to decouple authentication from the application so that it can be initiated on one device and verified on another. Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) allows exactly that separation.</p>

<p>CIBA is a relatively new authentication flow based on <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> in which the client can initiate an interaction flow to authenticate the users without having end-user interaction from the consumption device. The flow involves back-channel communication from the client to the OAuth 2.0 authorization provider without redirecting through the user’s browser (consumption device). The authentication would be verified independently from a separate authentication device, such as a phone or smartwatch, in possession of the user and securely enrolled with the provider.</p>

 CIBA enables a smooth authentication experience 

<p>Consider the following flow for our banking email address use case.</p>

<p></p>

 
   The customer care application initiates an authentication event for the user. It sends a direct CIBA request to the authorization server. 
   Unlike a regular login page, the user is redirected to, the authorization server sends a push notification to the user’s phone. 
   The authorization server is notified when the user accepts the notification on her phone/smartwatch. 
   The authorization server then issues a user token to the application. The application uses the user-scoped token to complete the target operation, which is updating the email address. 
 

<p>A few benefits of this approach are:</p>
 
   The user experience becomes smoother during verification. It also can instill confidence in users that the system operates securely. 
   Push notification offers higher security than other out-of-band user authentication methods, such as SMS one-time code (OTP). 
   The application token can be narrowly scoped to the user, providing the least privileged access. 
 

<p>Here is a simplified flow of a transaction using CIBA.</p>

<p></p>

 CIBA builds upon OAuth 2.0 and OIDC 

<p>CIBA is an extension on top of OIDC, which itself is based on the OAuth 2.0 framework. It brings in a new OAuth 2.0 grant type in the family: <code>urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba</code>. As customary with the OIDC discovery endpoint, CIBA introduces additional metadata parameters, such as <code>backchannel_token_delivery_modes_supported</code> and <code>backchannel_authentication_endpoint</code>. The discovery document payload looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "issuer": "...",
    "authorization_endpoint": ".../authorize",
    "token_endpoint": ".../token",
    "userinfo_endpoint": ".../userinfo",
    "jwks_uri": "...",
    "grant_types_supported":[
      "authorization_code",
      "refresh_token",
      "password",
      "urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba"
    ],
    "backchannel_token_delivery_modes_supported":["poll", "ping", "push"],
    "backchannel_authentication_endpoint": "",
    ....
}

</code>   

<p>The <code>backchannel_token_delivery_modes_supported</code> parameter needs some additional commentary. The specification defines three different modes of notifying the client about the completion of authentication.</p>
 
   Poll: In this mode, the client keeps polling the authorization server until the authentication is complete or the event times out. In case of successful authentication, the final poll returns the tokens to the application. This mode is the simplest and easiest to implement. 
   Ping: When the authentication is complete, it will call back to a registered URL of the client, notifying the status. The client makes a request to the authorization server for tokens. 
   Push: When the authentication is complete, it will call back to the client’s registered URL with the tokens. 
 

<p>Ping and Push modes are more complex to implement and need additional metadata and implementation steps on the client side. However, it saves network trips caused by the polling cycle.</p>

<p>Since the CIBA request uses a back-channel, it must contain a parameter that the authorization server can use to identify the user. Typically, the parameter is supplied using the <code>login_hint</code> or <code>id_token_hint parameter</code> of the request.</p>

<p>The authentication device performs out-of-band authentication instead of the traditional authentication flow, where the client interacts with the authorization server sequentially. In practical implementations, it would be a push notification to a device such as a phone or smartwatch. The device needs to be securely registered to the authorization server for the user so that it knows where to send the authorization request. The push notification can be delivered by embedding the mechanism in the application’s mobile application or using a companion authenticator application.</p>

 Security considerations when using CIBA 

<p>CIBA is vulnerable to attacks akin to an <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mfa-fatigue-hackers-new-favorite-tactic-in-high-profile-breaches/#google_vignette">MFA fatigue attack</a>. Consider the case where an attacker guesses a user ID or infiltrates a user account and repeatedly attempts to carry out a sensitive transaction implemented using CIBA authorization. The real user might get overwhelmed by repeated push notifications and accept one.</p>

<p>A related scenario is when the attacker has a list of user IDs and initiates transactions for each. While most users would ignore the push prompt, a small percentage could approve the request.</p>

<p>In summary, CIBA suffers from a weakness where an attacker can force-initiate an authorization event. In certain scenarios, a more secure alternative is the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628">device code flow</a>, where a user can actively initiate authorization on their device using a QR code or one-time code.</p>

<p>Also, CIBA should not be used in a same-device scenario where the consumption and authentication devices are the same.</p>

 CIBA support in Okta 

<p>CIBA is not yet widely implemented. Okta has been an early adopter of the CIBA standard.</p>

<p>CIBA is rapidly gaining traction in the banking industry. <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi">FAPI</a> specifications, developed based on the OAuth 2.0 token model, include the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-ciba.html">CIBA profile</a>. CIBA, along with complementary product offerings such as <a>Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)</a>, make up the key components required for highly regulated identity.</p>

<p>In Europe, CIBA can help implement the decoupled authentication flows outlined by <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/implications-around-psd2-and-open-banking/">PSD2 and UK Open Banking</a>. <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/by-industry/banking-and-finance/the-consumer-data-right">Consumer Data Right (CDR)</a> in Australia is expected to include the specification soon.
Beyond the banking industry, CIBA is promising to provide enhanced security and user experience for the Helpdesk, customer service, retail Point of Sale (POS), Interactive Voice Response (<a href="https://www.ttec.com/glossary/interactive-voice-response">IVR</a>), and shared kiosk-based applications.</p>

<p>Okta supports CIBA in poll mode, a feature called <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-ciba/main/">Transactional Verification</a>. The <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/">Okta authorization server</a> includes the CIBA grant as part of the support.</p>

<p>The authentication process is supported by allowing the creation of a mobile push authenticator using <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2020/10/showcase20-introducing-the-okta-devices-sdk-and-api-a-better-way-to-secure-and-delight-mobile-users/">the Okta device SDK</a>. This SDK can be easily embedded in the organization’s mobile application or as a separate companion application. Check out the iOS and Android guides on how to implement a branded push authenticator using the SDK. The guides include sample applications to get you quickly started building the experience.</p>

 Use CIBA for secure identity verification in your apps 

<p>Digital applications are crucial for every business, and securing them is paramount. It’s not enough to protect just the front door with authentications. Applications must always be vigilant during their operations and operate on a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture">zero-trust</a> model. CIBA is an important tool to ensure that applications enforce continuous and secure authorization in appropriate contexts without compromising the user experience.</p>

<p>A masked email address is a unique, automatically generated email address that you can use to shield your primary email from spam and email scams like <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams">phishing attacks</a>.</p>



<p>Email masking adds a layer of protection between you and your inbox—and with data breaches and fraud at <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-shock-stats-prove-most-people-have-had-their-personal-data-stolen/">record highs</a>, masked email, as well as email aliases, temporary email, and disposable email, are now popular privacy tools.</p>



<p>But if you’re searching for truly private and secure email, you can do much better than masked email. MySudo has loads of benefits over other email options and we’ll cover them all here—but first, let’s do the 101 on masked email.</p>



 Is a masked email the same as an email alias? 



<p>Email masking is sometimes confused with email aliasing, but they’re not the same.</p>



<p>An email alias is a secondary email address (usually a variation of your primary email address) that sits in your primary inbox—whereas a masked email is an entirely separate email account that gets forwarded to your primary email inbox.</p>



<p>But a masked email is not a temporary email or a disposable email, either.</p>



<p>A temporary email address is usually set up to receive one-off messages, has no sending capability, and will auto-expire after a set time or set number of uses.</p>



<p>A disposable email is like a temporary email but typically lasts longer. It may have limited sending capability for replies. You can throw away your disposable email whenever you’re done with it.</p>



 How does email masking work? 



<p>While your primary email provider can handle your email aliases, you’ll need a third-party provider to run your masked email service. Here’s what happens:&nbsp;</p>



 
 You create a masked email address through a service like Apple’s iCloud Private Relay, Firefox Relay, or a custom domain. 



 When someone sends an email to your masked address, the service forwards the email to your real inbox. 



 You read the email in your real inbox without the sender ever knowing your real email address. 
 



<p></p>



<p>Depending on the service you choose, replies will go either:</p>



 
 Via the service: Some masked email services let you send email from the masked address, so the recipient sees the masked email address, not your real email address, or 



 From your real inbox: If you reply to an email that’s been forwarded from the masked email service, the service will rewrite the “From” address to keep your real email hidden. 
 



<p></p>



<p>You can disable or delete your masked email at any time.</p>



 What type of email is MySudo email? 



<p>MySudo email is a popular secure email service with full send and receive support. It’s entirely separate from your personal email account and intentionally protects your personal email from spam and email-based scams.</p>



<p>MySudo email is better than masked email in at least 4 ways:</p>



<p></p>



 <br>1. MySudo is more than email; it’s a complete private identity management solution 



<p>Your MySudo email sits within a secure <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/#:~:text=You%20assign%20each%20of%20your,goods%2C%20or%20booking%20local%20services.">Sudo digital identity</a> which you set up, manage and retain until you decide to delete it. While email is a popular feature of a Sudo, each Sudo contains so much more, to make it a complete private identity management solution. Here’s what’s in each Sudo:</p>



 
 1 email address – for end-to-end encrypted emails between app users, and standard email with everyone else 



 1 handle – for end-to-end encrypted messages and video, voice and group calls between app users 



 1 private browser – for searching the internet without ads and tracking 



 1 phone number (optional)* – for end-to-end encrypted messaging and video, voice and group calls between app users, and standard connections with everyone else; customizable and mutable 



 1 virtual card (optional)* – for protecting your personal info and your money, like a proxy for your credit or debit card or bank account 
 



<p></p>



<p>*Phone numbers and virtual cards only available on a paid plan. Phone numbers available for US, CA and UK only. Virtual cards for US only.</p>



<p>Masked email services usually provide only disposable or relay email addresses, not full identity separation like MySudo does.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>2. You can have up to 9 separate email accounts with MySudo 



<p>The <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">top plan</a> on MySudo entitles you to up to 9 separate Sudo digital identities, which means you can actually maintain up to 9 separate email accounts at any one time (plus 9 secondary phone numbers, private browsers, handles, and optional virtual cards).</p>



<p>The real power comes when you apply those 9 separate Sudos to different purposes in your busy life: shopping, dating, classified selling, travel, social media accounts, and more. Anywhere you don’t want to use your personal email, phone, and credit card, use your Sudo details instead. You stay private, safe and organized.

<p></p>



 <br>3. MySudo email is end-to-end encrypted between MySudo users 



<p>MySudo email is end-to-end encrypted between MySudo users. This gives you much greater privacy and control, especially for sensitive communications. You can easily <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/easy-invite-a-friend-function-is-now-in-mysudo/">invite friends and colleagues to the app</a>, so you can email, call, and message each other securely.</p>



<p>Most masked email services only forward email and don’t secure or end-to-end encrypt it beyond basic TLS during transmission.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>4. You can sign up to MySudo without giving away your personal email or any other info 



<p>Many masked email services tie the masked address to your real identity behind the scenes, but MySudo doesn’t. In fact, we can’t. That’s because MySudo won’t ask for any of your&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>, like primary email address or phone number, when you set up and log in to your account. Instead, your account is protected by an authentication and encryption&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">key</a>&nbsp;that never leaves your device.</p>



<p>We’ll only ask for personal information if you opt-in to use the optional MySudo&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/?s=virtual+cards">virtual cards</a> feature and for UK phone numbers, because for these services we must do a one-time verification of your identity by law.</p>



<p>So, don’t waste your time setting up masked email or email aliases for privacy. Instead, go straight to <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a>, where you can have up to 9 secure email addresses that shield and protect your personal email—and loads of other privacy and security features besides.</p>



<p>Download MySudo for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mysudo-protect-your-identity/id1237892621">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anonyome.mysudo">Android</a>.</p>

					 Signal to Sale: How Ultrasonic Tech is Solving Retail’s Attribution Problem 				 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>For all retailers, the physical store remains crucial for customer conversion, but the rapid expansion of digital channels has created a non-linear path from awareness to purchase. The exponential increase in consumer touchpoints makes it nearly impossible for industry leaders to draw a clear line across the whole customer journey. This disruption in the funnel universally impacts big box stores, CPGs, and small brick-and-mortar merchants alike.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
					 How are companies supposed to invest resources into promotion campaigns when conversion metrics are basically a shot in the dark? 				 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>The Problem: In today’s retail ecosystem, merchants only truly know their customers at checkout, but by then, it’s too late. If businesses could identify their consumers throughout the entire shopping journey, they could present personalized offerings at critical stages of the buying process and understand full attribution of which promotions worked and which didn’t.</p><p>The Game Plan:</p>  Recognize which customers viewed certain TV promotions at-home  Identify customers when they enter the store  Present customers with personalized offerings during their shopping experience to increase spend or highlight higher margin items  Cultivate unique shopping experiences that increase word of mouth marketing  Gamify the checkout experience to make consumers excited for their next visit.  <p>With this equation, your retail store doesn’t become an option; it becomes the destination.</p><p>The Solution:&nbsp;LISNR’s Radius, an ultrasonic SDK capable of sending data over inaudible sound using standard speakers and microphones. Radius transmits data using frequencies higher than what humans can hear allowing these “tones” to be layered over TV broadcasts and in-store music/announcements. Our Zone66 tone profile can send data over 30 feet from standard speakers and can be used to identify a consumer and their relative location within the physical store. Once identified, merchants can send personalized offerings directly to the consumer’s device as they are in front of specific products.</p><p>Furthermore, LISNR offers Quest, a loyalty management platform that enables tracking of consumers’ purchase history and incentivizes future purchases. Utilizing the gamified nature of Quest at checkout, consumers can track their progress toward rewards and redemption, keeping the store top of mind.</p>

					</a>
				 
								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									 The Proliferation of LISNR-Enabled Digital Touchpoints <p>LISNR capitalizes on digital touchpoints by enabling the delivery of valuable and personalized offers directly to consumers at various touchpoints found in everyday shopping experiences. By integrating with LISNR, retailers can enable attribution within their existing infrastructure.</p> At-Home Television <p><br>Retail media, CTV, and linear TV ad spend is projected to be around $5 billion in 2025, according to MediaPost. Retailers clearly understand the value in advertising through television; however, realizing the ROI is much more difficult. How can businesses confidently attribute an advertisement to an uptick in purchases at checkout? The answer is Radius.</p>								 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
		 
				 
				 
									<p>Radius’ ultrasonic tones can be played simultaneously with a normal TV audio broadcast. Image 1 shows an example of a Radius tone at a frequency far above standard broadcast audio being played at the human audible level. Retailers can utilize any audio stream to encourage their consumers to open their app and engage or receive a promotion. What better way to embrace the ever-present second screen?</p>

					</a>
				 
								 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Retailers can either broadcast a single offer to all consumers or offer a personalized coupon based on their previous shopping behavior.</p>								 
				 
				 
		 
				 
				 
												
																					Image 1: Radius tone being broadcast at a frequency higher than human hearing
										
									 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
		 
				 
				 
									 In-Store Audio <p>In-store audio, whether music or PA announcements, is commonplace in retailers and is often drowned out as white noise. As a result, in-store audible advertisements often fall short, with retailers relying on consumers to be actively listening. Again, Radius can break this paradigm.</p><p>By operating simultaneously with in-store audio, consumers are seamlessly presented with personalized offers via their device. The Radius SDK even allows data to be transmitted over three distinct audio frequencies or “channels” to prevent overlapping messages. Image 2 demonstrates how three distinct data streams can be played simultaneously over audio.</p><p>For this use case, retailers can broadcast “Zone IDs” in-store to locate consumers and present relevant messaging. Once the consumer’s device receives the Zone ID for the store, the retailer’s backend app logic is able to present the consumer with a personalized offering. App logic can also be set up to limit the amount of promotions a consumer receives in a given timeframe.</p>								 
				 
				 
		 
				 
				 
							 
			 
		 
						 
				 
				 
				 
												
																					Image 2: Radius tones being broadcast over 3 different channels
										
									 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
		 
				 
				 
									 At-Checkout <p>Many of today’s shopper cards or loyalty programs are either a black box for consumers, or a percentage discount disguised as loyalty points. This does nothing to create loyal or engaged customers. LISNR instead offers Quest, a gamified loyalty platform.</p><p>By creating gamified experiences, Quest taps into a different mindset of the consumer, building a connection to merchants while increasing transaction size and volume. Quest is not just about dollars spent; it empowers retailers to incentivize any customer action (visits, specific item purchases, referrals) that they deem impactful. Consumers can interact with time-based criteria (quests) or lifetime progression (achievements) to track their loyalty and redeem rewards.</p><p>Quest’s data builds a positive feedback loop for consumer preferences. As consumers shop more frequently, their preferences become more defined allowing retailers to present more relevant offers. These offers in turn incentivize consumers to come back, spend more in-store, and look forward to their next visit.</p>								 
				 
				 
		 
				 
				 
												
																					Quest allows consumers to earn and collect achievement badges modeled after video games
										
									 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
									 Conclusion <p>By establishing a channel from awareness to conversion, retailers can capitalize on the power of targeted marketing and attribution. Retailers no longer need to guess at their ROI vs cost per impression, LISNR leads to insights of cost per conversion. Add personalized loyalty into the mix and you begin to see the LISNR flywheel for retailers.</p>

 Evolution from 800-63-2 to 800-63-3  
<p>The NIST SP 800-63 guidelines are dynamic, constantly adapting to evolving technological advancements and threats. The latest iteration, NIST SP 800-63-3, represents a crucial evolution from its predecessor, 800-63-2, incorporating significant improvements to address emerging vulnerabilities and provide stronger security measures.</p> 
<p>A key update resides within NIST 800-63B, a core component of the 800-63-3 guidelines, which focuses intently on authentication methods. Notably, email one-time passwords (OTPs) have been explicitly placed in a limited scope. This decision directly acknowledges their inherent susceptibility to widespread phishing at the workplace, where email is easily compromised.</p> 
<p>Similarly, SMS-based authentication has been formally downgraded as a viable authenticator for high-assurance scenarios. While SMS was initially considered a significant step forward for two-factor authentication, we found through the years, mobile providers and even the SS7 network itself was compromised.</p> 
<p>These pivotal revisions in NIST 800-63-3 unequivocally signal a strategic shift towards prioritizing stronger, more phishing-resistant authentication protocols. NIST actively encourages organizations to adopt resilient authentication mechanisms that genuinely protect against unauthorized access and prevent identity fraud.</p> 
 Key Concepts and Processes of Identity Proofing and Authentication  
<p>The guidelines introduce a significant shift by retiring the concept of a "level of assurance (LOA)" as a single, all-encompassing ordinal that dictates implementation-specific requirements. Instead, NIST 800-63-3 emphasizes that agencies (and by extension, organizations) should select.</p> 
<p>IAL (Identity Assurance Level), AAL (Authenticator Assurance Level), and FAL (Federated Assurance Level) as distinct, independent options. This selection process is driven by appropriate business and privacy risk management considerations, alongside specific mission needs. While many systems might coincidentally have the same numerical level for each of IAL, AAL, and FAL, this is not a mandatory requirement, and agencies should avoid assuming they will always be identical within any given system.</p> 
<p>The distinct components of identity assurance detailed in these guidelines are as follows:</p> 
  
  IAL refers to the identity proofing process, which validates the real-world identity of the applicant.  
  AAL refers to the authentication process, which verifies the user's claimed identity during a transaction.  
  FAL refers to the strength of an assertion in a federated environment, specifically used to communicate authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to a relying party (RP).  
  
<p>This explicit separation of categories provides organizations with greater flexibility in choosing identity solutions and significantly enhances the ability to embed privacy-enhancing techniques as fundamental elements of identity systems, regardless of the chosen assurance level.</p> 
<p>Beyond these foundational assurance concepts, the guidelines meticulously elaborate on the crucial roles played by various key actors within the sophisticated digital identity ecosystem:</p> 
  
  Credential Service Providers (CSPs): These entities bear the significant responsibility for issuing and meticulously managing authenticators (digital credentials) for users.Their role ensures the secure storage of the unique digital representation of the individual and its secure use for authentication. Their meticulous handling of these credentials is vital for the entire chain of trust.  
  Relying Parties (Verifiers): These are the diverse services, applications, or systems that judiciously consume the authenticated identity to grant appropriate access to specific resources or services. They inherently rely on the assertions provided by the CSPs to verify the user's identity before extending trust or access. The important parts of their role involve verifying identity, often by confirming the user's authentication complies with specified Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs).  
  
 The Digital Identity Model: NIST's Vision for Online Presence  
<p>NIST defines a sophisticated and nuanced concept of digital identity that extends far beyond the simplistic notion of a username and password. This comprehensive model fundamentally emphasizes the unique and verifiable nature of an individual's digital representation and its pivotal role in facilitating secure online transactions and interactions across diverse platforms.</p> 
<p>The Digital Identity Model, as conceptualized by NIST, illustrates a clear and sequential flow for establishing and utilizing a secure digital identity, moving from an applicant's initial request to their engagement in online transactions. This model involves several interconnected key stages:</p> 
  
  Applicant: This initial stage represents the individual requesting access or registration for a digital service. At this point, the applicant may submit personal data such as their name, email, or an ID photo to initiate the process.  
  Enrollment: Here, the identity is rigorously verified using various identity proofing methods. Once verification is successful, credentials or authenticators are issued to the individual for future use.  
  Digital Identity: Once the enrollment process is complete and verified, a unique digital representation of the individual is created. This digital identity is then stored securely and subsequently used for authentication purposes in various online contexts.  
  Online Transaction: In the final stage of the model, the user leverages their established digital identity to authenticate and gain access to a service. During this process, the system actively verifies the user's identity, ensuring compliance with predefined Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs) to secure the transaction.  
  
<p>This model provides a clear visual and conceptual framework for understanding the lifecycle of a digital identity within the NIST guidelines, emphasizing the progression from initial proofing to ongoing authentication.</p> 
 Key Processes in Digital Identity Management  
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3 breaks down digital identity management into three key, interconnected processes:</p> 
  
  Identity Proofing: The foundational step of verifying an individual's identity, ensuring it exists and belongs to the claimant. This prevents fraudulent account creation and initial unauthorized access.  
  Digital Authentication: The ongoing process of verifying a user's claimed identity each time they attempt an online transaction or access a resource. It ensures the legitimate holder is performing the action.  
  Federated Identity Management: A mechanism for linking identities across different organizations, allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple relying parties without repeated authentication.  
  
 Understanding NIST Assurance Levels (IALs, AALs, FALs)  
<p>NIST defines Identity Assurance Levels (IALs), indicating the certainty that a claimed identity corresponds to a real-world identity. These are part of NIST 800-63-3 and provide a tiered approach to evaluating identity proofing strength.</p> 
  
  IAL1 (Low Assurance): No requirement to link the individual to a real-world identity; information is self-asserted.  
  IAL2 (Medium Assurance): Uses digital documents as evidence to support the claimed identity's real-world existence and verifies the person's association.  
  IAL3 (High Assurance): Requires an authorized and trained representative to verify the individual in person, often with biometrics, for the highest certainty.  
  
<p>IALs primarily measure assurance at a single point in time, during enrollment or initial identity proofing, and do not cover ongoing authentication.</p> 
<p>Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs) quantify authentication mechanism strength during login:</p> 
  
  AAL1: Typically single-factor (e.g., username/password), generally discouraged for sensitive data.  
  AAL2: Requires at least two distinct authentication factors, designed to resist replay attacks, though SMS OTPs are now less secure.  
  AAL3: The highest level, requiring strong cryptographic device-based authentication (e.g., FIDO security key, device-bound passkeys), highly resistant to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks.  
  
<p></p> 
 Enrollment and Identity Proofing (SP 800-63-A)  
<p>NIST 800-63-A provides practical and prescriptive examples of proofing methods that can be judiciously utilized to meet these varying assurance levels. These methods are designed to collectively minimize the risk of fraudulent identity creation and unauthorized access:</p> 
  
  Document Verification: This involves examining official documents (e.g., passport, driver’s license) either in person or digitally, with technology capable of detecting forgeries or alterations.  
  Facial Recognition with Liveness Detection: This cutting-edge method uses facial biometrics to confirm the person matches the claimed identity. Crucially, liveness detection is integrated to detect and thwart spoofing attempts using photos, videos, or masks.  
  Live Video Verification: This adds a significant layer of human-centric security by facilitating a face-to-face verification session over a secure video conference. An authorized agent engages directly with the individual to confirm liveness and detect signs of coercion.  
  Chat Verification: For lower-risk scenarios or as a preliminary step, chat verification can be employed, often combining AI and human interaction.  
  Location Detection: Verifying the geographical location of the individual during the proofing process can be important, though it must strictly adhere to all privacy regulations.  
  Attestation: A critical component providing an auditable trail, attestation involves a responsible party formally confirming and documenting the results of the identity proofing process, retaining results but not sensitive PII.  
  
<p>The strategic integration of these diverse methods, as meticulously outlined in NIST 800-63-A, culminates in a comprehensive, multi-layered identity proofing ecosystem.</p> 
 Authentication and Lifecycle Management (SP 800-63-B)  
<p>NIST Special Publication 800-63-B delves into the critical area of Authentication and Lifecycle Management, placing significant emphasis on "verifier impersonation resistance," directly acknowledging the widespread and persistent threat of phishing attacks. This mandate means that authentication methods must be meticulously designed to prevent attackers from successfully impersonating legitimate relying parties (e.g., websites, applications) in order to trick unsuspecting users into revealing their credentials or authentication factors.</p> 
<p>The decisive move to deprecate email OTP and significantly downgrade SMS-based authentication in NIST 800-63B directly reflects the understanding that these methods, while once considered helpful, are no longer sufficient to provide adequate assurance against modern, targeted threats.</p> 
 Federation and Assertions (SP 800-63-C)  
<p>The core concept elaborated in 800-63-C is the precise definition of Federated Assurance Levels (FALs). FALs are designed to quantify the confidence that can be placed in the assertions or claims made by one identity provider (often acting as a Credential Service Provider or CSP) to a distinct relying party (or verifier) about a user's identity and their authentication event.</p> 
  
  FAL1 (Low Assurance): Corresponds to the lowest level of confidence in the assertion, often linked to an AAL1 authentication event.  
  FAL2 (Medium Assurance): Reflects a moderate level of confidence, typically corresponding to an AAL2 authentication event.  
  FAL3 (High Assurance): Denotes the highest level of confidence in the assertion, corresponding to an AAL3 authentication event.  
  
<p>These levels are crucial because they enable a relying party to understand and trust the level of rigor and security that was applied by the identity provider in establishing and authenticating that user's identity. This allows for informed risk decisions when granting access based on a federated assertion.</p> 
<p>The process of conveying authentication and attribute information in a federated environment typically involves several key elements:</p> 
  
  Assertions: Cryptographically signed digital statements made by a trusted identity provider about a user's identity or authentication event.  
  Protocols: Standardized technical protocols (e.g., SAML, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) used to securely exchange these assertions.  
  Trust Frameworks: Established frameworks defining policies, procedures, and technical agreements between participating entities to ensure interoperability and security.  
  
<p>Federated identity management significantly improves user experience via single sign-on (SSO) and enhances security by centralizing identity management with trusted providers.</p> 
 Implementation Guidelines for Identity and Authentication Assurance Levels  
<p>Implementing NIST 800-63-3 involves selecting suitable assurance levels and addressing challenges. A common error is only verifying identity at hire; a robust strategy must cover the entire employee lifecycle.</p> 
<p>Critical scenarios requiring secure identity proofing and strong authentication include:</p> 
  
  Employee Onboarding: Ensuring new hires are legitimate before granting system access, preventing interview fraud.  
  Credential Resets: Protecting against social engineering that exploits reset processes, as seen in the MGM Resorts attack.  
  Changing Roles or Elevated Privileges: Re-verifying identity before granting new access levels.  
  Elevated Detected Risk: Prompting re-proofing when monitoring systems detect suspicious activity (e.g., unusual login locations).

<p>“I went to Geneva to understand what, if anything, people were saying regarding digital identity and standards in a governance-focused forum. My brain is now full.”</p>



<p>I’m an identity and standards geek. I adore the topic of identity and the standards development process; everything from the brilliant minds, the challenges, and the intense edge cases. (Well, some of the challenges. I could do without a few.)</p>



<p>But I also recognize that both the identity industry and the standards process have serious issues, especially when it comes to the diversity of representation and issues of governance. Too often, we hear from the same people in the same rooms, solving the same problems.</p>



<p>So, when I knew I’d be in Geneva for the first <a href="https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/">Global Digital Collaboration Conference</a> (which, by the way, exceeded my expectations), I applied for accreditation to attend the <a href="https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2025/">WSIS+20 High-Level Event</a>, hosted by the ITU. The WSIS+20 is, according to their website, “an existing multistakeholder United Nations (UN) process on digital governance and cooperation with a vision of fostering people-centered, inclusive, and development-oriented information and knowledge societies.” My goal was pretty simple: listen to people I don’t usually get to hear from. Try to understand why the worlds of digital identity, governance, and Internet policy remain so siloed, despite everyone’s insistence that this is all interconnected.</p>



<p>I’ve learned a lot. I’m not sure what to do with all of it yet, but I’m glad I came.</p>

 Defending Our Voice: Participation ≠ Power 



<p>Let’s start with the first session I attended: “<a href="https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2025/Agenda/Session/309">Defending Our Voice: Global South Participation in Digital Governance</a>.” Kemly Camacho (Association for Progressive Communications) moderated the session, which included speakers from IT for Change, Derechos Digitales, the UN Human Rights Office, and the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.</p>



<p>They were primarily discussing governance, not technical standards, but a lot of what they said seemed relevant for the standards world, too. Right out of the gate, the first speaker, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandini-chami-03807669/">Nandini Chamim</a>, laid out a set of points I think everyone in identity and standards work should hear:</p>



 
 Presence ≠ Participation: Just being in the room doesn’t mean having influence. Real participation means being able to shape agendas and priorities. 



 Multistakeholder ≠ Public Policy: Equal status in dialogue doesn’t automatically create legitimate public policy. What matters is how different interests are mediated to reach consensus. 



 The Mundial 2014 process raised this issue: Legitimacy in Internet governance must be earned, not assumed through default institutional formats. 



 Trust deficit: Historical data shows ongoing public skepticism. Governance spaces are often dominated by powerful countries and corporations, sidelining the issues important to less-represented groups. 



 Technical ≠ Apolitical: Since WSIS, we’ve seen how technical standards often embed political values. They shape not only systems, but also societal norms. 



 Openness must be questioned: When we talk about openness, we should ask: Openness towards what (i.e., open to what kind of issues?), and for whom? 
 



<p>Even when civil society groups are invited, it’s often tokenistic; visa issues, language barriers, and lack of funding limit meaningful engagement. And when they do show up, there’s often no follow-up, no feedback loops, and no real seat at the agenda-setting table.</p>



 IAM Is a Multi-Tool. We’re Not the Whole Toolbox. 



<p>Another thing that became clear throughout the event was that many of the people here are tackling big problems, and digital identity isn’t exactly one of them.</p>



<p>This reminded me of a conversation I had with Andrew Hindle and Richard Bird at the bar during Identiverse 2025. (All the best conversations seem to happen at the bar.) We talked about how siloed the identity team is within most organizations, even though IAM touches every part of the business.</p>



<p>That conversation led me to understand that identity people often think in systems, but the rest of the organization thinks in functions. HR, finance, compliance, marketing—they’ve all got their own language and priorities. And understanding IAM isn’t in their job description.</p>



<p>WSIS+20 made me realize that the same kind of disconnect exists at the global level, too.</p>



<p>The people in these rooms work on global human rights, economic justice, equity, ethics, and environmental resilience. To them, identity is just one tool in a thousand-piece toolbox. Standards are just one governance process among many. Most of them have never heard of SAML, FIDO, or the W3C Digital Credential API, and don’t need to. They don’t use the terms CIAM, workforce identity, or even authentication and authorization. They have use cases that require things like identity verification, but it’s not on their radar.</p>



<p>What they do understand is that technology is not neutral. Technologists and policymakers must shape it around a platform of human rights. Where I’ve <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/27/governance-decides-if-decentralization-works/">previously written</a> that “the technology is ready, the governance is not,” what I saw here is that the governance work is happening, but it’s happening in a different room, with a very different vocabulary.</p>



 So what do we do about the gap? 



<p>It’s tempting to say we need to get technologists into policy rooms and policymakers into technical working groups. But I don’t think that’s the answer, at least not by itself. This isn’t a matter of “getting in the room.” It’s about figuring out how to share power, information, and influence across two very different systems.</p>



<p>The only halfway-satisfying idea I have right now is this: mandated consultation, in both directions.</p>



 
 Policy decisions should be reviewed by expert technical groups. 



 Technical standards should be reviewed by policymakers and civil society. 
 



<p>Even that solution frustrates me. It’ll slow processes down further in a time when everything else is speeding up. It may leave even more room for de facto standards to take root via market dominance. But I can’t think of another way to bridge the growing legitimacy gap between how we make standards and how people expect governance to work. Consultation also won’t be enough if there’s no way to track what feedback was given, what was included, and, critically, what was left out and why. That’s not just a process problem. That’s a legitimacy problem.</p>



<p>If you have other suggestions, I’m listening.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:04]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com">Spherical Cow Consulting</a>. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Defining the Governance Gap 



 



<p>[00:00:30]<br>So I went to Geneva for the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) meeting. It’s a multistakeholder United Nations process, organized by the ITU, that focuses on digital governance and cooperation.</p>



<p>My goal? To understand what, if anything, people were saying about digital identity and standards in a governance-focused forum.</p>



<p>And it was… really interesting. I’m very glad I went.</p>



<p>Now, if you know me, you know I’m an identity and standards geek. I love the process—well, most of it. The brilliant minds, the weird edge cases, the moments where it feels like we’re collectively inching the Internet forward? I live for that.</p>



<p>But I also recognize the industry’s flaws:</p>



 
 Representation gaps 



 Governance issues 



 Repetition of the same voices and perspectives 
 



<p>And that’s not how progress works.</p>



 



 Finding WSIS and Listening Beyond the Norm 



 



<p>When I found out I’d already be in Geneva for the Global Digital Collaboration Conference (which far exceeded expectations), I applied for accreditation to attend the WSIS+20 High-Level Event.</p>



<p>According to its official description, WSIS is about:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Fostering people-centered, inclusive, and development-oriented information and knowledge societies.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In real terms? It’s the room where governments, civil society, and international organizations gather to talk about the future of digital governance on a global scale.</p>



<p>My objective was simple:<br>Listen to people I don’t normally hear from.<br>And try to understand why identity, governance, and Internet policy feel like separate worlds, even though they’re clearly interconnected.</p>



 



 The Session That Set the Tone 



 



<p>[00:02:43]<br>The first session I attended was titled:<br>Defending Our Global South Participation in Digital Governance.</p>



<p>It was moderated by Kemli Camacho from the Association for Progressive Communications, with panelists from:</p>



 
 IT for Change 



 Derechos Digitales 



 UN Human Rights Office 



 Brazilian Internet Steering Committee 
 



<p>They weren’t there to talk about standards, but what they said resonated powerfully.</p>



<p>A speaker named Nadini Chowni offered some compelling truths:</p>



 
 Presence ≠ Participation<br>Just being in the room doesn’t mean influencing the agenda. Real participation means shaping the priorities—not just reacting to them. 



 Multistakeholder ≠ Public Policy<br>Equal footing in a discussion doesn’t guarantee fair policy outcomes. What really matters is how interests are mediated and resolved. 



 Legitimacy Must Be Earned<br>She referenced the Mundial 2014 process, which emphasized that governance legitimacy is earned—not assumed—just because a structure looks inclusive on paper. 



 There’s a Public Trust Deficit<br>Long-standing skepticism exists due to powerful countries and corporations dominating governance spaces, often sidelining less-represented voices. 
 



<p>And perhaps most importantly:<br>Being technical is not apolitical.<br>The design of standards reflects values. It shapes systems. It sets social norms.</p>



 



 Tokenism, Risk, and Real Costs 



 



<p>[00:04:39]<br>Even when civil society is invited, participation is often tokenistic:</p>



 
 Visa problems 



 Language barriers 



 No travel funding 



 No translation or agenda 



 No follow-up mechanism 
 



<p>As one speaker said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Participation is costly. And it’s risky.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sometimes, just showing up carries political risk. And even then, there’s no guarantee your voice will shape the outcome.</p>



<p>As a working group chair in a standards organization, this hit hard. I try to be inclusive—but I often rely on those who are willing to speak up.</p>



<p>Clearly, I need to do better.</p>



 



 Identity Isn’t the Toolbox—It’s Just a Tool 



 



<p>[00:06:01]<br>Here’s the realization:<br>Identity and access management (IAM) is like a multi-tool—it’s handy, flexible, and powerful.<br>But it’s not the whole toolbox.</p>



<p>At the WSIS event, most people weren’t even thinking about digital identity.</p>



<p>Instead, they were focused on:</p>



 
 Human rights 



 Economic justice 



 Environmental resilience 
 



<p>Digital identity was just one small piece of their broader challenges.</p>



<p>This reminded me of a conversation I had at Identiverse earlier this year—with Andrew Hindle and Richard Bird—about how siloed IAM projects tend to be inside organizations.</p>



<p>Even though identity touches everything (HR, finance, compliance, security), it often goes unacknowledged across domains.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



 
 IAM folks think in systems 



 Others think in functions 
 



<p>Different language. Different priorities. Different goals.</p>



<p>And at a global level, it’s the same. The WSIS crowd? They’ve never heard of SAML or FIDO. They’re not discussing consumer or workforce identity.</p>



<p>They’re talking about:</p>



 
 Data sovereignty 



 Rights 



 Accountability 
 



<p>They expect technologists to embed human rights into the systems they build.</p>



 



 Governance Is Happening… Somewhere Else 



 



<p>[00:07:42]<br>I used to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Technology is ready; governance is not.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, I’m not so sure. Governance is happening—just in other rooms, with very different vocabulary.</p>



<p>And that’s overwhelming.</p>



<p>We’ve got:</p>



 
 WSIS 



 IGF 



 Global Digital Collaboration 



 National frameworks 



 Regional strategies 
 



<p>Even experts struggle to keep up.<br>For civil society groups, trying to monitor all that—on tight budgets, in multiple languages—it’s nearly impossible.</p>



<p>That’s not just a risk. It’s already causing:</p>



 
 Fragmentation 



 Incompatibility 



 Conflicting outcomes 
 



<p>And no one wins.</p>



 



 The Gap Isn’t Just Presence—It’s Power 



 



<p>[00:08:45]<br>So how do we bridge that gap?</p>



<p>It’s tempting to say:<br>“Just bring technologists into policy rooms and policymakers into technical working groups.”</p>



<p>But that’s not enough.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because it’s not about presence. It’s about power—and how to share it across two very different systems.</p>



<p>One half-formed idea:<br>Create mandated consultations in both directions.</p>



 
 Policy decisions get reviewed by expert technical groups 



 Technical standards get reviewed by policymakers and civil society 
 



<p>That should be baseline practice.</p>



<p>But even that frustrates me—because it’s going to slow us down. And we’re already struggling to keep up.</p>



<p>And the slower we go, the more room there is for de facto standards—those not built on consensus, but on market dominance.</p>



<p>Still, I can’t see another way to address the legitimacy gap.</p>



<p>And consultation alone isn’t enough without accountability.</p>



 



 What Happens Next? 



 



<p>[00:09:53]<br>One of the speakers noted that the WSIS Elements Paper—the framework guiding these discussions—barely included strong human rights language.</p>



<p>It was, in their words, “legally timid.”</p>



<p>So we need more than just listening.</p>



<p>We need:</p>



 
 Traceability 



 Transparency 



 Accountability 
 



<p>We need to track:</p>



 
 What feedback was given 



 What was included 



 What was excluded—and why 
 



<p>This isn’t just a process gap.<br>It’s a legitimacy problem.</p>



<p>If you’ve been in one of these policy rooms, or tried to bring identity work into broader governance conversations, I would truly love to hear from you.</p>



<p>Because honestly? I don’t see how we get from two parallel worlds to one where we can truly collaborate.</p>



<p>But I’m listening.</p>



 



 Final Thoughts

            <p>Thales is proud to have partnered with the first edition of the International Physics Olympiad held in France. From the STEM for ALL prize giving to a visit of our Palaiseau laboratory, relive a week dedicated to excellence and diversity among tomorrow's young scientific talents.</p>
<p>First held in 1967, the International Physics Olympiad is the world’s most prestigious physics competition for young people under twenty. It brings together over a thousand participants from nearly 90 countries to celebrate physics and support the students who will shape the science of tomorrow.</p>
<p>At Thales, encouraging science, technology, and vocations in STEM fields is one of our priorities. That is why we are proud of having been a partner of the first edition of this competition held in France, which took place from July 18 to 24 in the Paris region.</p>
<p>During the closing ceremony, Marko Erman, Chief Scientific Officer of Thales, awarded a grant as part of the STEM for ALL programme to five students who showed great motivation for STEM fields despite the social challenges they face.</p>
<blockquote><p>The International Physics Olympiad is a testament to the scientific excellence of young people from around the world. Through the STEM for ALL grants, we aim to encourage the commitment and diversity of these future talents by giving them the means to pursue their passion for science and to take on tomorrow’s challenges.<br>
Marko Erman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The five recipients are part of delegations from Nigeria, Pakistan, Spain, Turkmenistan, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>As a sponsor, Thales also welcomed more than 60 students from 17 countries to the Thales Research &amp; Technology laboratory in Palaiseau. They were able to discover the Group’s latest innovations in physics: next-generation quantum sensors, superhydrophobic materials, and high-power lasers. They also had a special opportunity to interact with our scientific experts about their recent work and learn about the many possible career paths available to them.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is essential to spark curiosity and foster the desire to innovate among young generations. Supporting them and helping them discover the diversity of scientific and technological professions is an investment in our collective future.<br>
Amélie Ravier,&nbsp;Executive Director, Thales Solidarity<br>
&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

  UK MSBs face increased FCA scrutiny in 2025. This article shows how to modernize AML and sanctions screening to reduce false positives, manage alerts, and stay compliant at scale.

<p>Money service businesses (MSBs) in the UK face growing regulatory pressure from the FCA. This article explains how automated AML screening, real-time sanctions checks, and audit-ready tools can help MSBs manage compliance risk, reduce false positives, and prepare for increased oversight.</p>
 
 Money service businesses (MSBs) in the UK—including remittance providers, currency exchanges, and payment platforms—operate in a high-risk environment. With financial crime threats rising and regulatory expectations tightening, these firms must now demonstrate proactive, real-time anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. 
<p>In 2025, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is sharpening its focus on MSBs. Failures to screen transactions, monitor for suspicious behaviour, or implement effective controls can result in serious penalties, deauthorisation, or reputational harm.</p>
 FCA Priorities for MSBs 
<p>The FCA expects all MSBs to implement a robust AML framework that includes:</p>
 
 Customer due diligence (CDD) for both individuals and business clients 
 Ongoing sanctions screening and politically exposed person (PEP) checks 
 Transaction monitoring and alert escalation 
 Clear audit trails for all risk-based decisions 
 Timely suspicious activity reporting (SARs) 
 
<p>Additionally, firms must ensure compliance with the UK Sanctions List maintained by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).</p>
 Key Challenges Facing UK MSBs 
<p>1. High Transaction Volume and Velocity<br>
Remittance firms and currency exchanges often process thousands of transactions per day, making manual screening impractical.</p>
<p>2. False Positives and Alert Fatigue<br>
Outdated screening systems may generate excessive alerts, slowing reviews and leading to oversight risks.</p>
<p>3. Staff Capacity and Consistency<br>
Small compliance teams may struggle to maintain consistent review standards across geographies or service lines.</p>
<p>4. Fragmented Data and Documentation<br>
Disconnected onboarding, transaction, and case management systems make it difficult to build an audit-ready record of compliance.</p>
 How iComply Helps UK MSBs Stay Compliant 
<p>iComply offers a scalable compliance platform tailored to the needs of fast-moving, high-volume money service providers.</p>
 1. Real-Time AML and Sanctions Screening 
 
 Integrate with UK and global watchlists (OFSI, UN, EU, etc.) 
 Screen natural persons and entities at onboarding and continuously 
 Flag PEPs, sanctioned individuals, and adverse media hits 
 
 2. Automated Risk Scoring and Alerts 
 
 Customize risk thresholds by geography, transaction size, or client type 
 Trigger alerts for review, escalation, or SAR filing 
 Reduce false positives using contextual data and identity matching 
 
 3. Centralized Case Management 
 
 Document findings, decisions, and next steps in a single dashboard 
 Assign team roles and track case resolution timelines 
 Export reports for internal audits or FCA inspections 
 
 4. Audit-Ready Logs and Compliance Reporting 
 
 Maintain immutable logs of all screening actions 
 Generate structured SARs and compliance reports on demand 
 Support full FCA audit traceability 
 
 5. Data Privacy and Localization Controls 
 
 Comply with UK GDPR and OFSI disclosure requirements 
 Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted and stored in the UK 
 
 Case Insight: Money Services Business in London 
<p>A multi-jurisdictional money services business integrated iComply to consolidate onboarding and screening across five countries. In less than three months:</p>
 
 Reduced false positives by 42% 
 Cut review time from 2 hours to 20 minutes per flagged case 
 Passed an FCA spot check with zero findings 
 
 What to Expect in 2025 
 
 FCA Enforcement Surge: More on-site inspections and thematic reviews of AML controls 
 Sanctions Expansion: Increased OFSI updates related to geopolitical instability 
 Tech Adoption Mandates: Growing regulatory expectation to adopt RegTech and eliminate manual-only workflows 
 
 Take Action 
<p>MSBs that fail to modernize AML compliance are at risk of enforcement actions, fines, and loss of authorisation. But those who invest in scalable, intelligent tools can turn compliance into a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Schedule a consultation with iComply to see how we help UK MSBs screen smarter, stay compliant, and scale with confidence.</p>

<p>This is paramount. Identify which specific leagues, teams, and tournaments you absolutely need to watch (e.g., Premier League, NFL, NBA, Champions League, Formula 1). Research which platforms hold the broadcasting rights for best sports streaming sites in your region. Don’t assume all services offer everything.</p>



 Prioritize Stream Quality &amp; Reliability 



<p>Look for services that consistently offer HD or 4K streaming for a crisp picture. Equally important is minimal buffering and lag, especially for live events where every second counts. Read reviews about best sports streaming sites stability during peak viewing times.</p>



 Evaluate Device Compatibility &amp; User Interface 



<p>Ensure the service works seamlessly on all your preferred devices (smart TV, phone, tablet, computer, gaming console). A clean, intuitive user interface is crucial for easily finding games, navigating schedules, and managing your account without frustration.</p>



 Compare Pricing &amp; Value 



<p>Assess the subscription cost against the channel lineup and includes features. Some services offer a broader range of content at a higher price, while others specialize and are more budget-friendly. Look out for bundles (e.g., ESPN+ with Hulu) that might offer better overall value for your entertainment needs.</p>



 Check for Key Features 



 
 Cloud DVR: Can you record live games to watch later? Is there a storage limit? 



 Simultaneous Streams: How many devices can you watch at once? (Important for households with multiple viewers). 



 Multi-View/Split Screen: Can you watch multiple games simultaneously? (Highly sought after for major sports days). 



 Exclusive Content: Does the platform offer original sports shows, documentaries, or behind-the-scenes access? 



 Ad Experience: How frequent and intrusive are the ads? Are there ad-free tiers available? 
 



 Utilize Free Trials 



<p>Many reputable streaming services offer free trials. This is the best way to test out the platform’s content, stream quality, user interface, and features before committing to a subscription.</p>



 Read Reviews &amp; Get Recommendations 



<p>Consult reliable tech and sports media reviews, and ask other sports fans for their experiences with different services. User feedback can highlight pros and cons that aren’t obvious from a features list.</p>



 Consider Bundles &amp; Add-ons 



<p>Sometimes, combining a base streaming service with a specific sports add-on (like the B/R Sports add-on on Max, or NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV) is the most cost-effective way to get all the content you want.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The realm of best sports streaming sites in 2025 offers an unparalleled array of options, making it easier than ever for fans to follow their passions. Whether you’re a die-hard football fanatic, a basketball enthusiast, or a lover of niche sports, the perfect platform awaits.</p>



<p>As you finalize your choice, remember that the “best” site is ultimately the one that aligns with your specific viewing habits, desired features like 4K quality and DVR, and the precise leagues you can’t miss. With the continuous evolution of features like multi-view options, lower latency, and seamless integrations, 2025 promises an even more immersive and flexible sports viewing experience. So, pick your best sports streaming sites, settle in, and get ready for a year filled with exhilarating live action!</p>

 Tips for Finding the Best New Movies on Stream 



 Utilize Dedicated Streaming Guides &amp; Aggregators 



<p>Websites and apps like JustWatch, Reelgood, and TVGuide are invaluable. They aggregate content from multiple streaming services, allow you to filter by platform, genre, release year, and even track your watchlist across different services.</p>



 Check Platform “New Release” Sections Regularly 



<p>Every major streaming service (Netflix, HBO Max, Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Apple TV+, etc.) has a “New &amp; Trending” or “Recently Added” section. Make these your first stop for fresh content.</p>



 Follow Reputable Entertainment News Sites &amp; Critics 



<p>Keep an eye on well-known movie review sites (Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, IMDb), entertainment news outlets (Variety, Hollywood Reporter, TheWrap, Mashable), and film blogs/podcasts. They often highlight upcoming releases and critical darlings.</p>



 Dive into Genre-Specific Lists 



<p>If you’re in the mood for something specific, search for “best new horror movies streaming 2025” or “top sci-fi films on Netflix 2025.” Many sites curate lists by genre, which can lead you to hidden gems.</p>



 Leverage Platform Recommendation Engines 



<p>Your streaming service’s algorithm learns from your viewing history. While not perfect, paying attention to its “Recommended for You” or “Because You Watched…” sections can introduce you to new films aligned with your taste.</p>


 
 


 Watch Trailers and Previews 



<p>Before committing to a full movie, watch the trailer. Most platforms integrate trailers directly into their listings, giving you a quick glimpse of the plot, style, and cast to help you decide.</p>



 Engage with Online Communities &amp; Social Media 



<p>Join movie-focused Reddit communities, Facebook groups, or follow film critics and entertainment accounts on social media. These communities are often quick to share new discoveries, recommendations, and discussions.</p>



 Explore “Coming Soon” Sections 



<p>Look for sections dedicated to upcoming releases on your preferred platforms. This allows you to mark your calendar and get excited about films launching in the near future.</p>



 Consider Third-Party Review Sites 



<p>Before diving in, check out external reviews and ratings from both critics and general audiences on sites like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes. While taste is subjective, this can give you a good idea of a film’s overall reception.</p>



 Don’t Forget About Theatrical-to-Stream Transitions 



<p>Many major films still have a theatrical release first, but quickly make their way to streaming platforms. Stay updated on these transitions to catch critically acclaimed movies shortly after their cinema run.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The cinematic landscape continues its rapid evolution in 2025, with streaming platforms firmly established as primary destinations for the year’s most anticipated films. From star-studded blockbusters making their way quickly from theaters to your living room, to innovative originals pushing creative boundaries, the selection of best new movies on stream offers something for every taste.</p>



<p>As you navigate the exciting releases of 2025, remember that enhancing your streaming experience with tools like Herond Browser, which prioritize speed, security, and ad-free viewing, can make all the difference. Stay updated with new release schedules, leverage aggregation sites, and trust your personal taste to ensure you’re always tuned into the very best new movies on stream in 2025.

<p>In our <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/1-hpps-role-in-the-ai-driven-crypto-future-from-wallets-to-agents-e61b0397238b">previous article</a>, we explored how HPP unlocks intelligent, agent-driven finance through AI-powered DeFi (DeFAI). In this second installment, we shift the focus to infrastructure — specifically, how HPP is building the coordination layer for a decentralized, SLM-powered AI&nbsp;economy.</p><blockquote>TL;DR:<br>HPP is building the blockchain infrastructure for the post-LLM era, where AI is powered by lightweight, modular Small Language Models (SLMs) instead of monolithic LLMs. Unlike LLMs, SLMs are efficient, fine-tunable, and privacy-preserving, making them ideal for enterprises such as banks and healthcare providers. HPP provides the coordination, payment, and verification layers necessary for these models and agents to collaborate in real-time. Through AI-native tools like Noösphere, developers and users can deploy agent-based services, conduct off-chain AI reasoning, and enable micro-payments between&nbsp;models.</blockquote><p>In the era of artificial intelligence, it’s easy to assume that bigger means better. Large Language Models (LLMs) have dazzled the public, but for enterprises, their size is often a liability rather than an asset. HPP is being built from the ground up to support a different future — one where AI is modular, composable, and deployed with real-world constraints in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>This is the future of SLMs (Small Language Models), and HPP is the infrastructure designed to support&nbsp;it.</p> Why SLMs Will Matter More Than&nbsp;LLMs <p>While LLMs dominate headlines, their use in enterprise and government environments is limited by fundamental issues. These include massive compute requirements, opaque data processing, and a lack of enterprise-level support and maintenance.</p><p>In sectors like finance, healthcare, and public infrastructure, where Aergo has already built strong credibility, such instability is a non-starter. These institutions prioritize predictability, data sovereignty, and ease of maintenance. LLMs typically fall short in all three&nbsp;areas.</p><p>SLMs, on the other hand, offer a practical path forward. They run efficiently on existing hardware, can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, and keep sensitive data local without relying on public inference APIs. For enterprise-grade AI to scale effectively, it must be tailored to its specific environment. That’s what SLMs&nbsp;enable.</p> So Why Is HPP Launching Now? <p>HPP didn’t appear out of nowhere. It was created in response to a growing need. As enterprises began adopting specialized AI models, a critical bottleneck emerged — the lack of a secure and verifiable coordination layer between models, agents, and humans. Smart contracts alone couldn’t handle this&nbsp;need.</p><p>HPP is being launched to fill that gap. It is designed not only to process transactions but also to orchestrate distributed intelligence in a trusted and scalable&nbsp;manner.</p> What Makes HPP Different? <p>HPP (House Party Protocol) is Aergo’s next-generation evolution. It is a Layer 2 AI-native network designed to facilitate real-time, verifiable coordination among agents, models, and&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Here’s how we are aligning with the rise of the SLM&nbsp;economy:</p>  SLM-Oriented Architecture: HPP’s infrastructure supports lightweight inference, agent execution, and off-chain verification. This is optimized for high-frequency, low-latency decision-making.  Agent-to-Agent Payments: With tokenized microtransactions, HPP enables autonomous systems to transact with each other. These include sensor-to-sensor, bot-to-bot, and model-to-model interactions.  Programmable Coordination Layer: HPP is not just a smart contract platform. It is a coordination layer that allows distributed teams of agents to operate, cooperate, and resolve logic through programmable protocols.  Off-Chain Intelligence with Noösphere: Developers can offload computation-heavy tasks to trusted off-chain environments, then bring back proofs or results on-chain for transparency and auditability.  Plus-and-Play AI Services: Users can subscribe to or deploy specialized SLMs into their wallets. At the same time, developers can compose multiple agents into dApps or workflows, enabling projects to offer AI-as-a-Service directly on top of&nbsp;HPP.   A Financial Layer for the Machine&nbsp;Economy <p>The agent economy demands a new kind of currency. SLMs and agents execute countless micro-transactions, often worth fractions of a cent, in real-time. Traditional finance cannot keep up with this scale or speed.

 Why use Okta for authentication 

<p>Building an authentication system and handling credentials, sessions, and tokens is highly insecure and exposes your application to serious vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Okta provides a secure, scalable, and standards-based solution using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0. It also integrates seamlessly with OIDC client libraries for your favorite tech stack and allows you to fetch tokens.</p>

 Why use PKCE in OAuth 2.0 

<p>To further strengthen security, this project uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636">RFC 7636</a>. PKCE is a security extension to the Authorization Code flow. Developers initially designed PKCE for mobile apps, but experts now recommend it for all OAuth clients, including web apps. It helps prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks and makes it useful for every type of OAuth client, even confidential clients such as web apps that use client secrets. As OAuth 2.0 has steadily evolved, security best practices have also advanced. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html">RFC 9700: Best Current Practice for OAuth 2.0 Security</a> captures the consensus on the most effective and secure implementation strategies. Additionally, the upcoming OAuth 2.1 draft requires PKCE for all authorization code flows, reinforcing it as a baseline security standard.</p>

<p>With Okta, you can implement modern authentication features and focus on your application logic without worrying about authentication infrastructure.</p>

 A secure web app using Express, OAuth 2.0, and PKCE 

<p>Let’s build an expense dashboard where users log in with Okta and view spending data based on their role. Whether they work in Finance, Marketing, or HR, each team views only its own expenses. To keep things minimal in this demo project, we’ll define roles and users directly in the app.</p>

<p>You’ll also use OpenID Connect (OIDC) through the openid-client library for authentication. Then, you’ll map each user’s email from the ID token to a team. The dashboard applies principles of least privilege and displays expenses by team, so each user sees only their department’s spending.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

 
   
    <p>Node.js installed (v22+ recommended)</p>
   
   
    <p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Integrator Free Plan org</a></p>
   
 

 Create your Express project and install dependencies 

<p>Create a new project folder named <code>express-project-okta</code>, and open a terminal window in the project folder.</p>

<p>Initialize a new Node.js project:</p>

   <code>npm init -y
</code>   

<p>Install the required packages:</p>

   <code>npm install express@5.1 passport@0.7 openid-client@6.6 express-session@1.18 ejs@3.1 express-ejs-layouts@2.5 dotenv
</code>   

<p>Now, install the development dependencies:</p>

   <code>npm install --save-dev nodemon
</code>   

<p>In the package.json file, update the scripts property with the following:</p>

   <code>  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js"
  }
</code>   

<p>What do these dependencies do?</p>

<p>These installed packages become your Express project’s dependencies.</p>

 
   
    <p><code>express</code>: Handles routing and HTTP middleware for your web app</p>
   
   
    <p><code>passport</code>: Sets up and maintains server-side sessions</p>
   
   
    <p><code>openid-client</code>: Node.js OIDC library with PKCE support; handles the OAuth handshake and token exchange.</p>
   
   
    <p><code>express-session</code>: Manages user sessions on the server</p>
   
   
    <p><code>dotenv</code>: Loads environment variables from a <code>.env</code> file</p>
   
   
    <p><code>ejs</code>: Enables dynamic HTML rendering using embedded JavaScript templates</p>
   
   
    <p><code>express-ejs-layouts</code>: Adds layout support to EJS, helping manage common layout structures across views</p>
   
 

 Configure environment variables for OIDC authentication 

<p>Create a <code>.env</code> file in the root directory with placeholders for your Okta configuration.</p>

   <code>OKTA_ISSUER=
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={clientSecret}
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
POST_LOGOUT_URL=http://localhost:3000
</code>   

<p>In the next step, you’ll get these values from your Okta Admin Console.</p>

 Create the Okta OIDC web application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need an Okta Integrator Free Plan account. To get one, sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Once you have an account, sign in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Next, in the Admin Console:</p>

 
   Go to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Click Create App Integration 
   Select OIDC - OpenID Connect as the sign-in method 
   Select Web Application as the application type, then click Next 
   
    <p>Enter an app integration name</p>
   
   Configure the redirect URIs:
     
       Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code> 
       Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:3000</code> 
     
   
   In the Controlled access section, select the appropriate access level 
   Click Save 
 


  Where are my new app's credentials?

<p>Creating an OIDC Web App manually in the Admin Console configures your Okta Org with the application settings.</p>

<p>After creating the app, you can find the configuration details on the app’s General tab:</p>

 
   Client ID: Found in the Client Credentials section 
   Client Secret: Click Show in the Client Credentials section to reveal 
   Issuer: Found in the Issuer URI field for the authorization server that appears by selecting Security &gt; API from the navigation pane. 
 

<p>You’ll need these values for your application configuration:</p>

   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">Okta PowerShell Module</a> to automate this process. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">this guide</a> for more information about setting up your app.</p>



 Build the Express app 

<p>Create an <code>index.js</code> file in your project root. It serves as the main entry point for your application. Use it to initialize the Express app, set up the routes, and configure <a href="https://www.passportjs.org/">Passport</a> to manage user sessions by serializing and deserializing users on each request.</p>

   <code>import express from 'express';
import session from 'express-session';
import passport from 'passport'; 
import routes from './routes.js';
import expressLayouts from 'express-ejs-layouts';

const app = express();

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(expressLayouts); 
app.set('layout', 'layout');
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use(session({
  secret: "your-hardcoded-secret",
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
}));

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());

passport.serializeUser(function (user, done) {
  done(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function (obj, done) {
  done(null, obj);
});

app.use('/', routes);

app.listen(3000, () =&gt; {
  console.log('Server listening on http://localhost:3000');
});
</code>   

 Define team mapping and sample expenses 

<p>Create a <code>utils.js</code> file to serve as a data module for your project. This file includes a user-to-team mapping and has dummy expense data for each team, covering all teams configured for testing in your web app.</p>

<p>The application determines the user’s team context from the email claim in the ID token and filters the expense list accordingly, so the dashboard displays only that team’s data.</p>

<p>To customize the data, open <code>utils.js</code> and update the following objects:</p>

 
   
    <p><code>ALL_TEAMS_NAME</code> - an array listing all teams in your organization</p>
   
   
    <p><code>userTeamMap</code> - maps each user’s email (or “admin” for full access) to a specific team</p>
   
   
    <p><code>dummyExpenseData</code> - contains sample expense data for each team</p>
   
 

   <code>export const ALL_TEAMS_NAME = ["finance", "hr", "legal", "marketing", "dev advocacy"];

export const userTeamMap = {
  "hannah.smith@task-vantage.com": "admin",
  "grace.li@task-vantage.com": "legal",

export function getModifiedTeam(team) {
  if (!team?.trim()) return [];

  const toPascalCase = (str) =&gt;
    str
      .trim()
      .split(/\s+/)
      .map((word) =&gt; word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase())
      .join(' ');

  const toKebabCase = (str) =&gt; str.trim().toLowerCase().split(' ').join('-');

    }));
  }

  return [
    {
      id: toKebabCase(team),
      label: toPascalCase(team),
    },
  ];
}
</code>   

<p>The file also defines <code>getModifiedTeam</code>, a helper that converts a team name into an array of objects. Each object has an id and a label. If the team is admin, the function returns an object for every entry in <code>ALL_TEAMS_NAME</code>; otherwise, it returns a single object for the specified team. Later in the project, the app calls this function to transform the user’s team information.</p>

 Create a file to handle authentication 

<p>Create an <code>auth.js</code> file for this step. This file uses the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/openid-client">openid-client</a> library to handle the OIDC flow: it logs users in, exchanges the authorization code for tokens, and logs them out. It also defines a middleware that guards protected routes.</p>

<p>In the auth.js file, add the following code:</p>

   <code>import * as client from "openid-client";
import "dotenv/config";

import { getModifiedTeam, userTeamMap } from './utils.js';

async function getClientConfig() {
  return await client.discovery(new URL(process.env.OKTA_ISSUER), process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID, process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET);
}

export async function login(req, res) {
  try {
    const openIdClientConfig = await getClientConfig();

    const code_verifier = client.randomPKCECodeVerifier();
    const code_challenge = await client.calculatePKCECodeChallenge(code_verifier);
    const state = client.randomState();

    req.session.pkce = { code_verifier, state };
    req.session.save(); 

    const authUrl = client.buildAuthorizationUrl(openIdClientConfig, {
      scope: "openid profile email offline_access",
      state,
      code_challenge,
      code_challenge_method: "S256",
      redirect_uri: `${process.env.APP_BASE_URL}/authorization-code/callback`,
    });

    res.redirect(authUrl);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send("Something failed during the authorization request");
  }
}

function getCallbackUrlWithParams(req) {
  const host = req.headers["x-forwarded-host"] || req.headers.host || "localhost";
  const protocol = req.headers["x-forwarded-proto"] || req.protocol;
  const currentUrl = new URL(`${protocol}://${host}${req.originalUrl}`);
  return currentUrl;
}

export async function authCallback(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const openIdClientConfig = await getClientConfig();

    const { pkce } = req.session;

    if (!pkce || !pkce.code_verifier || !pkce.state) {
      throw new Error("Login session expired or invalid. Please try logging in again.");
    }

    const tokenSet = await client.authorizationCodeGrant(openIdClientConfig, getCallbackUrlWithParams(req), {
      pkceCodeVerifier: pkce.code_verifier,
      expectedState: pkce.state,
    });

    const { name, email } = tokenSet.claims();
    const teams = getModifiedTeam(userTeamMap[email]);

    const userProfile = {
      name,
      email,
      teams,
      idToken: tokenSet.id_token,
    };

    delete req.session.pkce;

    req.logIn(userProfile, (err) =&gt; {
      if (err) {
        return next(err);
      }

      return res.redirect("/dashboard");
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Authentication error:", error.message);
    return res.status(500).send(`Authentication failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}

export async function logout(req, res) {
  try {
    const openIdClientConfig = await getClientConfig();

    const id_token_hint = req.user?.idToken;

    const logoutUrl = client.buildEndSessionUrl(openIdClientConfig, {
      id_token_hint,
      post_logout_redirect_uri: process.env.POST_LOGOUT_URL,
    });

    req.logout((err) =&gt; {
      if (err) return next(err);

      req.session.destroy((err) =&gt; {
        if (err) return next(err);
        res.redirect(logoutUrl);
      });
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Something went wrong during logout.');
  }
}

export function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect("/login");
}
</code>   

<p>This file includes the following functions:</p>

 
   <code>getClientConfig</code> - Retrieves the authorization server’s metadata using the discovery endpoint. 
   <code>login</code> - This function starts the Authorization Code + PKCE flow. It generates the required values to enable PKCE: the code_verifier and code_challenge. These values, along with the <code>state</code> value protect the user sign in process from attack vectors. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636">PKCE</a> protects against auth code interception attacks, and the state parameter protects against <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a>. The openid-client builds the user sign in URL with these values and redirects the user to Okta to complete the authentication challenge. 
   <code>getCallbackUrlWithParams</code> - Reconstructs the complete callback URL, including protocol, host, path, and query. 
   <code>authCallback</code> - This function runs when the user redirects back to the app after the authentication challenge succeeds. At this point, the redirect URL back into the application includes the auth code. The OIDC client verifies the auth code by checking that the state value matches the parameter in the first redirect. Once verified, the openid-client library uses the auth code for the token exchange by adding the code_verifier to the token request. The authorization server validates the auth code and the code_verifier value to ensure the request comes from the client making the original authentication request, mitigating attacks using stolen auth codes.
Once we get back valid tokens, we handle the app’s business logic, such as mapping the user to a team and storing the profile details and ID token in the session. If everything succeeds, it redirects the user to the dashboard. 
   <code>logout</code> - Logs the user out of the app and redirects to the post-logout URL. 
   <code>ensureAuthenticated</code> - Middleware that allows authenticated users to proceed and redirects others to the login page. 
 

 Set up routing in Express 

<p>Now things start to come together and feel like a real app. The <code>routes.js</code> file defines all the essential routes, from login and logout to viewing your profile, the expense dashboard, and individual team expense pages. The app handles each endpoint’s core logic and checks a user’s authentication status before granting access to protected pages.</p>

<p>It acts as our app’s traffic controller, directing users to the right pages and ensuring that only logged-in users can view sensitive information like the expense dashboard or group details. This structure keeps our app organized and secure and lays the foundation for a smooth user experience.</p>

   <code>import express from "express";
import "dotenv/config";

import { authCallback, ensureAuthenticated, login, logout } from "./auth.js";
import { dummyExpenseData } from './utils.js';

const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.render("home", { title: "Home", user: req.user });
});

 Add EJS views in Express 

<p>Now it’s time to give the app a user interface. You’ll use EJS templates to build pages that respond dynamically to who’s logged in and what data they see. The app uses <code>ejs</code> templates to render the pages, plus <code>express-ejs-layouts</code> for common layout structures.</p>

<p>Create a folder named <code>views</code>, then add the following EJS files:</p>

<p>home.ejs</p>

   <code>&lt;% if (user) { %&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome, &lt;%= user.name || 'User' %&gt;!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;% } else { %&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Log your expenses and manage your team's spending on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;% if (user) { %&gt;
&lt;a href="/dashboard" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Go to Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;% } else { %&gt;
&lt;a href="/login" class="btn btn-success"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;

 Run the Express app with authentication 

<p>In your terminal, start the server:</p>

<p><code>npm start</code></p>

<p>Open your browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p>

<p>Click Login and authenticate with your Okta account. The app then displays your Expense Dashboard, Profile, and a Log out option.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: When you’re signed in to the Developer Console as an admin, Okta keeps your org session active and automatically logs you into the app. To test other user accounts, use an incognito tab to test the login flow.</p>
</blockquote>

 Admin view: 

<p></p>

 User view: 

<p></p>

 Expenses view: 

<p></p>

<p>And that’s it! You’ve built a secure Expense Dashboard and connected your Express application to Okta using OIDC and OAuth.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick rundown of the features I used in this project to build a secure expense dashboard:</p>

 
   
    <p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity and authentication layer built on OAuth 2.0.</p>
   
   
    <p>Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is the most secure flow for server-side and browser-based web apps.</p>

            <p>With its aim of ‘digitising’ the North Atlantic via an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) barrier comprising networked ships, uncrewed vehicles (UVs) and AI-enabled acoustic sensors, Project CABOT is reshaping how undersea threats are detected and deterred.</p>
<p>On 16th July, representatives from thirty SMEs gathered at the National Museum of the Royal Navy to rally around Project CABOT’s problem statement.&nbsp;<br>
Hosted by Thales, the day was one of collaboration, curiosity and shared intent, with each organisation communicating how their current, evolving and future capabilities might contribute to the programme’s success. Collaborative workshops troubleshooted the sorts of challenges that might stall or scupper what the Royal Navy is trying to get done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the sun set over Portsmouth, so too did the energy in the room become increasingly invigorated and infectious. After all, CABOT presents an enticing, extraordinary opportunity for industry - one in which it’s not simply delivering solutions but, instead, solving problems and defining an approach with knowledge sharing, trust and accountability at the helm - with an ecosystem of partners working together to deliver.</p>
 Unpacking CABOT’s complexity 
<p>CABOT is not a standalone initiative. It’s grounded firmly within the broader strategic imperative for persistent, integrated and decisive ASW capability across the North Atlantic. The stakes are high: as undersea threats proliferate and adversaries grow more agile and emboldened, so too must the UK’s ability to detect, track, and respond with equal speed and accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the programme’s challenges range from sensor fusion and data latency to the orchestration of autonomous systems at scale, each buffeted by environmental factors (temperatures, salinity, currents and seabed topography) which will affect the ongoing effectiveness of the ASW barrier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power supply and sustainability remains a constraint for long-duration, real-world deployments, especially when many current autonomous platforms can only stay on task for a few days.</p>
<p>Then there are the more bureaucratic, institutional barriers to greater industry collaboration and SME engagement with programmes like CABOT. Where SMEs face time-intensive, costly compliance requirements and bidding processes that divert resources away from core business activities. There may also be difficulty connecting with - and differentiating themselves from - larger organisations, and limited access to funding (to name but a few).</p>
<p>But the mood in the room was far from daunted. Instead, optimism and urgency coexisted. Participants weren't there to admire the problem; they were there to dismantle it.</p>
 Strength in numbers: the enterprise approach to subsea defence 
<p>Agile, inventive and unburdened by bureaucracy, the SME ecosystem is both a critical enabler of CABOT and a catalyst for the future of ASW more widely. It’s one that Thales has been curating deliberately over time - connecting capabilities, nurturing relationships and creating the conditions for trust to flourish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A useful example is the collective effort of SMEs in supporting the Royal Navy’s Dreadnought submarines with Sonar 2076, one of the most advanced systems of its kind. Spearhead (rapid capability, development and deployment in ASW) and CUES&nbsp;(Complex Underwater Environmental Sensor)&nbsp;are also demonstrations of how bringing innovation to the front line relies on the ability to integrate and iterate quickly, backed by the flexibility and specialist knowledge that smaller suppliers bring.</p>
<p>The benefits are mutual. Where SMEs help larger, slower, bureaucracy-bound organisations stay sharp and responsive, these same organisations can bring scale, insight and access to elevate the efforts of SMEs and prospective partners. Decades of close customer engagement and minds full of institutional knowledge mean companies like Thales can ground the aspirations and innovations of SMEs in the current operational context, helping whole ecosystems understand not just what the problem is, but how it plays out on the front line.&nbsp;</p>
 From North Atlantic to global stage: CABOT’s strategic ripple 
<p>Project CABOT may be focused on a specific challenge in a specific theatre, but it’s reflective of a much broader strategic need: shoring up the UK’s defence and industrial resilience at sea, on land and in the skies - and creating and sustaining SQEP’s (Suitably Qualified and Experienced People) against the backdrop of emerging technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course there is a defence dividend that comes along with the SME ecosystem approach - investment in jobs and communities, localised prosperity and the associated economic benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where plans like Readiness 2030 (previously ReArm Europe) signal demand and intent to fortify the West’s competitive edge against rising geopolitical instability, Project CABOT serves as a testbed for how the UK and its partners can deliver capability at pace and with purpose, underscored by an enterprise approach with SME mission partners deeply embedded from the outset.</p>
<p>Because Thales knows as well as its current and potential partners: when it comes to making sure the UK and its allies are ready, resilient and perpetually prepared, it’ll be all hands on deck.<br>

 Identity Fraud: A $50 billion opportunity in disguise for insurance companies&nbsp; 



<p>Identity fraud isn’t slowing down. In fact, it’s accelerating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to recent projections, global identity fraud losses will pass $50 billion by 2025, driven by phishing, synthetic identities, and data breaches across digital ecosystems. For insurance providers, this growing crisis is not just a threat. It’s a massive opportunity to offer high-value, proactive solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter identity fraud solutions for insurance: bundled tools and services that go beyond claims and coverage to actively protect customers in their everyday digital lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What’s driving the surge in identity fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>As more of life moves online, and with generative AI and dark web data trading on the rise, identity theft has become faster, smarter, and far more widespread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key trends include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Synthetic identity fraud, where fake personas are created using real and fabricated data. 



 Phishing and account takeovers, primarily through mobile apps and SMS.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Credential stuffing, using leaked passwords to access personal accounts. 



 Digital impersonation, aided by AI-generated photos, voices, and documents.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Traditional insurance offerings aren’t built to handle these threats, but privacy and identity protection bundles are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 A new layer of protection: Digital identity bundles 



<p>Leading insurers are now bundling digital identity protection with their offerings, helping policyholders stay ahead of fraud and bounce back faster when it strikes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundled identity fraud tools may include:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Virtual cards for safer online purchases&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Masked phone numbers and emails to protect personal contact info 



 Dark web monitoring and breach alerts&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Credit and identity theft monitoring&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Wallet-based credentials for secure authentication and claims access&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>By embedding these tools into policies, insurers add measurable value to customers’ lives while opening up entirely new lines of business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why identity protection is a smart revenue play&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Here’s what makes identity fraud solutions so attractive for insurers:</p>



 
 Recurring revenue potential from subscription-based privacy tools&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Cross-sell and upsell opportunities during digital onboarding and renewals 



 Improved retention through proactive risk reduction and service stickiness&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Lower fraud-related claims through early detection and secure communication&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Differentiation in a market where most offerings feel commoditized&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Plus, identity protection is a need that transcends age and demographics. Whether you’re protecting a retiree from phishing or a young family from account takeover, the value is straightforward to communicate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Leading with privacy builds trust&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Consumer surveys show growing demand for brands that prioritize privacy:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-report-2023.pdf">81% of consumers</a> say a company’s data practices influence their buying decisions&nbsp; 



 72% are more likely to stay loyal to brands that give them control over personal data&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Offering embedded identity protection doesn’t just reduce fraud, it sends a powerful signal. You’re not just selling policies. You’re safeguarding your customers’ digital lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Getting started: Partnering for success&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Insurers don’t need to build these tools in-house.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partnering with privacy and identity technology providers allows you to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Launch fast with white-labeled apps or SDKs&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Customize offerings for different policyholder segments&nbsp; 



 Integrate into existing claims, onboarding, and renewal flows&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>From virtual communications to secure claims access, everything can be built into the policy experience, no heavy development is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2025 and beyond, identity fraud solutions for insurance won’t just be nice to have, they’ll be expected. Consumers are looking for comprehensive protection, and insurers that deliver it will earn more than just premiums. They’ll earn long-term loyalty, new revenue, and a strong position in a digital-first world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  With new KYB and UBO verification mandates in force, U.S. commercial lenders must modernize due diligence. This guide shows how to meet regulatory standards and improve operational efficiency.

<p>U.S. commercial lenders are under new pressure to verify businesses and beneficial owners as part of strengthened AML obligations. This article outlines how KYB and UBO discovery tools can help lenders meet FinCEN’s rules, reduce fraud, and accelerate onboarding for business borrowers.</p>
 
 In the United States, commercial lenders—from regional banks to online small business platforms—face a new compliance reality in 2025. FinCEN’s implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and enhanced customer due diligence (CDD) rules are reshaping the expectations for how lenders verify the legitimacy of business borrowers. 
<p>The stakes are high: lenders must not only validate the businesses they serve but also uncover who really owns and controls them.</p>
 The Regulatory Shift 
<p>The CTA, fully in effect as of 2024, created a new federal Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) registry. But that doesn’t remove responsibility from lenders – it adds to it.</p>
<p>Under FinCEN’s rules, lenders must:</p>
 
 Identify and verify the legal entity (KYB) 
 Determine and validate all beneficial owners (UBO discovery) 
 Maintain auditable records of CDD 
 Monitor for changes in ownership or control over time 
 
<p>This is now true for traditional banks, fintech lenders, equipment leasing firms, and alternative credit providers.</p>
 Compliance Challenges for Lenders 
<p>1. Complex Ownership Structures<br>
Many borrowers – especially LLCs, holding companies, and startups—use layered or indirect structures that obscure ownership.</p>
<p>2. High Volume, Low Margin<br>
Lenders often manage thousands of applications a month, leaving little room for manual document collection and review.</p>
<p>3. Incomplete or Stale Data<br>
Borrowers may submit outdated records or omit key beneficial owners, exposing lenders to audit risk.</p>
<p>4. Fragmented Systems<br>
Loan origination platforms, KYC tools, and document management systems are often disconnected, creating data silos.</p>
 How iComply Supports Commercial Lending Compliance 
<p>iComply’s platform provides commercial lenders with a streamlined, audit-ready approach to KYB and UBO checks.</p>
 1. Business Verification (KYB) 
 
 Verify entity status using registration databases and public records 
 Match corporate information to legal documents 
 Confirm business address, phone, domain, and operations 
 
 2. Beneficial Ownership Discovery 
 
 Identify UBOs using automated data extraction and relationship mapping 
 Flag nominees, trustees, and shell structures 
 Apply configurable ownership thresholds for verification 
 
 3. Smart Document Collection 
 
 Request Articles of Incorporation, operating agreements, and shareholder data via guided client portals 
 Use risk-based triggers to escalate required documentation 
 
 4. Continuous Monitoring and Refresh 
 
 Track changes in ownership or control 
 Automate annual review cycles or risk-triggered updates 
 
 5. Full Audit Logs and Reporting 
 
 Log all verification steps, document uploads, and screening decisions 
 Export CDD reports for internal audits or regulatory reviews 
 
 Case Insight: Mid-Market Equipment Lender 
<p>A U.S. equipment financing firm used iComply to streamline UBO checks for SMB borrowers. In just 60 days, they:</p>
 
 Reduced average application processing time by 48% 
 Flagged and escalated 12 high-risk entities that previously passed manual reviews 
 Improved audit readiness with complete BO documentation trails 
 
 2025 Outlook for Commercial Lenders 
 
 FinCEN Enforcement Actions: Expect closer scrutiny of lenders’ KYB and BOI alignment 
 Integration Pressure: Regulators may push for integrated CDD systems across onboarding and underwriting 
 Emerging State-Level Rules: States like New York and California are considering BOI verification mandates beyond federal requirements 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Lenders that proactively modernize KYB and UBO workflows can reduce fraud, improve credit quality, and stay ahead of mounting regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>Book a demo with iComply to see how we help commercial lenders accelerate onboarding while maintaining full KYB/UBO compliance in 2025 and beyond.</p>

<p>Q: When is the HPP Mainnet launching?<br> The launch is happening very soon. While we initially targeted Q4, development has moved ahead of schedule. The private mainnet is up and running with select builders. We’re not sharing an exact date to avoid setting unrealistic expectations, but all signs point to a Q3 public&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Q: Will HPP offer grants or early-stage builder incentives?<br> We’re not launching a traditional grants program. Instead, we’re supporting builders through milestone-based assistance. If a project aligns with HPP’s long-term vision (especially in AI and Web3), we’re open to providing structured support. The goal is to back teams that deliver, not just&nbsp;promise.</p><p>Q: Are there any big partnerships coming?<br> Yes, but “partnership” can mean many things. Rather than vague announcements, we encourage more specific questions — are you asking about integrations, infrastructure, exchanges, or something else? We’re engaged in multiple partnership conversations, but we prefer to discuss them in the right&nbsp;context.</p><p>Q: Are DevTools available for developers building on HPP?<br> Yes. You can already access early DevTools on HPP.io, including resources for agent deployment, off-chain reasoning, and microtransaction support. More SDKs and templates are being developed to make HPP more attractive to AI-native builders.</p><p>Q: How will gas fees compare to Polygon or Arbitrum?<br> We’ll provide more details closer to the public launch. Right now, we’re focused on minimizing friction for high-frequency, micro-value transactions between agents. Fee structure comparisons will become more concrete as the network&nbsp;matures.</p><p>Q: What’s happening with Aergo staking? Some users didn’t receive expected rewards.<br> Staking is active, and rewards are being distributed as outlined in the documentation. We encourage everyone to carefully review the staking terms. If expectations weren’t met, it’s often due to a misunderstanding of the reward structure. We’ll share the docs again for&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>Q: Should we be worried about AI taking jobs?<br> Yes, especially if people don’t adapt. AI will reduce the need for human labor in many sectors, including skilled ones. But those who embrace AI tools and integrate them into their work will remain valuable. The best way to stay ahead is to become the AI expert in your field and lead the change rather than resist&nbsp;it.</p><p>Q: How are you already adapting to AI at VaaSBlock and HPP?<br> We’ve moved away from traditional hiring plans. Instead, we operate on a “solutions-first” mindset. For any task or challenge, we ask if AI can solve it before assigning it to a person. When we do bring people in, it’s often for specialized, time-bound work. This has helped us remain lean and adaptable in a rapidly changing environment.</p><p>Q: Final thoughts from this session?<br> HPP is more than a new chain. It’s the infrastructure layer for intelligent, decentralized coordination. From agent-driven services to modular AI tools, we’re building a future where applications don’t just run, they think, reason, and transact in real time. The public mainnet is coming soon, and we can’t wait to see what the community builds&nbsp;next.</p><p>Stay connected:<br> → DevTools &amp; ecosystem: <a href="https://www.hpp.io/">HPP.io</a><br> → Community chat: <a href="https://t.me/aergoofficial">Telegram</a><br> → Real-time updates: <a href="https://x.com/aergo_io">@aergo_io</a></p><p>Let us know your questions for next week.

<p>We’d like to congratulate Alison Mangiero and the Crypto Council for Innovation on a powerful and forward-looking testimony before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee. The hearing, titled “<a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mangiero-Testimony.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,</a>” spotlighted critical issues surrounding digital asset policy, and we’re proud that SpruceID’s work in privacy-preserving digital identity was highlighted as part of the solution.</p><p>As Alison noted in her remarks, digital assets reshape how we transfer value, access financial services, and verify identity. A key challenge in this transformation is ensuring that digital identity systems are secure, interoperable, and resistant to evolving threats like deepfakes generated by AI. That’s where blockchain-based approaches can play a defining role.</p><blockquote>“Today, for less than $15, artificial intelligence can generate images of people and fake IDs that can fool current identity verification security solutions. But companies, like SpruceID, are working on applications of blockchain and cryptography that have security features that even AI cannot break.” - Alison Mangiero, Crypto Council for Innovation</blockquote> Why Identity Is Core to Crypto <p>At first glance, identity and crypto may seem like separate domains, but they are deeply connected. Blockchain-based systems, by design, enable trust without intermediaries. But to participate in real-world applications, such as opening a financial account, signing a contract, or receiving government benefits, users still need a secure way to prove who they are. Privacy-preserving digital identity provides that missing link.</p><p>Using cryptographic credentials that can be selectively disclosed, individuals can prove facts about themselves (like age or residency) without oversharing personal information. This aligns with the values of the crypto ecosystem, like decentralization, privacy, and user control, while also addressing urgent needs around fraud prevention, compliance, and equitable access.</p> Real-World Deployment at Scale <p>This work is already happening. The California Department of Motor Vehicles has issued over two million mobile driver’s licenses using SpruceID’s technology, enabling residents to prove their identity online with strong privacy protections and safeguards against synthetic fraud. California is also exploring additional ways to unlock new efficiencies in public service delivery.</p> Collaborating on National Standards <p>Beyond state-level innovation, SpruceID is working with the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> and the <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)</a> to demonstrate how digital credentials, when paired with regulatory clarity from agencies like FinCEN, can streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and improve compliance across the financial sector.</p><p>As digital identity becomes foundational to safe participation in the digital economy, collaboration across public and private sectors will be key.</p> Building the Next Generation of Public Infrastructure <p>SpruceID’s mention in this testimony is just one piece of a much larger effort. We’re especially grateful to the public servants and policymakers working to ensure that digital infrastructure in the U.S. is secure, privacy-preserving, and future-ready.</p> <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mangiero-Testimony.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Read the Full Testimony</a>

             Thales Alenia Space Italy to build the Multi-Purpose Habitation module for the Moon 
 
 The Multi-Purpose Habitation module is a key building block in the Artemis roadmap for establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon. It will allow astronauts to live on the lunar surface to conduct science experiments and test initial habitability. 
 By combining module design activities with future collaborations leveraging Italy’s technological and manufacturing capabilities, the company will deliver a secure, comfortable and multifunctional habitat module for astronauts, fully compatible with other systems and components. 
 As part of the Italian Space Agency’s program, this contract strengthens the pivotal roles of Thales Alenia Space Italy and Italy in advancing crewed and robotic space exploration on the Moon and beyond. 
 Lunar exploration will benefit from Thales Alenia Space Italy’s cutting-edge technology, expertise and long experience in space exploration, space transportation systems and orbital infrastructures, that could pave the way for future missions to Mars. 
 
<p>Rome, July 25, 2025 – Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to perform the preliminary design phase, including development of critical enabling technologies, of the pressurized Multi-Purpose Habitation (MPH) module for the lunar surface.&nbsp;</p>
 
    
 
<p>Multi-Purpose Habitation module © Thales Alenia Space_Briot</p>
<p>Planned for launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in 2033, the MPH module will be the first ever dedicated habitation asset on the lunar surface as part of the Artemis Accords between NASA and ASI for bilateral Moon cooperation. The MPH module will safely host astronauts during their missions, support surface operations, enable scientific research experiments both with and without the presence of a human crew; and have the capability to move on the surface.</p>
<p>Designed for a minimum operational lifespan of 10 years, the MPH will serve as a permanent surface habitat, capable of operating synergistically with other elements of the Artemis architecture.</p>
 Part rover, part lunar shelter 
<p>Over the course of the two-year contract, Thales Alenia Space Italy will act as overall prime contractor, working alongside Altec (a public-private company owned by Thales Alenia Space and ASI) and other Italian industrial entities, for the MPH preliminary design phase. The initial development will focus on enabling technologies aimed at facing the harsh environmental conditions on the lunar surface, including extreme thermal variations, pervasive lunar dust, high radiation levels, micrometeoroid impacts, and the effects of reduced lunar gravity. In collaboration with the Industrial consortium members and space agencies, the company will lead the development of the MPH module to advance scientific discovery on the Moon, enable sustainable lunar exploration and drive the knowledge and technologies needed to support human missions to Mars.</p>
<blockquote><p>Teodoro Valente, President of the Italian Space Agency, emphasized: "MPH represents yet another scientific challenge for Italy and ASI, which are planning to bring a comfortable and safe human settlement to the lunar surface, thanks to the expertise and high, competitive technological standards that Thales Alenia Space Italy has acquired internationally in the field of space habitability. The future lunar module, the result of the historic relationship between NASA and ASI, is part of a long-term investment vision that Italy has implemented, enabling us to play an increasingly leading role in the new space race and, moreover, to be a fundamental part of the Moon to Mars Strategy of NASA's Artemis program. Today's signature confirms the Italian Government's significant and ongoing commitment to supporting the development of the Space Economy and supporting Italy's globally recognized excellence. Furthermore, it is important that this act comes just days after Parliament's approval of the country's first "Space Law".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“We are deeply honored that ASI has entrusted Thales Alenia Space with this contract to develop the MPH, giving us, as a leading European company, the opportunity to drive scientific and technological progress in building the first Italian human outpost on the lunar surface. This milestone will further strengthen and advance human space exploration on the Moon and beyond,” said Giampiero Di Paolo, Deputy CEO and Executive Vice President, Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space.</p>

Thu, 07/24/2025 - 18:59


             
 A joint collaboration between France and the UK to map, on a global scale, the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide; the main greenhouse gas caused by human activity. 
 MicroCarb will show how space-based science can improve our understanding of the vital carbon cycle and contribute to informed climate policy decisions to help protect our planet. 
 Thales Alenia Space was responsible for the assembly, integration and testing of the satellite platform as well as launch preparations. 
 
<p>Cannes, July 26, 2025 – The scientific mission MicroCarb, led by the French space Agency CNES, was successfully launched from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.&nbsp;</p>
 
    
 
<p>MicroCarb © CNES</p>
<p>MicroCarb is a joint mission between the UK Space Agency and French Space Agency, Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES), serving as the prime contractor. The mission is co-financed by these two agencies, as well as by the European Commission and the French government within the framework of the Investments for the Future Program (PIA), managed by the National Research Agency (ANR). The satellite is designed to precisely map atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂), capturing detailed data on emissions from human activities as well as absorption by natural sinks such as oceans and forests.</p>
<p>The satellite is built on the CNES Myriade platform. Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), completed the assembly, integration, and testing of the satellite platform at RAL Space in Harwell, UK, and was responsible for launch preparations. Airbus Defence and Space provided the instrument payload, the infrared spectrometer.</p>
<p>MicroCarb will operate in low Earth orbit, at an altitude of 650 km, and serves as a precursor to the European Union’s Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring (CO2M) mission – a constellation of three satellites, with payloads supplied by Thales Alenia Space, which will deliver precise measurements for human-induced atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane. MicroCarb complements the CO2M mission by providing early observations and valuable data, enhancing our capability for CO₂ and methane monitoring to inform climate policy makers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, a special city-scanning mode will enable the mapping of CO₂ distribution within urban areas, which are responsible for the majority of global emissions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Thorburn, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the UK, commented, “I am immensely proud of the contribution our teams in the UK and France have made to MicroCarb - Europe’s pioneering satellite for mapping carbon dioxide on a global scale. Huge thanks to CNES and to the UK Space Agency for the trust they have placed in us, enabling Thales Alenia Space to play a key role in advancing Europe’s leadership in climate monitoring and environmental science, and helping to protect our planet.”<br>

            <p>In July 2025, two key events reinforced Europe’s accelerating commitment to rearmament and strategic collaboration: the UK–France Defence Summit in London and the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome. These diplomatic and industrial milestones underscore the importance of trusted partnerships, UK-built industrial capabilities, and advanced technology in deterring aggression and safeguarding shared national security.</p>
 UK–France Defence Summit: Renewing the Tech Partnership 
<p>The UK–France Defence Summit, held during President Macron’s state visit, marked a renewed commitment to co-developing future technologies across AI, electromagnetic defence systems, and critical infrastructure resilience — all central to NATO's focus on scalable, interoperable readiness.</p>
<p>Thales is proud to support this agenda. UK Government announcements recognised our £40 million investment in cortAIx UK as a pivotal enabler of mission-critical AI for mission-critical AI across sense to effect. This was showcased as part of the UK–France Industrial Strategy.</p>
<p>cortAIx UK is Thales’ AI accelerator — part of a global network — focused on developing explainable, secure, and human-in-the-loop AI. Areas of work include sensor fusion, threat detection, autonomy, and AI-enhanced command decisions. The programme supports cross-border R&amp;D, including collaboration with UK SMEs and academic partners, and reflects a shared industrial ambition to maintain NATO’s technological edge.</p>
<p>This initiative directly supports Europe’s broader rearmament strategy — accelerating innovation and transitioning trusted AI from research to operational deployment. This investment includes the creation of 200 highly skilled AI and data specialist roles in the UK.</p>
 Supporting Ukraine: Industrial Investment &amp; Air Defence Readiness 
<p>At the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome, the UK Government announced a major air-defence contract with Thales to supply more than 5,000 missiles, valued at up to £283 million. The package supports frontline Ukrainian forces and sustains advanced manufacturing in the UK, including skilled jobs in Belfast.</p>
<p>This programme exemplifies Thales' role in enabling the UK’s contribution to Rearm Europe — delivering UK-built, export-ready capability that supports allied deterrence and enhances operational tempo in high-threat environments.</p>
<p>As European nations reconstitute their munitions stockpiles and bolster resilience, the UK–Ukraine air defence partnership reflects a wider strategic shift: regenerating defence capacity at speed and scale through trusted industrial alliances.</p>
 Thales at the Forefront: Mission-Critical AI &amp; Trusted Systems 
<p>cortAIx UK is scaling rapidly, with:</p>
 
 200 AI and data science specialists recruited by end of 2025, aligned with the UK Government’s AI Opportunities Action Plan. 
 Integration into Thales’ global cortAIx network of 600+ experts and 100+ AI-enabled systems. 
 Strategic partnerships with SMEs and universities — including UK partners in industry and academia — to industrialise and deploy trusted AI. 
 
<p>Key operational use cases currently focus on:</p>
 
 Maritime mine countermeasures 
 Electro-optical and radar data classification and fusion 
 Automated threat detection 
 
<p>Our approach remains human-centred: prioritising explainability, cybersecurity, frugality, and trust. This makes our systems not just innovative but operationally effective, ethical, and scalable across NATO forces.</p>
 The Strategic Value of These Partnerships 
<p>Together, these announcements highlight:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A shared Franco-British ambition to co-develop next-generation defence technology<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thales’ ability to deliver UK-built industrial capability that supports frontline readiness and European deterrence<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A UK-led commitment to Rearm Europe, grounded in AI-enhanced decision-making, trusted communications, and intelligent air defence<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exportable systems that sustain jobs, deepen alliances, and reinforce resilience across the NATO enterprise</p>
 Leadership Perspectives Ahead of DSEI: Strengthening Europe’s Defence Readiness 
<p>Speaking ahead of DSEI 2025, Phil Siviter, CEO of Thales in the UK, commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rearmament today is not about simply replenishing stockpiles — it’s about regenerating our industrial and technological edge in partnership with our allies. At Thales, we’re proud to help the UK play a leading role — by scaling UK-built manufacturing, accelerating trusted AI, and building systems that deliver operational advantage from the factory floor to the frontline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Shaw, COO of Thales in the UK, added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether it’s supporting Ukraine with critical systems, powering NATO’s multi-domain C2, or shaping tomorrow’s AI-enabled battlespace, we are showing what a trusted UK-based partner can do. At DSEI, we will demonstrate how we deliver not just products, but capability, speed, and strategic impact.</p>

<p>A preview of what’s next, and a few important changes along the&nbsp;way</p><p>Ocean Nodes have come a long way since their launch in August 2024. In less than a year, we’ve seen over 1.71 million nodes deployed across 70+ countries, powered by you, our community. Together, we’ve stress tested the stack, reported bugs, experimented, and helped push the infrastructure forward. This collective effort has laid a strong foundation. Now, it’s time to build on&nbsp;it.</p><p>As we look ahead, it’s time to enter Phase 2, a new chapter that shifts the focus toward GPU-powered compute, performance-based incentives, and a more production-grade environment.</p><p>Here’s what’s changing, and how we’re preparing for what’s&nbsp;next.</p> Phase 1 rewards wrap July&nbsp;31 <p>The Ocean Nodes community has surpassed every expectation. Your contribution has proven that decentralized compute can scale globally. That effort, and your uptime, hasn’t gone unnoticed, as we currently stand at 12.45M ROSE rewards distributed. To make space for the transition into Phase 2, we’ll be ending the current rewards system as of July&nbsp;31.</p><p>Here’s why: the next stage will introduce major infrastructure updates, which require testing and refinement, with bugs and instability expected in the early stages. To keep things fair for everyone and the focus on progress towards the next stage, rewards in their current form will be paused during this time. Read&nbsp;on.</p> ONBs wrap at ONB — Perks&nbsp;ahead <p>We’re also capping Ocean Node Badges (ONBs) at ONB1. The reason is simple: initial participation was beyond projections, with over 1.71M total nodes, and we want to ensure the system remains clear and manageable going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>If you’ve earned ONB1, you’ll receive exclusive benefits in Phase 2. This is our way of recognizing the early builders who helped shape and strengthen the Ocean Nodes&nbsp;network.</p><p>The perks tied to ONB1 will be announced when Phase 2 launches. We’re making sure they’re meaningful, as per&nbsp;usual.</p> Phase 2 begins in September — with adjusted competitive rewards&nbsp;system <p>Ocean Nodes Phase 2 is set to launch in September, with a key focus on GPU-powered compute environments. This will allow for more advanced workloads and real-world AI use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>With this shift, the rewards model will be adjusted. The aim is to better reflect the value that GPU-based nodes bring to the network and to support more demanding jobs such as model training and multi-stage compute workflows.</p><p>More information about the reward structure will be shared at the time of&nbsp;launch.</p> What to expect in Phase&nbsp;2 <p>Phase 2 is all about making Ocean Nodes more powerful, usable, and aligned with real-world compute needs. Here’s a sneak peek at what’s&nbsp;coming:</p>  GPU Support — training, fine-tuning, and heavy workloads  Paid Compute Jobs — flexible pricing based on&nbsp;usage  Upgraded Monitoring System — with benchmark jobs, node history, and detailed performance metrics  Comprehensive dashboard — clearer dashboards and logs so you can see how your node is&nbsp;doing  Node Configurability — choose which features to expose or&nbsp;disable   What’s next <p>August is all about preparing for Phase 2. We’ll be testing the new system, making improvements, and finalizing how the updated rewards system will work. This will be your chance to try out what’s&nbsp;coming.</p><p>We’ll be running benchmark compute jobs on selected GPU-enabled nodes to measure performance. These benchmarks are short, simple jobs, designed to give us insight into how different setups perform. They also help us shape a reward system that’s fair, reliable, and ready for&nbsp;scale.</p> Thanks for Building With&nbsp;Us <p>As we enter this next chapter, we want to acknowledge the effort and energy this community has invested in Ocean Nodes. Phase 1 showed us what’s possible. Phase 2 is about scaling that possibility into a reliable, compute-focused network that serves real-world use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>You’ve helped bring Ocean Nodes this far, and we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>Keep an eye on our Discord, Twitter, and blog for updates and sneak peeks as we gear up for September.</p><p>Thanks for being here. Let’s keep building!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-nodes-update-transitioning-into-phase-2-166604982c2b">Ocean Nodes Update: Transitioning into Phase 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The first half of 2025 confirms Thales’ strong momentum since the beginning of the year, with a significant increase in our financial indicators.<br>​<br>​Sales are up sharply, driven by the strength of our Defence and Avionics businesses, which are benefiting from continued increases in production capacity. This sustained performance enables us to raise our annual target for sales organic growth. Order intake continues to record solid momentum, in a favorable context for the vast majority of our businesses. They will once again exceed sales in 2025, offering exceptional visibility for the coming years. Adjusted EBIT margin has also improved significantly, demonstrating the relevance of the Group's strategy based on disruptive innovation, operational excellence and a relationship of trust with our customers.<br>​<br>​We are also continuing to invest in research and in expanding our industrial capacities, in order to meet the major challenges of a rapidly changing world.<br>​<br>​This solid first half is above all the result of the commitment and professionalism of Thales's 83,000 employees, to whom I extend my warmest thanks. Thanks to them, we are entering the second half of the year with an upwardly revised sales growth target.”<br>​<br>​Patrice Caine, Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</p></blockquote>
 Key figures 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Order intake in the first half of 2025 amounted to €10,352 million, down -4% compared with the first half of 2024 (-4% also at constant scope and exchange rates). This slight decrease is explained by a high comparison basis, with the signing of three contracts with a unit value of more than €500 million in the first half of 2024 compared to only one in the first half of 2025. The sales momentum remains nonetheless very positive and the consolidated order book at June 30, 2025, totaled €50 billion, showing an increase of 7% compared to the first half of 2024. In this regard, the Group expects in the second half of this year the booking of the Air Defence contract signed with the United Kingdom for an amount of £1.16 billion, effective in July 2025. </p>
<p>Sales totaled €10,265 million, up 8.1% in total change and at constant scope and exchange rates compared with the first half of 2024. The increase in sales benefited notably from a solid performance of Avionics and Defence.</p>
<p>The Group reports for the first half of 2025 an Adjusted EBIT of €1,248 million, compared with €1,096 million in the first half of 2024, up 13.9% (+12.7% on an organic basis). The Adjusted EBIT margin reached 12.2% of sales, a significant increase compared to the first half of 2024 (11.5% of sales).</p>
<p>At €877 million, the Adjusted net income, Group share is up by 1% compared to last year. It incorporates a temporary additional contribution to the corporate tax in France amounting to €60 million. Excluding this exceptional impact, the Adjusted net income, Group share is up by 8%.</p>
<p>Net income from continuing operations, Group share amounted to €664 million compared to €625 million in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>Free operating cash flow was positive and amounted to €499 million, compared with -€85 million in the first half of 2024. This strong increase was driven by a significant improvement in the change in working capital requirement compared to June 30, 2024, thanks notably to a continued satisfactory payment profile from Group’s customers as well as ongoing actions taken in the context of stocks optimization.</p>
<p>Net debt reached €3 427 million at June 30, 2025 compared to €3 044 million at December 31, 2024.</p>
 Order intake 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Order intake in H1 2025 amounted to €10,352 million, down -4% compared to H1 2024 (-4% also at constant scope and exchange rates). The Group continued to benefit from excellent sales momentum across all its activities and recorded a contract with unit value in excess of €1 billion in the second quarter related to the supply of 26 Rafale Marine to India. The book-to-bill ratio is 1.01 (1.13 in the first half of 2024).</p>
<p>Thales booked 10 large orders with a unit amount exceeding €100 million in the first half of 2025, for a total amount of €2,874 million: </p>
 
 5 large orders booked in Q1 2025:<br>
 
 Contract signed with Space Norway, a Norwegian satellite operator, for the supply of the THOR 8 telecommunications satellite; 
 Order by SKY Perfect JSAT to Thales Alenia Space of JSAT-32, a geostationary telecommunications satellite; 
 Signing of a contract between Thales and the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop Argonaut, a future autonomous and versatile lunar lander designed to deliver cargo and scientific instruments to the Moon; 
 Order from the Dutch Ministry of Defence for the modernization and support of vehicle tactical simulators; 
 Order from the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) for the development, production, and maintenance of vetronics equipment for various Army vehicles as part of the SCORPION programme. 
 
 
 5 large orders booked in Q2 2025:<br>
 
 Contract related to the supply of 26 Rafale Marine to India to equip the Indian Navy;  
 As part of the SDMM (Strategic Domestic Munition Manufacturing) contract signed in 2020 for the supply of ammunition to the Australian armed forces, entry into force of years 6 to 8. The continuation of the SDMM contract concerns the design, the development, manufacture and maintenance of a variety of ammunition; 
 Contract for the delivery to Ukraine of 70 mm ammunition and the transfer of the final assembly line of certain components of this ammunition from Belgium to Ukraine; 
 Order for the production and supply of AWWS (Above-Water Warfare System) combat systems intended for frigates equipment in Europe;  
 Order by Sweden of compact multi-mission medium range Ground Master 200 radars. 
 
 
 
<p>At €7,479 million, order intake of a unit amount below €100 million showed an increase of 4% compared to the first half of 2024. Orders with a unit value of less than €10 million are up 5%.</p>
<p>Geographically9, order intake in mature markets amounted to €7,031 million, down compared to the first half of 2024 (-4% in total change and -5% on an organic basis). This decline is mainly explained by a high comparison base in the first half of 2024, which included the contract related to the order of two F126 frigates by the German Navy. <br>​Order intake in emerging markets amounted to €3,321 million, down -3% in total and organic change. The registration of the order by the Indian Navy for 26 Rafale Marine in the first half of 2025 does not fully compensate the two contracts with a unit value exceeding €500 million recorded in the first half of 2024 in those markets. ​ </p>
<p>Order intake in the Aerospace segment stood at €2,658 million compared to €2,688 million in the first half of 2024 (-3% at constant scope and exchange rates). The Avionics market enjoys sustained sales momentum in its various segments. Order intake in the Space activity, which had benefited from a favorable phasing in the first quarter with 3 orders worth more than €100 million each, was slightly down over the semester.</p>
<p>With an amount of €5,751 million (compared to €6,120 million in the first half of 2024, i.e., -6% at constant scope and exchange rates), order intake in the Defence segment continued to benefit from strong commercial momentum, while the basis for comparison with 2024 is high. Six orders with a unit amount exceeding €100 million were booked in the first half of 2025, including an order exceeding €1 billion from India for 26 Rafale Marine. The Group confirms its objective of a book-to-bill ratio above 1 in 2025 for the Defence segment, notably with the expected booking of new important contracts in the second half of the year, including the Air Defence contract with the United Kingdom for an amount of £1.16 billion, effective in July 2025. ​ The order book stood at €38.9 billion (compared to €36.5 billion in the first half of 2024), representing approximately 3.4 years of sales. </p>
<p>At €1,897 million, order intake in the Cyber &amp; Digital sector is aligned with sales, as most of the activities in this segment operate on short cycles. The order book is therefore not significant.</p>
 Sales 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Sales for the first half of 2025 stood at €10,265 million, compared to €9,493 million in the first half of 2024, up 8.1% both in total and organic changes.</p>
<p>From a geographical standpoint10, sales recorded solid growth in emerging markets, with organic growth of +10.7%. Sales in mature markets grew organically by +7.4%, driven notably by Europe (+8.9%).</p>
<p>In the Aerospace segment, sales amounted to €2,759 million, up 6.8% compared with the first half of 2024 (+5.8% at constant scope and exchange rates). This solid growth reflects the continued strong momentum in the Avionics market, driven by aftermarket activities and the military domain. Space sales remained affected by last two years’ low demand in telecommunications satellites; OEN (Observation, Exploration, Navigation) showed good performance.</p>
<p>Sales in the Defence segment totaled €5,581 million, up 13.0% compared to the first half of 2024 (+12.7% at constant scope and exchange rates). After a very strong first quarter (+15.0% at constant scope and exchange rates), the segment continued to record double-digit growth in the majority of its activities in the second quarter.</p>
<p>At €1,862 million, sales in the Cyber &amp; Digital segment decreased by -3.7% compared to the first half of 2024 (-1.9% at constant scope and exchange rates). This evolution reflects the following trends:</p>
 
 Cyber businesses recorded a decrease in the first half of 2025 (-3.5% at constant scope and exchange rates):<br>
 
 The Cyber Products business, slightly down in the second quarter after a first quarter of growth, remained affected as expected by disturbances related to the merger of Thales and Imperva’s sales forces. This now completed merger is the final step of Imperva’s integration and paves the way to the deployment of its product offering to its full potential. A progressive ramp-up in sales trajectory is expected in the second half of the year; 
 The Cyber Services business was affected by soft market demand during the first half of the year. With this offer, which represents approximately 20% of the Cyber activity (as per 2024 sales), the Group continues to refocus its strategy on segments offering profitable growth. This process, which involves streamlining and standardizing operations, aims at improving operating margin and can occasionally weigh on volumes. 
 
 
 Digital businesses were stable in the first half of 2025 (-0.8% at constant scope and exchange rates):<br>
 
 Identity and Biometrics solutions were down over half-year. The activity, which had experienced a decline in sales in 2020 due to COVID, is affected in 2025 by an unfavorable comparison effect related to the significant catch-up that occurred post-pandemic and until 2024. The segment thus returns to a more usual run rate in 2025; 
 Secure Connectivity solutions experienced robust and profitable growth, driven by digital solutions (including eSIMs as well as on-demand connectivity platforms); 
 Within the Payment Services business, digital banking solutions stood out particularly this semester and recorded a solid performance. 
 
 
 
 Results 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>The Group posted an Adjusted EBIT11 of €1,248 million for the first half of 2025, at 12.2% of sales, compared to €1,096 million (11.5% of sales) in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>The Aerospace segment recorded an Adjusted EBIT of €252 million (9.1% of sales), compared with €167 million (6.5% of sales) in the first half of 2024. The Adjusted EBIT margin recorded a strong increase, driven by the solid performance of the Avionics activities that posted a robust double-digit margin. It also benefited from the significant Adjusted EBIT improvement in Space, which is expected to be positive in 2025 before restructuring costs. </p>
<p>Adjusted EBIT for the Defence segment amounted to €720 million, compared with €639 million in the first half of 2024 (+13.5% at constant scope and exchange rates). At 12.9%, the margin in this sector is stable compared to last year (12.9% in the first half of 2024).</p>
<p>The Cyber &amp; Digital segment recorded an Adjusted EBIT of €265 million in the first half of 2025 compared to €272 million in the first half of 2024. The margin was up slightly and amounted to 14.2% of sales (against 14.1% in the first half of 2024). This evolution reflects the Group’s ability to preserve its commercial margins thanks to a strict discipline in terms of pricing policy. </p>
<p>Excluding Naval Group, unallocated EBIT amounted to -€24 million compared to -€26 million in the first half of 2024. </p>
<p>At €35 million in the first half of 2025, Naval Group’s contribution to Adjusted EBIT is lower compared to the first half of 2024. This change is mainly explained by the temporary additional contribution to corporate tax in France, whose impact on Naval Group’s share amounts to €5 million this semester and is expected to reach €8 million for the full year.</p>
<p>Cost of net financial debt amounts to -€56 million compared to -€87 million in the first half of 2024. This improvement is mainly explained by a significantly lower net debt than at June 30, 2024. Other adjusted financial income11 amounted to -€30 million over the first 6 months of 2025, compared with €32 million in the first half of 2024. This evolution reflects the non-recurrence in the first half of 2025 of exceptional items recorded during the first half of 2024, notably the distribution of dividends from non-consolidated affiliates as well as foreign exchange gains. The adjusted financial expense on pensions and other long-term employee benefits12 was stable at -€26 million compared to -€28 million in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>Adjusted net income, Group Share12 thus amounted to €877 million, compared with €866 million in the first half of 2024, after an adjusted income tax charge12 of -€277 million compared with -€193 million in the first half of 2024. This change is mainly explained by the recording in the first half of 2025 of the additional temporary contribution to corporate tax in France, which reduced Adjusted net income by €60 million. The effective tax rate as of June 30, 2025 stood at 26.7% and at 21.0% excluding the additional contribution to corporate tax in France (compared to 20.4% as of June 30, 2024).</p>
<p>Adjusted net income, Group share, per share12 amounted to €4.27, up 1% compared with the first half of 2024 (€4.21).</p>
<p>Net income from continuing operations, Group share amounted to €664 million, an increase of 6% compared to June 30, 2024 (€625 million). </p>
 Financial position as of June 30, 2025 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Free operating cash flow was positive at €499 million, compared to -€85 million in the first half of 2024. This strong increase was mainly driven by the improvement in the change in working capital requirements.</p>
<p>Over 2025 half-year, the net balance of acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and affiliates of -€64 million mainly consisted of the final price adjustment related to the sale to Hitachi Rail of the Transport activity on May 31, 2024. The Group did not finalize any significant acquisition or disposal over the period. </p>
<p>As of June 30, 2025, the net debt amounted to €3,427 million, compared with €3,044 million as of December 31, 2024. This change mainly takes into account the net balance of disposals (acquisitions) of subsidiaries and affiliates for a negative net amount of -€64 million, dividends payments for -€586 million (-€534 million in the first half of 2024) and new lease liabilities for -€118 million (-€95 million in the first half of 2024).</p>
<p>Shareholders’ equity, Group share amounted to €7,138 million, compared with €7,515 million as of December 31, 2024. This evolution reflects the positive contribution of net income from continuing operations, Group share (+€664 million) less the dividend paid (-€586 million).</p>
 Outlook 
<p>The robust sales performance in the first half, driven by the strength of the Avionics and Defence businesses, allows the Group to raise its annual organic sales growth target.<br>​The commercial momentum in the second half is also well oriented as Thales continues to benefit from favorable prospects in the vast majority of its markets in the short, medium and long term.</p>
<p>Thales confirms its expectation of a solid increase in Adjusted EBIT margin, mainly driven by the margin progression in the Aerospace segment and continued high margin in Defence.</p>
<p>The Group still anticipates a contained direct impact of tariffs based on the information available as of July 23, 2025. Thus, the 2025 guidance assumes reciprocal tariffs of 10% from Europe and 25% from Mexico, and exclude any retaliatory measures that might be taken by Europe in this context.</p>
<p>Assuming no new disruption in the macroeconomic and geopolitical contexts, and assuming the aforementioned assumptions regarding tariffs, Thales upgrades its sales organic growth target for 2025 and confirms its other targets:</p>
 
 An unchanged book-to-bill ratio above 1; 
 An expected organic sales growth between +6% and +7%, versus to +5 to +6% previously, corresponding to a sales range of €21.8 to €22.0 billion13; 
 An Adjusted EBIT margin between 12.2% and 12.4%. 
 
<p>***</p>
<p>This press release contains certain forward-looking statements. Although Thales believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, as described in the Company's Universal Registration Document, which has been filed with the French financial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers – AMF).</p>

				  Traditional meets decentralized finance in our next-generation, 3-factor authentication, digital identity solution. Powered by Verifiable Credentials, authenticated biometrics, and real-time database validation, this innovation provides the assurance needed for safe international asset transactions and &nbsp;establishes seamless and secure cross-border asset flows.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth and Jake West</p>
<p>SEATTLE — Today, Indicio and Black Mountain Investment Group (“BMIG”) announced a strategic partnership to revolutionize KYC and identity verification processes for the financial and legal industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This partnership combines Indicio’s market-leading decentralized identity and authenticated biometric technology with Black Mountain’s expertise in business solutions to create a much-needed bridge between traditional and decentralized finance that delivers scalable, fraud-resistant technologies for institutions operating in increasingly global and regulated markets.</p>
<p>Global regulatory changes are accelerating growth in the cross-border asset ecosystem and fueling the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi). Indicio and Black Mountain have developed proprietary technology that allows for a new, decentralized approach to verify investor, institution, and asset identities. This KYC is critical to scaling transactions in secure, fraud-resistant, and compliant ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio developed the most powerful decentralized digital identity solution in the marketplace by incorporating authenticated biometrics in Verifiable Credentials trust-anchored to a blockchain with real encryption. This significantly increases the level of identity assurance for remote onboarding, KYC, and digital transactions- which can now be performed more rapidly and reliably than ever before by investors and institutions through the use of this technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Indicio has developed an architectural approach to digital identity that meets the rapidly evolving needs of conventional and decentralized finance around KYC, account access, and digital asset management,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “We’re really excited to work with Black Mountain Investment Group to advance secure, seamless, decentralized trust for global financial transactions.”</p>
<p>“Trusted digital identity verification is a serious catalyst for advancing the digital transformation of and unlocking liquidity in global finance,” said Elijah Levine, CEO of BMIG. “It’s all too often that you work with the biggest and best banks and exchanges and they still operate on outdated and cumbersome KYC verification standards that are also often restricted to US-based financial transactions. When we saw the work that Indicio has been doing with biometric authentication and tamper-proof digital credentials in travel, not only did we want to invest immediately in their main business, but we also recognized that their tech is shockingly translatable to the finance industry.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We see a path towards rapid scale and believe that this technology should be implemented immediately across the biggest and best institutions in global finance for their own internal protection and liability purposes, outside of the efficiencies and liquidity that will be immediately unlocked. This partnership is centered around delivering innovative solutions that integrate the very latest technology into the rapidly expanding market of secure, privacy-preserving global asset transfers.”</p>
<p>About Indicio</p>
<p>Indicio is a global leader in Verifiable Credentials, decentralized identity, and digital trust infrastructure. From powering national identity pilots to enabling seamless international travel, Indicio helps governments and businesses build data and identity systems that are secure, privacy-preserving, and interoperable across borders and industries.</p>
<p>About Black Mountain Investment Group</p>
<p>Black Mountain Investment Group (“BMIG”) is a technology-driven back-office platform and entrepreneurial ecosystem designed to power the next generation of funds and businesses.

<p>“Much like ‘the cloud’ (really just someone else’s computer) or ‘the superhighway’ (I never have figured that one out), the metaphor of a ‘wallet’ has become a convenient shorthand for a tangle of technical, policy, and usability decisions.” </p>



<p>But as we keep building out digital identity ecosystems, complete with verifiable credentials, identity wallets, and cross-jurisdictional trust models, I want to ask:</p>



<p>Is the metaphor still helping us? Or is it time to kill the wallet?</p>

 Why metaphors matter 



<p>Basically, a digital wallet is a secure container for <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/20/digital-credentials-that-can-be-verified-a-lesson-in-terminology/">digital credentials</a>. But metaphors are powerful: They shape user expectations, influence system design, and carry emotional and cultural baggage.</p>



<p>Say “wallet,” and people conjure different things:</p>



 
 A tap-to-pay credit card or mobile payment app 



 A driver’s license or ID holder 



 A catch-all pouch for everything from boarding passes to coffee shop punch cards to loyalty cards 
 



<p>This matters because the assumptions baked into that metaphor directly affect how systems are designed and how people trust (or don’t) them.</p>



 One word, too many meanings 



<p>Consider Google Wallet. It assumes it can store just about anything, provided protocols and formats are supported. Apple Wallet is similarly broad in scope but imposes a more curated, policy-heavy experience; credentials often go through approval workflows, and Apple maintains tight control over what gets displayed.</p>



<p>Then you have purpose-built wallets like the SIROS Foundation’s <a href="https://github.com/wwWallet">wwWallet</a>, which explicitly aim for neutrality and open standards. In that case, “wallet” is just the delivery mechanism: Credentials come from many issuers, and the wallet doesn’t try to second-guess the user’s intent.</p>



<p>So far, so good. But many users still assume they’ll only need one wallet. After all, they only carry one physical one, right?</p>



<p>Well… not exactly.</p>



 Surprise: you’re already carrying multiple wallets 



<p>A growing number of users already interact with multiple wallet-like experiences; they just don’t recognize them as such.</p>



<p>Take a gym app with a scannable membership barcode. That’s not a digital wallet; it’s just displaying an unprotected credential. But a university app that stores a student ID, enables cryptographic access to campus systems, or lets students securely share transcripts? That’s starting to behave like a wallet. These apps issue, hold, and present credentials, but often without using open standards, secure storage mechanisms, or user-centric consent flows. In practice, they’re wallet-adjacent without meeting the formal definitions found in standards like ISO/IEC 18013-5 or NIST guidance.</p>



<p>This distinction matters when issuers or verifiers only trust credentials handled within their own apps. If every organization builds its own closed-loop container, users end up juggling multiple apps that can’t talk to each other. That may be good for organizational control, but it’s bad for user experience, portability, and interoperability.</p>



<p>To make sense of this ambiguity, researchers Lukkiena, de Reuver, and Bharosa offer a <a href="https://proceedings.open.tudelft.nl/DGO2025/article/view/1039/1073">taxonomy of digital wallets</a> that identifies 10 core characteristics across three levels: wallet architecture, functional capabilities, and governance model. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341070789057605633/">Henk Marsman</a>, for pointing me to this article!) For example, wallets can be custodial or self-sovereign, anchored to a specific platform or OS-agnostic, and focused on narrow single-issuer use cases or broader cross-domain ecosystems. Their conclusion? There’s no universal definition of “wallet,” and that’s a problem when different actors use the same word but mean fundamentally different things. When it takes this much effort to explain what we mean by “wallet,” maybe it’s time to admit the metaphor is no longer fit for purpose.</p>



 Who controls permission and consent? 



<p>The wallet metaphor also glosses over deeper architectural questions like who’s in charge of permission and consent.</p>



<p>When you hand someone your physical wallet, no pop-up asks if you’re sure. You’ve already decided what to share. Digital systems, though, are expected to do better. They support selective disclosure (I hope), enforce access policies, and (ideally) prompt you when data is about to be shared.</p>



<p>But when the wallet is mediated by a browser or embedded in a platform you don’t control, who’s responsible for enforcing that consent? The wallet? The issuer? The verifier? The browser? Even people deeply involved don’t agree on the answers here.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/digital-identities-getting-know-verifiable-digital-credential-ecosystem">NIST blog on digital wallets</a> offers a definition, and that definition sets the stage for various assumptions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A digital wallet is a native application on your mobile device—though in the future, may also be stored in the cloud—that holds and secures your VDCs… Depending on the entity issuing the VDC, users may need to download a wallet application supported by the credential issuer before a VDC can be issued to their phone.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is useful, but it also normalizes a model where wallets are tied to issuers, not users. If every credential needs its own issuer-approved container, we’re not talking about wallets anymore. We’re talking about app-specific credential lockers. That’s a very different interaction model and one that may undermine user control.</p>



 When regulation and design don’t talk to each other 



<p>In Europe, things get even murkier. The EU’s data protection frameworks (GDPR, eIDAS 2.0) layer in consent requirements that assume a clear user interface and intentional disclosure. A 2023 study published in the Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology, however, highlighted just how far the actual UX has drifted from those principles.</p>



<p>In “<a href="https://hal.science/hal-04913768/">Two Worlds Apart! Closing the Gap Between Regulating EU Consent and User Studies</a>,” researchers Bielova, Santos, and Gray examined real consent flows and found a minefield of “dark patterns” and manipulation. Decline buttons are hidden or misleading, options are presented in confusing hierarchies, and “Accept All” is given visual prominence over granular choices.</p>



<p>If we’re now building digital wallets that insert themselves into this consent process, we have to ask: are we replicating these same patterns? Are we genuinely improving user control or just rebranding old manipulations?</p>



 Designing for privacy: lessons from Kantara 



<p>The Kantara Initiative’s <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEMCP/overview">Privacy-Enhancing Mobile Credentials (PEMC) Implementers Report</a> offers a different and possibly more practical perspective. It doesn’t try to define “wallet” from a metaphorical standpoint. Instead, it focuses on capabilities that put the user back in charge:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The wallet SHALL be designed to facilitate user understanding and control over what data is being shared and for what purpose. User consent SHALL be explicit, contextual, and revocable.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s a higher bar than most current systems hit.</p>



<p>The report also stresses the importance of:</p>



 
 Purpose limitation: credentials should only be used for clearly defined, disclosed functions. 



 Transparency and auditability: users should be able to review where and how credentials have been used. 



 User-managed permissions: ideally, from a central UI that lets users adjust sharing policies without reissuing credentials. 
 



<p>These aren’t just checkboxes for compliance. They’re structural features that define trust. If your “wallet” can’t support these requirements, maybe it shouldn’t call itself one.</p>



 So… do we kill the wallet? 



<p>Maybe. Or maybe we reframe it.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor has done a lot of work. It helped early adopters wrap their heads around verifiable credentials. It gave vendors a way to pitch new apps without diving into crypto protocols.</p>



<p>But now, it’s showing its limitations.</p>



 
 It implies singularity, when reality demands multiplicity. 



 It collapses trust boundaries, hiding the difference between issuer-owned and user-controlled containers. 



 It blurs accountability, especially when it comes to consent and user agency. 



 And it distracts regulators, who often assume the metaphor aligns with actual practice. 
 



<p>If we’re serious about building systems that scale, interoperate, and respect users, we may need to put the metaphor on pause. Maybe even kill it.</p>



<p>Or at least, give it a long-overdue retirement party.</p>



 Bonus question: Got a better metaphor? 



<p>I’m genuinely curious: What should we call these things? If “wallet” is too narrow, too payment-focused, or just too confusing, what’s the alternative?</p>



<p>Inbox? Locker? Credential safe? Something new entirely? Or is the ambiguity still worthwhile for a reason I’m missing?</p>



<p>Drop me a note. I promise not to brand it.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>00:00:04<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>00:00:26<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Why Do We Call It a Wallet? 



<p>00:00:30<br>So, have you ever stopped to wonder: why do we call it a wallet?</p>



<p>In digital identity, the term wallet has become so common that we don’t even think twice about it—much like the cloud (air quotes intended), which, as we know, is really just someone else’s computer.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor has served as convenient shorthand. It wraps up a lot of complex technical, policy, and usability decisions into a single image that feels familiar.</p>



<p>But is it still serving us well? Or is it time to—dare we say—kill the wallet?</p>



<p>And yes, if you’re now hearing Elmer Fudd singing “Kill da Wabbit,” you’re not alone. It’s stuck in my head too.</p>



 



 Why Metaphors Matter 



<p>00:01:15<br>Metaphors help make the abstract more tangible. In digital identity, a wallet conjures up something:</p>



 
 Personal 



 Portable 



 Secure 



 That holds important things we don’t want to lose 
 



<p>In theory, a digital wallet does exactly that—a secure container for digital credentials.</p>



<p>00:01:34<br>However, there’s a catch.</p>



<p>Metaphors don’t just explain things—they shape them. They guide system design and influence both user and architect expectations.</p>



<p>And when a metaphor starts to mislead or restrict what’s possible, it’s time to reconsider it.</p>



 



 What Are We Really Talking About? 



<p>00:01:54<br>When we say wallet, what are we actually describing?</p>



<p>Sometimes, we mean a secure application that stores and presents digital credentials. But other times, we’re referring to:</p>



 
 A whole service ecosystem 



 Trust registries 



 Credential exchanges 



 Key management systems 
 



<p>00:02:18<br>This ambiguity creates confusion.</p>



<p>If you imagine a wallet as an app that lives only on your phone, you might not expect it to:</p>



 
 Sync across devices 



 Backup to the cloud 



 Integrate with browsers 
 



<p>So, the metaphor starts to limit understanding rather than enhance it.</p>



 



 Physical Wallets vs. Digital Identity 



<p>00:02:45<br>Think about your real wallet. You might carry:</p>



 
 Credit cards 



 A driver’s license 



 A photo of your dog 



 Maybe some cash (if you’re feeling nostalgic) 
 



<p>But your work ID might live on a badge you scan at the door.<br>Your passport is likely in a drawer.<br>Your vaccine certificate might be in an email or government portal.</p>



<p>00:03:06<br>Each credential lives in a different place and serves a different function. Yet digital credentials are expected to behave as a single type—all handled the same way.</p>



<p>That’s a problem.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor reinforces the idea that if you control something, you must physically possess it. But that’s not how real life—or digital systems—work.</p>



 



 Delegation and Flexibility 



<p>00:03:32<br>We delegate trust and control all the time.</p>



 
 Browsers remember our passwords 



 Apps access our photos 



 Others pick up prescriptions or check in for us 
 



<p>00:03:44<br>Digital identity must support this same flexibility—not just theoretically, but by design.</p>



<p>If the wallet metaphor implies identity is always something you carry and only you carry, it fails to reflect:</p>



 
 Delegation 



 Guardianship 



 Enterprise-managed credentials 
 



<p>Sometimes, you don’t need to carry the credential—you just need to control access to it.</p>



 



 Trust, Adoption, and Governance 



<p>00:04:12<br>Another problem: the wallet metaphor implies that once you have your credentials, you’re done.</p>



<p>But really, that’s just the beginning.</p>



<p>For a credential to matter:</p>



 
 It must be accepted 



 It must be verifiable 



 It must be trusted 
 



<p>00:04:30<br>This brings us to:</p>



 
 Trust registries 



 Governance frameworks 



 Interoperability standards 
 



<p>None of these live inside the wallet. Yet without them, the wallet is just a lonely app with nowhere to go.</p>



 



 Who Are We Building For? 



<p>00:04:50<br>Are we building for everyday users—or for people like us?</p>



<p>The danger in sticking too closely to the wallet metaphor is that we end up designing for:</p>



 
 Tech-savvy users 



 Privacy-conscious individuals 



 People willing to manage keys and credentials 
 



<p>00:05:08<br>But most users aren’t in that space. They just want things to work.</p>



<p>They want identity to be seamless—not a side project.<br>And they certainly don’t want to be blamed for losing access when their private key is wiped in a phone reset—or dropped in a beer.</p>



 



 Rethinking Security and Usability 



<p>00:05:32<br>We need to stop designing for the metaphor. People aren’t all ready to manage their own cryptographic infrastructure—and that’s okay.</p>



<p>Security isn’t one-size-fits-all. Usability isn’t either.</p>



<p>There are cases where:</p>



 
 Cloud-based key management offers better recovery options 



 Delegation to trusted devices boosts usability 



 Giving users a choice increases adoption 
 



<p>We shouldn’t cling to the idea that the most secure option is always the only secure option.</p>



 



 Do We Kill the Wallet? 



<p>00:06:08<br>Not necessarily.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor has brought us this far. It’s familiar, useful, and still works in many settings.</p>



<p>But we should be:</p>



 
 More careful in how we use it 



 Clearer about what we mean 



 Open to other metaphors—or better yet, clearer explanations 
 



<p>00:06:30<br>Maybe it’s time for:</p>



 
 Identity lockers 



 Digital toolboxes 



 Credential dashboards 
 



<p>Or maybe it’s time to explain what these systems actually do—without relying on metaphor at all.</p>



 



 Language Matters 



<p>00:06:48<br>The user brings their own context. That’s who we’re building for.</p>



<p>So:</p>



 
 In specs: our language must be crystal clear 



 For users: our explanations must be accurate and inclusive 
 



<p>We may need a whole basket of metaphors, not just one.</p>

  Canadian legal professionals face growing KYC obligations. This guide explains how law firms can implement privacy-first CIP workflows that meet FINTRAC and provincial regulations with confidence.

<p>As FINTRAC and provincial law societies tighten client identification rules, Canadian law firms must adopt smarter KYC practices. This article explores how legal professionals can implement modern CIP workflows using privacy-first identity verification that aligns with both AML obligations and solicitor-client privilege.</p>
 
 Legal professionals in Canada face a growing tension: How can they meet expanding anti-money laundering (AML) and client identification obligations without compromising client confidentiality or introducing unnecessary administrative burden? 
<p>This challenge has come into sharp focus as FINTRAC increases its oversight of designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs), and as law societies across Canada revise their regulatory frameworks to align with national AML strategies. The result? Law firms are now squarely in the sights of regulators—and must update their Client Identification Procedures (CIP) accordingly.</p>
 What’s Changing for Legal KYC in Canada 
<p>Since 2022, Canadian legal regulators have progressively strengthened requirements for:</p>
 
 Verifying client identity using independent, reliable documents or information 
 Recording beneficial ownership and third-party relationships 
 Monitoring ongoing client relationships and source of funds 
 Reporting suspicious transactions under FINTRAC guidelines 
 
<p>For firms engaged in real estate, corporate structuring, or trust administration, the burden is even greater. These services have been linked to elevated money laundering risk in recent typologies published by both FINTRAC and the Cullen Commission.</p>
 Why Traditional KYC Doesn’t Work for Law Firms 
<p>Many legal practices still rely on paper-based intake forms, manual document review, or ad hoc third-party services. These approaches often fall short because they:</p>
 
 Lack defensible audit trails for regulators 
 Introduce delay and friction for clients 
 Risk privacy breaches when data is shared with cloud vendors or external processors 
 Fail to flag beneficial ownership complexity or risk indicators in real time 
 
 The iComply Advantage: Legal-Grade KYC with Built-In Privacy 
<p>iComply helps Canadian law firms modernize KYC and CIP with a secure, configurable platform that respects both privacy and compliance.</p>
 1. On-Device Identity Verification 
 
 Clients upload documents and biometrics directly through a white-labeled portal 
 Verification occurs on-device using edge computing—PII is encrypted before transmission 
 Reduces reliance on international cloud vendors or external processors 
 
 2. Real-Time Beneficial Ownership Discovery 
 
 Automatically map directors, shareholders, and UBOs of legal entities 
 Screen individuals and entities against sanctions and PEP lists 
 Apply firm-specific thresholds for EDD or review 
 
 3. Custom CIP Workflows 
 
 Configure intake flows based on practice area (e.g., real estate vs litigation) 
 Trigger additional reviews based on client type, geography, or structure 
 Maintain full audit logs for internal review and law society compliance 
 
 4. Privacy by Design 
 
 Full data residency in Canada 
 Compliance with PIPEDA, provincial privacy laws, and solicitor-client privilege 
 Consent management and data retention controls 
 
 Case Insight: Boutique Law Firm in Ontario 
<p>A three-partner corporate law firm adopted iComply to streamline CIP for incorporations and real estate closings. The firm:</p>
 
 Reduced KYC admin time by 70% 
 Enhanced its ability to detect complex beneficial ownership structures 
 Passed a Law Society of Ontario audit with commendation for data handling and audit readiness 
 
 What to Watch in 2025 
 
 Law Society Reviews: Expect more frequent spot audits and policy compliance reviews 
 Digital Identity Integration: Provinces like BC and Ontario are hoping to expand digital ID adoption 
 Cross-Border Practice Implications: U.S. and EU data protection rules may affect multi-jurisdictional practices 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Law firms that delay compliance modernization face increasing audit risk and reputational exposure. But those that lead with privacy-first, intelligent KYC can turn compliance into a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Connect with iComply to see how we support Canadian law firms with audit-ready KYC tools that respect both client trust and evolving regulatory demands.</p>

  <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) offer the speed, reliability, and offline functionality of native apps—all delivered through the web. However, security is as important as performance, especially regarding user authentication. Modern authentication is essential in a world where users expect instant, secure access across multiple devices and platforms.</p>

<p>Identity providers, like Okta, offer secure, scalable, and developer-friendly tools for implementing authentication. Federated identity allows users to sign in using existing social accounts.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll walk through how to build a React-based PWA with offline support and integrate it with Google Social Login using Okta. You’ll learn how to deliver a fast, reliable user experience with modern identity features built in. Let’s get started.</p>

<p>What you’ll need</p>

<p>This is a beginner-friendly tutorial, so you’ll mostly need the willingness to learn! However, you’d need access to a few things:</p>
 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Node.js</a> and NPM. Any LTS version should be fine, but in this tutorial, I use Node 22 and NPM v10 
   A command terminal 
   Basic JavaScript and TypeScript knowledge 
   An IDE of your choice. I use PHPStorm, but you can use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> or something similar. 
   A <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Console Account</a>. You can set up one using your Gmail account. 
 

 Creating an Okta integration 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need an Okta Integrator Free Plan account. To get one, sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Once you have an account, sign in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Next, in the Admin Console:</p>

 
   Go to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Click Create App Integration 
   Select OIDC - OpenID Connect as the sign-in method 
   Select Single-Page Application as the application type, then click Next 
   
    <p>Enter an app integration name</p>
   
   In the Grant type section, ensure that both Authorization Code and Refresh Token are selected 
   Configure the redirect URIs:
     
       Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:5173/login/callback</code> 
       Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:5173</code> 
     
   
   In the Controlled access section, select the appropriate access level 
   Click Save 
 


  Where are my new app's credentials?

<p>Creating an OIDC Single-Page App manually in the Admin Console configures your Okta Org with the application settings.  You may also need to configure trusted origins for <code>http://localhost:5173</code> in Security &gt; API &gt; Trusted Origins.</p>

<p>After creating the app, you can find the configuration details on the app’s General tab:</p>

 
   Client ID: Found in the Client Credentials section 
   Issuer: Found in the Issuer URI field for the authorization server that appears by selecting Security &gt; API from the navigation pane. 
 

   <code>Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">Okta PowerShell Module</a> to automate this process. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">this guide</a> for more information about setting up your app.</p>



 Create the React app 

<p>We’ll use a Vite template to scaffold the project. The example app for this tutorial is a todo application called “Lister”. To create a React app named “Lister”, run the following command in your terminal to scaffold the project:</p>

   <code>  npm create vite@5.4 lister
</code>   
<p>Select React and TypeScript as the variant.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions after running the command to navigate into your app directory and installing dependencies.</p>

<p>We have extra dependencies to add. Run the following commands in your terminal.</p>

<p>Install React Router by running</p>

   <code>npm install react-router-dom@5.3.4
</code>   

<p>Install React Router types by running</p>

   <code>npm install --save-dev @types/react-router-dom@5.3.3
</code>   

<p>To use Okta authentication with our React app, let’s install the Okta SDKs by running</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-react@6.9.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@7.8.1
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>I wrote this post using Vite 5.4, React 18.3, Okta React 6.9, and Okta AuthJS SDK 7.8.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this, you now have the base React project set up.</p>

 Secure routes in your React app with React Router 

<p>Open the project in your IDE. Let’s navigate to <code>App.tsx</code> and paste in the following code:</p>

   <code>import './App.css';
import { Route, Switch, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { LoginCallback, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import Home from './pages/Home.tsx';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
   clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
   issuer: `https://${import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN}`,
   redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
   scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access'],
});

function App() {
   const history = useHistory();
   const restoreOriginalUri = (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth,  originalUri: string) =&gt; {
       history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
   };

   return (
     &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
        &lt;Switch&gt;
            &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
            &lt;Route path="/" exact component={Home}/&gt;
        &lt;/Switch&gt;
     &lt;/Security&gt;
   );
}

export default App

</code>   

<p>We set up the Okta authentication SDK packages in the <code>App</code> Component. Pay attention to the <code>OktaAuth</code> config:</p>

   <code>const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
   clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
   issuer: `https://${import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN}`,
   redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
   scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access'],
});
</code>   

<p>If you encounter any issues with the login, a good place to start debugging is from here. We’ll use environment variables to define our OIDC configuration in the app for convenience. In the root of your Lister project, create an <code>.env</code> file and edit it to look like so:</p>

   <code>VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN={yourOktaDomain}
VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientID}
</code>   

<p>Replace {yourOktaDomain} with your Okta domain for example, <code>dev-123.okta.com</code> or <code>trial-123.okta.com</code>. Note the variable doesn’t include the HTTP protocol. Replace {yourOktaClientID} with the Okta client ID from the Okta application you created.</p>

<p>Before moving forward, let’s set up React Router in our project root. Navigate to <code>src/main.tsx</code> and replace the existing code with the following code snippet:</p>

   <code>import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
 &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
  &lt;App/&gt;
 &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;,
)
</code>   

<p>In the <code>App.tsx</code> earlier, we imported <code>Home</code> from <code>./pages/Home.tsx</code> and used it in our routing. Let’s create the <code>Home</code> component. In the <code>src</code> folder, create a <code>pages</code> folder, and in that, create a <code>Home.tsx</code> file.</p>

   <code>const Home = () =&gt; {
 return (&lt;h2&gt;You are home&lt;/h2&gt;);
}

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>This is a minimal home component that represents our home page.</p>

 Authenticate using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>Next, we want to add the ability to sign in and out with our Okta without social login as a starting point. We’ll add the social login connection later.</p>

<p>To do that, we’ll create the <code>SignIn</code> component and a generic <code>Layout</code> component to control user access based on their authentication. Navigate to your <code>src</code> folder, then create a <code>components</code> folder to hold child components.</p>

<p>In the newly created <code>components</code> folder, create the <code>Layout.tsx</code>, <code>Layout.css</code>, and <code>SignIn.tsx</code> files.</p>

<p>Open the <code>Layout.tsx</code> file and add the following code:</p>

   <code>import './Layout.css';
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import SignIn from "./SignIn.tsx";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import logo from '../assets/react.svg';

const Layout = ({children}) =&gt; {
 const { authState, oktaAuth} = useOktaAuth();
 const signout = async () =&gt; await oktaAuth.signOut();

 return authState?.isAuthenticated ? (&lt;&gt;
  &lt;div className="navbar"&gt;
   &lt;Link to="/"&gt;&lt;img src={logo} className="logo" /&gt;&lt;/Link&gt;
   &lt;div className="right"&gt;
    &lt;Link to="/profile"&gt;Profile&lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;button onClick={signout} className="no-outline"&gt;Sign Out&lt;/button&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div className="layout"&gt;
   {...children}
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/&gt;) : &lt;SignIn/&gt;;
}
export default Layout;
</code>   
<p>This component imports the <code>useOktaAuth</code> from the <code>@okta/okta-react</code> package. This React hook helps us the user’s authenticated state and gives them access to the child components of the <code>Layout</code> component. The hook also lets us sign in or out our users.</p>

<p>At the top of the file, we import <code>Layout.css</code>. Open <code>Layout.css</code> so fill in the CSS we need:</p>

   <code>.layout {
 max-width: 1280px;
 margin: 0 auto;
 padding: 2rem;
 text-align: center;
}

.layout.sign-in {
 margin-top: 35vh;
}

.logo {
 height: 32px;
 will-change: filter;
 transition: filter 300ms;
}

.navbar {
 display: flex;
 justify-content: space-between;
}
</code>   

<p>These minor stylings help the <code>Layout.tsx</code> navbar look proper. Let’s not forget the <code>SignIn</code> component used in the <code>Layout</code> component.</p>

<p>Paste the following code into <code>SignIn.tsx</code>:</p>

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import logo from '../assets/react.svg';

const SignIn = () =&gt; {
 const { oktaAuth} = useOktaAuth();
 const signin = async () =&gt; await oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();

 return (
  &lt;div className="sign-in layout"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt; &lt;img src={logo} className="logo" alt="Logo"/&gt; Lister&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;button className="outlined" onClick={signin}&gt;Sign In&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 );
}

export default SignIn;
</code>   

<p>Here, we use the same <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook to sign in our user. Lastly, we update <code>src/App.tsx</code> to use our new <code>Layout</code> component. We wrap the Layout component around the routes that require authentication. Your code now looks like this:</p>

   <code>import './App.css';
import { Route, Switch, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { LoginCallback, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import Home from './pages/Home.tsx';
import Profile from './pages/Profile.tsx';
import Layout from "./components/Layout.tsx";


const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
   clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
   issuer: `https://${import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN}`,
   redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
   scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email'],
}) ;

function App() {
   const history = useHistory();
   const restoreOriginalUri = (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth,  originalUri: string) =&gt; {
       history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
   };

   return (
     &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
             &lt;Switch&gt;
                 &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
                 &lt;Layout&gt;
                     &lt;Route path="/" exact component={Home}/&gt;
                     &lt;Route path="/profile" component={Profile}/&gt;
                 &lt;/Layout&gt;
             &lt;/Switch&gt;
     &lt;/Security&gt;
   );
}

export default App
</code>   

<p>Be careful not to wrap the callback route in the <code>Layout</code> component, or else you’ll experience some weirdness during logins. If you look at the code above, you see we added a route for a profile component. Let’s create that component!</p>

<p>Navigate to <code>src/pages</code> and create the <code>Profile.tsx</code> and <code>Profile.css</code> files. In your <code>Profile.tsx</code> file, paste these in:</p>

   <code>import './Profile.css';
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { IDToken, UserClaims } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";

const Profile= () =&gt; {
 const { authState, oktaAuth} = useOktaAuth();
 const [userInfo, setUserInfo] = useState&lt;UserClaims | null&gt;(null);

 useEffect(() =&gt; {
  if(!authState || !authState.isAuthenticated) setUserInfo(null);
  else setUserInfo((authState.idToken as IDToken).claims);
 }, [authState, oktaAuth]);

 return (userInfo) ? (
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;div className="profile"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My User Profile (ID Token Claims)&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Below is the information from your ID token which was obtained during the &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-auth-code-pkce"&gt;PKCE Flow&lt;/a&gt;
     {' '}
     and is now stored in local storage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     This route is protected with the
     {' '}
     &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SecureRoute&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
     {' '}
     component, which will ensure that this page cannot be accessed until you have
     authenticated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
     &lt;thead&gt;
     &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Claim&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;
     &lt;/thead&gt;
     &lt;tbody&gt;
     {Object.entries(userInfo).map((claimEntry) =&gt; {
      const claimName = claimEntry[0];
      const claimValue = claimEntry[1];
      const claimId = `claim-${claimName}`;
      return (
       &lt;tr key={claimName}&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{claimName}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td id={claimId}&gt;{claimValue.toString()}&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;/tr&gt;
      );
     })}
     &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 ) : (&lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Fetching user profile...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;)
};

export default Profile;
</code>   

<p>And in your <code>Profile.css</code> file, add the following styles:</p>

   <code>td, th {

</code>   

<p>The <code>Profile</code> component shows you the information in the <code>useOktaAuth</code>. When building your profile page, you will probably use only a handful of that information.</p>

<p>Lastly, paste this helper CSS code into the <code>index.css</code> file in your folder root; it’s just minor styling tweaks to improve your app’s appearance.</p>

   <code>#root {

   background-color: #ffffff;
 }
 a:hover {
   color: #747bff;
 }
 button {
   background-color: #f9f9f9;
 }
}

</code>   

<p>Run <code>npm run dev</code> in the console. The command serves your app at <code>http://localhost:5173</code> and you should be able to sign in with your Okta account.</p>

<p>With these, all we need to do now is integrate Social Login and then make this app a PWA, both of which are straightforward!</p>

 Federated identity using Social Login 

<p>Social login is an authentication method that allows users to sign into an application using their existing credentials from platforms like Google, Facebook, or Apple. It simplifies the login process, reduces password fatigue, and enhances security by leveraging trusted identity providers. In our case, we are choosing Google as our social login provider.</p>

 Configure Google as an Identity Provider in Okta 

<p>First, we’d need to sign up for Google Workspace and create a Google project. After that, we configure Google as an Identity Provider (IDP). Follow the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/social-login/google/main/">instructions to set up Google for Social Login from Okta Developer documentation</a>.</p>

<p>When you define the OAuth consent screen in Google Cloud, use the following configuration:</p>
 
   Add <code>http://localhost:5173</code> to your authorized JavaScript Origins - this is the test server for our React application. 
   Add <code>/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback</code> to the Authorized redirect urls session. Replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with your actual Okta domain. 
 

<p>When adding the required scopes in Google Cloud, include the <code>./auth/userinfo.email</code>, <code>./auth/userinfo.profile</code>, and the <code>openid</code> scopes.</p>

<p>After setting up Google Cloud, you’ll configure Okta. Use the following values:</p>
 
   Enable automatic account linking to make it easier for users with an Okta account to sign in with Google. 
   Add <a href="https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/configure-routing-rules.htm?">routing rules</a> to allow all logins to use Google Social Login. For this tutorial, we’re keeping the routing conditions permissive; however, you should be a lot more stringent on a production application. You can check the routing page to configure routing to fit your use case better. 
 

 Test authenticating with Google Social Login 

<p>If you run <code>npm run dev</code> and click the sign-in button, you should see the “Sign In With Google” button and your usual Okta sign-in / sign-up screen!</p>

 Set up your React app as a PWA 

<p>Lastly, let’s make our app a PWA so we can use it offline. First, we need to add a new dependency. Open the command terminal to the project’s root and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install vite-plugin-pwa@1.0.1
</code>   

<p>Next, we update our vite.config.ts in your project root to include PWA configuration and add manifest icons:</p>

   <code>import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { VitePWA } from "vite-plugin-pwa";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
const manifestIcons = [
 {
   src: 'pwa-192.png',
   sizes: '192x192',
   type: 'image/png',
 },
 {
   src: 'pwa-512.png',
   sizes: '512x512',
   type: 'image/png',
 }
]
export default defineConfig({
 plugins: [
   react(),
   VitePWA({
     registerType: 'autoUpdate',
     devOptions: {
       enabled: true
     },
     manifest: {
       name: 'Lister',
       short_name: 'lister',
       icons: manifestIcons,
     }
   })
 ],
})
</code>   

<p>You can get cute favicons from an <a href="https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/">icon generator</a> and replace the <code>manifestIcons</code> source images with those. You can also look at the <a href="https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/">Vite PWA documentation</a> to better understand each option’s meaning and how to use it.</p>

<p>With these changes, end your current npm script and run <code>npm run dev</code> again; everything should be peachy. Now we have an app with Social Login capabilities.</p>

<p>Since this application is a todo list application, let’s add the todo list feature. Since our app is a PWA, our users should be able to use the application even when offline. To make the data accessible offline, we can store it locally on the client using browser storage and then sync the data with our servers using service workers (let us know if you want to see a tutorial using service workers).</p>

 Build a secure todo list React PWA 

<p>Since we will persist the todo list data, creating a model is a good idea. This model serves as a layer of abstraction over the DB calls. In this section, we’ll save the data to local storage; in the future, we may want to switch to another technology. A model helps us make this change in the implementation without changing code when consuming the model. Now let’s create the model: navigate to the <code>src</code> folder and create a folder named <code>models</code>. In that folder, create a <code>Task.model.ts</code>. We’ll call each item in the todo list a task.
The task model file should look like this:</p>

   <code>export interface Task {
 name: string;
 description: string;
 done: boolean;
}

const key = 'lister-tasks';

export default {
 addTask: (task: Task) =&gt; {
  const currentTasksJSON = localStorage.getItem(key);
  if (!currentTasksJSON) {
   localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify([task]));
   return;
  }
  const currentTasks = JSON.parse(currentTasksJSON);
  currentTasks.push(task);
  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(currentTasks));
 },

 all: (): Task[] =&gt; {
  const currentTasksJSON = localStorage.getItem(key);
  if (!currentTasksJSON) return [];
  return JSON.parse(currentTasksJSON);
 },

 save: (tasks: Task[]) =&gt; localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(tasks)),
}
</code>   

<p>The model is a small wrapper over <code>LocalStorage</code>. The first part of the model defines the Task interface – all we need for a task is its name, description, and done state. The key variable is the <code>localStorage</code> item name; I chose to use <code>lister-tasks</code> for mine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember, don’t store sensitive user data (e.g., passwords) on the client side but on a secure server!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next up, we update the home page at <code>src/pages/Home.tsx</code> to look like this:</p>

   <code>import './Home.css';
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import TaskModel, { Task } from "../models/Task.model.ts";

const EMPTY_TASK: Task = { name: "", description: "", done: false } as const;
const Home = () =&gt; {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState&lt;Task[]&gt;(TaskModel.all().reverse());
  const [addMode, setAddMode] = useState(false);
  const [form, setForm] = useState&lt;Task&gt;(EMPTY_TASK);
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState&lt;boolean[]&gt;(new Array(tasks.length).fill(false));
  useEffect(() =&gt; TaskModel.save(tasks), [tasks]);

  const toggleTask = (id: number) =&gt; {
    const _tasks = [...tasks];
    _tasks[id].done = !_tasks[id].done;
    setTasks(_tasks);
  }
  
  const addNewTask = (e: Event) =&gt; {
    e.preventDefault();
    setExpanded(new Array(tasks.length + 1).fill(false));
    setTasks([...tasks, form]);
    setForm(EMPTY_TASK);
    setAddMode(!addMode);
  }


  const toggleExpansion = (id: number) =&gt; {
    const _expanded = [...expanded];
    _expanded[id] = !_expanded[id];
    setExpanded(_expanded);
  }


  return (&lt;&gt;
    &lt;h2 className="tab-heading"&gt;
    &lt;button className={`no-outline ${!addMode &amp;&amp; 'active'}`}
        onClick={() =&gt; setAddMode(false)}&gt;Task List
    &lt;/button&gt;


    &lt;button className={`no-outline ${addMode &amp;&amp; 'active'}`} onClick={() =&gt; setAddMode(true)}&gt;New
      Task +
    &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    {addMode &amp;&amp; &lt;form className="tab" action="#" onSubmit={addNewTask}&gt;
    &lt;div className="form-fields"&gt;
      &lt;div className="form-group"&gt;
      &lt;label htmlFor="name"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Task name"
          onChange={(e) =&gt; setForm({...form, name: e.target.value})} required/&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="form-group full"&gt;
      &lt;label htmlFor="description"&gt;Description&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;textarea rows="5" maxLength="800"
            onChange={(e) =&gt; setForm({...form, description: e.target.value})}
            className="form-control" name="description"
            id="description" placeholder="describe the task..."&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div className="form-group"&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;}
    {!addMode &amp;&amp; &lt;ul className="tab task-list"&gt;
    {tasks.map((task, idx) =&gt;
      &lt;li key={idx} className={`${task.done &amp;&amp; 'done'}`}&gt;
      &lt;div className="title-card"&gt;
        &lt;input type="checkbox" name={'task' + idx} checked={task.done}
            onChange={() =&gt; toggleTask(idx)}/&gt;
        &lt;p className="name"&gt;{task.name}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p className="expand" onClick={() =&gt; toggleExpansion(idx)}&gt;&amp;#9660;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      {expanded[idx] &amp;&amp; &lt;p className="description"&gt;{task.description}&lt;/p&gt;}
      &lt;/li&gt;)}
    &lt;/ul&gt;}
  &lt;/&gt;);
}

export default Home;

</code>   

<p>The first three lines of the code are the necessary imports. Next, we create a default empty task. The rest of the component is a basic CRUD page, with the required state for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. I used a <code>useEffect</code> hook to save the tasks to local storage whenever they change. If you look at the component, a <code>Home.css</code> import is at the top. Let’s create that file in the same directory and paste these into the content:</p>

   <code>.form-fields {
 display: flex;
 justify-content: space-between;
 flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.form-group{
 margin: 5px 0;
}

.form-fields .form-group{
 width: 100%;

 flex-direction: column;
}

.form-group.check-group {

}
</code>   

<p>The above are helper styles. I used a tabular design for the todo list component so CRUD can be on the same page without using modal popups. Once all the files are in place, you’ll see the Todo List home page when you log in with Okta.</p>

<p>Once you have all the required manifest icons in your project, when you serve the app, you’ll see a prompt in the browser to install it on your machine! If you don’t want to create icons, use <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-pwa-example">the ones in the sample repo</a>.</p>

 Authenticate with Social Login from a React PWA 

<p>Great job making it this far! Along the way, we’ve explored how social login works with Okta and Google and how to set up a basic PWA using React, Vite, and the Vite PWA plugin. As a bonus, we now have a handy little todo list app to help keep our day on track!</p>

<p>Of course, a production-ready application would involve more advanced service worker configurations and a proper database setup, but our current implementation is adequate for an introduction.
Now it’s your turn to have fun: open the app in your browser, try signing in with Okta or Google, and test the install prompt to see how smoothly it runs as a standalone app. Happy coding!</p>

 Tips for Safe and Optimal Streaming 



 Use Trusted Sites 



<p>When exploring Top 10 Movie Sites for Free, it’s crucial to stick to legal platforms to safeguard yourself from malware, viruses, and potential legal issues. Reputable free streaming sites acquire content through legitimate licensing, ensuring a safer viewing experience compared to illicit alternatives that often host malicious ads or even direct malware downloads. Always prioritize your digital security by verifying a site’s credibility before streaming.</p>



 Enable VPN 



<p>To enhance your privacy and bypass geo-restrictions on certain movie sites for free, it’s highly recommended to enable a VPN like NordVPN or ExpressVPN. A Virtual Private Network encrypts your internet connection and masks your IP address, making your online activity more private. This not only adds a layer of security against data monitoring but can also allow you to access content that might otherwise be unavailable in your region due to licensing agreements.</p>


 
 


 Check Internet Speed 



<p>For a smooth and uninterrupted experience while you stream your favorite films, ensure you have a stable internet connection. Streaming movies, especially in higher resolutions, requires sufficient bandwidth to avoid constant buffering and pixelation. Before settling in for a film, a quick check of your internet speed can prevent frustration and guarantee that your movie night is enjoyable and seamless.</p>



 Ad Blockers 



<p>While ad blockers can significantly improve your experience on movie sites for free by removing intrusive advertisements, be aware that some platforms may not work with ad blockers enabled. Many free streaming services rely on ads for revenue, and they might detect and block users who have ad blockers active, preventing content from loading. Use them cautiously and be prepared to disable them for specific sites if you encounter playback issues.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Remember to prioritize your safety by sticking to trusted sites, considering a VPN for enhanced privacy, and ensuring a stable internet connection for optimal streaming. While some sites rely on ads, the trade-off is often worthwhile for the vast library of content at your fingertips. Embrace the world of free streaming and elevate your entertainment experience today!</p>

From faster airport check-ins to personalized hotel experiences, identity is becoming portable, private, and verifiable.</p><p>To explore what’s real, what’s next, and what identity organizations should be doing today, we hosted a live conversation with two people at the forefront of this shift. Annet Steenbergen, an advisor to the EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium, shared insights from the large-scale pilots testing the EUDI Wallet across Europe.

<p>Q: What can we expect once the HPP Mainnet goes live, especially with partners like Eigenlayer and Arbitrum?<br>The Mainnet is launching very soon. Boost will likely be the first project to go live on it. The vision is for HPP to become the preferred chain for AI-native projects — fast, scalable, and developer-friendly. Our partnerships with Eigenlayer, Arbitrum, and others are focused on ensuring high throughput and robust infrastructure.</p><p>Q: Is RWA something HPP is actively targeting?<br>Absolutely yes. As long as projects are legally compliant, HPP is open to supporting RWA use cases. We’re not putting artificial limits on what can be built — RWA is welcome if it fits within the framework.</p><p>Q: How will HPP impact enterprise chains and existing apps?<br>HPP is a public Layer 2 chain, which differs from Aergo’s earlier enterprise deployments. We’re building dev tools and working on integrations to make it easy for dApps to adopt HPP. The goal is to bring real usage into the ecosystem, not just testnet&nbsp;demos.</p><p>Q: How does HPP see the relationship between AI and blockchain?<br>We’re the infrastructure layer, not the app itself. Think of us like Microsoft Word — we’re not the author, but we empower the builder. We want HPP to be the default chain AI developers turn to when they need trust, traceability, and composability.</p><p>Q: Are you collaborating with top AI players or building your own stack?<br>Ideally both. We’re open to working with leading AI teams and also building internal tools and research capacity. At the end of the day, we want HPP to be on the shortlist when someone serious is looking to deploy AI on-chain.</p><p>Q: Could HPP be used as a Plan B during a global black swan financial event?<br>No, that’s not part of the discussion. We’re not in talks with banks or central authorities for that sort of thing, and we doubt most crypto projects are. It’s not what we’re focused on building.</p><p>Q: What do you think about the rise of “growth companions” (virtual AI friends)?<br>Technically? Not scary — they’re just better chatbots with memory. Socially? It’s more complex. There are risks (e.g. loneliness, mental health, even tragedy), but also huge potential for positive impact, especially in mental health and human connection. History shows that society tends to fear new tech at first — like it did with organ transplants — but those fears can give way to lasting&nbsp;good.</p><p>Q: Is there a direct collaboration between Blocko and Upleat on the Aergo mainnet?<br>Blocko built Aergo, but their stablecoin work with Upleat is separate from the public HPP Mainnet. They often fork Aergo tech for custom enterprise deployments, and we don’t expect this to run on our public chain. Also, we stay out of those talks to avoid conflicts of interest.</p><p>Q: How does Aergo see itself contributing to or differentiating from the broader AI x crypto movement, especially with the rise of ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) initiatives?<br>While we respect and support the ambition behind ASI, Aergo(HPP) is focused on a different layer of the stack. Rather than aiming to build superintelligence, we are designing the infrastructure layer that can be put into use in real life based on verifiable, decentralized coordination between AI agents, users, and protocols. Our focus is on practical, scalable systems that unlock near-term value. In short, we’re not just theorizing about AI’s role in the future. We’re shipping the infrastructure to support verifiable and economically active AI&nbsp;systems.</p> Final Wrap-Up   The HPP Mainnet is nearly here. It will launch as a public mainnet once preparations are complete. For more details, check out the announcement (<a href="https://x.com/aergo_io/status/1946087643269521531">https://x.com/aergo_io/status/1946087643269521531</a>)  We’re building an AI-first, developer-ready L2 and want to be the chain that real builders&nbsp;choose.  Community feedback continues to shape our direction.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-17-hpp-mainnet-ai-and-the-evolving-ecosystem-4e4d332379b8">[Aergo Talks #17] HPP Mainnet, AI, and the Evolving Ecosystem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Why Download Picture from Website? 



 Common Use Cases for Downloading Pictures

You can easily create mood boards for design or decor, gathering visual inspiration from various sources. It’s also perfect for<a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-remove-background-from-images-a-simple-tutorial/"> saving tutorials</a> with step-by-step images, ensuring you have offline access when you need it most. Furthermore, you can effortlessly archive visuals for personal reference, building a library of images for hobbies, research, or future creative endeavors.</p>









 Benefits: Convenience, Creativity, and Offline Access 



<p>The benefits of knowing how to download picture from website are clear: convenience, creativity, and offline access. No more scrambling to find an image you saw online when you’re without the internet. You can collect inspiration anytime, anywhere, boosting your creative workflow. Plus, with a secure browser like Herond, you ensure these downloads are not only easy but also safe, protecting your device and privacy as you build your visual library.</p>



 Herond’s Advantage: Safe and Fast Browse 



<p>When you use Herond Browser, you gain a significant advantage in how to download picture from website. Herond is designed to <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-stop-pop-up-ads/">block trackers and ads</a>, which not only makes your browsing experience cleaner and faster, but also ensures enhanced security during image downloads. By preventing malicious scripts and intrusive ads, Herond helps you save images safely, without unwanted pop-ups or privacy concerns, making your visual archiving process seamless and protected.</p>



 Step-by-Step Guide to Download Picture from Website 



 Step 1: Use Herond Browser for Safe Browse 



 
 Recommend Herond Browser: Download Herond Browser at <a href="https://herond.org/">https://herond.org/</a>. 



 Benefits: Enjoy 3x faster page loading and robust tracker-blocking features for a secure browsing environment. 



 Guide Users: Open your target website in Herond Browser for protected and efficient image downloading. 
 



 Step 2: Identify and Right-Click the Image 



 
 Locate &amp; Select: To download pictures from a website, simply identify the image you want. On desktop, right-click on it; on mobile, long-press it. 



 Save Option: From the context menu, select “Save Image As…” or “Download Image”. 



 Herond’s Advantage: Herond’s intuitive interface makes this process seamless, ensuring quick and easy image saving without fuss. 
 


 
 


 Step 3: Use Browser Developer Tools for Protected Images 



 
 Access Developer Tools: To download pictures from a website that are “locked,” open Herond’s Developer Tools by pressing <code>Ctrl + Shift + I</code> (or <code>Cmd + Option + I</code> on Mac), or simply right-click anywhere and select “Inspect.” 



 Locate Image URL: Navigate to the “Network” tab and filter by “Img” to see loaded images. Alternatively, check the “Elements” tab to inspect the page’s HTML for image links. 



 Save Image: Once you find the image’s URL, right-click it and select “Open in new tab” to view the image directly, then right-click again to “Save Image As.” This method helps you bypass common restrictions. 
 


 
 


 Step 4: Use Online Download Tools 



 
 Suggest Trusted Tools: For bulk or restricted image downloads, consider online tools like Img2Go or DownloadGram. These can often bypass website limitations. 



 Access via Herond: Always access these external tools through Herond Browser. Herond’s built-in ad and tracker blocking ensures a cleaner and safer experience when using third-party download services. 
 



 Step 5: Take Screenshots as a Backup 



 
 Utilize Screenshot Features: As a reliable backup method for how to download pictures from a website, use Herond Browser’s built-in screenshot feature, or your device’s native tools. For Windows, Snip &amp; Sketch (<code>Windows key + Shift + S</code>) is great; on Mac, use <code>Command + Shift + 4</code>. 



 Refine with Cropping: After capturing, use simple cropping tools to refine your screenshots, focusing only on the desired image area and eliminating unnecessary elements. This ensures you get a clean visual copy, even if direct downloading isn’t possible. 
 


 
 


 Tips for Efficient and Safe Image Downloading with Herond 



 Verify Image Sources 



<p>When learning how to download picture from website, always verify image sources to avoid malicious files. Before clicking download, quickly check the website’s credibility. Herond Browser actively helps by displaying site safety warnings, alerting you to potentially risky sites and adding an extra layer of protection against malware or unwanted downloads. This simple step can save you from significant security headaches.</p>



 Use VPN with Herond 



<p>For enhanced privacy while you download picture from website, consider combining Herond Browser with a VPN like NordVPN. While Herond already offers strong built-in protections, using a reputable VPN encrypts your connection and masks your IP address. This dual approach ensures your browser and downloading activities remain private and secure, especially when accessing various online sources for images.</p>









 Organize Downloads 



<p>To maintain an efficient workflow, organize your downloads by saving images in dedicated folders. Instead of letting downloaded pictures scatter across your default “Downloads” folder, create specific directories for different projects or categories. This practice makes it much easier to find and manage your visual assets later, ensuring that learning how to download picture from website also leads to a tidy and productive system.</p>



 Leverage Herond’s Speed 



<p>Finally, truly leverage Herond’s speed for a superior downloading experience. Herond’s remarkable 90% tracker-blocking capability significantly reduces the amount of data loaded by websites.

By minimizing background activity and intrusive elements, Herond ensures your focus remains on efficiently getting the images you need without lag or distractions.</p>

<p>Want to save that inspiring tutorial, hilarious clip, or favorite music video to watch offline? Knowing how to download YouTube video for free &amp; safely is a skill many are searching for. At Herond, we get it – you want convenience without compromising security. This guide will walk you through the best, most reliable methods to download your favorite YouTube content safely, ensuring your device stays protected while you build your offline video library.</p>



 Why Download YouTube Videos? 



 Reasons to Download YouTube Video for free 



<p>Knowing how to download youtube video for free &amp; safely offers compelling reasons for users. It’s incredibly useful for watching offline during travel, ensuring entertainment or learning isn’t interrupted by poor internet connectivity on flights, trains, or in remote areas. Moreover, you can save educational content like tutorials, lectures, or documentaries, creating a personal knowledge library accessible anytime. Finally, it allows you to create personal collections of favorite music videos, inspirational talks, or funny clips, curating content precisely to your preferences.</p>


 
 


 Benefits of Downloading YouTube Videos 



<p>The benefits of<a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-clear-all-youtube-search-history/"> downloading youtube video</a> for free are manifold. Foremost is convenience: you can access your desired content instantly without buffering or relying on an internet connection. This also translates to greater accessibility, as downloaded videos can be watched on various devices, anytime, anywhere, truly making your content portable. Crucially, these methods often provide cost-free solutions for personal use, allowing you to enjoy a vast library of content without recurring data charges or subscription fees, ensuring you can download youtube video for free &amp; safely.</p>



 Best Ways to Download YouTube Video for Free &amp; Safely 



 Method 1: Use Online YouTube Downloaders 



 
 Recommended Tools (Use with Caution): For a quick way to download youtube video for free &amp; safely, popular online downloaders include SaveFrom.net. These tools generally allow direct video conversion from a URL. 



 Simple Steps
 
 Copy the video URL directly from YouTube’s address bar. 



 Paste the URL into the designated field on the online downloader’s website. 



 Select your desired format (e.g., MP4) and resolution (e.g., 1080p) from the available options. 



 Click “Download” to save the video to your device. 
 
 



 Crucial Warning: Be extremely cautious and avoid shady sites that display excessive pop-up ads, try to redirect you, or prompt you to install suspicious software. These can often lead to malware or phishing attempts. Always use a secure browser like Herond to mitigate risks. 
 


 
 


 Method 2: Use Desktop Software 



 
 Suggest Reliable Tools: For a more powerful and often higher-quality approach to download youtube video for free &amp; safely, consider desktop software. Top recommendations include 4K Video Downloader (known for its user-friendly interface and support for various resolutions) or YT-DLP (a robust, open-source command-line tool for advanced users). 



 Installation &amp; Usage for Quality/Safety:
 
 Installation: Download the software from its official website (e.g., <code>4kdownload.com</code> for 4K Video Downloader, or check <code>github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp</code> for YT-DLP) to ensure authenticity and avoid malware. Follow the installation prompts. 



 Usage (4K Video Downloader): Copy the YouTube video URL, paste it into the software, choose your desired format and resolution (up to 4K/8K if available), and click download. It’s designed for straightforward, high-quality saves. 



 Usage (YT-DLP): This is a command-line tool. After installation, you’ll use your computer’s terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) to run commands like <code>yt-dlp </code> to download, with options for specific formats or qualities. It offers immense flexibility but has a steeper learning curve. 
 
 
 









 Method 3: Use Mobile Apps 



 
 Recommend Apps (Android): For Android users seeking how to download YouTube videos for free &amp; safely directly on their devices, popular choices include <a href="https://www.snaptube.com/">SnapTube</a> or <a href="https://tubemate.vi.softonic.com/">TubeMate</a>. These apps offer features like background downloading and various quality options. 



 Safe APK Download: Since these apps are typically not available on the Google Play Store (due to YouTube’s terms of service), it’s crucial to download their APKs only from their official websites. Avoid unofficial app stores, as they often host outdated, modified, or malicious versions that could compromise your device. Always prioritize security by sourcing directly from the developers. 
 


 
 


 Method 4: Screen Recording as a Backup 



 
 How to Use: As a last resort or for content difficult to download directly, screen recording is a viable backup method for how to <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-delete-the-history-from-youtube/">download youtube</a> video for free &amp; safely. Most modern devices have built-in screen recorders (e.g., swipe down on Android/iOS and tap the record icon). For desktop, powerful software like OBS Studio offers comprehensive recording capabilities. 



 Pros &amp; Cons:
 
 Pros: This method requires no third-party download tools, making it inherently safer in terms of avoiding malware. 



 Cons: Videos recorded this way often have lower quality compared to direct downloads (limited by screen resolution and recording settings). They also typically require manual editing to trim unwanted parts (like ads or UI elements), adding extra steps to the process. 
 
 
 









 Tips for Safe and Efficient Downloading 



 Choose Trusted Tools 



<p>To truly download youtube video for free &amp; safely, the most crucial step is to choose trusted tools. Stick to well-reviewed apps and websites that have a strong reputation and clear privacy policies. Avoiding unknown or suspicious downloaders is paramount, as many can be fronts for malware, adware, or phishing schemes designed to compromise your device or steal your data. Always check user reviews and security warnings before proceeding, ensuring your downloading experience remains secure.</p>



 Check Video Quality 



<p>When you download a YouTube video, always check video quality options. Most downloaders allow you to select the resolution (e.g., 720p, 1080p, or even 4K). Choosing the appropriate resolution ensures the video is compatible with your device’s display capabilities and storage capacity. While higher quality is great, it also means larger file sizes. Balancing quality with your device’s storage and playback capabilities is key to efficiently building your offline video library.</p>


 
 


 Use VPN for Privacy 



<p>For an added layer of security and privacy, while you download youtube video for free &amp; safely, consider using a VPN like NordVPN or ExpressVPN. A VPN encrypts your internet connection and masks your IP address, making your online activities more private and harder to track by your Internet Service Provider or other third parties. This is especially beneficial when using online downloaders, as it adds a shield between your device and the various servers involved in the downloading process, protecting your data.</p>



 Manage Storage 



<p>Finally, to keep your device running smoothly, it’s essential to manage storage by organizing your downloaded videos. Large video files can quickly consume significant disk space. Create dedicated, clearly labeled folders for different categories (e.g., “Tutorials,” “Music Videos,” “Travel Vlogs”). Regularly review your collection, deleting videos you no longer need. This proactive organization not only saves device space but also makes it far easier to find and enjoy your downloaded content whenever you want.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Mastering how to download youtube video for free &amp; safely gives you unparalleled convenience and access to your favorite content. Whether using online downloaders, desktop software, mobile apps, or screen recording, always prioritize digital safety by choosing trusted tools, avoiding suspicious sites, and using a secure browser like Herond. By understanding legal aspects, managing quality, and organizing downloads, you can confidently build a robust offline library without compromising security.</p>

 Insurance brand differentiation through PaaS&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a new way to stand out in the insurance industry, and it’s not about offering lower premiums or faster claims. It’s about privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumer expectations are shifting, and Privacy as a Service (PaaS) is emerging as a powerful differentiator for insurers seeking to lead in trust, security, and digital experience. This is your opportunity to move beyond compliance and build tangible brand equity through privacy.&nbsp;</p>



 The Rise of Privacy for the Everyday Consumer&nbsp; 



<p>In today’s hyper-digital world, privacy has gone from a background concern to a front-page priority. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/#:~:text=In%20an%20era%20where%20every,May%2015%2D21%2C%202023.&amp;text=Americans%20%E2%80%93%20particularly%20Republicans%20%E2%80%93%20have%20grown,and%20the%20government%20(79%25).">Pew Research</a>, 67% of Americans say they understand little to nothing about what companies do with their data, up from 59% in previous years. Most also feel they have little or no control over how businesses or government agencies use their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where Privacy as a Service (PaaS) becomes a critical advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PaaS offers insurers a strategic way to embed privacy tools into their offerings from encrypted messaging and masked contact details to user-controlled data sharing and real-time breach monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What privacy as a service looks like&nbsp; 



<p>Privacy as a Service isn’t theoretical. It’s a growing suite of tools insurers can implement today, either through white-labeled apps or integration with their existing digital platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Private communication channels (e.g., encrypted messaging)&nbsp;<br> 



 Virtual cards for secure payments or online purchases&nbsp;<br> 



 Digital wallets that store only necessary credentials&nbsp;<br> 



 User-controlled identity and data-sharing preferences&nbsp;<br> 



 Real-time alerts and monitoring for data breaches, leaks, or misuse&nbsp;<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Together, these tools help protect against fraud, phishing, impersonation, and unauthorized data sharing, all while building policyholder confidence.&nbsp;</p>



 What specific PaaS solutions are available?&nbsp; 



<p>Several technology providers now offer turnkey or customizable privacy-as-a-service toolkits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/digital-identity-protection/">Anonyome Labs provides</a> secure communication tools (like virtual phone numbers and masked emails), identity protection, digital wallets, and breach monitoring.&nbsp;<br> 



 Jumio and Okta offer identity verification and access management solutions that support consumer-controlled credentialing.&nbsp;<br> 



 <a href="https://thetechpencil.com/how-googles-2025-tracking-policy-impacts-iphones-and-apple-s-ecosystem-38c168a1b5d7">Apple’s Private Relay</a> and others are shifting expectations for how personal data should be handled in digital experiences, further reinforcing the importance of privacy-centric offerings.&nbsp;<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Insurers can choose to license these features or integrate them into native apps for a seamless user experience.&nbsp;</p>



 How to effectively communicate the value of privacy tools 



<p>Implementing PaaS is only half the equation. Insurers must clearly articulate why it matters to customers. Here’s how:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Lead with control: Emphasize how customers can manage what they share and with whom they share it.&nbsp;

This environment allows HPP to validate its infrastructure, onboard foundational projects, and test cross-chain, smart contract, and agent-based operations. The Public Mainnet is scheduled for Q3 2025, along with full token activation, agent deployment, developer tools, and ecosystem integration.</blockquote><p>We’re excited to announce the official launch of the House Party Protocol (HPP) Private Mainnet, a significant milestone that marks the culmination of focused research, protocol development, and ecosystem readiness. More importantly, it represents the final preparatory phase before opening the network to the broader&nbsp;public.</p> Why Launch a Private&nbsp;Mainnet? <p>The Private Mainnet provides a controlled environment for finalizing and validating the core infrastructure before it is fully accessible to the public. While technically identical to the upcoming public mainnet, this phase allows us to fine-tune key systems, ensure operational stability, and onboard essential modules.</p><p>Key developments during this stage&nbsp;include:</p>  Deployment of cross-chain bridges, oracles, and subgraphs  Initial issuance of the HPP token and setup of on-chain governance mechanisms  Onboarding of foundational projects, including AQT (RWA tokenization), Booost (proof-of-humanity), and W3DB/VaasBlock (on-chain reputation)   What We’re&nbsp;Testing <p>During the private mainnet phase, we are rigorously testing the protocol’s core capabilities under real-world conditions. This includes evaluating distributed node coordination and overall network performance, conducting smart contract audits, and assessing system observability at the protocol level. These tests ensure HPP can support intelligent, autonomous operations at&nbsp;scale.</p> What’s Next: Public Mainnet Launch in Q3&nbsp;2025 <p>Once the Private Mainnet is successfully stabilized, HPP will move into its next chapter with the public release of its Layer 2 mainnet in Q3 2025. This launch will activate the full HPP token economy and invite broader user and developer participation.</p><p>At the public launch, the HPP ecosystem will&nbsp;support:</p>  Native staking, protocol governance, and fee mechanisms using the HPP&nbsp;token  Deployment of autonomous agents for DeFi, AI coordination, and RWA operations  Developer onboarding through SDKs, APIs, and documentation portals  Cross-platform and cross-chain composability between CEXs, DEXs, and L2 protocols  <p>The HPP Private Mainnet is not just a technical milestone. It’s a clear signal that the network is nearing readiness for public adoption. We’re building the foundation for an intelligent, agent-based blockchain future.</p><p>We’re just getting started. In the coming weeks, we’ll be sharing more in-depth content, including public roadmap details, developer documentation, and additional resources.

  As AUSTRAC tightens oversight, Australian insurers must modernize AML practices. This guide shows how to automate risk checks, verify identities, and manage broker-led onboarding using iComply.

<p>AUSTRAC is increasing scrutiny on insurers and intermediaries under Australia’s AML/CTF regime. This article explores how insurers can automate AML screening and identity verification for policyholders, brokers, and third parties – while maintaining compliance with reporting, privacy, and onboarding standards.</p>
 
 Australia’s insurance sector is under growing regulatory pressure as AUSTRAC expands its supervision beyond banks and casinos. General insurers, life insurance providers, and MGAs are now expected to demonstrate robust anti-money laundering (AML) programs, effective customer due diligence (CDD), and clear audit trails. 
<p>The result? AML is no longer a back-office function. It’s now a front-line compliance priority.</p>
 The AUSTRAC Focus in 2025 
<p>Recent enforcement actions and guidance updates from AUSTRAC make it clear that insurers must:</p>
 
 Identify and verify policyholders and beneficiaries 
 Screen for politically exposed persons (PEPs) and sanctions 
 Assess risk based on product type and transaction behaviour 
 Monitor intermediaries such as brokers, agents, and referrers 
 Report suspicious matters and threshold transactions 
 
<p>Unlike banks, insurers face unique challenges: low-frequency transactions, indirect relationships via brokers, and legacy systems with fragmented data. This makes real-time AML controls more difficult—yet increasingly essential.</p>
 Key Compliance Challenges for Insurers 
<p>1. Broker-Mediated Risk<br>
Many insurers onboard customers indirectly through brokers. If AML checks are delayed or inconsistent, exposure increases.</p>
<p>2. Complex Beneficiary Structures<br>
Life insurance policies, trusts, or group schemes often involve multiple named or contingent beneficiaries, requiring deeper CDD.</p>
<p>3. Manual Onboarding and Monitoring<br>
Legacy systems often rely on PDFs, emails, or offline checks—creating gaps in screening and reporting.</p>
<p>4. AU-Specific Privacy and Data Handling Laws<br>
AML systems must comply with the Australian Privacy Act and localization rules for sensitive personal data.</p>
 How iComply Helps Australian Insurers 
<p>iComply delivers a flexible, modular platform for AML compliance that supports insurance-specific use cases, including:</p>
 1. AML Screening for Policyholders and Brokers 
 
 Screen natural persons and legal entities against global PEP and sanctions lists 
 Automate ongoing monitoring with configurable refresh intervals 
 Risk-score customers and brokers based on transaction type and geography 
 
 2. Identity Verification at Onboarding 
 
 Use edge computing to validate ID documents and biometrics locally 
 Ensure fast onboarding without storing sensitive data offshore 
 Maintain full audit trails for AUSTRAC inspection readiness 
 
 3. Modular Flows for Multi-Party Policies 
 
 Onboard and verify multiple parties (e.g., policyholder, beneficiary, advisor) within a single case file 
 Apply risk-based logic to determine verification depth per party 
 
 4. Broker Portal and Delegated Compliance 
 
 Offer white-labeled portals for broker-assisted onboarding 
 Maintain insurer control over compliance policies and screening standards 
 
 5. Data Residency and Privacy Controls 
 
 All personal data processed and stored in compliance with Australian data protection law 
 Configurable consent capture, encryption, and retention policies 
 
 Case Insight: Life Insurer in NSW 
<p>A leading life insurance provider implemented iComply’s AML and identity verification modules for broker-led onboarding. Within 90 days:</p>
 
 Reduced manual reviews by 67% 
 Flagged 2 high-risk brokers for enhanced due diligence 
 Streamlined onboarding from 4 days to under 1 
 
 What to Expect in 2025 
 
 More Targeted AUSTRAC Reviews of non-bank financial services providers 
 Integration with Digital Identity Frameworks as Australia expands verified ID initiatives 
 Increased Focus on Intermediary Oversight including brokers, aggregators, and marketing affiliates 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Insurers can no longer afford to treat AML as a check-the-box task. AUSTRAC expects proactive, risk-based controls – especially when brokers and beneficiaries complicate the onboarding chain.</p>
<p>Talk to iComply to learn how we help Australian insurers meet AML obligations, reduce friction, and future-proof compliance with a flexible, audit-ready platform.</p>

  TAU Systems and Thales announce pioneering collaboration in laser-driven particle acceleration
prezly

Thu, 07/17/2025 - 15:00


             
 TAU’s compact accelerator offers applications throughout science, including imaging semiconductor structures, radiation testing space-bound electronics, developing cancer therapies, and conducting advanced medical imaging techniques 
 The Thales laser has been installed in the world’s first-of-its-kind commercial laser-plasma accelerator facility, TAU Labs, dedicated to customer applications 
 
<p>Austin, TX – July 17, 2025 –<a href="http://www.tausystems.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.tausystems.com/">TAU Systems</a>, the developer of next-generation ultrafast laser-plasma accelerators, today announced the collaboration with solid-state laser producer Thales. The collaboration leverages Thales’ expertise in high peak power laser systems and TAU Systems’ innovation in laser-driven particle acceleration.</p>
<p>The collaboration will see the two pioneering companies offer for the first-time complete commercial laser-driven particle and radiation sources, generating from electrons or neutrons to X-rays and Gamma rays. These crucial systems, with the first one installed in TAU Labs Carlsbad, California, are complemented by an innovative beam-time-as-a-service proposal at the first of several application centers, and will accelerate research and development into many exciting and relevant areas such as radiation testing of space-bound electronics, advanced X-Ray imaging of 3D structures, and even novel cancer therapies. </p>
<blockquote><p>TAU Systems CEO, Bjorn Manuel Hegelich said: “It is great to be working with Thales, they have been leaders of high energy Titanium:Sapphire scientific lasers for many years and their experience ​ brought ​ a positive impact on bringing access to laser-plasma wakefield accelerator technologies to a broader scientific audience.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Tugdual Le Bouar, Laser Systems &amp; Solutions Director at Thales commented: “Building on the strengths of both companies, Thales and TAU Systems are at the forefront of developing exciting new products that will combine their respective technologies and usher in new applications for the most advanced and accessible particle and light sources.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Thales has been at the leading edge of laser system development for more than 40 years, manufacturing high-energy, flashlamp-pumped and diode-pumped nanosecond lasers for industrial applications as well as powerful ultrashort pulse Titanium:Sapphire femtosecond laser systems delivering power of up to 10 petawatts for scientific applications.</p>
<p>How TAU System’s Compact Accelerator Works&nbsp;</p>
<p>Particle accelerators hold great potential for semiconductor applications, medical imaging and therapy, and research in materials, energy and medicine. But conventional high-energy particle accelerators require plenty of space – some upwards of kilometers – making them expensive and limiting their presence to a handful of national labs and universities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TAU Systems have built and rigorously tested a compact laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA), which has a wide variety of applications, and the full system could be contained in a volume the size of a shipping container.</p>
<p>This kind of compact particle accelerator could also be used to drive another device called an X-ray free electron laser, which could be used as a light source for beyond EUV lithography for even more advanced chip production as well as being capable of recording the dynamics of processes on the atomic or molecular scale. Examples of such dynamic processes include drug interactions with cells, changes inside batteries that might cause them to go into thermal runaway, chemical reactions inside solar panels, and viral proteins changing shape when infecting cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept for LWFA was first described in 1979. An extremely powerful laser strikes a gas target (e.g. Helium), heats it into a plasma and creates plasma waves that accelerate electrons from the gas, thereby generating a high-energy electron beam. Conceptually, the laser is like a boat skimming across a lake, leaving behind a wake – a plasma wake/wave – and electrons ride this plasma wave like surfers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the past couple of decades, various research groups have developed more powerful versions and Hegelich’s group holds the current record with a demonstrated acceleration gradient of over 100 billion volts per meter or 1,000x more than even the strongest conventional accelerators can achieve.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s hard to get into the biggest wave without getting overpowered, so surfers get dragged in by Jet Skis,” Hegelich said. “In our accelerator, the equivalent of Jet Skis are metal nanoparticles that release electrons at just the right point and just the right time, so they are all sitting there in the wave. We get a lot more electrons into the wave when and where we want them to be, rather than statistically distributed over the whole interaction, and that’s our secret sauce.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>About TAU Systems&nbsp;</p>
<p>TAU Systems is an Austin, Texas-based deep-tech company commercializing the first compact particle accelerators and specialized X-ray free-electron lasers that combine the capabilities of large accelerators with a small footprint to provide easy and affordable beam-time access for any company. Led by premier experts in laser-driven particle accelerators, TAU is democratizing access for the progress of semiconductors, batteries, medical imaging, nuclear energy, and more. </p>
<p>In 2023 TAU, together with the University of Texas reached a world record with the successful demonstration of an electron beam with an energy of 10 billion electron volts (10 GeV) generated in 10 centimeters.<br>​<br>​Learn more a<a href="http://www.tausystems.com/">t</a> <a href="http://www.tausystems.com/">www.tausystems.com</a></p>

<p>In this two-part series, we explore the foundational pillars shaping the future of the House Party Protocol (HPP): AI for Blockchain and Blockchain for&nbsp;AI.</p><p>As artificial intelligence and decentralized infrastructure continue to converge, HPP is emerging as a protocol purpose-built for this new paradigm. From transforming crypto wallets into intelligent, autonomous agents to powering the infrastructure for Small Language Models (SLMs), HPP is redefining how users interact with both AI and blockchain systems.</p><p>This series will examine two key dimensions:</p>  How HPP unlocks intelligent, agent-driven finance through AI-powered DeFi&nbsp;(DeFAI)  How it provides the coordination, verification, and transaction layer for the emerging SLM-powered AI&nbsp;economy  <blockquote>TL;DR: Crypto wallets are evolving from static storage tools into intelligent, AI-powered agents. Fueled by NFTs and SBTs, these wallets now carry identity, access, and behavioral history. With HPP’s AI-native infrastructure, specifically ArenAI and Noösphere, wallets can think, learn, and act autonomously. They’ll interact with CEXs and DEXs, execute DeFi strategies, and manage assets like personal financial agents.</blockquote><p>There was a time when NFTs were all about digital art, and crypto wallets were simply tools for storing tokens, signing transactions, and tracking balances. But today, those humble utilities are transforming into something much more profound.</p><p>In the age of AI, your wallet is no longer just a container — it’s becoming a character. A digital entity with identity, ownership, and access privileges that AI can understand and interact&nbsp;with.</p> The Silent Comeback of&nbsp;NFTs <p>Recently, major financial institutions in Korea, including Woori Bank and Naver Financial, have launched NFT wallet services. This is happening after the initial NFT hype has largely faded. So why&nbsp;now?</p><p>The answer lies in what NFTs and their lesser-known counterpart, SBTs (Soulbound Tokens), are becoming:<br> Foundations of digital identity in the AI-driven Web3&nbsp;economy.</p>  NFTs are no longer just digital collectibles. They’re evolving into carriers of personal history, access rights, and even AI-compatible metadata.  SBTs offer non-transferable identity markers — certifications, experience logs, and trust credentials that form your on-chain reputation.  <p>With these, your wallet becomes you, not just your holdings, but your behavior, access permissions, and digital presence.</p> ArenAI and Noösphere: Giving Intelligence to the&nbsp;Wallet <p>Now that your wallet has an identity, the next frontier is intelligence. This is where HPP’s AI-native infrastructure comes in, led by two key components: ArenAI and Noösphere.</p>  ArenAI turns your wallet into an autonomous agent. It can interpret context, make decisions, and execute transactions on your behalf — think automated staking, DeFi strategies, or even negotiation with other&nbsp;agents.  Noösphere enables off-chain computation, such as AI inference or data processing, to be performed in trusted environments, then verified and reflected on-chain.  <p>Together, they enable a new paradigm: wallets that think, learn, and act. Not just signing transactions, but proactively managing your digital financial life.</p> AI Wallets: The Gateway/Portal to Real&nbsp;DeFAI <p>The true impact lies in what these intelligent wallets unlock:<br> A seamless, AI-powered interface into the world of decentralized finance.</p><p>Your wallet&nbsp;will:</p>  Interact with both CEXs and DEXs via AI agents that move liquidity, execute trades, or hedge risk across platforms.  Access crypto products — such as staking, yield farming, and lending — as if browsing a bank app, with ArenAI suggesting strategies based on real-time market conditions.  <p>This is the true beginning of DeFAI, Decentralized Finance powered by&nbsp;AI.</p> A Wallet That Becomes&nbsp;You <p>NFTs and SBTs give your wallet a personality. ArenAI and Noösphere give it a mind. Together, they form the foundation for the next internet: an agent-driven economy where AI not only supports but participates in markets, governance, and ownership.</p><p>In this new paradigm, your wallet&nbsp;will:</p>  Learn your&nbsp;behavior  Manage your&nbsp;assets  Interact with other&nbsp;agents  Execute trades and participate in economies  <p>It won’t just hold tokens. It will become your digital&nbsp;twin.</p><p>A new infrastructure layer is emerging. In a world where AI models are no longer passive tools but active market participants, we need more than just smart contracts. We need coordination, autonomy, and verifiability at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>This is where HPP is&nbsp;heading.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/1-hpps-role-in-the-ai-driven-crypto-future-from-wallets-to-agents-e61b0397238b">[1] HPP’s Role in the AI-Driven Crypto Future: From Wallets to Agents</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Traditional identity providers allow you to configure access across your organization in a variety of ways, including passwords, multi- factor authentication, or logging in with a google account. Proven Auth adds a fourth option in the form of tamper-proof Verifiable Credentials for a faster, more secure login experience.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-auth/">Proven Auth</a> is a version of <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a> designed to enable single sign-on (SSO) using <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable Credentials.</a> Proven Auth is more than just a way to enable passwordless authentication, it is a system for orchestrating access to applications and resources and managing the lifecycle of a user so that they have access to what they need — and only what they need — when they need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, Proven Auth can be used to issue employees with Verifiable Credentials for access to applications and documents or even to the areas they need access to based on their role within a company. A sales team member would have access to sales resources that an engineer would not. Or when an employee changes teams, their access can be immediately updated in the system’s governance file. If they leave the company, their credentials can easily be revoked, so no more collecting key cards or changing passwords.</p>
 Why login with Verifiable Credentials? 
<p>Verifiable Credentials offer benefits that traditional login systems simply cannot compete with.&nbsp;</p>
 
 They remove the need for logins and passwords and multi-factor authentication. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again, any system that relies on usernames and shared secrets (passwords, security questions, etc) is vulnerable to data breaches and impersonation attempts. 
 They can be verified without phoning home or checking in with a third party. Credentials are verified through cryptography. You can be certain who issued the credential and that the information in the credential hasn’t been tampered with. This means that personal data doesn’t need to be stored in a centralized database to confirm who you are, and you can prove your identity instantly to the system without needing to check in with the issuing party or a third party identity provider. 
 They stop account takeovers and impersonation attacks. Each Verifiable Credential is bound to its owner and stored locally in a digital wallet app on their mobile device. Access to the wallet and device are through biometrics and code. The credential can’t be shared for someone else to use, it can’t be faked, and it can’t be stolen.&nbsp; 
 Easily implement least-privilege access. Verifiable Credentials simplify applying zero-trust approaches to security. With Proven Auth, you configure governance files to orchestrate who has access to what. It’s authentication plus access management. 
 
 How do I integrate Proven Auth into my existing identity provider’s systems?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Once you have Proven, our team at Indicio has created a collection of APIs that will allow you to access the option for Verifiable Credentials the same way that you can access any other option when logging into your systems, such as an existing user account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have integrated Proven Auth into your systems you will see the option to issue credentials to users, who will be able to hold them in a digital identity wallet, and share them back to your system for verification.</p>
<p>A full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwE33TP0rec&amp;t=102s">demonstration of integrating Proven Auth</a> and what the new user experience will look like can be found on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IndicioID">Indicio YouTube Channel.</a></p>
 How do I get started? 
<p>Getting started is as easy as <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reaching out to the team at Indicio</a> to discuss your current systems.</p>
<p>Our team has years of experience creating solutions all around the globe, and will make sure that your team can not only integrate Verifiable Credentials quickly, but is set up to get the most use out of this powerful technology.

<p>We often talk about digital identity as if it’s a universal construct, something that can be standardized, serialized, and slotted into global frameworks. But identity is as cultural as it is technical. And when we ignore that, we risk building trust frameworks that work beautifully on paper and fail spectacularly in practice.</p>



 Identity isn’t one thing 



<p>Digital identity systems often bundle together multiple assumptions: that identity is persistent, singular, owned by the individual, and useful primarily for authorization or reputation. But those assumptions aren’t global truths—they’re artefacts of particular social and cultural histories.</p>



<p>(I had fun researching this post; I wanted to make sure that my anecdotal experience was backed up by people who did proper research. I could do this kind of thing ALL DAY. But I digress…)</p>



<p>In a comparative study of users in Central/Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0165551519879702">Katalin Feher</a> found striking differences in how people conceive of and manage their digital selves. For many Southeast Asian users, their “digital identity” is framed in terms of accounts, i.e., external tools for managing reputation. It’s something outside themselves, instrumental and pragmatic. For Central and Eastern European users, the self–account divide is blurrier; the digital footprint is seen as a real extension of personal identity, warranting careful curation and self-expression. (This paper is not freely available; I purchased a copy.)</p>



<p>Neither is wrong. Each leads to different expectations about how identity systems should behave and who should control them.</p>



 System design reflects cultural norms 



<p>This isn’t just about user attitudes. Cultural values shape system design too. Western identity architectures often assume:</p>



 
 Ownership and individualism – the user holds and controls their identity; 



 Transparency and audit – data trails should be visible and attributable; 



 Consent as the primary safeguard – once informed, the user is responsible. 
 



<p>These align well with societies that prioritize personal autonomy. But in more collectivist or hierarchical cultures, trust may flow through institutions or communities rather than individuals. Reputation may be managed through social harmony, not audit logs. And consent may be implicit, situated, or shaped by expectations of familial or societal duty.</p>



<p>Trying to implement a one-size-fits-all identity system on top of that diversity? That’s how you end up with systems people don’t trust, don’t use, or work around.</p>



<p>One of the biggest hurdles to designing identity standards that reflect cultural diversity is that the standards development community itself isn’t particularly diverse. Let’s look at the IETF as an example, since they publish easily accessible demographic information. According to the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-community-survey-2023/">2023 IETF community survey</a>, nearly 80% of participants came from North America or Europe, and 85% identified as men. Most respondents spoke fluent English—the only language used for meetings, mailing lists, and documents. That streamlines coordination but inevitably filters out who can easily participate. When standards bodies fail to include regional, linguistic, and gender diversity, they naturally produce results that reflect the norms and assumptions of those already at the table.</p>



 When assumptions don’t translate: cultural mismatch in identity systems 



<p>We’ve seen identity systems built around one cultural model fall short when deployed in another. Sometimes, the mismatch causes friction; other times, it leads to outright rejection.</p>



<p>Take digital wallets built around the idea of individual ownership. In many Western contexts, this makes perfect sense: Users expect to control their credentials on personal devices. But in parts of Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, phones are often shared among family members or even communities. Identity systems that assume one person per device can break down quickly in these environments, creating exclusion where access was the goal.</p>



<p>Or consider face recognition. In the U.S. and Europe, it has sparked privacy concerns, but it still sees widespread deployment. In parts of the world where historical surveillance or ethnic targeting is fresh in public memory, even a technically secure facial recognition tool can feel untrustworthy. The issue isn’t the technology, it’s the cultural resonance of how people use the technology.</p>



<p>Then there’s the matter of naming. Systems that require a first and last name in Latin script are common, but not universally applicable. Cultures with patronymics, single names, or character-based scripts often find their identities shoehorned into forms they didn’t design and can’t fully control.</p>



<p>These aren’t just edge cases. They’re warning signs. When we treat digital identity as a neutral infrastructure, we miss the social and cultural weight it carries. And that weight can’t be standardized away.</p>



 We need regionally adaptable trust frameworks 



<p>If we want digital identity to serve people globally, we need frameworks that can flex to local norms while maintaining interoperability. That doesn’t mean abandoning global standards; it means decoupling the mechanism from the assumption set.</p>



<p>A few ideas worth exploring:</p>



 
 Modular trust anchors – Let different regions define who or what counts as a trustworthy issuer. 



 Flexible disclosure models – Don’t assume every system must default to maximum transparency. 



 Interoperable semantics, adaptable governance – Let credential formats be standardized, but leave room for local rules around their issuance and use. 
 



<p>The Levin &amp; Mamlok paper, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/info12020068">Culture and Society in the Digital Age</a>,” warns of a creeping homogenization of experience as digital systems encode particular ways of being into their logic. If we’re not careful, we’ll reproduce the same flattening in digital identity where diversity becomes a bug, not a feature.</p>



 Identity is local. Interop is global. 



<p>We’re building the infrastructure of digital personhood. That’s no small task. But if we want that infrastructure to support real people, not just tidy models, we have to let it speak in more than one voice.</p>



<p>That means more than just designing flexible architectures. It means actively bringing more voices into the rooms where those architectures are shaped. If cultural norms differ (and they do), then we need people who live those differences to help define what trustworthy, usable, and empowering identity systems look like. Otherwise, we risk exporting assumptions, not standards.</p>



<p>Trust doesn’t scale unless it can adapt. And adaptation doesn’t happen without inclusion.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to The Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 What Is Digital Identity, Really? 



 



<p>[00:00:29]<br>Hi there, and welcome back to The Digital Identity Digest. In today’s episode, I want to ask you a simple but profound question:</p>



<p>[00:00:35]<br>What comes to mind when you hear the term digital identity?<br>Do you think of:</p>



 
 Biometrics? 



 Login credentials? 



 A string of JSON? 



 Your social media handle? 
 



<p>[00:00:46]<br>The answer likely depends on several factors:</p>



 
 Where you’re from 



 How old you are 



 How tech-savvy you feel 
 



<p>[00:00:52]<br>Cultural context plays a big role here.</p>



<p>[00:00:57]<br>We often talk about digital identity like it’s universal—something we can standardize, serialize, and fit into tidy global frameworks.</p>



<p>[00:01:08]<br>But identity is as cultural as it is technical. Ignoring that can lead to trust frameworks that look great on paper but fail in practice—especially when so-called edge cases were never edge at all.</p>



 



 Unpacking Assumptions About Identity 



 



<p>[00:01:23]<br>Let’s start with a key reminder: identity isn’t one thing.</p>



<p>[00:01:26]<br>Most digital identity systems are based on a set of unspoken assumptions:</p>



 
 Identity is persistent 



 It’s singular 



 It’s controlled by the individual 



 It exists mainly for authorization or reputation 
 



<p>[00:01:42]<br>But none of these are universal truths—they are cultural artifacts. They reflect the norms of specific regions, especially the US and Europe, where many of these systems originated.</p>



<p>[00:01:54]<br>I’ve seen these cultural assumptions in standards work and tech deployments. But I wanted to back that up with research—not just anecdotes.</p>



 



 Meet the Research: Catalyn Fair 



 



<p>[00:02:07]<br>Enter Catalyn Fair (and fingers crossed I’m pronouncing that correctly).</p>



<p>[00:02:12]<br>Fair conducted a comparative study of digital identity and online self-management, focusing on Central and Eastern Europe vs. Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>[00:02:23]<br>The study included:</p>



 
 60 in-depth interviews 



 Equal focus on students and business leaders 



 Solid, qualitative insights 
 



<p>[00:02:33]<br>What she found wasn’t subtle.</p>



<p>[00:02:33]<br>In Southeast Asia, digital identity is often seen as external—a tool for:</p>



 
 Managing reputation 



 Accessing services 
 



<p>It’s instrumental, not personal.</p>



<p>[00:02:49]<br>But in Central and Eastern Europe, identity is seen as deeply connected to the self.<br>Your digital presence isn’t just metadata—it’s:</p>



 
 An extension of who you are 



 Something you curate and express 



 Part of your personal narrative 
 



<p>[00:03:05]<br>Neither model is better. But each one shapes user expectations—and design choices.</p>



 



 Design Reflects Culture, Too 



 



<p>[00:03:17]<br>Cultural values don’t just affect users—they show up in system architecture.</p>



<p>[00:03:23]<br>Western identity models often assume:</p>



 
 The individual owns and controls their identity 



 Transparency is inherently good 



 Informed consent makes systems trustworthy 
 



<p>[00:03:43]<br>These assumptions work well in societies that value personal autonomy and individual accountability.</p>



<p>[00:03:54]<br>But in collectivist or hierarchical cultures, trust flows differently:</p>



 
 Through institutions or family 



 Reputation relies on social harmony 



 Consent may be implicit or relational 
 



<p>[00:04:16]<br>So when a single identity model is deployed globally, friction is inevitable.</p>



 



 Who’s in the Room? 



 



<p>[00:04:31]<br>Let’s talk about the people building these systems.</p>



<p>[00:04:35]<br>One challenge is that standards development communities lack diversity.</p>



<p>[00:04:46]<br>Take the IETF—the Internet Engineering Task Force:</p>



 
 In 2023, ~80% of participants were from North America or Europe 



 85% identified as male 



 Most were fluent in English (the sole language used in IETF spaces) 
 



<p>[00:05:17]<br>This streamlines communication—but filters out valuable perspectives.</p>



<p>[00:05:29]<br>So even well-meaning people design standards based on their own assumptions.</p>



<p>[00:05:34]<br>We’ve seen how badly that can go.</p>



 



 Real-World Design Conflicts 



 



<p>[00:05:45]<br>Let’s take a closer look at where systems break.</p>



<p>[00:05:50]<br>Digital wallets in the West:</p>



 
 Built around individual control 



 One person, one device 
 



<p>[00:06:00]<br>But in parts of Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa:</p>



 
 Phones are shared across families and communities 



 Exclusive smartphone access isn’t guaranteed 
 



<p>[00:06:09]<br>If your system assumes one phone per person—it fails immediately.</p>



<p>[00:06:23]<br>Facial recognition sparks privacy debates in the US and Europe.<br>But in regions with a history of surveillance or ethnic targeting, it’s actively distrusted, regardless of technical safeguards.</p>



<p>[00:06:55]<br>Then there’s the perennial issue of naming.</p>



<p>[00:06:59]<br>Many systems require:</p>



 
 First and last names 



 In Latin characters 
 



<p>[00:07:08]<br>But that’s not globally applicable. Consider:</p>



 
 Cultures with single names 



 Languages using non-Latin scripts 



 Regions where names reflect lineage or patronymics 
 



<p>[00:07:17]<br>Forcing conformity erases identity and damages trust.</p>



 



 Designing for Cultural Flexibility 



 



<p>[00:07:50]<br>So—what do we do about all this?</p>



<p>[00:07:51]<br>We need regionally adaptable trust frameworks—systems that flex to local norms while preserving interoperability.</p>



<p>[00:07:59]<br>That doesn’t mean abandoning global standards.<br>It means designing with flexibility.</p>



<p>[00:08:11]<br>What might that look like?</p>



 
 Modular trust anchors<br>Let regions define trusted issuers—whether they’re governments, nonprofits, or private entities. 



 Flexible disclosure<br>Enable minimal, selective proof. Don’t force full data dumps for basic verification. 



 Standardized semantics + localized governance<br>Agree on technical formats, but allow cultural variation in credential rules, issuers, and legal weight. 
 



<p>[00:08:58]<br>These aren’t just ideas—they’re already being explored in:</p>



 
 Decentralized identity 



 Verifiable credentials 



 Wallet interoperability 
 



<p>But they need cultural awareness to succeed.</p>



 



 Digital Identity as Cultural Infrastructure 



 



<p>[00:09:12]<br>A great paper by Levin and Mamlock—Culture and Society in the Digital Age—makes an important point:</p>



<p>[00:09:27]<br>Digital systems don’t just provide tools.<br>They encode worldviews.</p>



<p>[00:09:34]<br>Without care, we end up with flattened experiences—forcing everyone into one digital model.</p>



<p>[00:09:43]<br>If diversity becomes a bug to work around, instead of a feature, we’re building the wrong world.</p>



<p>[00:09:53]<br>We are designing the infrastructure of digital personhood.</p>



<p>[00:09:58]<br>If that’s going to support real people—not just tidy models—we need systems that speak in more than one voice.</p>



<p>[00:10:06]<br>And that means more than just flexible tech.</p>



<p>We need:</p>



 
 Broader participation 



 Cultural representation 



 Inclusion at the table 
 



<p>[00:10:24]<br>Otherwise, we’re not building local systems—we’re exporting our assumptions.</p>



<p>[00:10:30]<br>And without cultural adaptation, trust doesn’t scale.</p>



<p>[00:10:39]<br>Something to think about.</p>

<p>Fast-growing fintechs in the U.S. must balance speed and compliance. This article explores how edge-based KYC and automated risk workflows can help fintechs meet regulatory requirements, avoid fines, and scale onboarding without adding friction.</p>
<p>U.S.-based fintechs have transformed consumer and business finance with on-demand services, embedded payments, and automated lending. But behind the innovation lies a growing compliance challenge: Know Your Customer (KYC) obligations that are intensifying under federal scrutiny.</p>
<p>Regulators like FinCEN, the CFPB, and state-level authorities are tightening expectations on identity verification, fraud prevention, and ongoing due diligence. Meanwhile, fintechs face pressure to onboard users in seconds – not hours or days.</p>
<p>So how can fintechs scale while staying compliant? The answer lies in smarter KYC infrastructure.</p>
 The Growing KYC Burden 
<p>Whether you’re offering neobanking, investing, crypto, or credit services, KYC is no longer a one-time check. Fintechs are expected to:</p>
 
 Validate identity using reliable, independent sources 
 Screen for sanctions, PEPs, and adverse media 
 Re-verify identity during account updates or flagged behaviour 
 Retain data for audits while respecting user privacy 
 
<p>But many fast-moving teams are still using:</p>
 
 Patchwork vendor stacks 
 Manual data review 
 Legacy cloud-based KYC providers that store sensitive PII offshore 
 
<p>This results in high drop-off rates, operational inefficiencies, and regulatory exposure.</p>
 Why Legacy KYC Systems Fail Fast-Moving Fintechs 
<p>Latency: Traditional cloud verification introduces delays that can kill user signups</p>
<p>Security Risk: Cloud-based systems increase attack surface and risk data residency violations</p>
<p>Scalability Limits: As user volume grows, manual processes don’t scale without adding staff</p>
<p>Lack of Customization: Pre-set workflows don’t align with dynamic product onboarding paths</p>
 iComply: KYC Built for Fintech Scale 
<p>iComply offers a modular, edge-first KYC solution designed to meet U.S. regulatory requirements while enabling seamless growth. Here’s how:</p>
 1. Edge Computing for Identity Verification 
<p>Identity documents and biometrics are processed locally on the user’s device before encryption—reducing latency, improving conversion rates, and supporting GDPR and U.S. privacy laws.</p>
 2. Real-Time Risk Screening 
<p>Automate checks for:</p>
 
 Sanctions lists (OFAC, UN, etc.) 
 PEP and adverse media 
 Liveness and document forgery detection 
 
 3. Configurable Workflows 
<p>Adapt KYC flows based on:</p>
 
 Risk profile (e.g., domestic vs international) 
 Use case (e.g., deposit, credit, crypto) 
 Triggered events (e.g., account update, large transaction) 
 
 4. Automated Decisioning + Escalation 
<p>Define clear rules for auto-approval, rejection, or escalation. Eliminate manual reviews for low-risk users while flagging suspicious ones instantly.</p>
 5. Privacy-First Data Governance 
<p>Support U.S. data residency with options for:</p>
 
 U.S.-based cloud or on-premise deployment 
 Encrypted audit logs 
 Consent management and user data controls 
 
 Case Study: Embedded Lending App 
<p>A Series B fintech offering embedded lending used iComply to streamline borrower onboarding. Results included:</p>
 
 30% faster KYC completion time 
 41% increase in sign-up conversion 
 Seamless integration with their existing fraud detection tools 
 
 Regulatory Considerations for U.S. Fintechs in 2025 
 
 FinCEN Guidance Updates: Closer scrutiny of beneficial ownership checks and non-face-to-face onboarding 
 CFPB Data Rights Proposals: Increased emphasis on consent, data sharing transparency, and consumer control 
 State-by-State Regulation: Some states, like New York and California, impose stricter KYC and fraud compliance frameworks 
 
 What to Do Next 
<p>Fintechs that want to grow fast can’t afford to treat compliance as a bottleneck. By rethinking your KYC architecture, you can:</p>
 
 Reduce friction during onboarding 
 Enhance fraud prevention 
 Stay ahead of audits and enforcement 
 
<p>Book a strategy call with iComply to learn how our edge-based KYC platform helps U.S. fintechs scale securely, stay compliant, and win user trust.</p>

<p>Browser extensions can be fantastic tools, enhancing your web experience from blocking ads to managing passwords. But sometimes, they can cause issues like slowing down your browser, clashing with websites, or even raising security concerns. If you’re looking to regain control of your browser or simply want to declutter, this Herond article will show you how to disable a Browser Extension: Quick Tips for Beginners. Let’s dive into some useful advice to get you started!</p>



 What Does Disabling a Browser Extension Mean? 



 Simple definition 



<p>Disabling a browser extension means you’re simply turning it off without uninstalling it. It stops running and affects your browser, but stays installed so you can easily reactivate it later. This gives you flexibility to manage your browser’s performance and security on the fly.</p>


 
 


 Benefits 



<p>Knowing how to disable a browser extension offers several benefits. It often improves browser speed by reducing background processes, enhances security by deactivating potentially risky extensions, and <a href="https://blog.herond.org/what-does-it-mean-when-your-browser-crashes-out/">simplifies browse</a> by decluttering your toolbar and preventing website conflicts. It’s a quick way to troubleshoot and keep your browser efficient.</p>



 Step-by-Step Guide to disable a Browser Extension 



 Step 1: Access the Extensions Menu 



 How to find 



<p>The first step to managing your browser’s add-ons is knowing how to disable a <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/category/extensions">browser extension</a> by finding its dedicated menu. On Chrome, you typically navigate through the Menu (three dots) in the top right, then hover over “More Tools,” and finally click “Extensions.” For Firefox users, you’ll find it by clicking the Menu (three lines), then selecting “Add-ons and themes.” Herond Browser and other Chromium-based browsers usually follow a similar path to Chrome.</p>


 
 


 Tip 



<p>For a quicker way to access your extensions menu, consider using keyboard shortcuts. For instance, on Chrome and many other Chromium-based browsers, you can often jump directly to the extensions page by pressing Ctrl + Shift + E (or Cmd + Shift + E on Mac). This little trick can save you time and make the process of learning how to do it even more efficient, letting you manage your add-ons with just a few keystrokes.</p>



 Step 2: Toggle Off the Extension 



<p>Once you’re in the extensions menu, how to disable a browser extension is simple. Just find the extension you wish to turn off and click its toggle switch. This immediately deactivates it, stopping it from running in the background while keeping it installed for future use.</p>



 Safety note 



<p>A crucial safety tip when managing extensions is to be aware of their permissions. Before disabling an extension, review the access it has been granted (e.g., Browse history, site data). Understanding these permissions is vital for your online security and privacy.</p>



 Step 3: Verify the Change 



<p>After you’ve toggled off an extension, it’s smart to verify the change to ensure it’s no longer active. To do this, simply browse to a website where you previously noticed the extension’s effect, or open a new tab and observe your browser’s performance. This quick check confirms that you’ve successfully learned how to disable a browser extension and that it’s no longer interfering with your <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-create-web-shortcut-on-desktop/">browse experience</a> or consuming resources.</p>



 Tip 



<p>Occasionally, an extension might not fully deactivate immediately after toggling it off. If you’ve verified the change and the extension still seems active, a simple restart of your browser can often resolve the issue. Close all browser windows, then reopen your browser. This action forces all processes to shut down and restart, ensuring the extension’s disabled state is fully applied, making your effort to learn how to disable a browser extension complete and effective.</p>



 Quick Tips for Beginners to disable Extensions Safely 



 Tip 1 



<p>When you’re trying to figure out which extension might be causing problems, like slowing down your browser or crashing a website, it’s best to disable one extension at a time. This method lets you pinpoint the exact culprit. After disabling one, test your browser to see if the issue is resolved. If not, re-enable it and move on to the next. This systematic approach makes learning how to disable a browser extension for troubleshooting much more efficient.</p>



 Tip 2 



<p>Before you toggle off an extension, take a moment to review its permissions. Extensions often ask for broad access to your browser data, history, or even the ability to change website content. Understanding these permissions helps you know what the extension was capable of doing. This knowledge is key for maintaining your <a href="https://blog.herond.org/optimize-your-website-for-rapid-traffic-growth/">online privacy and security</a>, and it’s a smart step when learning how to disable a browser extension.</p>









 Tip 3 



<p>It’s a good habit to keep a list of disabled extensions for future reference. You might disable an extension thinking you won’t need it, only to realize later that a specific website or workflow depends on it. A simple note or a mental list of what you’ve turned off can save you time and frustration if you need to reactivate something or understand why a certain feature isn’t working. This tip makes managing how to disable a browser extension a more organized process.</p>



 Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them 



 Pitfall 1: Accidentally removing it instead of disabling 



<p>A common mistake when learning how to disable a browser extension is accidentally removing or uninstalling it instead of just disabling. This happens when users click the “Remove” or “Uninstall” button instead of the toggle switch. The solution is simple: always double-check the button or toggle you’re about to click. Disabling keeps the extension installed for future use, whereas removing it means you’d have to re-download and re-install it if you ever change your mind.</p>


 
 


 Pitfall 2: Performance drop after disabling 



<p>Sometimes, even after you’ve learned how to disable a browser extension, you might still notice a performance issue or a lingering effect. This “performance drop” isn’t necessarily because of the disabled extension, but could be due to leftover data. The solution here is to clear your browser’s cache and cookies after disabling extensions, especially if you’re troubleshooting speed problems. This helps refresh your browser’s data, ensuring that any residual effects of the inactive extension are completely gone and your browser runs smoothly.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Learning how to disable a browser extension empowers you to control your online experience. This simple skill is vital for troubleshooting performance, enhancing security, or just decluttering your browser.</p>



<p>By following quick tips – accessing the menu, toggling off, verifying changes, and applying best practices – you, you ensure a smooth, safe, and tailored browse journey. Managing extensions regularly is a small effort that yields big rewards: a faster, more secure, and more enjoyable online life.</p>

<p>Accidentally closing a vital browser tab is a common frustration, often leading to lost work or information. But don’t panic! Herond knows these mishaps happen. This quick guide will show you how to restore closed tabs safely without losing data. This also helps ensuring your valuable content is always just a few clicks away. Say goodbye to lost tabs and browse with peace of mind!</p>



 Understanding Closed Tabs and Data Safety 



 What happens when a tab closes unexpectedly 



<p>When a browser tab closes unexpectedly, whether due to a crash, a system freeze, or an accidental click, your immediate thought is often about lost data. In such scenarios, the browser typically doesn’t immediately delete the session information. Instead, it temporarily holds data related to your open tabs, hoping to facilitate recovery. This temporary storage is key to understanding how to restore closed tab content. It also gives you a crucial window to recover your work or browse session before it’s permanently gone.</p>









 Why safety matters 



<p>The safety of your data is paramount when dealing with closed tabs. When you’re trying to figure out how to restore closed tab information, it’s vital to ensure you’re not inadvertently causing data leaks, especially if the tab contains sensitive personal or financial details. Furthermore, improper recovery attempts could lead to overwriting valuable saved sessions or browser data. Prioritizing safe restoration methods protects your privacy and ensures that the recovery process doesn’t create new problems, keeping your information secure and intact.</p>



 Step-by-Step Guide on how to Restore Closed Tab Safely 



 Step 1: Use Browser’s Built-In Restore Feature 



 How to access 



<p>The quickest way to learn how to restore closed tab is by using your browser’s built-in feature. For most browsers, a simple keyboard shortcut does the trick: pressing Ctrl + Shift + T (or Cmd + Shift + T on Mac) will instantly reopen the last closed tab. If you need to go further back, browsers like Firefox offer a “Recently Closed Tabs” option within their History menu, allowing you to pick specific tabs from a list. This native functionality is designed for rapid recovery and is usually your first, best option.</p>


 
 


 Safety tip 



<p>When attempting to restore closed tabs, a crucial safety tip is to check for <a href="https://blog.herond.org/what-does-it-mean-when-your-browser-crashes-out/">recent backups</a> – not just of your tabs, but potentially your browser profile if you use synchronization features. While the built-in restore function handles most recent closures, understanding how to restore closed tab data from older sessions might involve looking into your browser’s history or sync settings. Ensuring a browser profile backup or regularly syncing your browser data can act as a safety net, protecting against permanent data loss even in more severe scenarios like a browser crash.</p>



 Step 2: Check Session History 



 Guide to finding history 



<p>If the quick restore shortcut doesn’t bring back your tab, the next step is to dive into browser’s session history. For <a href="https://herond.org/">Herond</a>, you can access your full Browse history by pressing <code>Ctrl + H</code> (or <code>Cmd + Y</code> on Mac) or via the Menu -&gt; History. Chrome users can find similar functionality in their History tab or the Timeline feature, which chronologically lists past activities. This detailed history allows you to scroll back and locate the specific tab you accidentally closed, even if it was from a previous Browse session.</p>









 Tip 



<p>When regularly checking your session history to learn how to restore closed tab content, it’s a good practice to clear old data to avoid clutter. Over time, your browser history can become very extensive, making it harder to find what you need quickly. Periodically clearing Browse data, especially older entries you no longer need, can significantly streamline your history logs. This helps ensure that when you do need to restore a tab, your recent, relevant sessions are easier to pinpoint and recover efficiently.</p>



 Step 3: Restore from Saved Sessions 



 How to use session managers or extensions 



<p>Beyond browser history, knowing how to restore closed tab sessions becomes even more robust with dedicated session managers or extensions. Tools like <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko">Session Buddy</a> (for Chrome) allow you to save entire Browse sessions, including multiple windows and tabs, as a single file. This means if your browser crashes or you accidentally close everything, you can simply load a previously saved session. These extensions offer a powerful backup solution, giving you peace of mind that your complex Browse setups are always recoverable.</p>



 Safety 



<p>While session managers are incredibly useful for learning how to restore closed tab data, it’s crucial to prioritize safety: avoid untrusted extensions. Always download session management tools only from official browser web stores (like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons) and check reviews, ratings, and developer credibility. Installing unverified extensions can expose your browser data to security risks, including malware or data leaks. Prioritize your digital safety by choosing well-vetted and reputable tools to manage your precious browsing sessions.</p>



 Step 4: Prevent Data Loss with Auto-Save 



<p>To proactively prevent data loss and ensure you rarely need to figure out how to restore closed tab content, enable your browser’s auto-save features. Many browsers and web applications offer automatic saving of form data, tabs, or even entire sessions. Make sure these settings are activated in your browser’s preferences. This small step creates continuous backups of your active work, significantly reducing the impact of accidental closures or crashes by automatically preserving your progress.</p>



 Tip 



<p>Beyond auto-save, a robust tip for preventing data loss is to regularly export session data. Some browser extensions or built-in features allow you to save your entire current Browse session (all open tabs and windows) as a file. Periodically exporting this data to a secure location provides an independent backup. This means even if your browser’s internal recovery fails, you still have a separate file to restore closed tab groups, offering an extra layer of security for your valuable <a href="https://blog.herond.org/top-fast-secure-and-best-web-browsers-to-use/">browse sessions</a>.</p>



 Top Tips to Ensure Safe Tab Restoration 



 Tip 1: Update your browser to avoid bugs 



<p>To ensure safe tab restoration, always update your browser to avoid bugs. Outdated browser versions can have vulnerabilities or glitches that might hinder proper tab recovery, or even compromise your data. Keeping your browser software current ensures you have the latest security patches and functionality, making the process of learning how to restore closed tab content more reliable and secure. Regular updates are a simple, yet effective, preventative measure.</p>









 Tip 2: Use incognito mode for sensitive tabs before restoring 



<p>For sensitive information, a smart safety practice is to use incognito mode for sensitive tabs before restoring. If you know a tab contains private data, opening it in incognito/private mode ensures its session isn’t saved to your regular Browse history or cache. This can be particularly useful if you’re ever in a situation where you need to learn how to restore closed tab content in a shared or public environment, as it prevents sensitive data from being inadvertently exposed or saved persistently.</p>



 Tip 3: Back up bookmarks regularly 



<p>While not directly about real-time tab restoration, a vital tip for long-term data safety is to back up bookmarks regularly. Even if you master how to restore closed tab sessions, important pages you visit frequently should be bookmarked. Regularly exporting or syncing your bookmarks ensures that if a severe browser issue prevents session recovery, your most valuable links are still saved. This acts as a robust safety net for your essential web resources.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Accidentally closing a crucial browser tab is frustrating, but knowing how to restore closed tabs safely without losing data means you don’t have to panic. By using your browser’s built-in features, checking history, and leveraging smart extensions, you can quickly recover valuable work. Proactively prevent data loss with auto-save and regular backups, and prioritize safety by updating your browser and being mindful of extension permissions. These tips ensure a seamless, secure, and enjoyable Browse experience, keeping your data always within reach.</p>

 🪄Innovation and New Technology Developments 



 



<p>Italy Modernizes Civil Services and Digital Wallet with National Integration and Offline Access</p>



<p>Italy is advancing its digital identity infrastructure with significant updates to its national digital services. Over 700 municipalities have joined the centralized National Archive of Civil Status (ANSC), replacing paper-based record-keeping with a unified digital platform for civil documents. Synchronization with the National Registry of the Resident Population ensures data accuracy and streamlines administrative workflows. Concurrently, Italy’s “IO” app now supports offline access to its digital wallet, allowing users to retrieve essential documents like driving licenses and health cards without an internet connection. With nearly 90 million digital identities issued and robust growth in digital document adoption, Italy is ahead of its National Recovery and Resilience Plan targets. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202507/italy-gets-offline-digital-wallet-access-as-country-advances-digitalization?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--EhejpP-DJoIdVyFYvvhEYiEQmuuoHZ_inGkXjP6sExOWjy_d6qBqBlDxxMAiUQOh__a6m">(Source)</a></p>

<p>South Africa Launches Upgraded Identity Verification System With Faster, More Reliable Access to NPR</p>



<p>South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs has launched an upgraded identity verification platform that allows both government and private sector entities to verify identities against the National Population Register (NPR). Previously plagued by high failure rates due to underinvestment, the new system now handles over 180,000 daily transactions with minimal error and sub-second response times. The justice sector and several private users have already transitioned, benefiting from improved reliability and efficiency. While some users were unprepared for the switch despite prior consultations, the Department is offering a grace period until October to optimize usage and reduce costs, crediting back overpayments based on off-peak verification adjustments. <a href="https://techafricanews.com/2025/07/07/south-africa-modernises-identity-verification-tackles-system-failures-with-new-platform/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9AcPmS6M7PouHHT7-YBBPeS9LeulsWJ5XjCam_W1Tjye7ZIC51VltsRjatJxvGMZtzc_jS">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Germany Urges Apple and Google to Remove DeepSeek Over GDPR Violations and Data Transfers to China</p>



<p>Germany’s data protection authority has requested Apple and Google to block the Chinese chatbot app DeepSeek from their app stores, citing unlawful data transfers to China and violations of GDPR. The Berlin Data Protection Commissioner argued that DeepSeek fails to provide adequate safeguards for user data, especially given Chinese authorities’ extensive access rights. The app had already been banned in Italy earlier this year for similar concerns, and investigations are ongoing in several other EU countries. Despite a recent privacy policy update, DeepSeek remains under scrutiny for opaque data retention practices and lack of user protections equivalent to those in the EU. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/deepseek-faces-ban-in-germany-as-privacy-watchdog-reports-the-app-to-google-and-apple-as-illegal-content?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Nq70wR3hz92SgvzeicgX3SVZTGLAxw_U41RLc7VtNk7iKfCO3oWZ00cj5vsDHUykMTpQ4">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Stanford Paper Critiques Age Assurance Laws as Suppressive and Fragmented Regulatory Measures</p>



<p>In a new paper from Stanford Law School, legal scholar Eric Goldman critiques online age assurance laws, arguing they amount to “segregate-and-suppress” legislation that undermines privacy, innovation, and free expression. Goldman challenges the fragmented regulatory landscape and the terminology underpinning age assurance technologies, claiming such laws expose users to surveillance and economic harms. However, critics note that his argument downplays the risks of unrestricted access to harmful content and seems aligned with the stance of industry groups like NetChoice. The paper ultimately favors parental oversight and digital literacy over legal mandates, though it has been criticized for overlooking the practical and ethical concerns driving age assurance efforts. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202507/respected-legal-authority-frames-age-assurance-legislation-as-segregation-suppression?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87Rsozl63vNzLLjQA7ctkZbywkY0hR9qCl-OlvF4cgTwV1bySN4mO4sDRnETAyaMoke1vL">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Healthline Faces Record CCPA Settlement Over Misuse of Sensitive Health Data and Consent Failures</p>



<p>Healthline Media has agreed to a $1.55 million settlement with the California Attorney General for alleged violations of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Unfair Competition Law—the largest CCPA-related settlement to date. The investigation found that Healthline continued to share user data with advertisers for targeted ads even after users opted out, particularly revealing sensitive health-related information based on visited pages. Additional violations included inadequate contract terms with ad partners and non-functional cookie consent tools. As part of the settlement, Healthline must implement corrective measures, including fixing opt-out mechanisms, halting the sharing of health-related article titles, and maintaining a robust CCPA compliance program. The settlement awaits court approval. <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/california-ag-healthline-ccpa-settlement/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9AcPmS6M7PouHHT7-YBBPeS9LeulsWJ5XjCam_W1Tjye7ZIC51VltsRjatJxvGMZtzc_jS">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Spain Arrests Five in $542 Million Crypto Fraud Tied to Global Investment Scam</p>



<p>Five individuals have been arrested in Spain for allegedly orchestrating a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded over 5,000 victims—100 of them from Switzerland—out of approximately $542 million. Coordinated by the Spanish Guardia Civil with support from Europol and law enforcement in the US, France, and Estonia, the operation involved arrests in the Canary Islands and Madrid. The suspects are believed to have used a global network to collect and move funds through various financial channels, including crypto transfers. Authorities also linked the group to a complex banking and corporate structure based in Hong Kong. The case is one of Spain’s largest crypto fraud investigations and follows recent international crackdowns on similar scams. <a href="https://fintechnews.ch/fintechspain/spain-crypto-investment-fraud-europol-arrests/77123/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_47aar0ufxldN8lVyCXG_g_T8CN4LP8I0Euf7fYO4O_HOoHpsP7mGz29UF72Gy3DmB6xfq">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Chile Cracks Down on Tren de Aragua’s $13.5 Million Crypto-Fueled Laundering Network</p>



<p>Chilean authorities have dismantled a major money laundering operation linked to the Venezuelan criminal group Tren de Aragua, which allegedly funneled over $13.5 million through bank accounts and cryptocurrency to multiple countries, including the U.S., Venezuela, Colombia, and Spain. The crackdown, which resulted in 52 arrests, uncovered that the laundered funds stemmed from crimes such as human trafficking, extortion, drug trafficking, and homicides. Experts note that Tren de Aragua has adopted crypto-based laundering tactics from Mexican cartels to obscure financial trails. The organization has previously been designated a Transnational Criminal Organization by the U.S. Treasury’s OFAC for its expansive illicit operations across the Americas. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chile-cracks-down-on-tren-de-araguas-crypto-money-laundering-scheme/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_47aar0ufxldN8lVyCXG_g_T8CN4LP8I0Euf7fYO4O_HOoHpsP7mGz29UF72Gy3DmB6xfq">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Meta Challenges EU Fine Over “Pay or Consent” Model in Ongoing Data Privacy Dispute</p>



<p>Meta plans to appeal a €200 million fine issued by the European Union for allegedly violating the Digital Markets Act through its “pay or consent” model, which offers users a choice between paying for ad-free access or consenting to data tracking. The European Commission found this approach failed to provide an equivalent alternative without personalized data use, deeming it non-compliant with EU rules. Meta contests the ruling, citing prior legal precedent supporting subscription-based models. The case marks another chapter in Meta’s ongoing conflict with European regulators over data privacy, following earlier fines and legal disputes concerning ad targeting and transatlantic data transfers. <a href="https://dmarketforces.com/meta-to-appeal-e200m-eu-fine-over-data-privacy-concerns/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_47aar0ufxldN8lVyCXG_g_T8CN4LP8I0Euf7fYO4O_HOoHpsP7mGz29UF72Gy3DmB6xfq">(Source)</a></p>

 4 Arrested in £440M M&amp;S Cyber Attacks; Are They Members of Scattered Spider?  
<p>On July 10, 2025, the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) announced a major breakthrough in its investigation into a series of devastating cyber attacks, arresting four individuals from their homes in the West Midlands and London. The suspects face a litany of serious charges, including Computer Misuse Act offenses, blackmail, money laundering, and, notably, "participating in the activities of an organized crime group."</p> 
<p>While the NCA confirmed the suspects' involvement in an organized syndicate, they did not officially name the group. This has led to widespread speculation, and the cybersecurity community is asking one major question: are they members of Scattered Spider? While an official confirmation is pending, it's widely believed that the group is responsible. The tactics used in the £440 million retail heist, specifically the reliance on advanced social engineering ploys, are a known signature of the Scattered Spider hacker group.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s Take: Whether or not these four individuals are confirmed members, the profile of this attack and the suspects themselves paint a vivid picture of the threat that groups like Scattered Spider represent. The suspects are incredibly young, ranging from just 17 to 20 years old, which aligns perfectly with the known demographics of this new generation of digital native cybercriminals.</p> 
 How Young, Native-Speaking Groups Outmaneuver Traditional Defenses  
<p>For years, enterprise security has been architected to defend against a specific type of threat: sophisticated, often foreign, nation-state actors. The defense playbook was designed to spot technical vulnerabilities and hunt for clues of foreign intrusion, like language errors in phishing emails or unusual geopolitical motives. But today, the most dangerous threat isn't a foreign government; it's a teenager in a Western country who sounds exactly like one of your employees on the phone.</p> 
<p>The attackers in groups like Scattered Spider are shockingly young, often between 16 and 22 years old. They are true digital natives who have grown up in a world of social media, online gaming, and instant communication. This gives them more than just technical skill; it provides them with an intuitive grasp of online psychology and a mastery of social manipulation that older, more traditional hacking groups often lack. They don't operate in rigid hierarchies but as fluid, decentralized collectives, working together like a gig-economy startup for cybercrime.</p> 
<p>Their single most effective weapon is the English language. Unlike many foreign adversaries, these young attackers are native speakers. When they call an IT help desk to impersonate an employee, there are no accents, stilted phrases, or cultural missteps to raise alarm bells. They can build rapport, express urgency, and navigate corporate jargon flawlessly, weaponizing trust to turn your most helpful employees into unwitting accomplices. Their process is a masterclass in psychological manipulation:</p> 
  
  Reconnaissance: They scour social media like LinkedIn to find a target employee, gathering personal details like their role, colleagues, and even recent projects.  
  Impersonation: Armed with this information, they call the IT help desk, often during a busy shift change. They create a sense of urgency – "I'm locked out and have a huge presentation in five minutes!" – to pressure the agent.  
  Exploitation: They skillfully answer security questions using the data they’ve collected and trick the well-meaning agent into resetting credentials or even enrolling a new MFA device.  
  
<p>This operational model is fundamentally different from that of a nation-state. These groups are not driven by ideology; they are financially motivated, seeking maximum profit with calculated efficiency. This agile and opportunistic structure makes them incredibly difficult to track. They will focus on one industry, refine their social engineering tactics for that sector's specific culture, extract as much money as possible, and then move on to the next target. The security playbooks written for yesterday's threats are simply not equipped to handle this new breed of adversary.</p> 
 How to Stop Scattered Spider: Defeating the Gen-Z Hacker with Identity Assurance  
<p>Fighting a new breed of predator requires a new class of defense. Probabilistic security has failed. The only way to stop a Scattered Spider attack is to move to a deterministic model of security; one that provides absolute certainty about a user's identity.</p> 
<p>HYPR dismantles the Scattered Spider playbook piece by piece:</p> 
  
  Eliminate the Attack Vector with Phishing-Resistant MFA: The primary weapon of Scattered Spider is credential phishing. HYPR Authenticate replaces passwords with FIDO-certified, passkey-based authentication. Authentication is bound to the true domain of the service, making it impossible for AiTM tools like Evilginx to function. If a user is lured to a fake site, the authentication will simply fail. There is no credential to steal and no session cookie to hijack. The attack is stopped before it begins.<br><br>  
  Secure the Help Desk with Deterministic Identity Verification: The help desk is Scattered Spider's favorite entry point. HYPR Affirm slams that door shut. To perform a sensitive action like a credential reset, the user must prove who they are, not just what they know. Affirm uses a multi-layered, configurable workflow that can include verifying a government-issued ID, a biometric selfie match, and other deterministic factors. A scammer on the phone cannot fake their way through a live facial recognition scan. We help you verify the person, not the account.  
  
<p>Scattered Spider thrives on uncertainty, manipulation, and the fundamental flaws of legacy identity security. HYPR provides certainty.</p> 
<p>Don't wait to become Scattered Spider's next headline. It's time to move beyond security that hopes it's right to a system that knows.</p>

  EU VASPs face strict Travel Rule enforcement in 2025. This guide explains how to meet MiCA and FATF requirements using iComply’s KYT and KYC tools—without compromising user experience or privacy.

<p>With MiCA implementation and FATF enforcement gaining momentum, VASPs in the EU must now implement transaction-level monitoring (KYT) and comply with the Travel Rule. This article explores how combining edge-secure KYC with smart KYT can enable full compliance while preserving user privacy and minimizing operational drag.</p>
 
 For Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) operating in the European Union, 2025 is a regulatory inflection point. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) has taken effect, and enforcement of the FATF Travel Rule is no longer theoretical – it’s here. 
<p>VASPs must now verify the identity of senders and receivers, screen transactions for risk, and transmit originator and beneficiary data across platforms and jurisdictions. At the same time, they must do so without compromising user experience or exposing themselves to privacy risks.</p>
<p>It’s a tall order – but it’s achievable with the right technology architecture and compliance strategy.</p>
 The Travel Rule in the EU: What’s Required 
<p>The FATF Travel Rule (Recommendation 16) and the EU’s corresponding measures require VASPs to:</p>
 
 Identify both the sender and receiver in crypto transactions above a certain threshold (typically €1,000) 
 Transmit originator and beneficiary information to the receiving VASP 
 Screen transactions for sanctions, PEPs, and suspicious activity 
 Retain records and provide them to regulators on request 
 
<p>In many EU jurisdictions, this is now mandated under national transpositions of MiCA and AMLD.</p>
 Key Compliance Challenges for VASPs 
<p>1. Identity Verification in Real Time VASPs must verify natural persons and legal entities at onboarding—often within seconds—to avoid losing users. Traditional KYC platforms relying on cloud processing introduce latency and risk.</p>
<p>2. Transaction Monitoring (KYT) Legacy AML platforms weren’t built to analyze blockchain transactions. VASPs need tools that:</p>
 
 Detect patterns of smurfing, mixing, or structuring 
 Flag anomalous wallet behaviour 
 Correlate on-chain events with user profiles 
 
<p>3. Privacy and GDPR Conflicts Transmitting user PII to third-party platforms or across borders can violate GDPR unless encrypted and consented properly. Many VASPs lack infrastructure to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>4. Cross-Platform Interoperability Ensuring data integrity across exchanges, custodians, and wallet providers requires consistent formatting, encryption standards, and interoperability with protocols like TRISA or OpenVASP.</p>
 The iComply Solution: Edge KYC + KYT 
<p>iComply offers a hybrid approach to compliance that protects privacy and enables full regulatory alignment:</p>
 1. Edge-Based KYC Verification 
 
 Identity documents, biometrics, and user data are processed on-device before being encrypted and transmitted. 
 Prevents unnecessary data exposure and supports GDPR, MiCA, and national data residency laws. 
 
 2. KYT with On-Chain Intelligence 
 
 Monitor wallet behaviour in real time 
 Risk-score transactions using blockchain analytics and off-chain KYC data 
 Detect structuring, layering, and high-risk flow patterns 
 
 3. Protocol-Agnostic Travel Rule Compliance 
 
 Integrate with TRISA, OpenVASP, and other compliance messaging protocols 
 Validate counterparty information and log communication trails 
 
 4. Unified Case Management 
 
 Combine KYT alerts, KYC data, and screening history into a single dashboard 
 Document decisions, escalate suspicious cases, and export reports 
 
 Case Insight: EU-Based Crypto Exchange 
<p>An exchange in Germany deployed iComply to integrate KYT screening with their existing KYC workflow. Within 60 days:</p>
 
 Drop-off rates in onboarding fell by 22% due to faster edge-based identity checks 
 High-risk wallet activity was flagged 3x more accurately 
 The firm passed a BaFin audit with recognition for its Travel Rule implementation 
 
 Regulatory Outlook for 2025 
 
 MiCA Phase-In: Stablecoin issuers and exchanges are now subject to enhanced due diligence requirements 
 TRP Adoption: The Travel Rule Protocol (TRP) is becoming the common standard across Europe 
 Supervisory Convergence: National regulators are aligning enforcement expectations across the EU 
 
 Take Action 
<p>For VASPs in the EU, 2025 is not just about avoiding penalties—it’s about proving maturity, privacy protection, and regulatory leadership.</p>
<p>Contact iComply to see how our KYT and edge-secure KYC platform helps VASPs comply with the Travel Rule, automate risk controls, and scale with confidence across Europe.</p>

<p>We’ve just released a <a href="https://holochain.org/roadmap/?ref=blog.holochain.org">new roadmap</a> for Holochain that we redesigned to improve visibility into both the development status and the workflow of the Holochain team. It shows a summary of release history, status of in-progress work, and planning of upcoming work including releases actively being planned and those that are just incubating. These summaries are linked to our actual Github project management tooling to calculate our work velocity and expected completion of work in progress as well as planning estimation.</p> Context <p>Showing the evolution and progress of an open-source project in an easily digestible way is both a critical and a non-trivial task.While we have been operating transparently for quite some time using Github Projects to manage and prioritize our work, the available summarizing and visibility tooling GitHub provides for roadmaps and burn-down don’t provide the necessary accessibility to developers and non-developers alike to stay informed on what’s currently being worked on, and what is yet to come. And we too have struggled with how best to create visibility into projected completion times, as this is<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/?ref=blog.holochain.org"> notoriously difficult to do</a>.</p><p>Our new, dynamic roadmap addresses these challenges by making our completion estimates visible the same way we see them internally - based on real data of our historical velocity, and compared with the team’s complexity estimation on future and in-progress work. <br><br>Take a look at how the new timeline in this video walk-through, or read on for more info on how it works.</p> What we show  Released <p>The Released column provides a list of actually released software. For the most part this shows Holochain releases, but it also includes notable releases of other stand-alone projects (like the HTTP Gateway). More current releases link to actual issues completed in our Github Projects tool.</p> In Progress <p>The “In Progress” column provides visibility into the releases we are currently actively working on. For each release you can see the percentage completion of story points, the current velocity and estimated time to completion. The story point completion is also broken down by epic for more detailed project data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Up Next <p>The “Up Next” column provides visibility into our team planning and estimation process. As well as coding and delivering on current releases, we are also looking ahead to what comes next, and getting a handle on how much complexity is involved and what to put into future releases. So in this column what you see is the progress on the issues and time to complete for a release.</p> Our Process <p>To really make sense of this roadmap, it helps to understand our team process. Like many software teams, we use a simple modified Kanban-based agile workflow for low-level task management, and releases and epics for higher-level prioritization.</p>  Work items enter our flow as bugs and feature requests, either from Holochain team members or stakeholders adding them as GitHub issues, on one of our repositories. As the team breaks down larger items of work, they may add more issues across various repositories.  All of these end up in the project backlog where we prioritize them and slot them into a release and an epic, which collects larger chunks of work.  From there the items are set to "Ready for refinement" which is the crucial step of the team assessing the complexity of an issue, and possibly breaking it into smaller issues that are all estimated. There is much written about story point estimating in agile process, which you can google for if you want to understand this more deeply. Suffice it to say that it's best not to estimate "time/effort" but rather to estimate complexity. Looking back on completed issues reveals the time it takes for the team to complete items of that level of complexity.  When items have been estimated, they are marked "Ready" and team members can start the work according to priority.  Our releases are currently numbered in the pre-release <a href="https://semver.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">semver</a> numbering style of 0.X.Y. X is considered a major release where we allow ourselves to break APIs, which for developers means they may have to recompile their hApps, and/or actually make updates because the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/?ref=blog.holochain.org">HDK</a> is changed, and also will have to update the conductor version their runtime is using, because networking formats may have changed. The Y value is a minor and for those, no DNA updates are required; simply updating the Holochain version in a runtime will either add new non-breaking features, or have fixed bugs.  <p>Thus, our new roadmap helps make our internal process more accessible and visible. We show what releases we have completed, which we are working on, and are planning and incubating going forward.</p><p>Please note that this map is fluid. We move epics from one release to another as we evaluate them, and sometimes simply because we realize it makes more sense to get a release out sooner. Usually, what's In-Progress is fairly well planned out, and the scope should remain fairly stable. What's marked as Planning not so much, and what's marked Incubating even less so.</p><p>We've made it so that Releases and Epics are links on the site so you can navigate directly to our Github project for those who want to delve in deeper.</p> The GitHub Project <p>To look under the hood at what's on in GitHub here are some things to note:</p>  If you go to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/22?ref=blog.holochain.org">release view</a> you will see all of the releases also on the website, plus a few more that we are holding even more loosely on that gradient of certainty, so we don't show them on the website.  Releases on GitHub are prefixed with a "*" for those in planning, and an "_" for those being incubated.  You may notice that data is not pulled live from GitHub, but it is updated reasonably often. This is currently a manual process that will eventually be automated.  <p>This roadmap provides transparency into both our timelines and development processes, giving real-time insight into how we work, what we're building, and when. This helps community members make better-informed decisions when building on Holochain. We'll continue refining this roadmap based on your feedback - so we look forward to hearing what you think.!</p>

			 Héctor Castro Mateos is QA Lead at Tokeny, he joined the company in 2022. 
 Reflecting on the 3-year Journey 
 You’ve been with the company for three years, as a QA engineer. How has the company supported your growth during this time? 
<p>Since I joined the company three years ago, I’ve always felt empowered to take ownership of the QA process and shape it in a way that truly fits our team and product. That level of trust and autonomy has been key to my growth. On top of that, everyone here is genuinely supportive and collaborative, which makes it much easier to take on challenges and keep improving.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Tokeny’s Culture Involvement 
 Tokeny has grown significantly since you joined. How has the company culture evolved in your opinion? 
<p>A lot has definitely changed over these three years. As the company has grown, the tech team has constantly refined its processes, always aiming to improve step by step so we can deliver the best possible product.</p>

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “We’ve managed to keep that “family feeling” despite team changes, and I think that’s something really valuable to preserve.” 

		 
	 
             
	 
		 
			 “We’ve managed to keep that “family feeling” despite team changes, and I think that’s something really valuable to preserve.” 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe your own personal growth within the company? 
<p>The QA team has grown since I joined, and with that, so have my responsibilities. I started as the only QA, and now we’re a team of four. That shift has pushed me to grow into a leadership role, learning how to manage a team, balance priorities, and make sure everyone feels both productive and motivated. It’s been a continuous learning experience, and I’m still growing every day.</p>

		 
	 
                            
	 
		 
			 “It’s been a continuous learning experience, and I’m still growing every day.” 

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 “It’s been a continuous learning experience, and I’m still growing every day.” 

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 Company Values in Practice 
 You mentioned in your previous interview how much you enjoyed working with a very committed team, that creates a sense of belonging to a community. Can you share an example of a project where you or your team used this commitment, and how it was received? 
<p>There was a release where many things got delayed and we had blockers just a few days before the deadline. Instead of panicking, the team stayed fully engaged and focused. We split the work, adapted priorities, and everyone went the extra mile to make sure things were properly tested. It really showed how committed the team is, not just to doing their own tasks, but to making sure the company delivers quality on time.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Reflections and Future Outlook 
 If you could give advice to your younger self, just starting out at Tokeny, what would it be? 
<p>I’d tell myself to be more confident from the beginning and to trust the team. You don’t need to have all the answers on your own, the best outcomes come when you collaborate and rely on others. We’re all here to help each other grow.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 As someone who has been with the company through significant milestones, where do you see Tokeny going in the next five years, and how do you envision your role evolving in that journey? 
<p>The industry is evolving really fast, so it’s hard to predict exactly what things will look like in five years. Personally, I see myself continuing to grow professionally, leading a bigger QA team, and contributing to even more advanced testing strategies to keep ensuring the quality and reliability of our product.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 “I’m confident Tokeny will be at the forefront of that change” 

		 
	 
                        
	 
		 
			 “I’m confident Tokeny will be at the forefront of that change” 

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 Finally, as we’ve gotten to know you over the years, you’ve often shared your love for nutrition and a wide range of sports. Do any learnings or skills from these passions translate into your work at Tokeny? 
<p>Absolutely. I think anyone who approaches sports with passion and commitment develops a mindset built on patience, resilience, and the drive to keep going until the goal is achieved. That mentality naturally carries over into work, where consistency and perseverance are key.</p>

<p>Part of Bluesky’s mission to create a more open and decentralized social web is
helping users feel safe and in control of their experience. We always try to
balance safety with privacy, and free expression with civility.</p>
<p>To achieve our mission, we also work with governments around the world. In the
UK, the Online Safety Act requires that online platforms take specific steps to
reduce the risk of children seeing harmful content. Since certain parts of that
act come into effect later this month, we’re making some changes for people in
the UK.</p>
<p>We’ll use Epic Games’ <a href="https://www.kidswebservices.com/en-US">Kids Web
Services</a> (KWS) to give our UK
community choices about how to verify their age. If you’re in the UK, you can
choose between
<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/kids-web-services/pv-service/verification-methods">methods</a>
like credit card verification and face scans. (See
<a href="https://www.kidswebservices.com/en-US/faq">here</a> to
learn more about how KWS safeguards user information.) For people who are under
18 or don’t want to go through this process, we’ll make adult-appropriate
content inaccessible, and we’ll disable features like direct messaging.</p>
<p>If you’re in the UK, you’ll see a notification on our platform when this update
takes effect, and a way to report unwanted content:</p>

  
  Users in the UK will see notices of age requirements, and
  instructions for completing age verification.


  
  Users can report content through flows like the one pictured.

<p>In addition to these updates, we’ll continue to look at how we’re doing to
shield children from unwanted content, and how we can improve.</p>

				  Last week the Indicio team attended the Global Digital Collaboration Conference on digital identity and wallets in Geneva, Switzerland. There hasn’t been a clearer signal that decentralized identity, digital wallets, and Verifiable Credentials are about to transform digital interaction.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Eighteen hundred. That was the number of attendees at the inaugural two-day <a href="https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/">Global Digital Collaboration Conference</a> in Geneva at the beginning of July. The level of interest exceeded the organizer’s expectations, there was enough material for a week’s worth of discussions, the auditorium for the final session — usually the worst slot for speakers as everyone departs for the airport — was filled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve seen growing interest in decentralized identity over the past few years, from fringe to serious technology. This conference was at another level. It wasn’t a matter of if or when but how —&nbsp;how to implement and, above all, how to be interoperable.</p>
<p>Behind this sea change, maturing technology, successful deployments, and Europe —&nbsp;specifically, the EU mandate that all member states must offer at least one EU Digital Identity Wallet to all its citizens and residents by 2026.</p>
<p>Google, Huawei, Mastercard, and Visa were sponsors. Apple joined a panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many — companies and attendees — were in a “getting to know the technology” mode. Others, already married to the tech — such as Indicio — talked about how to achieve interoperability between European digital identity and wallet specifications and global specifications, and where the frontier is, namely verifiable identities for AI agents.</p>
 Interoperability 
<p>If the conference had a dominant theme, it was interoperability. How do we connect the world across different digital identity standards and wallets? In her presentation to the <a href="https://tac.openwallet.foundation/SIGs/wallet-interoperability/">Open Wallet Foundation’s Wallet Interop Special Interest Group</a> (WISIG), Indicio Software Engineer Char Howland began by explaining why interoperability was such a critical issue.</p>
<p>Simply put:&nbsp;</p>
 
 People expect joined up digital experiences and seamless workflows 
 A multi-credential and multi-protocol world can only scale through interoperability 
 Interoperability is often a legal requirement 
 
<p>Howland explained what the WISIG is doing to advance this and then discussed Indicio’s role in the SITA-Delta Air Lines-Aruba trial, where different credential formats and protocols were successfully combined in a single workflow from a single wallet to enable pre authorized travel, seamless check-in, boarding, and border crossing.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Indicio’s success in marrying a credential following the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Digital Travel Credential standards (DTC-1) with EU digital identity standards (IATA One ID) showed how easy it is to make a multi-credential world interoperate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, as a result of this success, Indicio will work with SITA on the upcoming European APTITUDE trial to develop a DTC-2 credential —&nbsp;a digital passport credential issued directly to travelers by the Dutch and French governments.</p>
<p>The WISIG panel showed open source collaboration at its best — and is a must-follow to keep up to date on wallet interoperability.&nbsp;</p>
 How to slay with Verifiable Credentials 
<p>Indicio CEO Heather Dahl addressed an equally critical point in her talk, aptly titled “How to slay with Verifiable Credentials.”</p>
<p>Slaying means focusing on what the technology does in terms of business value and not what it does in terms of being cool tech.</p>
<p>“This technology sells when people and companies can see it has value,” said Dahl. And the value Indicio’s customers see is that it creates:</p>
 
 Seamless, efficient processes 
 Seamless user experiences 
 Seamless authentication 
 Enables privacy and consent around personal data and data sharing, and especially around biometrics 
 Reduces operational complexity and cost around integration, data authentication, compliance and security 
 
<p>The next step for companies adopting and using the technology is how does this technology create ecosystems around trusted data? The answer, said Dahl, is when you combine interoperability and governance.</p>
<p>With decentralized governance, you can establish who is a trusted issuer of credentials, who is a trusted verifier of credentials, and what information needs to be shared for which purpose. And because these governance files are sent to each participant, all this happens instantly, thereby providing a way to generate trusted interaction and data sharing from anyone to anywhere.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>This is where companies are now, said Dahl. They want to see how they can connect and integrate their partners, their verticals, their sectors and go from sector to sector seamlessly. As an example, she discussed the SITA Digital Travel Ecosystem, a way for the entire travel and tourist economy to interoperate seamlessly around shared credential specifications, interop profiles, and decentralized governance.</p>
<p>Finally, Dahl addressed the next big thing in decentralized identity: AI. If agentic AI is to be a reality, all those agents are going to need verifiable identities too, and people are going to need to be able to consent to sharing their data. Indicio recently launched ProvenAI, an identity solution for AI that addresses these problems.</p>
 How to start your decentralized identity journey 
<p>We always end these pieces with a call to action. Based on what we saw in Geneva, this one is underlined. The time to start is now. Start playing with the technology, start strategizing about how it can be used to simplify your operations, improve your security, and benefit your customers. This is critical if you do or are planning to do business in the EU.</p>
<p>We can talk you through all the different flavors of credentials and protocols, show you demos of different use cases, and explain, in-depth, how this technology is being deployed, how to make it interoperable, and how to use it to deliver value.</p>
<p>Getting started is as easy as <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reaching out to our team</a> for a consultation or to discuss a specific use case.

 Universities can’t afford to treat cybersecurity as an afterthought. Here’s how to close the gaps before the next breach.&nbsp; 
<p>On June 24, 2025, Columbia University joined the growing list of higher education institutions compromised by sophisticated cybercriminals. The attack, which <a href="https://therecord.media/hacker-political-agenda-columbia-cyberattack">exposed 1.6 gigabytes of sensitive data from 2.5 million student applications</a>, wasn’t the work of a random opportunist, it was a politically motivated hacktivist who exploited systemic weaknesses in the university’s identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>This breach represents more than an isolated incident. It’s a stark warning about the reality facing higher education: attacks targeting universities have <a href="https://www.cloudrangecyber.com/news/higher-education-faces-rising-cyber-attacks-in-2024">surged nearly 70%</a> since 2023, with institutions now facing an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/10/10/cyber-signals-issue-8-education-under-siege-how-cybercriminals-target-our-schools/">average of over 2,500 cyberattack attempts each week</a>. For university CISOs and IT leaders reading about yet another campus breach, this one demands immediate attention, because the vulnerabilities that enabled Columbia’s compromise exist across virtually every campus in America.</p>
 Why Higher Education Has Become a Prime Target 
<p>Universities present an irresistible combination of valuable data and defensive weaknesses that make them ideal targets for both cybercriminals and nation-state actors. Unlike heavily regulated industries like finance or healthcare, higher education operates with unique vulnerabilities that attackers systematically exploit:</p>
 Open by Design, Vulnerable by Default 
<p>The collaborative nature of academic environments creates massive attack surfaces. Universities must balance open access for research and learning with security requirements—a tension that often resolves in favor of accessibility rather than protection. Multiple campuses, diverse user populations, and thousands of personal devices create countless entry points that traditional perimeter defenses can’t adequately secure.</p>
 Legacy Identity Systems Built for Trust, Not Security 
<p>Most universities still rely on authentication systems designed decades ago for smaller, more trusted communities. Password-based access controls and basic multi-factor authentication leave institutions vulnerable to the same social engineering and credential theft tactics that have compromised organizations across every sector.</p>
 Resource Constraints in a High-Risk Environment 
<p>Shrinking budgets force difficult choices between academic priorities and cybersecurity investments. IT teams often operate with skeleton staff while managing complex, distributed infrastructure that spans multiple generations of technology. This combination of limited resources and broad attack surfaces creates the perfect storm for successful cyberattacks.</p>
 The Columbia Attack: A Preview of What’s Coming 
<p>The details emerging from Columbia’s investigation reveal attack patterns that should concern every higher education leader. While the full forensic analysis remains ongoing, early reports suggest the attackers exploited weak identity verification processes to gain initial access, then moved laterally through systems containing sensitive student data.</p>
<p>This follows a predictable pattern: compromise user credentials through phishing or social engineering, bypass traditional MFA through known techniques, then abuse legitimate access to extract maximum value before detection.</p>
<p>The financial impact extends far beyond immediate incident response costs. Universities face regulatory fines, legal liability, remediation expenses, and the long-term reputational damage that affects enrollment and donor relationships.</p>
 Third-Party Risks Universities Often Overlook 
<p>Higher education institutions rely heavily on external vendors for everything from student information systems to dining services. Each vendor relationship introduces potential vulnerabilities, particularly when those providers have privileged access to campus systems or sensitive data.</p>
<p>The challenge isn’t just direct vendor access—it’s the inherited trust relationships that come with those partnerships. When a student information system provider gets compromised, attackers often inherit that vendor’s access to multiple university clients. This supply chain risk multiplies across the dozens of technology providers most universities depend on for daily operations.</p>
 Identity-First Defense for Higher Education 
<p>Traditional cybersecurity approaches fail in university environments because they focus on protecting systems rather than verifying identities. When attackers can convince legitimate users or help desk staff to grant access, network security becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p>The most effective defense requires securing the identity layer itself. Here’s how identity-first security addresses the specific vulnerabilities that made Columbia’s breach possible:</p>
 Verified Identity Authentication 
<p>The Challenge: University help desks process hundreds of password reset requests daily from students, faculty, and staff across multiple time zones. Traditional verification relies on security questions or basic information that attackers can easily research or socially engineer.</p>
<p>The Defense: Identity platforms that require users to prove their actual identity through biometric verification tied to government-issued identification. When someone requests account access, the system can definitively verify whether the person is who they claim to be—regardless of what information they provide over the phone.</p>
 Phishing-Resistant, Passwordless Authentication 
<p>The Challenge: University users are prime targets for phishing attacks, with students and faculty often sharing credentials across multiple personal and academic platforms. Traditional MFA can be bypassed through push notification fatigue or social engineering.</p>
<p>The Defense: Eliminating passwords entirely and using FIDO2-compliant biometric authentication that cannot be phished, intercepted, or socially engineered. There are no codes to read over the phone and no push notifications to accidentally accept.</p>
 Risk-Based Access Controls 
<p>The Challenge: University environments require flexible access from multiple locations and devices, making traditional location-based or device-based controls impractical.</p>
<p>The Defense: Identity-bound access controls that verify the person requesting access, regardless of their device or location. Even if attackers compromise approved devices or spoof trusted networks, they cannot authenticate without the legitimate user’s verified biometric identity.</p>
 Implementation Considerations for Universities 
<p>Regulatory Compliance Universities handle FERPA-protected student records, research data subject to various federal requirements, and often health information covered by HIPAA. Identity platforms that meet federal standards like FedRAMP High Authorization and NIST 800-63-3 demonstrate they can handle the complex compliance requirements universities face.</p>
<p>Operational Continuity Identity-based attacks can disrupt everything from class registration to research operations. The cost of operational disruption often exceeds the direct costs of incident response and can affect the institution’s academic mission for months or years.</p>
<p>Integration Requirements Modern identity platforms must integrate with existing campus systems—from learning management platforms to research computing resources—without disrupting daily academic operations.</p>
 The Time to Act is Now 
<p>Columbia’s breach isn’t an isolated incident—it’s a preview of what’s coming for every university that hasn’t modernized their identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>Rather than detecting breaches after they’ve compromised sensitive data, identity-first security prevents them from succeeding by securing the identity layer that attackers target first. The question isn’t whether your institution will face an identity-based attack—it’s whether you’ll be ready when it comes.</p>

<p>On this episode we spoke with Teresa Wu, Vice President of Smart Credentials and Access at IDEMIA. IDEMIA has been involved with many U.S. states for their mobile IDs, including New York, Arizona, Iowa, Delaware and more. Very few people on earth have more experience than Teresa working with governments to issue digital credentials.</p><p>We asked her what would encourage more states to launch mobile IDs and drive end-user adoption. Her response was: more relying party use cases. So, we spent most of our conversation exploring questions like:</p>  Should relying parties wait to adopt until standards mature and more people have digital IDs?  How can relying parties get started now?  How much should the industry channel its energy towards innovation vs. standardization?  How will the wallet landscape evolve? Will operating system wallets dominate, or will there be lots of wallets?  <p>We closed out by covering the lessons Teresa has learned through all this experience for public servants. I think this conversation will be relevant to anybody interested in digital IDs, either on the issuance or acceptance side.</p><p>You can find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teresawu/">Teresa</a> on Linkedin and learn more about <a href="https://www.idemia.com/">IDEMIA</a> on their website.</p><p>Subscribe to our newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p>That real-time lookup can serve legitimate needs, like revocation checks. But it also opens the door to targeted location tracking and behavioral profiling, especially if it’s implemented without transparency or user controls.</p>

<p>I’m less concerned here with how we got to this point—though it’s worth <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/24/digital-identity-open-standards/">reflecting</a> on the impact of paywalled standards and quiet design compromises—and more concerned with how we talk about it now. Too often, we respond to surveillance risks or fraud threats with hardline positions that don’t allow room for healthy disagreement or practical tradeoffs.</p>



 Imaginary Perspectives 



<p>To unpack the complexity, I’ve imagined three personas who reflect common but well-reasoned positions in the debate over real-time credential verification. Each has a valid point. As a friend wisely said, “A world without any surveillance and uncontrolled fraud is bad, no matter what some think. A world without any fraud because there is complete overhead control is also bad. We need to focus on finding an acceptable compromise.” These personas were not modeled on any particular individuals, so if you do see yourself here, think of yourself as an archetype, not a target.&nbsp;</p>



 Dr. Rhea Jamison, Privacy Researcher 



<p>“Surveillance should never be the default. If it must happen, make it visible, optional, and rare.”</p>



<p>Rhea has spent two decades advising civil liberties groups and participating in privacy-focused standards work. She sees invisible surveillance capabilities not as a theoretical risk, but as a historical pattern. When surveillance infrastructure is built into technical architecture, it tends to get used, often without meaningful consent or transparency.</p>



<p>Her concern with “phone home” verification models is twofold:</p>



 
 They enable real-time, fine-grained tracking of when and where a credential is used, turning the verifier-issuer relationship into a persistent surveillance channel. 



 The user may never know this is happening. As demonstrated in recent analysis of ISO/IEC 18013-5, an issuer can silently switch a credential from device-only to server-retrieval mode during a routine update. 
 



<p>She draws a sharp distinction between linkability, where transactions can be correlated later, and active surveillance, where every verification pings the issuer and generates a time-stamped log.</p>



<p>Rhea does not consider herself an absolutist. She acknowledges that in rare cases, real-time checks may be warranted. But only if:</p>



 
 The user is clearly informed that network contact will occur; 



 There is a viable offline alternative; 



 All server retrieval events are auditable by the user. 
 



<p>“Surveillance infrastructure rarely stays dormant. If we build systems that can track people invisibly, we have to assume someone, somewhere, eventually will.”</p>



 Marcus Lee, VP of Fraud Risk 



<p>“You can’t prevent fraud with stale data. Some level of real-time validation is necessary.”</p>



<p>Marcus runs enterprise fraud strategy at a multinational financial services firm. His team handles fraud mitigation across banking, healthcare, and payment systems. For Marcus, the risk isn’t theoretical: fraudsters already exploit credentialing gaps to create synthetic identities, steal controlled substances, and bypass onboarding checks.</p>



<p>He makes three key arguments for phone-home capability:</p>



 
 Regulatory compliance: Banks must meet <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp">Anti-Money Laundering</a> (AML) standards that often require verifying the current status of a credential at the time of use. 



 High-risk scenarios: From dispensing opioids at a pharmacy to controlling access to critical infrastructure, static credential models can’t flag suspended, stolen, or recently revoked identities in time to prevent harm. 



 Operational integrity: Real-time revocation and risk signals are critical for dynamic threat environments, such as when a compromised credential is detected and must be disabled immediately. 
 



<p>Marcus doesn’t ignore the privacy conversation. He believes enterprises must:</p>



 
 Minimize data retention 



 Disclose verification policies 



 Use contractually bounded systems 
 



<p>But banning real-time issuer contact outright? That, to him, is a risk too far.</p>



<p>“Fraud isn’t solved with good intentions. If we strip out risk signals in the name of privacy, we’ll end up rebuilding surveillance tools elsewhere with less transparency and with fewer guardrails.”</p>



 Priya Banerjee, Identity Standards Architect 



<p>“Both concerns are valid. Let’s design systems that make phone-home capabilities visible, limited, and accountable.”</p>



<p>Priya has helped draft standards at several of the more open standards organizations. She sees herself as a translator between idealism and operational need. She agrees with Rhea that invisible surveillance is unacceptable, but also agrees with Marcus that some environments can’t function responsibly without up-to-date credential data. (Priya is kind of my hero.)</p>



<p>Her view is that technical architecture should support both offline-first and risk-aware models, with strict boundaries. She proposes:</p>



 
 Device-based verification as the default 



 Explicit and visible consent if server retrieval is needed 



 Mandatory signaling by the verifier so users know which mode is active 



 Logged retrieval history that users can inspect (or challenge) 
 



<p>She also raises a quiet but critical point: when standards prohibit real-world use cases outright, implementers will often fork the spec or build their own tooling, often without the privacy protections the standard might have enforced.</p>



<p>“Designing for flexibility doesn’t mean compromising values. It means making systems that work in the real world, while ensuring the user stays informed, in control, and protected.”</p>



 Comparison Table 



ConcernRhea (Privacy Advocate)Marcus (Fraud Prevention)Priya (Balanced Architect)Default verification modeDevice-onlyContext-dependentDevice-first, fallback allowedReal-time server retrievalStrongly opposed; privacy riskRequired in high-risk sectorsPermitted with consent and loggingConsent modelMust be explicit and revocableNot always practicalRequired and user-visibleRevocation handlingLocal proofs, time-limited credsReal-time checks essentialHybrid: periodic updates + fallbackTransparency mechanismsMandatory user logsControlled via policyTechnically enforced signalingAcceptable tradeoffsVery few; privacy is paramountSome surveillance justifiedBoundaries + adaptability



 Conclusion 



<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer here. And that’s the point. These aren’t just technical choices; they’re governance decisions that shape what our systems can and can’t do. They are risk management decisions; no one size will fit all. The phone-home debate should be about recognizing that the needs of privacy, security, and accountability are not mutually exclusive, but they are in tension.</p>



<p>We build better infrastructure when we acknowledge those tensions rather than ignore them. That means creating room for high-risk use cases to function responsibly without turning every ID scan into a tracking event. It means embedding consent and transparency into the architecture, not just assuming policy will save us later.</p>



<p>These debates are worth having and revisiting as technology, regulation, and use cases evolve. Let’s keep listening, keep adjusting, and keep building systems that are worthy of the trust we expect users to place in them.</p>

 Transcript 



 Introduction 



<p>00:00:00 Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>00:00:26 Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Episode Overview 



<p>00:00:29 Hi there and welcome back to A Digital Identity Digest. In today’s episode, we’re diving into a topic that’s been grabbing attention, especially among those of us who spend our time thinking about infrastructure standards and users’ rights.</p>



<p>00:00:44 Initially, this episode almost began as a rage blog—a cathartic response sparked by a lively signal chat. Although I wasn’t the one raging, that conversation inspired the post you’re about to experience.</p>



 



 Understanding Phone Home and MDLs 



<p>00:01:00 The discussion centers on the Phone Home feature built into the specification for mobile driver’s licenses (MDLs). On the surface, MDLs are more than just a digital version of your government-issued ID—they’re designed to be stored on your phone, offering convenience, enhanced security, and reduced risks of forgery.</p>



<p>00:01:09 Yet, as with every innovation, the devil is in the details. The ISO specification includes a Phone Home functionality that allows systems verifying your ID—whether by a bartender, a TSA agent, or a pharmacist—to contact the issuer in real time to check its status.</p>



 Key Points: 



 
 Real-Time Verification: Ensures immediate feedback on license status. 



 Privacy Concerns: Opens the door to tracking when, where, and how often your ID is presented. 



 Implementation Flexibility: Depending on the issuer, this capability can be toggled silently. 
 



 



 Privacy vs. Practicality: The Debate 



<p>00:02:05 At first glance, real-time verification may seem entirely reasonable. After all, if an ID is revoked, expired, or flagged, shouldn’t the system know instantly?</p>



<p>00:02:16 However, there are notable catches:</p>



 
 Surveillance Risks: The same capability enables individual tracking. 



 Silent Activation: This feature can be turned on without the user’s knowledge. 
 



<p>These trade-offs highlight that implementation matters—a theme that will continue throughout our discussion.</p>



 



 Persona Spotlight: Dr. Rhea Jamieson 



<p>00:03:19 Let’s introduce our first fictitious persona, inspired by real-world conversations. Meet Dr. Rhea Jamieson, a dedicated privacy researcher with decades of experience collaborating with civil liberties groups and contributing to privacy-focused standards.</p>



<p>00:03:33 Dr. Jamieson’s core concerns include:</p>



 
 Default Avoidance of Surveillance: She argues that surveillance should never be the standard. 



 Visibility and Consent: Any real-time verification must be visible, optional, and auditable. 



 Risk of Inadvertent Activation: Once surveillance is technologically enabled, the pressure to use it grows. 
 



<p>00:04:12 In her view, cryptographic proofs and time-limited credentials should be leveraged to build systems that inherently avoid default surveillance—even if there are rare situations (such as border crossings) that might justify such features.</p>



 



 Persona Spotlight: Marcus Lee 



<p>00:05:11 Shifting to a different perspective, meet Marcus Lee, the imaginary Vice President of Fraud Strategy for a global financial institution. His world revolves around combating synthetic identity fraud, money laundering, and managing relentless regulatory audits.</p>



<p>00:05:37 Marcus believes:</p>



 
 Stale Data Is Risky: Static credentials, which can’t be updated or revoked in real time, are a liability. 



 Necessity of Real-Time Risk Signals: Fraud prevention demands immediate validation. 



 Controlled Usage: While he doesn’t advocate for Phone Home as the default, he insists on its availability where risks and liabilities are pronounced. 
 



<p>00:06:02 To him, privacy policies, audits, and enterprise-wide safeguards can accommodate real-time verification without sacrificing necessary safeguards.</p>



 



 Persona Spotlight: Priya – Bridging Both Worlds 



<p>00:06:43 Finally, let’s meet Priya, an imaginary standards architect who encapsulates the balancing act between privacy and practicality. With extensive experience across multiple standards development processes, Priya strives to bridge philosophy with real-world deployment.</p>



<p>00:06:50 Her approach is all about designing systems that are:</p>



 
 Visible: Phone Home capabilities should be transparent and clearly communicated. 



 Limited: Device-based verification should be the default, with strict limits on server retrieval. 



 Accountable: Every network retrieval must be logged for user review. 
 



<p>00:07:23 Priya’s vision emphasizes that designing for informed use with visible, enforceable boundaries allows for a dual benefit—supporting both privacy-first applications and high-risk scenarios.</p>



 



 Key Takeaways 



<p>00:08:06 The episode delivers a crucial message: designing flexible digital identity systems does not have to mean compromising core values. Consider these essential points:</p>



 
 Surveillance vs. Fraud Prevention: One perspective argues to design out surveillance, while another insists on embedding risk signals to prevent fraud. 



 Balanced Implementation: A middle ground is not only possible but necessary—standards can support both privacy and security with transparency and accountability. 



 Informed Consent: Ultimately, users should be kept informed, in control, and protected at every step. 
 



 



 Final Thoughts &amp; Call to Action 



<p>00:09:03 In conclusion, these perspectives are not mutually exclusive. As we build, standardize, and deploy digital credentials, let’s:</p>



 
 Stay Engaged: Keep the conversation open rather than viewing it as a zero-sum game. 



 Listen to Diverse Viewpoints: Every perspective—privacy, fraud prevention, and balanced standards—adds value. 
 



<p>00:09:22 Let’s build systems that truly reflect the trust we’re asking people to bestow upon us.</p>

<p>Not that I’m a lawyer! But I’m giving a short speech on AI regulation at the 2025 Asian Law Schools Association (ALSA) <a href="https://www.alsa2025.com/">Law and Technology Conference</a> in Sydney, on July 11.</p>
 Abstract 
<p>The phenomenon of deep fakes, where Generative AI creates realistic still and moving images mimicking real individuals, is deeply troubling for actors, authors and public figures. Some people have tried to assert intellectual property rights over their likenesses, but these approaches have proved problematic. Legal reform in this area would be complicated and time consuming.</p>
<p>Here I propose a simpler way to legally protect appearances, by applying established technology-neutral data privacy law to facial images and voice recordings.</p>
<p>Note carefully that this is not to say that faces and voices are necessarily “private”; instead, the point is to appeal to data protection principles which simply operate to restrain the flow of certain types of information, namely personal information (PI).</p>
<p>My argument in brief goes as follows:</p>
 
 Facial images and voice recordings constitute personal information under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A03712">Australian legal definition</a>, namely any “information … about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable”.Indeed, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/social-media-and-online-privacy/photos-and-videos">advised that photos and videos are treated as personal information</a> if the identity of individuals “is clear or could reasonably be worked out”. 
 Under technology neutral privacy law, privacy principles apply to personal information whether it is collected directly or indirectly. The OAIC has developed <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/more-guidance/guide-to-data-analytics-and-the-australian-privacy-principles">specific guidelines for “collection by creation”</a>, with a broad interpretation of collection to cover “gathering, acquiring or obtaining personal information from any source and by any means”, including “when information … generated from other information”. 
 So, if a Generative AI model creates a visual and/or acoustic likeness of a real-life individual Alice, then we can regard the model as having collected personal information about Alice. The use and disclosure of the generated likeness would be subject to legislated privacy principles. Consideration would usually have to be given to Alice’s consent for likenesses of her to be produced and disseminated. 
 
<p>I conclude that technology-neutral data privacy laws — such as Australia’s Privacy Act (1988), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (2016) and the American Privacy Rights Act (Updated House Draft, 23rd May 2024) — contain powerful and proven legal mechanisms that could help limit certain adverse effects of generative AI that are otherwise proving difficult to contain.</p>

 From wax seals to biometrics, we explore the past, present and future of identity verification. 



<p>Verifying your identity used to be simple: you just had to sign your name and if you couldn’t write, mark an ‘X’. A simple and far from rigorous process – certainly one that wouldn’t pass today’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> rules or fly in today’s strictly controlled and regulated environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that we’ve come a long way since signatures and wax seals, but the purpose of identity verification has remained consistent throughout history: to distinguish between individuals, establish trust, and allocate rights or responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’re obsessed with everything identity, and as one of the Heads of Product at IDnow, I’m particularly fascinated with the different ways in which we consciously and subconsciously identify ourselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, did you know that modern security cameras are now able to identify someone based on how they move? Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant don’t just listen to words — they analyze the frequency and rhythm of a voice to decide if it’s really the user and whether to provide the user profile’s private data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, fun fact: due to its unique shape, texture, and vein pattern, the human tongue could, theoretically, be used <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5210096/">for personal identification</a>. In fact, as a biometric identifier, a tongue can be as accurate as a fingerprint or iris. The main barriers to adoption include hygiene concerns, user discomfort, and technical challenges in consistent imaging. However, it’s perhaps only a matter of time until Apple devises a way to scan my tongue as I speak into my iPhone…&nbsp;</p>



<p>There has also been research into the viability of using brain reactions to stimuli (e.g. flashing lights or sounds) as biometric identifiers as brain signal patterns are nearly impossible to fake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’re also fascinated with the future of digital identity verification. But before we look ahead, let us first investigate the history of identity verification.</p>

 8 milestones in the history of identity verification. 



  Pre 3000 BC: It can be assumed that as people in small tribes and communities tended to all know each other, no formal documentation was ever needed. Recognition was based on appearance, voice, posture, or habits. Tattoos, scars, or tribal markings were, however, used to signify group identity or status.&nbsp;  



  3000BC to 300AD: Alongside the birth of larger civilizations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Rome came written records. Population registries (some found on stone tablets), often tied to occupation, parentage, or land ownership, date back to 3000BC.&nbsp;<br><br>Ancient Rome used written census rolls to verify citizens for taxation and military service purposes. Local scribes with local knowledge would often be used as the first level of identity verification.&nbsp;It was also during this period when individuals started to use engraved rings or stamps to validate their identity or to press into wax seals to authenticate documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  300 to 1500: References to letters permitting travel through Persian territories, (which many consider to be the first passport) were found from the 5th century. By the 15th century, official documents called “safe conducts” were used by the British Empire to allow subjects to travel abroad safely. Passports soon followed providing official identification for travel purposes.&nbsp;  



  1500 to 1800: In the early modern period, signatures started to become used as the legal mark of a personal identity, especially in the agreement of contracts.&nbsp;  



  1800 to 1900: By the industrial age, identity records were centralized and state-backed with various governments forming civil registries. Photos began appearing on official documents and fingerprints were being used to identify individuals. The first documented use of <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/visibleproofs/galleries/cases/vucetich.html">fingerprint analysis occurred in 1892 in Argentina</a> to prove a murder case.&nbsp;  



  1900 to 1990: Birth certificates and Social Security Numbers started to become standard across most nations whilst driving licenses and passports became the most common identity documents. Other countries introduced national identity cards. Even, as I recently discovered whilst sorting through items at my mother’s house, my grandmother. Of course, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">UK has always had a very different approach to identity verification</a>.<br><br>By the late 20th century, we started to see a shift from recognition to authentication. Biometrics, including fingerprints, facial features, and retina scans were introduced to gain access to high-security environments. The first retina scan was used in 1984 to enter secure US government facilities.  



 Jonathan’s grandmother’s National Registration Identity Card was first issued in May 1943 and last ‘authenticated’ in 1948. 



 



  1990 to 2013: The digital age was the period when identity became portable. Usernames and passwords became the norm to access online services, and email and social media accounts became informal identity layers. This was also when digital signatures and encryption were first used in official documents.<br><br>In 2013 we saw the introduction of the iPhone Touch ID, which brought biometrics into mainstream consumer technology. (Face ID would follow in 2017.)&nbsp;Unfortunately, fraudsters were not far behind and shortly after the introduction of these innovative methods of identity verification came an increase in fraudsters using creative ways to hack digital services.&nbsp;<br><br>In 2014, IDnow was founded in Munich, Germany and launched its flagship product, VideoIdent. Our expert-led video identity verification service was considered revolutionary at the time as it enabled organizations to offer the same legal equivalency as an in-person identity verification and had just been allowed by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">BaFin</a>).&nbsp;  



  2014 to 2024: During this decade, a variety of identity verification and digital signature solutions were added to the IDnow portfolio, including the AI-supported, fully automated AutoIdent identity verification solution.&nbsp;<br><br>In 2021, IDnow acquired the French market leader for identity verification&nbsp;technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German provider identity Trust Management AG, establishing us as one of the largest European players in the identity industry.&nbsp;It was during this decade that industries at large adopted automated identity verification. From scanning passports at airports to unlocking phones and accessing apps, the public now uses sophisticated AI and biometrics to validate their identities daily. They use smart watches to track biometric signals, and have become used to increased security measures, such as multi-factor authentication.  



 What’s coming next? 2025 – 2035.&nbsp; 



<p>Here are just a few trends that we’re likely to see soon in the identity space. Many organizations will start to focus on integrating self-sovereign identity into their platforms, where the individual owns their own data and identity is delivered through decentralized systems, such as blockchain. Here, data is shared only on a need-to-know basis. A great user experience if you want to prove your age without sharing your date of birth, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulation will continue to evolve around access to data stored on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">NFC (Near-Field Communication)</a> chips, which are often embedded in ID cards and documents. In the past, access to this data tended to be restricted to government agencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also an industry-wide drive toward improving customer experience, especially with regards to reducing authentication time. This will likely become easier and more widespread as individual governments and industries start to issue digital identity credentials that can be stored in a digital wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also seeing the growth of cross-border &amp; global interoperability through emerging global standards like W3C Verifiable Credentials and ISO 18013-5 for mobile IDs. Projects including eIDAS 2.0 in the EU aim to make digital identities and digital wallets usable across multiple countries, while the upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/amlr-explained-financial-services-need-know/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation</a> will set out what methods of identity verification will become compliant in the near future.</p>



 The future of identity verification.&nbsp; 



<p>As the market evolves at lightning speed, the businesses of tomorrow will need more than basic verification, they’ll need trust solutions that are continuous, intelligent, and built to scale. To succeed in the future, businesses will need to stay ahead of regulatory changes, outsmart new fraud threats, and deliver standout customer experiences.&nbsp;</p>

  With the UK's mandatory identity verification for company directors and Persons with Significant Control (PSCs) set to commence in autumn 2025, businesses have one month left to prepare. This article outlines the upcoming requirements, potential consequences of non-compliance, and how to ensure readiness.

<p>The United Kingdom is less than a month away from a major shift in how it handles director and beneficial owner identity verification. Under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act, new requirements will soon make it mandatory for company directors, Persons with Significant Control (PSCs), and anyone filing with Companies House to verify their identity. These changes aim to bring greater transparency to corporate structures and reduce the risk of fraud. They also introduce new pressures for compliance teams, legal advisers, and company secretaries—especially those still relying on outdated onboarding methods.</p>
 
 Who Must Verify 
<p>Starting in autumn 2025, the following individuals must complete identity verification:</p>
 
 All new and existing company directors 
 Persons with Significant Control (PSCs) 
 Individuals submitting filings on behalf of a UK-registered company 
 
<p>This applies to all companies, LLPs, and relevant legal entities registered with Companies House. Existing directors and PSCs will have a 12-month transition window. For new incorporations, identity verification must be completed before the appointment is confirmed.</p>
 
 How Identity Can Be Verified 
<p>There are three official routes for identity verification:</p>
 
 GOV.UK One Login<br>This is the UK government’s centralised digital identity platform. Users scan an RFID-enabled document (such as a passport or biometric residence permit) and complete a face match using biometric liveness detection. However, this system has lost its DIATF certification and has raised concerns regarding centralised data storage, tracking, and security. 
 In-Person Verification at Post Office Branches<br>An option for those who cannot complete digital verification. Requires manual face-to-face inspection of documents. 
 Via an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP)<br>Trusted firms such as law firms, accounting providers, and compliance vendors can verify identity on behalf of Companies House using approved methods. 
 iComply’s Verified and Audit-Ready Method<br>iComply offers a decentralized, privacy-first alternative to One Login. Using a combination of advanced document authentication, active and passive liveness detection, and secure 3-dimensional biometric face matching – all processed on-device via edge computing. This method exceeds the technical standards required by Companies House and supports global onboarding with full audit trails, real-time risk screening, and integrated KYB workflows. 
 
 
 What Happens if You Don’t Comply 
<p>Failure to comply with the new identity verification obligations will prevent new appointments from being registered. Existing directors or PSCs who do not verify within the designated transition period may face legal and financial penalties. In some cases, this may also result in being barred from holding a directorship or filing on behalf of a UK company.</p>
<p>Beyond the legal risks, there are reputational implications for firms that cannot prove the integrity of their leadership or onboarding processes. As identity verification becomes the new foundation of trust in UK company law, firms that fall behind will find it harder to attract capital, open accounts, and retain credibility.</p>
 
 How to Prepare Your Business 
<p>If you’re onboarding new directors or updating company filings this summer, the time to act is now. Here’s how to get ahead:</p>
 
 Encourage early verification: Don’t wait for the deadline. Begin verifying existing directors and PSCs now through iComply or your preferred ACSP. 
 Modernize your process: If you’re still manually collecting ID documents by email or storing PDFs in shared drives, now is the time to upgrade to a platform with real-time audit logs and secure data handling. 
 Avoid relying on unproven systems: With One Login’s certification issues and surveillance concerns, companies should carefully evaluate what method aligns best with privacy obligations and risk posture. 
 Train your teams: Ensure legal, compliance, and onboarding personnel are briefed on the new requirements and understand how to trigger verification workflows in your internal systems. 
 Centralize KYB and KYC: Director verification doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Integrating this into a broader KYB process will improve efficiency, oversight, and your ability to handle future regulatory changes. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why It Matters 
<p>Identity is more than a checkbox. For compliance teams and operations professionals, it’s the first gate of trust. Getting it right not only satisfies Companies House—it protects your business, your directors, and your clients from exposure, fraud, and reputational harm. These new requirements aren’t just about control. They’re about clarity. And clarity, when delivered through systems like iComply, means less friction, less stress, and fewer late-night compliance fire drills.</p>
 
 One Month Left 
<p>The countdown is on. In one month, director identity verification in the UK becomes mandatory. You can choose to rely on a centralized system or you can empower your firm with a trusted identity verification solution that puts security, privacy, and accountability at the core.</p>
<p>Start your free trial of iComply today. Stay ahead. Stay trusted.</p>

<p>At Bluesky, we're constantly working to help you personalize your experience. We know that staying connected means different things to different people, and sometimes, you just need to cut through the noise. That's why we're excited to introduce three updates to notifications:</p>
 
 Activity Notifications: Opt-in to receive push notifications from specific accounts. 
 Enhanced Notification Settings: Controls to fine tune which notifications you receive. 
 Repost Notifications: Receive notifications when someone likes or reposts posts you’ve reposted. 
 
<br>
 Activity Notifications: Never Miss a Post Again! 

  
  Tap the bell to receive push notifications from a specific account.

<p>Staying connected with the accounts that matter most to you just got easier with Activity Notifications, which let you receive push and in-app notifications directly from specific accounts. Never miss a breaking update, a new thought, or a live moment from the accounts you follow closely.</p>
<p>It's simple to enable these new notifications:</p>
 
 Navigate to a profile: Visit the profile of an account you love. 
 Look for the bell icon: If they have this feature enabled, you'll see a small bell icon next to the 'Follow' button. 
 Tap the bell: Press it, and you'll be able to enable notifications specifically for their new posts, and optionally, even their replies. 
 
<p>You can easily opt in to manage the list of people you're receiving "Activity Notifications" from at any time by going to Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Activity Notifications.</p>
 
  <p>For posters: if you want to keep things more mellow, you have the option to disable this feature entirely, or enable it only for people you follow, by going to Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Allow others to get notified of your posts.</p>
 
<br>
 Enhanced Notification Settings: Take Charge of Your Notifications 

  
  Press the settings icon in the top right of your notifications to fine-tune what you receive.

<p>We’re rolling out new controls over the notifications you receive. Head over to Settings &gt; Notifications to fine-tune your preferences. You can now choose to receive notifications from:</p>
 
 Everyone: Stay in the loop with all interactions. 
 People you follow: Filter out the noise and focus on your close connections. 
 No One: For when you need a moment of peace and quiet. 
 
<p>Here are the notification types you can now customize:</p>
 
 Replies: Control who can notify you when they reply to your posts. 
 Mentions: Decide when you're pinged for a mention. 
 Quotes: Manage notifications for posts that quote yours. 
 Likes: Get notified when someone likes your posts. 
 Reposts: See when your posts are reposted. 
 New followers: Keep track of your growing audience. 
 Likes of your reposts: Get feedback on the content you curate. 
 Reposts of your reposts: See how far your shared content travels. 
 Everything else: This covers general notifications, like when someone joins via one of your Starter Packs, or verification notifications. We've kept this category flexible so we can add more helpful updates in the future. 
 
<p>You can also enable and disable whether you receive push notifications for each of these categories, giving you even more granular control.</p>
 
  <p>A Note on Priority Notifications: Our previous "priority notifications" feature has been replaced by these new, comprehensive settings. If you previously had priority notifications enabled, your settings have been seamlessly migrated to these new options. Changing your reply, mention, and quote notifications to "people you follow only" will have the same effect as priority notifications did previously.</p>
 
<br>
 Get Notified About Your Reposts! 

  
  You'll now receive notifications for likes and reposts of your reposts.

<p>Finally, we’re introducing a new improvement for those who love to curate and share posts: you can now receive notifications when someone likes or reposts content you've reposted. Of course, you can adjust these notifications in your settings, choosing to receive them from everyone, just people you follow, or turning them off entirely.</p>
<p>We believe these updates will empower you to shape your Bluesky experience to be exactly what you want. Dive into your settings and explore the new controls you have!</p>

<p>Have you ever stopped to think about how systems like banking apps, eKYC platforms, or even e-learning portals know whether the person verifying their identity is real — and not just a photo or a deepfake? In a digital world where identity fraud is growing smarter every day, verifying a face isn’t enough anymore.</p>
<p>Enter the liveness detection SDK, the invisible but powerful tool that ensures the face on screen belongs to a real, physically present human being.</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll walk you through what a liveness detection SDK is, how it works, why it’s a must-have in 2025, and how <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a> offers one of the most secure, developer-friendly solutions available today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Liveness Detection SDK? 
<p>A liveness detection SDK is a set of developer tools that allows businesses and developers to integrate anti-spoofing capabilities into their apps, websites, and digital workflows. It works in tandem with a <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition SDK</a> to verify not just the identity of a user but also their presence.</p>
<p>While facial recognition determines who the person is, liveness detection ensures they are real, not a printed image, video replay, deepfake, or 3D mask.</p>
<p>Liveness detection SDKs are particularly valuable in:</p>
 
 Digital onboarding and eKYC 
 Secure login and access control 
 Financial transaction approvals 
 Telemedicine patient identity checks 
 Online exam proctoring 
 
<p>Recognito build SDKs that use advanced AI, computer vision, and biometric algorithms to carry out liveness detection in real-time with ultra-high accuracy.</p>
<p></p>
 How Does a Liveness Detection SDK Work? 
<p>Let’s break this down into an easy-to-follow process that mirrors real-world use cases:</p>
 Step 1: Face Detection 
<p>The system identifies a human face in front of the camera using machine learning-based face detection.</p>
 Step 2: Visual Capture 
<p>The SDK captures a short video or a burst of frames to analyze facial dynamics.</p>
 Step 3: AI-Based Analysis 
<p>The AI model checks for key indicators like depth, blinking, subtle facial movements, skin texture, or even blood flow patterns.</p>
 Step 4: Spoof Detection 
<p>Based on the data collected, the system determines whether the image is real (live) or fake (spoofed).</p>
 Step 5: Verification Result 
<p>If the user passes the liveness detection for face recognition, the identity verification continues instantly and securely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process takes just a few seconds, with no manual intervention required. It ensures that digital platforms can operate 24/7 with a high degree of trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passive vs. Active Liveness Detection 
<p>A strong face liveness detection SDK usually includes both passive and active detection methods:</p>



Type
Description
Ideal Use Case


Passive Liveness Detection
No user interaction required. Relies on analyzing facial features, textures, and natural movements.
Seamless onboarding, user-friendly apps


Active Liveness Detection
Requires users to carry out specific facial gestures like eye blinking, head rotation, or smiling.
High-security environments like digital banking, border control



<p>Recognito’s liveness detection SDK supports both passive and active modes, giving organizations the flexibility to balance user experience with the level of security needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Is a Liveness Detection SDK Essential in 2025? 
<p>As fraud evolves, so must our defenses. Here’s why integrating a liveness detection SDK is no longer optional:</p>
  1. Prevent Identity Spoofing 
<p>Modern spoofing attacks use high-resolution printed photos, digital screen replays, or even AI-generated deepfakes. A liveness detection SDK stops them in their tracks by requiring real-time, live biometric data.</p>
  2. Real-Time Identity Verification 
<p>Whether onboarding a customer or authenticating a returning user, decisions are made in under 2 seconds without human review.</p>
  3. Seamless UX 
<p>No OTPs, no passwords, no frustrating forms. Users verify their identity through natural interactions or no interaction at all in the case of passive detection.</p>
  4. Regulatory Compliance 
<p>Industries like fintech, healthcare, and telecommunications are governed by strict KYC, AML, and GDPR rules. <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-biometric-playground/">Facial liveness detection</a> helps meet those standards while minimizing user friction.</p>
  5. Easy Developer Integration 
<p>Recognito’s liveness detection SDK comes with detailed API documentation, mobile and web libraries, and support for Android, iOS, and desktop platforms.</p>
  6. Cost Reduction 
<p>Automated identity checks reduce the need for human intervention, speed up onboarding, and lower overall costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Use Cases for Liveness Detection SDK Across Industries 
<p>Liveness detection SDKs are used globally across a wide range of sectors. Here are a few industry-specific examples:</p>
  Banking &amp; Fintech 
 
 Enable passwordless logins 
 Prevent fraud during mobile banking transactions 
 Speed up digital KYC onboarding

<p>Georgia Judge Blocks Social Media Age Verification Law Over Free Speech Concerns</p>



<p>A federal judge has blocked Georgia’s law requiring age verification for social media users, citing violations of free speech and constitutional protections. The law, which was set to take effect this week, mandated that platforms verify users’ ages and obtain parental consent for those under 16. Judge Amy Totenberg issued a preliminary injunction, agreeing with trade group <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/netchoice/">NetChoice</a> that the law restricts minors’ rights, hinders anonymous speech, and limits access to information. Georgia plans to appeal the decision, while this case adds to a growing list of similar laws halted in at least eight other states due to constitutional concerns. <a href="https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/post/judge-blocks-ga-s-social-media-age-verification-law-citing-free-speech-concerns/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7CvMQcohlWHUPghc6K8ZUUEpWivJPE2j8ylQXlQFRFUR-Z9YEeW39clrHg2gQHmEOA4by">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Cloudflare Shifts to Default AI Bot Blocking with Pay Per Crawl Model</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudflare/">Cloudflare</a> has shifted its policy on AI web crawling, now blocking AI bots by default unless explicitly permitted by website owners. This move ends the previous opt-out model and introduces a “Pay Per Crawl” system, allowing publishers to set pricing terms for AI data access. The change follows widespread adoption of the opt-out option by over a million Cloudflare customers and aims to give content creators more control in the face of increasing generative AI activity. Experts suggest the policy could significantly disrupt GenAI business models reliant on free web data, particularly amid growing legal scrutiny and competition. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cloudflare-blocks-ai-web-scraping/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CTqUEgQzAQKWBdxhIZ9tfHVjMEfgu_8wGzXpYxXkyLtsVcXJ4U2-Q08qVNPhSpZrAKseY">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Qantas Data Breach Exposes Personal Information of Up to 6 Million Customers via Third-Party Platform</p>



<p>A cybersecurity breach affecting Qantas has potentially exposed the personal data of up to 6 million customers, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and frequent flyer numbers. The breach targeted a third-party platform used by a Qantas contact center, though Qantas systems themselves were not compromised. The airline has notified relevant Australian authorities and continues to investigate the extent of the breach, which is suspected to involve the hacking group Scattered Spider. Financial data and login credentials were not accessed, and frequent flyer accounts remain secure. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/02/qantas-data-breach-sees-up-to-6m-customer-records-at-risk/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CTqUEgQzAQKWBdxhIZ9tfHVjMEfgu_8wGzXpYxXkyLtsVcXJ4U2-Q08qVNPhSpZrAKseY">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>South Dakota Enacts Broad Age Verification Law for Adult Sites Following Supreme Court Backing of Texas Measure</p>



<p>Following a recent Supreme Court decision upholding Texas’ age verification law for pornographic websites, South Dakota is implementing a similar law requiring all sites that regularly host adult content to deploy age verification or estimation technology. Unlike Texas’ law, which applies only if a third of a site’s content is adult in nature, South Dakota’s legislation imposes no such threshold. Supporters, including Attorney General Marty Jackley, cite the Supreme Court’s decision as validation, while critics, such as the ACLU and Justice Elena Kagan in her dissent, warn the measures could infringe on adults’ First Amendment rights by overly restricting access to protected speech. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202507/south-dakota-to-push-ahead-with-age-verification-law-following-scotus-opinion?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CTqUEgQzAQKWBdxhIZ9tfHVjMEfgu_8wGzXpYxXkyLtsVcXJ4U2-Q08qVNPhSpZrAKseY">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>FinCEN Grants Banks Flexibility to Collect TINs from Third Parties under CIP Rule</p>



<p>FinCEN has issued an order allowing banks to collect Tax Identification Number (TIN) information from third-party sources instead of directly from customers, offering greater flexibility in meeting compliance requirements under the Customer Identification Program (CIP) Rule. The move, made in coordination with key banking regulators, reflects changes in how customers interact with financial institutions and incorporates public feedback from a 2024 request for information. While optional, the order requires banks to maintain risk-based procedures to verify customer identities effectively. The exemption aims to reduce administrative burden without increasing financial crime risks. <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-permits-banks-use-alternative-collection-method-obtaining-tin-information?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_2lAgNt-WocAz4mcJtwbIxV41JWoSSW2coOH-GjQDsnTeBLOE1PVs91PRz0SZNIjimSsW">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>German Regulators Push Apple and Google to Delist DeepSeek Over GDPR Breach Concerns</p>



<p>Germany’s data protection authorities have formally urged Apple and Google to consider removing the Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek from their app stores over alleged violations of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The request follows similar actions by regulators in Italy and Ireland and centers on concerns that DeepSeek inadequately protects European user data transferred to China. The German complaint cites GDPR Article 44, which restricts cross-border data transfers without sufficient safeguards. If upheld, the enforcement could lead to broader EU restrictions, with app store delistings significantly limiting DeepSeek’s presence in the region. <a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/germany-urges-apple-google-to-block-chinese-ai-app-deepseek/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_2lAgNt-WocAz4mcJtwbIxV41JWoSSW2coOH-GjQDsnTeBLOE1PVs91PRz0SZNIjimSsW">(Source)</a></p>

 Aergo Talks #15 — AMA&nbsp;Recap <p>This week’s Aergo Talks was a smaller, more casual session, giving the team a chance to answer pre-submitted community questions and speak more freely about what’s happening behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p> 1. HPP Launch Is Coming Sooner Than&nbsp;Expected <p>The news that HPP is arriving sooner than expected is a major win for the community and the broader ecosystem. Initially scheduled for Q4, the timeline has now been accelerated to Q3 thanks to strong alignment across product, engineering, and strategic planning. This early delivery not only reflects the team’s execution capability but also signals growing momentum behind the shift from traditional infrastructure to AI-native intelligence.</p><p>There is no official launch date yet. As Ben explained, setting a launch date too early doesn’t make sense for a digital-native Web3 platform, which operates with more flexibility than traditional industries. But the key takeaway is clear: the team is ahead of plan, and what was once months away is now just around the corner. It’s a strong signal that HPP is gaining momentum and entering the final phase of readiness.</p> 2. About Upcoming Partnerships <p>Community members asked when new partnerships would be announced. Ben clarified that there is no fixed announcement schedule. Instead, the team forms partnerships when they make sense for the product and support the long-term goals of&nbsp;HPP.</p><p>Rather than focusing on announcing partnerships regularly, the priority is working with the right partners at the right time. As HPP grows, more projects are expected to build on it, but announcements will come when they are&nbsp;ready.</p> 3. What’s the Vision for&nbsp;HPP? <p>HPP is about bringing Aergo into the AI era. Ben shared that the team is evolving Aergo’s foundation in two key&nbsp;ways.</p><p>First, HPP is being built to support AI-powered agents and decentralized logic, a major leap from traditional smart contracts. Second, the network encourages developers to build directly on the shared utility layer, instead of launching new Layer 2 tokens for every use&nbsp;case.</p><p>This makes the token more useful, the ecosystem more cohesive, and the developer experience more scalable.</p> 4. Robinhood and&nbsp;Arbitrum <p>One question asked whether Robinhood’s move to launch stock trading on Arbitrum has anything to do with Aergo or HPP. Ben confirmed there is no connection. While Aergo collaborates with Arbitrum, there is no direct involvement in that initiative.</p> 5. Looking&nbsp;Ahead <p>Aergo is evolving quickly into HPP, and the momentum is building. Projects like ArenAI (AI-native trading platform) and Noösphere (off-chain coordination and agent SDKs) are actively in development. The HPP mainnet rollout is on track for Q3, and infrastructure partnerships with EigenLayer, Arbitrum, and Conduit are already forming the backbone of what HPP will&nbsp;become.</p><p>As these pieces come together, Aergo will no longer be seen as just an enterprise blockchain. It will stand alongside the growing category of AI-native crypto protocols.</p><p>Ben summed it up clearly: “We’re not just participating in the AI conversation. We’re building the stack that makes it possible.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-15-ama-recap-f97a67d3c119">Aergo Talks #15 — AMA Recap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As the U.S. reshapes its compliance landscape—tightening some rules while loosening others—iComply equips regulated firms with the infrastructure to lead. From stablecoin frameworks and BOI reporting to KYB automation and fraud detection, compliance remains the backbone of financial freedom.</p>
<p>July 4th is excellent opportunity to take a moment and reflect on the systems that make financial freedom possible.</p>
<p>In 2025, the U.S. compliance landscape is evolving rapidly. Some frameworks are changing rapidly, like the Corporate Transparency Act and new stablecoin legislation. Others are being challenged, dismantled, or reinterpreted, such as elements of Operation Chokepoint and state-by-state approaches to privacy and crypto regulation.</p>
<p>This blend of innovation and deregulation reflects the core tension in American markets: freedom and responsibility. And compliance sits squarely at the intersection of both.</p>
 
 Innovation at the Heart of Financial Integrity 
<p>This year, the U.S. Senate advanced landmark stablecoin legislation that would require issuers to meet strict reserve, audit, and licensing requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act. At the same time, FinCEN’s Corporate Transparency Act came into force, obligating millions of legal entities to report beneficial ownership information under the new BOI rule. These measures signal a renewed focus on transparency and financial crime prevention, even as the broader regulatory narrative shifts.</p>
<p>Where does that leave firms operating in or entering the U.S. market?</p>
<p>Caught between rising expectations for digital oversight and growing scrutiny of enforcement overreach, the winners will be those who can move fast and still prove trust.</p>
<p>That’s where iComply comes in.</p>
 Case Study: Alt5 Sigma 
<p>Alt5 Sigma, a U.S.-based provider of digital asset infrastructure, offers crypto-as-a-service for banks, financial institutions, and fintechs. With increasing demand from traditional institutions to offer digital assets, Alt5 needed a compliance engine that could keep pace with product development – without sacrificing the integrity required to establish themselves as industry leaders in compliance.</p>
<p>By integrating iComply, Alt5 gained:</p>
 
 
<p>Modular onboarding portals for both individuals and entities</p>
 
 
<p>Real-time KYB and UBO workflows aligned with BOI requirements</p>
 
 
<p>Sanctions, PEP, and adverse media screening with full audit trails</p>
 
 
<p>Advanced device fingerprinting, geolocation, and behavioural fraud analytics</p>
 
 
<p>Whether issuing digital assets, onboarding institutions, or responding to regulators – Alt5’s full AML readiness has fuelled growth and allowed them to build market trust at scale.</p>
 
 Built for Both Stability and Change 
<p>At iComply, we recognize that compliance is about building the infrastructure that lets innovation thrive without compromising accountability.</p>
<p>That’s why we built our platform to be:</p>
 
 
<p>BOI-Ready: iComply automates beneficial ownership collection and reporting for entities covered under the Corporate Transparency Act – providing KYB and UBO workflows tailored to U.S. disclosure requirements.</p>
 
 
<p>Fraud-Aware: With device fingerprinting, geolocation, and behavioural analytics, we help firms detect fraud before it happens.</p>
 
 
<p>Edge-Secure: Our use of edge computing ensures personal data is processed and encrypted locally, giving U.S. firms privacy compliance by design—without relying on overseas servers or risky third-party subprocessors.</p>
 
 
 
 The Freedom to Lead 
<p>Independence isn’t just about autonomy – it’s about stewardship. The freedom to innovate means little without the responsibility to protect your clients, your institution, and your market.</p>
<p>This July 4th, as American firms navigate an evolving patchwork of regulatory clarity and ambiguity, we offer a simple proposition: compliance isn’t a constraint. It’s your competitive edge.</p>
<p>Happy Independence Day from the team at iComply.</p>

<p>London, July 3, 2025  – <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, today announces its strategic partnership with <a href="https://keyless.io/">Keyless</a>, a leader and pioneer in privacy-preserving biometric authentication, signifying a significant step in the future of digital identity security.</p>



<p>This collaboration integrates IDnow’s robust range of identity verification and digital signature solutions with Keyless’ biometric multi-factor authentication technology. Organizations can now enroll customers with IDnow and authenticate them with Keyless, introducing the concept of Continuous Trust. When a high-risk action occurs – like changing personal details or recovering an account – the biometric Keyless captures for authentication is matched against the biometric IDnow captured during signup.</p>



<p>In an era where digital interactions are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated threats, such as deepfakes and AI-driven fraud, the need for seamless and secure digital identity has never been more critical. IDnow’s commitment to embedding trust at every stage of the digital experience aligns seamlessly with Keyless’ innovative approach to biometric authentication, which ensures user privacy by eliminating the need to store biometric data.</p>



<blockquote><p>Trust is no longer a one-time checkpoint but a continuous process. Our partnership with Keyless enhances our ability to fight emerging fraud typologies amid a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, ensuring that digital identities remain secure and trustworthy throughout their lifecycle.</p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Keyless delivers multi-factor authentication in under 300 milliseconds by checking both the user’s face and their device was the one used during enrollment. It combines this with a unique cryptographic approach that transforms all biometric data into a non-PII format, guaranteeing user privacy. By layering privacy-first authentication from Keyless with IDnow’s flexible verification capabilities, organizations gain a future-ready solution that evolves with new threats, user behaviors, and regulatory demands.</p>



<blockquote><p>One of the biggest questions we get is whether users need to enroll twice – with the IDV and with Keyless. Until recently, the answer was yes. But what’s pivotal about the partnership with IDnow is that we can silently enroll users into Keyless during the IDnow verification flow. It’s a game changer for reducing friction.</p>Fabian Eberle, COO and Co-founder of Keyless</blockquote>



<p>This partnership is particularly significant for industries where security and compliance are paramount, such as banking, fintech, and healthcare. By integrating technologies, IDnow and Keyless offer a scalable, intelligent trust framework that not only meets current regulatory standards but is also adaptable to future challenges.</p>

				  The partnership will focus on Indicio’s Proven Auth, a simple way to use powerful Verifiable Credentials for single sign on, account access and management, and protection against phishing.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 Tokyo and Seattle: Indicio and <a href="https://www.nippon-rad.co.jp/en/">Nippon RAD Inc.</a> (TSE: 4736) are pleased to announce that they have <a href="https://www.nippon-rad.co.jp/ir/release/data/20250623.php">entered a strategic partnership,</a> combining Indicio’s market-leading decentralized identity and authenticated biometric technology with Nippon RAD Inc.’s expertise in systems integration and enterprise solutions<p></p>
<p>The partnership will focus on making <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-auth/">Indicio Proven Auth</a> available to the Japanese market.</p>
<p>Against a background in <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/use-case-how-indicio-proven-can-help-to-stop-account-takeovers-in-securities-trading/">phishing attacks and identity fraud</a>, Proven Auth removes a key weakness in account access and systems login by replacing usernames and logins with tamper-proof <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-2/">Verifiable Credentials</a> for seamless, cryptographic authentication and policy-based access management.</p>
<p>Proven Auth enables companies and organizations to issue Verifiable Credentials and define granular access policies based on role, time, device, or other criteria. This removes the need for third-party identity management or API calls to check centralized data.</p>
<p>Instead, tamper-proof digital identity is fully portable, bound to a person and their device, and can even incorporate biometrics for the highest level of digital identity assurance. This unique combination of features makes Proven Auth more powerful and cost effective than other authentication solutions.</p>
<p>“Customers and businesses need a 21st century digital identity technology that can solve current security weaknesses, protect people’s data and privacy, and deliver better user experiences — all in a cost effective way,” said Heather C. Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “And this is what they get with Proven Auth. It’s a simple, elegant, and streamlined way to manage identity and data — and it provides a foundation for companies and organizations to develop new seamless products and services around portable, digital trust, along with the capacity for these solutions to interoperate globally.”</p>
<p>“We’re very excited to be working with Nippon RAD to bring this to the Japanese market. They have decades of experience building real-world systems for some of Japan’s top companies, and they know what it takes to deliver technology that works at scale. Together, we’re helping businesses move past outdated login systems and into something more secure and flexible.”</p>
<p>“Nippon RAD is committed to introducing secure, innovative technologies that help our clients,” said Michimasa Suzawa, CTO of Nippon RAD. “Proven Auth is a breakthrough in authentication. Indicio’s leadership in decentralized identity and credential security made them a natural partner. Their solution is robust, standards-compliant, and built for scale.”</p>

 Holochain 0.5.3 ready for use <p>Building on the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-148-major-performance-improvements-with-0-5/">big speed and reliability improvements</a> in past Holochain 0.5.x releases, Holochain 0.5.3 is ready for general development. We’ve taken feedback on user experience and made further improvements to startup time and gossip reliability.</p><p>The big changes in Holochain 0.5.3 are:</p>  Agents more quickly declare and share their ‘storage arc’, the region of the DHT they claim to be holding. This makes other nodes recognise them as an authority so they can start sending new data directly to them.  Nodes detect and remember offline peers now. If any peer is unresponsive, the node makes a note of this in their peer metadata and doesn’t try requesting data from them or gossiping until they receive a new agent info record about them (which online peers will publish every twenty minutes).  All DHT requests are now sent to three random peers in parallel, and the quickest peer to respond with data wins. (Note that this isn’t necessarily the most in-sync peer, although this has always been true of DHT gets. This is helpful for nodes that don’t hold any DHT data for the address being requested, such as mobile nodes, and for any DHT query with a GetStrategy::Network.) Previously one peer at a time was contacted, and if that peer was unresponsive or didn’t hold the data, the request would time out in 60 seconds and return no data.  <p>You don’t need to do anything special to update your project to Holochain 0.5.3. HDK 0.5.2 and HDI 0.66.2 are compatible with Holochain 0.5.3, so most projects could simply choose to update Holochain but continue using the same zome dependencies. But if you do want to update your zomes to use HDK 0.5.3 and HDI 0.6.3, you’ll need to also add one explicit dependency; read the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.5/?ref=blog.holochain.org#rust">upgrade guide</a> for instructions.</p> CI tooling changes <p>If you’re a regular contributor to Holochain repositories, we’ve introduced new org-wide policies and processes, enforced by CI workflows. All commit messages must be in the <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Conventional Commits</a> format, e.g., feat: Add new admin API endpoint ListFoos or fix!: Change serialization for delete_foo(). A new bot, <a href="https://docs.cocogitto.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">cocogitto</a>, will enforce these rules on a PR by posting error comments and blocking merge for any commit that doesn’t comply.</p><p>Conventional Commits will be used in two ways:</p>  The commit messages will be used to decide how to bump version numbers (see the Conventional Commits website for details).  The changelog will now be automatically generated from commit messages.  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/release-integration?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">release automation readme</a> for details on how commits and merges work now. I found <a href="https://github.com/holochain/release-integration/blob/main/pre-1.0-cliff.toml?ref=blog.holochain.org#L63-L75">this section of this config file</a> especially helpful in understanding how commit messages are parsed into changelog items.</p> Office Hours 25 June: mobile WASM support <p>During our last Office Hours call, the topic of WebAssembly runtimes came up — specifically <a href="https://wasmer.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Wasmer</a>’s support for mobile operating systems. We have supported various approaches in the past, including precompiled binaries for iOS (now removed) and an interpreted WebAssembly back-end. Some topics discussed include:</p>  Maintaining the interpreted back-end (<a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/introducing-wasmer-v5?ref=blog.holochain.org">WAMR</a>)  The challenge of pre-compiling WebAssembly bytecode to machine code and including in a package, which results in large package sizes  Supporting Google’s V8 as a WebAssembly back-end, which is currently supported by Wasmer, but only for 64-bit ARM devices  <p>This topic is super important, as most people’s phones are their primary computing devices, and we also happen to have a <a href="https://volla.online/?ref=blog.holochain.org">partner who makes mobile phones</a>. Discussions are ongoing, and we need your input too.

<p>Poker has gone from a casual card game to a full-blown entertainment genre. From solo Twitch grinds to live-streamed cash games with six-figure pots, poker has found a new identity online that appeals to strategy lovers, gaming fans, and viewers hungry for drama. And business is booming.</p>



<p>Millions now tune in not just to watch the hands unfold, but to follow personalities, break down big bluffs, and interact with players in real time. A recent <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inside-the-rise-of-poker-streams-big-wins-big-risks/id1676846015?i=1000705000717">episode of the Digital Social Hour podcast</a> laid out just how far poker streaming has come, featuring high-stakes moments, huge communities, and the growing role of poker as entertainment, not just a game of skill. Some streams even boast prize pools worth millions, with other popular streamers taking home up to $300,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That surge in popularity is encouraging rapid innovation. Poker content has evolved beyond plain hand reviews or tournament replays. Now, it’s personality-driven, visually dynamic, and constantly adapting to new formats. At the crossroads of this evolution are VTubers: virtual streamers who blend performance art, gaming culture, and digital creativity. With their rising popularity across YouTube, Kick, and even Web3 platforms, it’s only a matter of time before they get dealt into the poker game.</p>



 Poker in America: A Legal Patchwork Paving New Roads 



<p>To understand why poker streaming is such fertile ground for VTubers, it helps to look at the current poker environment in the U.S.—a legal maze that requires agility, creativity, and sometimes, a bit of boldness.</p>



<p>At the federal level, online poker is still technically prohibited. However, enforcement varies wildly, and many players rely on offshore platforms. To illustrate, let’s look at how <a href="https://www.americascardroom.eu/usa-poker/new-york/">online poker in New York</a> has played out. Since online poker has yet to be legalized, locals play on sites such as the internationally-recognized Americas Cardroom, which operates in a legal gray area by being based outside U.S. jurisdiction. These platforms process real-money games and offer the kind of liquidity that’s nearly impossible to match in state-run markets. This includes 24/7 access to massive tourneys, like their flagship Venom series, where prizes can exceed $10 million. Such reliance on trusted offshore sites is also the norm for most American online poker players, since only nine states currently legalize this sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the live scene presents its own brand of innovation. For example, <a href="https://dallasexpress.com/city/court-reinstates-dallas-poker-houses-permit/">poker rooms in Texas</a>, despite having some of the country’s strictest anti-gambling laws, have become hotspots thanks to a clever workaround. Instead of charging rake, poker rooms in cities like Dallas operate on membership fees, effectively creating private clubs. A recent court ruling upheld these arrangements, reinforcing the model and giving local poker a second wind.</p>



<p>This patchwork system of legality creates an ideal environment for content creation. Poker players are adapting fast, and streamers are even faster. Whether they’re beaming in from New York using an offshore platform or live-casting hands from a Dallas club, content creators have found ways to showcase the game without breaking the rules. Add VTubers into that mix, and you have a model that allows full creative freedom, even in restrictive jurisdictions.</p>



 Streaming Teams and the Rise of Poker Personalities 



<p>The content game in poker has matured dramatically in the last five years. What was once niche is now mainstream. And poker platforms know it.</p>



<p>For instance, Americas Cardroom launched its online team in 2024, including popular streamers. Originally <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/acr-poker-introduces-inaugural-acr-team-online-302213088.html">called ACR Team Online</a>, they now go by the Stormers, with members regularly sharing content on platforms like Twitch. This isn’t just a marketing push—it’s a recognition that the future of poker involves creators just as much as it involves players. These team members aren’t necessarily all crushers at the table. They’re storytellers, entertainers, and community builders. Their primary edge is connection.</p>



<p>In this world of brandable personalities, VTubers fit perfectly. The poker industry has long leaned into identity and style. Look at how Phil Hellmuth built a legacy on emotional outbursts, or how Daniel Negreanu used charisma and table talk to cultivate his fan base. VTubers take that same idea and push it into the future, allowing for characters that are larger-than-life, aesthetically unique, and made for modern internet consumption.</p>



<p>A fox-masked analyst who breaks down bluffs like a samurai? A gothic vampire who runs high-stakes satellites under the cover of darkness? With VTubing, there are no limits. The avatar becomes the brand, and in today’s competitive streaming ecosystem, standing out is the name of the game.</p>



 Why VTubers Make Sense for Poker 



<p>Let’s break it down.</p>



<p>1. Privacy with performance: Not every poker streamer wants to show their face, especially if they’re moonlighting, shy on camera, or just want to keep their real identity separate from their poker content. VTubers solve this beautifully. They can be expressive, animated, and memorable without ever going on camera.</p>



<p>2. Elevated engagement: The average poker stream is static—just a headshot and a screen share of cards. VTubers, by contrast, can react with motion, facial expressions, sound effects, and dynamic backgrounds. This keeps viewers more engaged during long sessions and slow hands. Dead air becomes prime entertainment real estate.</p>



<p>3. Cross-community appeal: VTubing originated in anime and gaming circles, but it’s growing fast across other verticals like education, commentary, and now, potentially poker. The online poker audience overlaps heavily with crypto, gaming, and fandoms that are already receptive to digital avatars. VTuber poker streamers wouldn’t be outsiders—they’d be pioneers.</p>



<p>4. Monetization beyond the table: Most poker streamers monetize via donations, affiliate codes, and maybe the occasional merch drop. VTubers, on the other hand, can monetize their characters directly through plushies, art, sound packs, stickers, and even meet-and-greets in virtual spaces. For poker content creators trying to grow beyond ad revenue, this opens a world of opportunities.</p>



<p>5. Narrative potential: Poker is filled with arcs—downswings, upswings, lucky runs, and soul-crushing bubbles. VTubers, with their highly customizable personas, can turn these moments into compelling content. Themed overlays, emotional reactions, fantasy backstories—they can build a poker universe that feels more like a show than a stream.</p>



<p>As explained in this <a href="https://unionavatars.com/vtuber-avatars-a-gateway-to-creative-expression/">article Vtuber Avatars: A Gateway to Creative Expression</a> about how these avatars can enhance content creativity and connection,&nbsp;VTubers are opening up new dimensions of identity and audience connection. If that’s true for gaming, there’s every reason to believe it applies to poker, too.</p>



 All-In on the Avatar Future? 



<p>The writing’s on the felt: poker is changing. And the next big chapter might be animated. VTubers bring a potent blend of creativity, anonymity, and audience magnetism to a game that thrives on expression and personality. They could lower the barrier for new streamers, provide fresh content styles, and attract new fans who might never have clicked on a traditional poker stream. Best of all, they add a layer of storytelling that can make every bluff, hero call, and bad beat feel like part of a larger narrative.</p>



<p>As iGaming continues to grow, expect poker platforms to embrace more experimental content and VTubers to step up to the table.

   Resilience is on my list of the top ten buzzwords of the year. Whether we’re looking at geopolitical turmoil, AI disruption, or yet another IdP outage, it’s clear that the infrastructure we’ve relied on for decades is straining under new (and not-so-new) pressures.

<p>“We’ve all heard the calls for more resilient digital identity systems.“</p>



<p>Heck, I covered that in the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/27/governance-decides-if-decentralization-works/">blog posts</a> I did a few weeks ago on centralization vs. decentralization. Resilience is on my list of the top ten buzzwords of the year. Whether we’re looking at geopolitical turmoil, AI disruption, or yet another IdP outage, it’s clear that the infrastructure we’ve relied on for decades is straining under new (and not-so-new) pressures.</p>



<p>The catch to this demand, however, is that resilience is expensive. And in standards development, it’s often treated like it’s free.</p>



<p>Identity professionals usually talk about resilience as a technical or operational problem, how to recover when something fails. In my early days as a sys admin, disaster recovery and business continuity were my jam, so I get it. But from a standards and governance perspective, I keep coming back to a different question:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of resilience are current standards actually enabling? And where are we still pretending flexibility comes without cost?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>oooooh, hard question!</p>

 Resilience is the wrong word if you can’t afford to change 



<p>Most modern identity standards build in some notion of flexibility. You’ll find language about “pluggable” trust frameworks, revocable credentials, and multi-source identity assertions. It all sounds great, on e-paper.</p>



<p>But in practice, very few implementers can afford to build and maintain all the branches that the standards suggest. Most systems implement the bare minimum required to pass a test suite (please tell me there is a test suite) or ship a product. The more complex the flexibility, the less likely it will be used or maintained.</p>



<p>This tension came up repeatedly in my recent blog series on centralization and decentralization. It’s not that one model is better than the other; it’s that resilience requires the ability to shift between these architectures. Shifting means you need a governance structure that can manage both states, not just technical plumbing that supports a theoretical toggle.</p>



<p>Governance is expensive, as is testing rarely used failover paths. Yet we talk about flexibility as if it’s a universal good. It’s not. It’s a luxury, and we need to be honest about that.</p>



 Most standards assume stable trust anchors 



<p>I want to be clear: assuming stability isn’t inherently bad. The Internet only works because we assume certain things, like DNS will resolve, certificates will validate, and revocation servers will be online. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">Turtles all the way down</a>,” as the saying goes. If you don’t trust anything at all, then you cannot actually use the Internet.</p>



<p>But most identity standards still assume that key pieces of the trust chain are always available and operating neutrally. Whether it’s SAML federation metadata, OpenID Connect trust frameworks, or verifiable credential issuers and resolvers, there’s usually no plan B.</p>



<p>When systems fail due to policy shifts, infrastructure outages, or organizational collapse, the standard itself rarely provides fallback guidance. At best, you’ll get some <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14">MAY</a> clauses. More often, it’s left to implementers to figure out what to do when their trust anchor disappears.</p>



<p>Some specs (notably in the decentralized identity world) are starting to grapple with this. But many others still reflect a stable-world mindset. That’s a mismatch for the world we’re actually living in.</p>



 Delegation, AI agents, and identity sharing are afterthoughts 



<p>What makes me sad is that we, the people working in tech, knew these problems were coming, and we kicked the can anyway.</p>



<p>Delegation has been a known issue in identity for years. We’ve seen efforts like User-Managed Access (UMA) define how to handle “on-behalf-of” scenarios, layered roles, and AI agent use cases. But they’ve remained niche, partly because the implementation complexity is real, and partly because the incentives haven’t been there.</p>



<p>Now we’re scrambling to retrofit standards that were never designed to handle autonomous agents, shared credentials, or multi-party authorization flows. And we’re trying to do it without breaking existing infrastructure that assumed a much simpler world.</p>



<p>If we want identity infrastructure that can survive the next decade, we have to stop treating delegation and agentic identity as edge cases. They’re central to how identity will work going forward, and they’re crucial to any conversation about long-term resilience.</p>



 There’s no such thing as neutral infrastructure 



<p>Let’s talk about government-issued credentials.</p>



<p>They’re often framed as the gold standard for trust, and for many high-assurance use cases (finance, travel, health), they are. But they’re also highly contextual. They encode the priorities, capabilities, and politics of the issuer. Not everyone trusts their government. Not every government trusts other governments. And, not every global corporation can figure out how to deal with all the government requirements, especially when governments contradict each other.</p>



<p>A system that assumes government credentials are always the best option risks becoming brittle. What happens when a user doesn’t have access to those credentials? Or when the trust in a government changes?</p>



 The DC API 



<p>This question is playing out in real time in the standards world. A <a href="https://github.com/w3c-fedid/digital-credentials/issues/246">recent discussion</a> about the <a href="https://w3c-fedid.github.io/digital-credentials/">Digital Credentials API</a> in the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/">Federated Identity Working Group</a> points out that not all wallets are created equal, and neither are the governance models behind them.</p>



<p>A government-issued wallet may want to authorize verifiers through its own mechanism, asserting tight control over how its credentials are used. A browser acting as an intermediary might conflict with that, unless a protocol allows the wallet to enforce its preferences. But for other, non-government wallets, such as those used in enterprise, education, or social scenarios, the browser might be the only line of defense, especially where verification risk is low and wallet quality varies.</p>



<p>This is where the fiction of neutrality breaks down. When browsers or OS platforms decide how wallets should behave, who gets trusted, and what protocols are supported, they stop being passive conduits and start shaping the structure of the ecosystem. And that has consequences for which identity models can thrive. (To be fair, I’m not sure they have a choice, given how they are held liable for when things break down, but it’s still a matter of consequences.)</p>



<p>Resilience, then, isn’t just about supporting many wallets. It’s about enabling multiple trust frameworks to coexist, even when their needs are in tension.</p>



<p>That means standards shouldn’t default to one “gold standard” credential or wallet model. They should support a plurality of issuers, governance structures, and levels of assurance, because no single model is durable enough to anchor every identity system, everywhere, forever. No one is going to “win” the wallet wars.</p>



 If resilience is the goal, we need better defaults 



<p>We often measure the success of a standard by how widely it’s adopted. And that makes sense; if no one uses it, it doesn’t matter how flexible or forward-looking it is.</p>



<p>But in a world where trust assumptions are increasingly unstable, we also need to ask:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Can this standard still function when the environment shifts? Can it support multiple deployment models? Multiple trust anchors? Conflicting governance approaches?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Adoption is essential, but it’s not enough. Standards that can’t adapt get ripped out when the world changes, assuming we pay the technical debt. That might not happen in year one. But over time, brittle assumptions break, and infrastructure that once seemed “standard” adds to the debt that’s breaking our industry.</p>



<p>If resilience is the goal, we need better defaults:</p>



 
 Defaults that don’t assume the trust anchor is always online. 



 Defaults that let delegation and AI participation evolve without rewriting the spec. 



 Defaults that recognize different types of wallets, verifiers, and issuers will operate under different rules, but they still need to work together. 
 



<p>And maybe we also need more standards participants with risk assessment experience (please and thank you), so we can start designing for volatility from the beginning, not just retrofitting it later.</p>



 Wrapping up 



<p>I’m not arguing that we need to abandon federation or centralized identity, or that VCs are the answer to everything. I’m arguing that we need to stop building identity infrastructure that assumes everything will go right.</p>



<p>Resilience isn’t about architectural preference. It’s about designing for a world where the map keeps changing. If we want our standards to hold up under pressure, we need to stop pretending that flexibility is free and start deciding where we’re willing to invest.</p>



<p>Because trust might be turtles all the way down, but someone still has to check on the turtles.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>(00:00) Let’s talk about one of the most common words in tech media today: resilience.</p>



<p>(00:37) In 2025, it’s everywhere. But when it comes to digital identity systems, what does resilience actually mean—and perhaps more critically, who pays for it?</p>



<p>(00:51) Many assume resilience just means flexibility. But building flexible systems isn’t cheap. Flexibility costs money, and lots of it.</p>



 



 Flexibility on Paper vs. Resilience in Practice 



<p>(01:13) Most modern identity standards suggest adaptability. For example:</p>



 
 Pluggable trust frameworks 



 Support for multiple issuers 



 Credential revocation paths 



 Selective disclosure mechanisms 
 



<p>(01:41) These sound like flexible, future-ready systems. But in practice, most implementers don’t have the budget, time, or political will to build beyond what’s required today.</p>



<p>(02:10) When deadlines loom or audits approach, resilience features—fallback flows, delegation models—often get cut. They’re seen as luxuries, not priorities.</p>



<p>(02:27) The result? When a major provider goes offline, everyone scrambles to fix what should have been planned for.</p>



 



 Resilience Requires Planning for Change 



<p>(02:46) In earlier blog posts on centralization and decentralization, I made the case that resilience isn’t just about choosing one architecture. It’s about adapting between models as conditions shift.</p>



<p>(03:08) But those shifts require governance, testing, and long-term maintenance—and few standards talk about that part.</p>



 



 What Happens When Trust Anchors Fail? 



<p>(03:18) Most identity standards assume certain things are stable: DNS, certificate authorities, federation metadata, DID resolvers.</p>



<p>(03:45) And most of the time, that’s a fair assumption. But not always. Trust anchors wobble—frameworks get deprecated, registries go dark, support drops.</p>



<p>(03:56) What happens to the systems that depend on them?</p>



<p>(04:06) Often, nothing is specified. The standard assumes uptime, not failure. Resilience needs to plan for volatility, not just stability.</p>



 



 Real-World Examples of Fragility 



<p>(04:24) Consider some common standards:</p>



 
 OpenID Connect Federation: Trust chains fail if any node is unreachable 



 SAML: Metadata URLs are assumed always available 



 Verifiable Credentials: Depend on persistent, resolvable identifiers 
 



<p>(04:59) These aren’t bad standards. They’re doing critical work. But they often lack mechanisms for handling breakage—when, not if, it happens.</p>



 



 Delegation Is a Core Identity Requirement, Still Underserved 



<p>(05:06) Delegation is a cornerstone of identity. We’ve known this for years.</p>



<p>(05:11) Parents act for children. Executives delegate to assistants. Spouses share insurance logins. Healthcare proxies access private records.</p>



<p>(05:30) And now, we’re adding AI agents to the mix—bots booking appointments, filling forms, accessing systems.</p>



<p>(05:46) Most identity systems don’t handle this. There’s no consistent model for “on behalf of,” no standardized scoping, and no way to validate consent.</p>



<p>(06:06) UMA (User Managed Access) aimed to solve some of this. But it remains niche—important, yes, but far from mainstream.</p>



<p>(06:21) Now we’re stuck retrofitting delegation into systems that weren’t designed for multi-actor flows or digital intermediaries.</p>



 



 Wallet Diversity: Who Governs the Gate? 



<p>(06:45) One of the most timely conversations today is about wallet governance.</p>



<p>(06:55) In the W3C’s Federated Identity Working Group, Issue #246 asks: how should different wallets—government, enterprise, personal—be treated by browsers and platforms?</p>



<p>(07:16) Should a government wallet control its credential usage? Should browsers enforce a uniform model? It’s complicated.</p>



<p>(07:29) Government wallets have strong policies. Social wallets may offer more flexibility—but with lower assurance.</p>



<p>(07:43) So who decides?</p>



<p>(07:49) When browsers mediate everything, they start shaping governance—intentionally or not. That creates platform lock-in and infrastructure fragility.</p>



<p>(08:01) If your wallet only works on Platform A, but not Platform B, we’re undermining interoperability—and resilience.</p>



 



 Supporting Governance Pluralism 



<p>(08:18) True resilience means supporting pluralism—multiple governance models, even conflicting ones.</p>



<p>(08:28) Standards can’t just hope it all works out. They need to explicitly support this diversity, or risk failure as soon as conditions shift.</p>



 



 Measuring Adoption vs. Measuring Adaptability 



<p>(08:37) In most standards work, success is measured by adoption.</p>



<p>(09:12) But adoption isn’t the same as resilience. A brittle standard can be widely used—and still collapse when a key component fails or use cases evolve.</p>



<p>(09:20) Conversely, a highly adaptable standard that sees no uptake contributes nothing.</p>



<p>(09:28) We need to measure both adoption and adaptability if we want identity systems that can survive real-world conditions.</p>



 



 Toward Risk-Aware Standards 



<p>(09:43) So how do we move forward?</p>



<p>(09:46) One answer: bring more people into standards work who understand risk. Not just technical threats, but governance risk, market volatility, and long-term trust dynamics.</p>



<p>(10:04) Resilient standards aren’t paranoid—they’re durable.</p>



 



 The Real Cost of Resilience 



<p>(10:18) Digital identity resilience requires:</p>



 
 Flexibility, but not as an afterthought 



 Fallback paths and pluralist design, not idealized assumptions 



 A willingness to acknowledge the cost of preparation—and invest in it 



 A design approach that accepts the world won’t always cooperate 
 



<p>(10:28) We don’t have to throw out everything we’ve built. But we do have to ask what breaks when things shift—and what we’re willing to invest to prevent that.</p>

             June 2025   
	 
		 
			 Real Estate Tokenization Takes Off in Dubai 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Dubai’s real estate market is breaking records.</p>
<p>According to data shared by Property Finder, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-real-estate-sales-tokenization-boom-may-2025?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--fzXbKNxCOHLOkWjOmXDCEVaSvnXQJAYXIyz8uGR59YgJSWLnuTm9-H-itkhyYeMvs9bRq">Dubai recorded AED 66.8 billion (~$18.2 billion)</a> in real estate sales across 18,700 transactions in May 2025. That’s a 44% year-on-year surge, driven by both local and international investor demand.</p>

		 
	 
     Source: Cointelegraph     
	 
		 
			<p>Yet for global asset managers, accessing this market remains complex.</p>
 The barriers global asset managers still face 
<p>While Dubai’s real estate market is booming, it remains difficult for global asset managers to access directly.</p>
 
 Legal complexity. Buying real estate in Dubai often requires setting up a local entity or relying on nominee arrangements. These structures are time-consuming, costly, and raise concerns about transparency and control. 
 Operational inefficiencies. Servicing investors, tracking ownership, handling subscriptions and redemptions, distributing yields, and maintaining compliance, is still highly manual in most setups. This creates friction, especially for cross-border investors onboarding and ongoing fund administration. 
 Limited exit options. Even when fractional shares are available, liquidity is often locked. Without proper secondary market infrastructure, redemption or transfer opportunities are rare, making the asset less attractive for both managers and investors. 
 
 How tokenization is changing the game 
<p>These barriers are now being removed.</p>
<p>Through tokenization and a local, reputational licensed fund administrator like Apex Group, asset managers can offer Dubai real estate exposure in a fully regulated and digital-native format.</p>
<p>Our solutions, which have now been integrated into the Apex Group’s services, allow asset managers to experience a one-stop shop experience and use the permissioned token standard&nbsp;ERC-3643 to enforce investor eligibility, transfer rules, and compliance logic right into their tokens.</p>
 Unlock what wasn’t possible before 
 
 &nbsp;Multi-platform distribution: List real estate tokens across multiple compliant distribution platforms 
 Improved liquidity: Enable peer-to-peer secondary market transfers under control 
 24/7 Access: Offer 24/7 subscription and redemption for open-ended real estate funds 
 Real-time tracking: Track all activity in real time for full auditability 
 
<p>For asset managers, this means faster launches, broader investor reach, and the ability to offer modern real estate products that meet today’s expectations for accessibility and liquidity.</p>
 Market demands are real 
<p>On May 1, MultiBank Group, MAG, and Mavryk announced a $3 billion deal to tokenize MAG’s luxury real estate to democratize access to high-end real estate and enable global investors to participate with full legal certainty. Then, on June 11, Dubai saw its second tokenized apartment sell out in 1 minute and 58 seconds, with 149 investors from 35 countries and over 10,700 waitlisted.</p>
<p>Tokenized real estate has found its product-market fit.</p>
 Why it’s working now: Clear rules from VARA 
<p>On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) updated its Rulebook to formally regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) under the new Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) classification.</p>
<p>The regulatory clarity is in place. The infrastructure is proven. The demand is there. The future? Real estate tokens will increasingly plug into broader digital finance ecosystems, including lending, automated market making, and 24/7 liquidity via compliant DeFi.</p>
<p>Dubai is showing the way, and we’re ready to help you lead.</p>

 The Threat is Real and It’s Here Now 
<p>On Friday, June 28, 2025, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fbicyber_alertthe-fbi-has-recently-observed-the-cybercriminal-activity-7344513662025428992--jMe">the FBI issued an urgent cybersecurity alert</a>: the notorious Scattered Spider hacking collective has expanded its targeting to include the airline industry. This isn’t a theoretical future threat, it’s happening right now. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/28/business/cyberattacks-airlines-fbi-criminal-group">Hawaiian Airlines confirmed a cyberattack on Thursday</a>, and Canada’s WestJet has been dealing with an ongoing breach since June 13. Both incidents bear the hallmarks of Scattered Spider operations.</p>
<p>For airline executives reading about yet another cybersecurity threat, this one demands immediate attention. Scattered Spider isn’t your typical cybercriminal group. They weaponize something every organization has in unlimited supply: helpful employees and IT systems that assume someone calling with the right story must be legitimate. While security teams spend millions hardening networks and patching systems, these attackers simply pick up the phone and ask nicely for the keys to the kingdom—and they get them.</p>
 Understanding the Enemy: Why Scattered Spider is Different 
<p>Scattered Spider (also known as UNC3944, Octo Tempest, and several other aliases) represents a new breed of cybercriminal. This loosely organized collective of primarily English-speaking hackers has perfected the art of social engineering at enterprise scale.</p>
<p>Their recent victims <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_Spider">read like a Fortune 500 directory</a>: MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-the-marks-spencer-breach-tells-us-about-the-next-era-of-identity-attacks/">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, Twilio, and now multiple airlines. What makes them particularly dangerous is their systematic approach to identity-based attacks:</p>
<p>Social Engineering Excellence: They research their targets extensively, often impersonating specific employees or contractors when calling IT help desks. They know company terminology, recent projects, and organizational structure well enough to convince even experienced support staff that they’re legitimate employees.</p>
<p>MFA Bypass Mastery: While many organizations believe multi-factor authentication protects them, Scattered Spider <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-320a">has developed multiple techniques</a> to circumvent these controls:</p>
 
 MFA fatigue attacks that bombard users with push notifications until they accept one 
 Convincing help desk staff to add attacker-controlled MFA devices to legitimate accounts 
 SIM swapping to intercept SMS-based authentication codes 
 Phone-based social engineering to extract one-time passcodes directly from users 
 
<p>Legitimate Tool Abuse: After gaining initial access, they use approved remote access tools and live-off-the-land techniques, making their activities difficult to distinguish from legitimate IT operations.</p>
 Why Airlines Are Perfect Targets 
<p>The aviation industry presents an irresistible combination of vulnerabilities that make it ideal for Scattered Spider attacks:</p>
<p>Call Center Dependencies: Scattered Spider specifically targets airline call centers, exploiting the high-volume, time-pressured environment where help desk staff process hundreds of authentication requests daily.</p>
<p>Complex Identity Management: Distributed teams across multiple time zones and locations create numerous potential entry points and make identity verification challenging across all touchpoints.</p>
<p>High-Stakes Environment: Thin operational margins and zero tolerance for downtime create pressure to restore access quickly—exactly the environment where security shortcuts occur during incident response.</p>
<p>High-Value Data: Extensive PII, travel patterns, cargo manifests, and operational data provide valuable monetization opportunities for attackers.</p>
 The FBI’s Warning: Attack Vectors Airlines Must Address 
<p>The recent FBI alert specifically highlights the tactics Scattered Spider uses against aviation targets:</p>
<p>Help Desk Infiltration: Attackers call IT support claiming to be employees who’ve lost access to their accounts. They use publicly available information about the company and specific employees to build credibility.</p>
<p>Third-Party Vendor Targeting: The FBI warns that “anyone in the airline ecosystem, including trusted vendors and contractors, could be at risk.” Scattered Spider often attacks less-defended suppliers to gain access to primary targets.</p>
<p>MFA Device Registration Abuse: Once they convince help desk staff of their legitimacy, attackers request that new MFA devices be added to accounts they claim to own.</p>
 An Identity-First Defense Strategy 
<p>Traditional cybersecurity approaches fail against Scattered Spider because they focus on protecting systems rather than verifying identities. When attackers can convince legitimate users or help desk staff to grant access, perimeter defenses become irrelevant.</p>
<p>The most effective defense requires securing the identity layer itself. Here’s how identity-first security addresses each of the attack vectors the FBI warns about:</p>
 Verifiable Identity Authentication 
<p>The Challenge: Scattered Spider succeeds because authentication systems verify what users know (passwords) or have (phones, tokens) rather than who they are.</p>
<p>The Defense: Identity platforms that require users to prove their actual identity through biometric verification tied to government-issued identification. When someone calls the help desk claiming to be an employee, the system can definitively verify whether the caller is actually that person.</p>
 Phishing-Resistant, Passwordless Authentication 
<p>The Challenge: Traditional MFA can be bypassed through push notification fatigue, SIM swapping, or social engineering.</p>
<p>The Defense: Eliminating passwords entirely and using FIDO2-compliant biometric authentication that cannot be phished, fatigue-attacked, or socially engineered. There are no push notifications to accidentally accept and no codes to read over the phone.</p>
 Identity-Bound Access Controls 
<p>The Challenge: Current systems often grant access based on device compliance or network location, which can be spoofed or compromised.</p>
<p>The Defense: Tie every access request to a verified biometric identity. Even if attackers gain access to approved devices or networks, they cannot authenticate without the legitimate user’s biometric signature.</p>
 Centralized Identity Governance 
<p>The Challenge: Organizations lose visibility into identity-related activities across multiple systems and lack consistent identity policies.</p>
<p>The Defense: Centralized visibility into all identity-based access events with detailed audit trails and risk scoring. Security teams can immediately identify unusual authentication patterns or unauthorized access attempts.</p>
 Real-World Implementation Scenarios 
<p>For airline security teams wondering how this translates into practical protection, consider these scenarios:</p>
<p>Scenario 1: Help Desk Social Engineering A Scattered Spider attacker calls the IT help desk claiming to be a pilot who’s lost access to crew scheduling while on layover. The caller knows recent route changes, mentions specific flights, and provides the pilot’s employee ID. With traditional systems, overwhelmed help desk staff often approve password resets and MFA device additions during off-hours when supervisors aren’t available, especially when the caller sounds stressed about missing a flight assignment.</p>
<p>With identity-first security: Any account changes require biometric verification that cannot be provided remotely by an impersonator, regardless of how convincing their story.</p>
<p>Scenario 2: Contractor Account Compromise Attackers target a ground services contractor to gain access to airline systems through the supplier relationship. Traditional vendor management often relies on basic password policies and standard MFA across multiple client systems.</p>
<p>With identity-first security: All contractor access requires the same level of identity verification as employee access. Even if contractors’ traditional credentials are compromised, attackers cannot authenticate without their verified biometric identity.</p>
<p>Scenario 3: After-Hours Emergency Access An attacker claims to be a maintenance supervisor who needs urgent access to aircraft diagnostic systems for a grounded plane. They call during the night shift when fewer security personnel are available and pressure help desk staff with operational urgency.</p>
<p>With identity-first security: Emergency access protocols still require biometric verification, preventing attackers from exploiting time pressure and reduced oversight during off-peak hours.</p>
 Implementation Considerations for Airlines 
<p>Regulatory Compliance: Airlines operate in highly regulated environments requiring <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">certifications</a> like FedRAMP High Authorization, NIST 800-63-3, ISO 27001, SOC II Type 2, and ISO/IEC 30107-1 and 30107-3. Identity platforms meeting these standards demonstrate they can handle the stringent regulatory requirements airlines face across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Operational Continuity: Identity-based attacks can ground flights and disrupt operations for days or weeks. The MGM attack cost that organization $100 million in operational disruption. Preventing such incidents protects both revenue and reputation.</p>
<p>Customer Trust: High-profile breaches erode passenger confidence. Airlines that can demonstrate advanced security measures for protecting personal data gain competitive advantage in an increasingly security-conscious market.</p>
<p>Security Architecture: Centralizing identity verification can streamline overall security architecture while improving protection levels, reducing the complexity of managing multiple authentication systems across diverse airline operations.</p>
 The Time to Act is Now 
<p>Scattered Spider’s expansion to airlines isn’t a future threat, it’s happening right now. With the FBI issuing urgent warnings and multiple carriers breached in the last month, every organization in the aviation ecosystem faces immediate risk.</p>
<p>Rather than detecting attacks after they’ve begun, identity-first security prevents them from succeeding in the first place by securing the identity layer that Scattered Spider targets. The question isn’t whether your organization will face an identity-based attack—it’s whether you’ll be ready when it comes.</p>

 So, you’ve decided to integrate digital signatures into your tech stack, but don’t know where to start. Here we help you understand the difference between an SES, AES and QES, and the importance of a QTSP. 



 



<p>There are many reasons why forward-thinking organizations are choosing to integrate digital signature solutions into their tech stack, but perhaps the most obvious is that digital signatures just work – incredibly well, for businesses and users, across most industries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, usage is <a href="https://forms.app/en/blog/25-eye-opening-e-signature-statistics-for-2025">increasing by the day</a> and will almost certainly continue to climb as per the collective driving forces – and adoption pushes – from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/amlr-explained-financial-services-need-know/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more information on the business and customer benefits of digital signatures in your industry, read <a href="https://www.idnow.io/?p=345006&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=345067">‘Here’s why 95% of businesses are using digital signatures to optimize operations?’</a></p>



 Not all signatures are created equally. 



<p>Although the purpose of a digital signature is relatively straightforward (linking a signer to a document), there are different types with different levels of security and legal assurance. Businesses tend to offer one of either Simple Electronic Signatures (SES), Advanced Electronic Signatures (AES) or Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) depending on the particular use case required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But which solution is right for you and your customers? Here we explain everything you need to know about making the most out of digital signatures in 2025.</p>



 Digital certificates vs digital signatures. What’s the difference? 



<p>The relationship between a digital certificate and a digital signature is fundamental to how trust and authenticity are established in digital transactions. According to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS</a>, a digital signature is defined as “data in electronic form that is attached or logically associated with other data in electronic form, and which is used by the signatory to sign.” A digital signature performs three core functions:</p>



  Authenticity: Confirming the identity of the signer.&nbsp;  



  Integrity: Ensuring the document has not been changed after signing.&nbsp;  



  Non-repudiation: Preventing the signer from denying they have signed the document.  



<p>A digital certificate is an electronic document that links a person’s or entity’s identity with a cryptographic key pair made up of a public key and a private key.&nbsp;It is issued by a trusted entity, such as a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-trust-services/">Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP).</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When someone signs a document digitally, they use their private key to create the signature, and the recipient uses the sender’s public key to verify it. As only the signer has access to their private key, it is almost impossible for someone else to forge the signature or for the signer to claim they did not sign.&nbsp;The digital certificate provides the assurance that the public key belongs to the sender.</p>

 Navigating the different types of digital signatures. 



<p>IDnow offers a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">comprehensive suite of digital signature solutions</a> to satisfy whatever the regulatory requirement or industry use case. Our solutions adhere to security and encryption standards, including Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to a) ensure the signer’s identity and b) enable trust in the signature. They also leverage hashing algorithms to prevent the signed document from being altered without detection. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lower levels of digital signature solutions (SES) are easier and faster to use, while higher levels (AES + QES) involve more steps but provide stronger guarantees.</p>



 Simple Electronic Signature (SES). 



<p>IDnow’s SES solution is the simplest and quickest form of digital signature we offer. It can be represented by a textual name at the end of an e-mail, a scanned signature, a ticked checkbox, or a click on an “I agree” button. Although legally valid, SES solutions cannot track document changes, or verify the identity of signers, only the ownership and authorization of the sending domain or email address. As such, this signature is best suited for no- to low-risk transactions or informal agreements such as terms &amp; conditions or internal protocols.</p>



 Advanced Electronic Signature (AES). 



<p>IDnow’s AES solution provides a higher level of security and authentication than SES. As AES links the signature to both the signer and the data in a way that alterations are detectable, it is suitable for medium to high liability risk transactions that require strong identity verification without the full regulatory weight of QES, such as permanent employment contracts, insurance applications, NDAs, powers of attorney, or privacy statements.</p>



 Qualified Electronic Signature (QES). 



<p>IDnow’s QES represents the highest security standard and is the legal equivalent of a handwritten signature across the EU under eIDAS regulation. Created using a qualified digital certificate from a Qualified Trust Service Provider, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/idnow-trust-services-ab-europes-newest-qtsp/">IDnow Trust Services AB</a>, a QES provides maximum legal certainty for high-stake transactions. It is non-repudiable and equivalent to a handwritten signature on paper. QES is commonly used where the law specifically requires the highest level of assurance, such as life insurance or government contracts.</p>

 5 considerations to help you select the right digital signature solution. 



  Regulatory requirements? What level of signature does your industry regulation require for your specific transaction type?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  What is the transaction value? Higher-value transactions generally warrant stronger signature types (AES or QES).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Risk profile? Consider the potential for fraud or dispute in the specific transaction context. While QES comes with an inherent scheme of storing proofs of a transaction, AES and SES require companies to record an audit trail of their own.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  User experience priorities? What experience do your customers expect? Speed, security or a balance of the two?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Budgets and deadlines? Although neither is likely to be the deciding factor as to why organizations would choose one solution over the other, SES and AES can typically be implemented quicker than QES solutions, while SES are considerably cheaper to implement.

<p>Have you ever thought about how digital systems know you’re a real person and not just a photo or deepfake? In a world where passwords are getting replaced by faces, ensuring the “liveness” of that face has become mission-critical.</p>
<p>Enter the face liveness detection SDK, the invisible gatekeeper protecting online platforms from identity spoofing and fraud.</p>
<p>Whether you’re in banking, e-commerce, healthcare, or edtech, real-time identity verification is essential. And that’s exactly where Recognito steps in with its cutting-edge facial liveness detection solutions.</p>
<p>Let’s uncover what this technology is, how it works, and why your business should care. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Face Liveness Detection SDK? 
<p>A <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">face liveness detection SDK</a> is a software development kit that lets developers embed anti-spoofing features into their apps, platforms, or websites. Powered by AI and computer vision, it analyzes facial cues to confirm if the person is physically present, eliminating the risk of spoofing with photos, videos, or deepfakes.</p>
<p>This SDK works alongside or as a part of a facial recognition SDK to strengthen biometric authentication by confirming liveness during identity checks.</p>
<p>Key technologies it uses:</p>
 
 AI-based face movement tracking 
 Skin texture and blood flow analysis 
 Micro-expression detection 
 Real-time motion monitoring 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Does Face Liveness Detection Work? 
<p>Let’s break down the process step by step, no jargon, just clarity. </p>
 Step 1: Face Capture 
<p>The system uses a front camera to capture live visuals of the user in real time.</p>
 Step 2: AI Feature Analysis 
<p>It examines fine details like skin patterns, facial depth, light behavior, and subtle movements to verify authenticity</p>
 Step 3: Liveness Detection 
<p>The face liveness detection SDK determines if the subject is real or spoofed using advanced algorithms.</p>
 Step 4: Decision Output 
<p>Based on the detection score, the SDK either approves or denies identity verification,&nbsp; all within seconds.</p>
<p></p>
 Types of Liveness Detection 
<p>Advanced SDKs like Recognito’s include two main forms of liveness detection:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Passive Liveness Detection 
 
 No user interaction needed. 
 Identifies minute indicators of liveliness, such as skin texture and natural movement. 
 Completely seamless and invisible to the user. 
 Ideal for frictionless onboarding. 
 
  Active Liveness Detection 
 
 Prompts the user to perform an action (blink, turn head, smile). 
 Helps detect presentation attacks. 
 Great for high-security scenarios like digital banking and eKYC. 
 
<p>Recognito offers both passive and active liveness checks, providing enhanced security and adaptable integration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Use a Face Liveness Detection SDK in 2025? 
<p>The stakes are high,&nbsp; identity fraud is getting smarter. Your defenses should be smarter too.</p>
 1.  Prevent Spoofing Attacks 
<p>Prevents attackers from tricking the system using images, recordings, or 3D replicas.</p>
 2.  Real-Time ID Verification 
<p>Get instant confirmation of user identity, no manual checks required.</p>
 3.  Seamless Integration 
<p>Our SDK supports Android, iOS, and web with robust APIs and developer documentation.</p>

<p>A Scattered Spider attack exploited systemic service desk flaws and weak privileged access controls. Here’s how to shut the door for good.</p>
<p>When news broke that Marks &amp; Spencer was compromised in a ransomware campaign tied to Scattered Spider, many assumed it was a case of internal failure. But the truth is more complex, and more concerning for retail CISOs everywhere.</p>
<p>M&amp;S, like many retailers, relied on a third-party IT provider to manage service desk operations. According to multiple forensic reports, Scattered Spider deliberately targeted this provider due to systemic weaknesses in their service desk processes, then leveraged privileged access to pivot into client environments — including M&amp;S.</p>
<p>In short: the attackers didn’t hack the retailer. They walked through a door left open by the service provider.</p>
<p>The breach went undetected for months after the initial February compromise, culminating in DragonForce ransomware encrypting VMware ESXi hosts on April 24th. The aftermath has been devastating: more than $400 million in lost profit and more than $1 billion wiped from M&amp;S’s stock market value.</p>
 The Supply Chain Identity Problem Is Getting Worse 
<p>This isn’t an isolated incident. By early May, luxury department store Harrods and fashion retailer Dior had been targeted in cyberattacks, while Danish food giant Arla Foods was hit mid-May. The M&amp;S, Co-op, and Harrods attacks have been linked to similar tactics, suggesting a coordinated campaign against UK retailers.</p>
<p>What makes these attacks so dangerous isn’t sophisticated malware or zero-day exploits. It’s the abuse of legitimate access and trust relationships. Scattered Spider is believed to be a decentralized network composed largely of native English-speaking young people who coordinate in real-time over Discord, Telegram, and underground forums, using social engineering rather than technical hacking.</p>
<p>The M&amp;S breach follows a predictable pattern: compromise a service provider with weak identity controls, inherit their privileged access to client environments, then move laterally to deploy ransomware. What’s particularly troubling is how the attackers used SIM swapping to bypass traditional forms of multifactor authentication (MFA), then tricked IT help desks to gain deeper access.</p>
<p>Once inside, they exploited M&amp;S’s Microsoft Active Directory to gain broad system access — a classic case of authentication bypass leading to total compromise.</p>
 Why This Matters for Retail CISOs 
<p>Retail environments are sprawling, fast-moving, and heavily reliant on third-party IT providers. Unlike organizations in financial services or healthcare, retailers often lack the security hardening that comes with heavy regulation.</p>
<p>This breach is a textbook case of supply chain identity compromise — where attackers bypass perimeter defenses by exploiting trust and privilege in the authentication chain. Traditional MFA, VPNs, and endpoint security can’t stop an attacker who already has legitimate vendor access.</p>
<p>The financial impact extends far beyond immediate losses. According to a recent survey, more than <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/100466-more-than-60-of-consumers-would-avoid-a-retailer-post-breach">60% of consumers</a> would stop shopping with a brand that suffered a security incident, while IBM estimates the average cost of a data breach is now <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-07-30-ibm-report-escalating-data-breach-disruption-pushes-costs-to-new-highs">$4.88 million per incident.</a></p>
 How Modern Identity-Based Authentication Stops These Attacks 
<p>As the M&amp;S breach demonstrates, authentication built around credentials, devices, or even basic biometrics isn’t enough. Attackers can steal credentials, compromise devices, and even register fraudulent biometrics if they have administrative access.</p>
<p>The solution requires identity-based authentication that verifies the human behind every login, not just what they possess or know. Here’s how 1Kosmos addresses the three critical vulnerabilities exposed in the M&amp;S breach:</p>
<p>1. Identity-First Authentication — Not Just Credentials</p>
<p>Traditional MFA relies on “something you know, something you have, something you are.” But Scattered Spider has proven they can compromise all three. Anyone with administrative access or successful SIM swap can register things like user biometrics to any device—or set up an alternative identity provider to bypass authentication measures altogether.</p>
<p>1Kosmos takes a different approach. Our platform uses machine-verified identity proofing tied to government-issued credentials, combined with live biometric verification that detects presentation attacks including deepfakes. The private key of a matched public-private pair in the user’s device serves as the possession factor, while a live facial scan provides the inherence element — with 99.9% accuracy in confirming the authorized user’s identity.</p>
<p>2. Verified Privileged Access Controls</p>
<p>In the M&amp;S breach, TCS allegedly handed over privileged access without proper verification processes. With 1Kosmos, privileged access cannot be granted without a re-authenticated, identity-verified session, regardless of the requesting party’s VPN connection or claimed authority.</p>
<p>Our solution integrates with existing privileged access management systems to ensure every high-risk action requires fresh identity verification — not just inherited trust from a service provider.</p>
<p>3. Zero Trust Extended to Vendors</p>
<p>The traditional model of trusting third-party service desks is fundamentally broken. 1Kosmos enforces continuous identity assurance and step-up authentication based on risk, device, location, and behavior — even for trusted service providers.</p>
<p>This approach would have prevented the M&amp;S breach by requiring fresh identity verification for any privileged actions, regardless of TCS’s existing access agreements.</p>
 The Bottom Line: Retailers Can’t Afford to Outsource Trust 
<p>The M&amp;S breach isn’t just a cautionary tale — it’s a preview of what’s coming for every retailer that hasn’t modernized their identity infrastructure. Google was warning there are signs Scattered Spider may be moving on from UK retailers and pivoting to direct cyber-attacks against retail sector targets in the US.</p>
<p>As these attacks demonstrate, your security is only as strong as your weakest vendor’s identity controls. Traditional authentication methods that rely on credentials, devices, or basic biometrics simply can’t defend against social engineering attacks that compromise the authentication process itself.</p>
<p>1Kosmos provides the only NIST, FIDO2, and FedRAMP High certified platform that combines indisputable digital identity proofing with advanced biometrics and passwordless authentication. Our solution ensures that every access request, whether from employees, contractors, or vendors, is verified against a live human identity, not just inherited trust relationships.</p>
<p>The next supply chain attack is already being planned, and they’re counting on inherited trust to get them in.</p>

<p>Social media is cool for connecting and sharing content, but it’s a high-risk place for being tracked and scammed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers">FTC</a> calls social media “a golden goose for scammers”, and rails against the platforms’ collection and monetization of users’ personal data which “endanger people’s privacy, threaten their freedoms, and expose them to a host of harms, from identity theft to stalking.” </p>



<p>Social Media Day this June 30 is a good time to rethink how you manage your social media safety and privacy—and let <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo all-in-one privacy app</a> keep you safe on social media even if there’s a data breach.</p>



 What are the privacy and safety risks on social media? 



<p>Social media presents two massive safety risks: <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/#:~:text=A%20data%20breach%20is%20a,without%20permission%20or%20is%20lost.">data breaches</a> from malicious actors, and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers">data surveillance</a> from the platforms themselves. From both, you face significant harm to your personal safety, money, and reputation.</p>



 Data breaches of social media platforms 



<p>Data breaches happen when data troves like those kept by the social media giants are actively stolen and used maliciously for crimes such as identity theft, credit card fraud, phishing schemes, and other unauthorized access to accounts. This is in addition to the social media scams that are already rife: Globally, <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/34-Cybersecurity-Statistics-to-Lose-Sleep-Over-in-2020">30.5%</a> of all <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_au/what-is/phishing/social-media-phishing.html">phishing attacks</a> were via social media in 2024, and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers">one-quarter</a> of all people who reported losing money to fraud since 2021 said it started on social media.</p>



<p>In the first half of 2024, the number of data breach victims surpassed <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/latest-alerts/">1 billion—a 490 per cent increase</a> from the same time in 2023.</p>



<p>Some of the largest data breaches of all time have been via social media and exposed billions of user records, including:</p>



 
 The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/01/23/massive-26-billion-record-leak-dropbox-linkedin-twitterx-all-named/">“mother of all data breaches”</a>—the 2024 discovery of a 12-terabyte database containing 26 billion leaked data records from users of Chinese messaging giant Tencent; social media platform Weibo; platforms and services such as Twitter, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Adobe, Canva and Telegram; and various U.S. and other government organizations<br> 



 The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/technology/yahoo-hack-3-billion-users.html">2013–2106 breaches of Yahoo</a> which exposed highly sensitive personal information from over 3 billion user accounts and still holds the record for the most people affected by breach of a social media platform<br> 



 The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/09/986005820/after-data-breach-exposes-530-million-facebook-says-it-will-not-notify-users">April 2021 discovery of an earlier attack on Facebook</a> which was one of its largest (Facebook has had data breaches since 2012), which leaked the names, phone numbers, account names, and passwords of over 530 million people<br> 



 The high-profile<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election"> Facebook/Cambridge Analytica attack</a>, which saw British consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica,&nbsp;harvest and sell data&nbsp;from 50–90 million user accounts on Facebook<br> 



 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2021/06/29/details-on-700-million-linkedin-users-for-sale-on-notorious-hacking-forum/">LinkedIn’s April 2021 breach</a> of about 700 million users’ identities or around 93% of the total user base at the time<br> 



 The <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-selling-data-of-538-million-weibo-users/">March 2020 data breach</a> of one of China’s largest social media platforms, Sina Weibo, in which 538 million user account details were stolen and sold on the dark web<br> 



 The data breach of early social media platform <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/myspace-accounts-hacked/">MySpace</a>, with 360 million compromised accounts.<br> 
 



<p></p>



 Data surveillance on social media 



<p>But data breaches are only part of the social media risk story. In 2024 the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-staff-report-finds-large-social-media-video-streaming-companies-have-engaged-vast-surveillance">FTC</a> found that all the major social media and video streaming companies “harvest an enormous amount of Americans’ personal data and monetize it to the tune of billions of dollars a year.” This isn’t news, but it’s another credible confirmation of the global <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/#:~:text=High%20profile%2C%20significant%2C%20and%20regular,do%20so%20if%20they%20can.">data privacy crisis</a>.</p>



Source: <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-staff-report-finds-large-social-media-video-streaming-companies-have-engaged-vast-surveillance">FTC, 2024</a>



<p>The FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-staff-report-finds-large-social-media-video-streaming-companies-have-engaged-vast-surveillance">found</a>:</p>



 
 Companies collect and indefinitely keep <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">troves of data</a>, including information from <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a>, and about both users and non-users of their platforms.<br> 



 Many companies share the data, which raises “serious concerns regarding the adequacy of the companies’ data handling controls and oversight”.<br> 



 Some companies “deployed privacy-invasive tracking technologies, such as pixels” to serve ads to users based on preferences and interests.<br> 



 Users and non-users had little or no way to opt out of how their data was used by these automated systems.<br> 



 Companies that “amass significant amounts of user data may be able to achieve market dominance, which may lead to harmful practices with companies prioritizing acquiring data at the expense of user privacy.”&nbsp;<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>But it’s not only social media platforms tracking and selling our data or “<a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>”: <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism/">many companies</a> engage in <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism/">surveillance capitalism</a>, even <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/your-bank-is-selling-your-personal-data/">banks</a>. What’s more, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a> grease the wheels of this <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a> by harvesting, manipulating and even misrepresenting consumer data and sell it to brands to <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-privacy-pitfalls-of-personalized-advertising/">hyper-personalize ads</a> and content.</p>



<p>Of course, these massive data stores are rife with privacy invasions and safety risks including unintentional data exposure, third-party access and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/datamining.asp">data mining</a>, identity theft and social engineering scams, and data breaches, as we’ve covered.Statistics show <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-shock-stats-prove-most-people-have-had-their-personal-data-stolen/">most people in the world</a> have now had their personal data stolen and it’s getting worse.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/6-common-social-media-privacy-issues">deep dive</a> from TechTarget on all the personal information that social media platforms and third-party apps collect about you and what they can do with it, plus how criminals can easily access all that information, is well worth a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/6-common-social-media-privacy-issues">read</a>. To stop yourself from falling victim to scams and to limit data surveillance of your life via social media, you really need a way to avoid giving your personal information to the platforms in the first place—and that’s where <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> can help.</p>



 Use MySudo to lock down your privacy and safety on social media 



<p>You can use MySudo all-in-one privacy app for social media in two ways:</p>



 
 Create an alternative digital identity called a Sudo just for your social media.<br> 



 Update your existing social media accounts with your Sudo credentials instead of your personal information.<br> 
 



<p></p>



 Create an alternative digital identity just for your social media 



<p>MySudo is built around <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>, secure and customizable digital identities or “personas”, which come with their own alternative contact details like <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-6-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone</a>, and secure communications capabilities like <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/did-you-know-mysudo-has-loads-of-advanced-messaging-features/">end-to-end encrypted messaging</a> and calling, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">virtual payment cards</a>, and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browsing</a>.</p>



<p>With MySudo, you can create a unique Sudo email address and phone number solely for signing up to and logging in to your social media accounts and never have to expose your personal email and phone number to the platforms.</p>



<p>You could even go one step further and create a separate Sudo digital identity for your work social media accounts and another Sudo for your personal social media accounts, separating the two for privacy and perhaps professional reputation purposes—whatever suits your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/4-steps-to-setting-up-mysudo-to-meet-your-real-life-privacy-needs/">real-life privacy needs</a>.</p>



<p>When you do this you harness the power of <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy-2/">compartmentalization</a>, a military-style data protection strategy which <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">MySudo makes easy</a>. Platforms will still track you and criminals will still try to scam you, but they’ll only have access to your Sudo information, not your personal information which you probably use for your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-sudos-can-give-you-a-second-chance-at-digital-privacy/">banking and medical information</a>, for example, and definitely don’t want to risk with your doom scrolling. &nbsp;</p>



 Update your existing social media accounts with your Sudo credentials instead of your personal information 



<p>MySudo is a great <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-sudos-can-give-you-a-second-chance-at-digital-privacy/">second chance at digital privacy</a>. Once you have created a dedicated social media Sudo, you could go in and switch out your personal email and phone number for the new Sudo login details. Remember, if your socials are breached, your personal life is safe. The scammers can’t steal your personal information or invade your personal life, and the platforms can’t link your personal email and phone number to your other online activity to build and monetize your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">social graph</a>.</p>



 Get started with MySudo for social media 



<p>If you’re ready to put MySudo to work for your social media safety (and for your other online and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/6-ways-to-do-life-without-using-your-personal-details/">real-life activity</a>), start by <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">downloading MySudo for iOS or Android</a>, and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-desktop/">MySudo desktop</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-browser-extension/">browser extension</a> for convenience, and then create a dedicated “social media Sudo”. Your Sudo will come with:</p>



 
 1 email address – for social media sign-ups and logins, end-to-end encrypted emails between app users, and standard email with everyone else<br> 



 1 phone number (optional)* – for social media sign-ups and logins, end-to-end encrypted messaging and video, voice and group calls between app users, and standard connections with everyone else; customizable and mutable<br> 



 1 handle – for end-to-end encrypted messages and video, voice and group calls between app users<br> 



 1 private browser – for using social media without ads and tracking<br> 



 1 virtual card (optional)* – for protecting your personal information and your money when you pay online; like a proxy for your credit or debit card or bank account.<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Once your have your social media Sudo, you can:</p>



 
 Use the Sudo email to sign up and log in to social media platforms. Almost every social media platform requires at least an email address to set up an account and log in. By using your Sudo email instead of your personal one, the platform – and scammers – don’t have your personal email; they only have your social media Sudo email.<br> 



 Use the Sudo phone number for verification.Most platforms require a phone number for two-factor authentication and account recovery. By using your Sudo phone number instead of your personal one, the platforms and scammers don’t have your personal phone number, only your Sudo phone number. They can only scam your Sudo phone number and because you know it’s your Sudo number and not your personal one, you limit any damage to only that Sudo.<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>If you want to go further, you might even think about:</p>



 
 Always accessing your social media accounts through the Sudo private browser. Your Sudo private browser stops ads and tracking by default<br> 



 Taking your sensitive conversations out of the platforms and into MySudo, where all <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/did-you-know-mysudo-has-loads-of-advanced-messaging-features/">messaging</a> with other MySudo users is <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">end-to-end encrypted</a>. All calls and emails with other MySudo users are end-to-end encrypted, too.<br> 
 



<p></p>



 Use MySudo, but follow these social media safety tips too 



<p>MySudo will take you a long way to social media safety, but it’s important you follow some basic safety tips, like these from the FTC:</p>



 
 Limit who can see your posts and information on social media. All platforms collect information about you from your activities on social media, but visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-protect-your-privacy-apps">your privacy settings</a>&nbsp;to set some restrictions.<br> 



 If you get a message from a friend about an opportunity or an urgent need for money, call them. Their account may have been hacked—especially if they ask you to pay by cryptocurrency, gift card, or wire transfer. That’s how scammers ask you to pay.<br> 



 If someone appears on your social media and rushes you to start a friendship or romance, slow down. Read about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-you-need-know-about-romance-scams">romance scams</a>. And never send money to someone you haven’t met in person.<br> 



 Before you buy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0020-shopping-online">check out the company</a>. Search online for its name plus “scam” or “complaint.”<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>To learn more about how to spot, avoid, and report scams—and how to recover money if you’ve paid a scammer—visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/scams">ftc.gov/scams</a>. If you spot a scam, report it to the FTC at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reportfraud.ftc.gov/">ReportFraud.ftc.gov</a>. </p>



<p>Here are some more tips:</p>



 
 Don’t post sensitive personal information, such as your home address or phone number. Sharing things like the names of your family, pet and school can give scammers the hints they need to guess your passwords or the answers to your account security questions.<br> 



 Be mindful of your location settings and avoid sharing excessive details about your whereabouts.&nbsp;<br> 



 Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication on all your social media accounts.<br> 



 Use private internet connections.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-vpn/">MySudo VPN</a> shields your location and IP address.<br> 



 Be wary of requests from strangers and don’t click on suspicious links.&nbsp;<br> 



 Be wary of third-party apps that request access to your social media account. And avoid social login&nbsp;(see more on that below).<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>If you discover your personal information was exposed in a data breach, quickly change your passwords, add a fraud alert to your credit reports, and place a freeze on your credit reports. More helpful advice is available at the non-profit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Identity Theft Resource Centre</a>.</p>



<p>You can also move quickly to download&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a>&nbsp;personal data removal service, part of the MySudo app family.</p>



<p>Clearly, it’s more important than ever to scroll and share safely on social media. <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">Download MySudo for iOS or Android</a> and protect yourself on the platforms.</p>

 ⚖️ Policy and Regulatory 



 



<p>Meta Wins Copyright Lawsuit Over AI Training with Books by Authors like Sarah Silverman</p>



<p>A federal judge has ruled in favor of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/meta/">Meta</a> in a lawsuit brought by 13 authors, including Sarah Silverman, who alleged their copyrighted books were used illegally to train AI models. Judge Vince Chhabria granted summary judgment, finding Meta’s actions qualified as fair use, noting the AI’s output was transformative and the plaintiffs failed to prove market harm. However, he emphasized the decision’s narrow scope, cautioning that future plaintiffs with stronger arguments could prevail. This follows a similar ruling favoring Anthropic and reflects ongoing legal scrutiny as tech firms face additional lawsuits involving other copyrighted materials. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/federal-judge-sides-with-meta-in-lawsuit-over-training-ai-models-on-copyrighted-books/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_AwNKZHtoKkfiDQagzMatUvcW9vi5rXwqx8vqOwK83EyXOzvHqpqwV5-7ElZ1JAKkH0Q6l">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Delegation, especially in the digital world, spans every sector and silo you can think of, from personal issues to business needs. A caregiver needs to manage prescriptions for an incapacitated family member. An executive assistant files expense reports on behalf of a CEO. An AI agent moves money between your bank accounts, ideally without draining your savings in the process. Real life involves multiple actors, multiple roles, and a messy, shifting web of consent and authority.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, most of our digital systems still behave as if we’re playing a single-player game. Delegation, the ability for one party to act clearly and securely on behalf of another, is not a nice-to-have. It never really was; just ask anyone who had to get into someone else’s accounts after that someone else passed away. But agentic AI has turned what was treated as an edge case into a foundational requirement for how we live and interact online.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/03/delegation-part-one/">first post on delegation</a>, I wrote about why this matters. Now let’s consider what today’s technical foundations offer and why what we have today isn’t enough.</p>



 OAuth: Great for Authorization. Awkward for Delegation. 



<p>If you work anywhere near digital identity, you know <a href="https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2">OAuth 2.0</a> (I’d like directly to the spec, but there are <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2615">SO MANY SPECS</a> in the OAuth family. It’s crazypants.). OAuth 2.0 is the backbone of how we let one service act on behalf of a user. It’s how you click “Sign in with Google” or allow a fitness app to access your calendar.</p>



<p>For basic authorization, OAuth is brilliant. But for complex, human-centric delegation? Not so much.</p>



<p>In most OAuth implementations, delegation looks like “Alice-to-Alice” sharing. Alice authorizes a service, and when that service acts, it looks like Alice herself is taking the action. There’s no clear, auditable distinction between actions initiated directly by Alice and actions performed on her behalf.</p>



<p>When the stakes are low, that’s fine. When delegation needs to be explicit, limited, and verifiable, you know, in healthcare, finance, or enterprise environments, it starts to fall apart.</p>



 RFC 8693: Token Exchange – Helpful, but Not Plug-and-Play 



<p>There is important work happening inside OAuth to handle more sophisticated delegation patterns.</p>



<p>RFC 8693 (OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange) defines a way to trade one token for another. It creates the foundation for services acting “on behalf of” a user and enables more traceable chains of authorization.</p>



<p>This is real progress. It opens the door to:</p>



 
 Services that act as authorized intermediaries, 



 Audit trails that reflect delegated authority, 



 Clearer boundaries between who initiated which actions. 
 



<p>But it has its own issues.</p>



<p>As shared by engineers working with these standards today, RFC 8693 is a framework, not a turnkey solution. It’s incredibly useful if someone does the heavy work of designing the exact policies, constraints, and usage patterns that fit a specific environment.</p>



<p>There are no general-purpose, plug-and-play implementations. To put it another way, RFC 8693 gives you the ingredients. It doesn’t bake the gluten-and-dairy-free-but-still-tasty cake.</p>



 OAuth 2.1: Important Cleanup, Not a Delegation Revolution 



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1/">OAuth 2.1</a> is currently moving through the IETF process; that means it is still a draft, and you shouldn’t think of it as a stable specification. It consolidates best practices from OAuth 2.0 and improves security by:</p>



 
 Requiring Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for all clients, 



 Removing risky flows like the Implicit and Resource Owner Password Credentials grants, 



 Tightening rules around redirect URIs to prevent common attacks. 
 



<p>These are much-needed improvements to make OAuth deployments more secure and consistent.</p>



<p>However, OAuth 2.1 does not introduce major new delegation capabilities. If you were hoping for a seamless way to model multi-actor delegation as a standard feature, OAuth 2.1 will disappoint you. It’s a maintenance and modernization release, not a redesign of delegation models.</p>



 What’s Still Missing? 



<p>When people talk about “richer delegation models,” they are typically looking for capabilities that OAuth alone doesn’t fully deliver today:</p>



 
 Contextual constraints: Delegating narrowly, following the model of “only access this resource, only for this task, only during this window.” 



 Clear actor chains: Recording “Bob is acting for Alice” rather than obscuring delegation behind a generic authorization. 



 Lifecycle management: Ensuring delegation expires automatically when the situation changes (e.g., a role change or time limit). 



 Auditability: Maintaining reliable logs that show exactly who acted, when, and under what authority. 



 Transitivity control: Defining whether and how a delegated authority can be further delegated to others. 
 



<p>OAuth, with extensions like Token Exchange and Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), can enable some of this when carefully implemented. (Those last three words should fill you with trepidation, just sayin’.) But it doesn’t guarantee it, and it leaves much of the structure up to each deployment. (What could possibly go wrong?)</p>



<p>That gap matters, especially as systems get more complex, regulatory scrutiny increases, and agentic AI becomes more common.</p>



 Exploring Other Delegation Models 



<p>Recognizing these gaps, others in the identity community are exploring additional models beyond pure OAuth:</p>



 
 <a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html">User-Managed Access (UMA)</a>: Built on top of OAuth 2.0, UMA allows resource owners to define fine-grained sharing policies. It offers strong concepts for delegation but has seen limited real-world adoption due to its complexity. 



 Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers (VCs and DIDs): These technologies allow an agent to present cryptographically verifiable proof of delegated authority. They are still maturing but hold significant promise for trusted delegation between humans, organizations, and AI agents. 



 Enterprise Mission Profiles: Some organizations are developing tailored delegation frameworks for specific industries, building on OAuth or PKI to meet regulated needs without relying on consumer-grade assumptions. 
 



<p>Each approach recognizes the same fundamental reality: digital systems must become much better at supporting explicit, constrained, auditable delegation.</p>



 Why I’m Writing About This 



<p>To be clear, I’m not one of the people writing these specifications. I’m not here to offer a new protocol or propose another working group. No, seriously, we do not need another working group. My goal is to build a bridge between people who have resources to throw at this problem and the groups working on the problem now. .</p>



<p>There is a growing group of implementers, architects, and security leads who are starting to notice the cracks:</p>



 
 Delegation models are messy. 



 AI agents are bumping into walls. 



 Critical systems are relying on brittle workarounds. 
 



<p>At the same time, important, thoughtful work is happening in standards bodies like the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">OpenID Foundation</a> and the IETF to address delegation challenges, but those efforts aren’t widely understood yet.</p>



<p>If you’re feeling frustrated that “surely OAuth already handles this,” or worried that your project’s AI agent has no clean path to delegated authority, you’re not wrong.</p>



<p>The people working on these specs know there’s a gap. They’re working hard to close it. They are amazing. But building better delegation models will take time, feedback, and collaboration from across the industry, not just inside the standards track.</p>



 Delegation Isn’t Solved Yet, But It’s Solvable 



<p>Delegation today is a patchwork of partial solutions. But it doesn’t have to stay that way.</p>



<p>With better tools and more attention to what real-world delegation actually requires, we can build systems that reflect the complex, messy, multi-actor world we live in. It’s not going to change quickly, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be focusing our attention on fixing the problems. </p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00]<br>Welcome to A Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Why Are We Talking About Delegation Again? 



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Welcome back. Today, we’re revisiting the topic of delegation, but this time we’re diving into the technical side—what today’s systems offer, why it’s not enough, and where the real gaps lie.</p>



<p>[00:00:41]<br>If you’re familiar with OAuth, hang in for 30 seconds. If not, no worries—here’s the short version:</p>



<p>[00:00:50]<br>OAuth is a protocol that lets you authorize one service to access something you control without handing over your password.</p>



<p>[00:00:57]<br>It’s why you can “Sign in with Google” or allow a calendar app to sync your schedule—without giving up full control of your account.</p>



 



 OAuth: The Backbone of Modern Delegation 



<p>[00:01:04]<br>OAuth is the underlying plumbing for online access delegation. When it works well, it’s great. But when it falls short (and spoiler alert: it does), it results in messy workarounds and real security gaps.</p>



<p>[00:01:25]<br>Originally, digital systems were built around a clean model: one user, one identity, one device, one intent. And while that worked for about 80% of use cases, the remaining 20%—where delegation lives—takes the most effort to get right.</p>



 



 Real Life Is Messy: The Rise of Multi-Actor Systems 



<p>[00:01:47]<br>Fast forward to today: real life is messy, with overlapping authority and complex actors.</p>



<p>[00:02:00]<br>Think about it:</p>



 
 A caregiver managing a family member’s medical appointments 



 An executive assistant filing expenses for a CEO 



 An AI agent managing your bank accounts (ideally without buying a Tesla) 
 



<p>[00:02:15]<br>Delegation has never been a “nice-to-have” feature. It’s always been critical—just ask anyone who’s had to manage a deceased relative’s online accounts.</p>



<p>[00:02:25]<br>Now, with AI entering the picture, delegation has gone from edge case to foundational design problem—and most systems aren’t ready.</p>



 



 What OAuth Gets Right (and Where It Breaks) 



<p>[00:02:39]<br>OAuth 2.0 is well-known in identity circles. It’s a powerful authorization protocol, especially for simple use cases like:</p>



 
 Signing in with Google 



 Granting apps access to calendar or contacts 
 



<p>[00:03:17]<br>But for complex, human-centered delegation, things start to fall apart. Here’s what typically happens:</p>



 
 Alice authorizes a service 



 The service acts 



 Logs show Alice did it—even though it was the service 
 



<p>[00:03:41]<br>That’s okay when the stakes are low. But when it’s an AI agent booking travel, paying bills, or managing healthcare? Not so much.</p>



<p>[00:03:52]<br>You don’t want to give your AI or family member unlimited, untraceable access.</p>



<p>[00:04:03]<br>But you also don’t want it blocked at every turn. Systems need to recognize that it’s acting with limited, delegated authority.</p>



 



 The Need for Rich, Constrained Delegation 



<p>[00:04:12]<br>Without rich, constrained delegation, you either:</p>



 
 Grant too much access and lose control 



 Or block useful actions completely 
 



<p>[00:04:22]<br>Neither option is ideal. And OAuth—at least as widely implemented—wasn’t designed for this kind of nuanced delegation.</p>



 



 RFC 8693: Token Exchange to the Rescue? 



<p>[00:04:32]<br>OAuth isn’t standing still. One key development is RFC 8693—the token exchange spec. It enables services to act on a user’s behalf with audit trails and chains of authority.</p>



<p>[00:05:06]<br>Sounds promising, right?</p>



<p>[00:05:06]<br>But here’s the catch: RFC 8693 is a framework, not a turnkey solution. It gives you the ingredients, not the cake.</p>



<p>[00:05:31]<br>If your project assumes token exchange will “just work” for delegation—good luck. You’ll need to profile it properly, define scopes, and create policies tailored to your environment.</p>



 



 What About OAuth 2.1? 



<p>[00:05:40]<br>OAuth 2.1 is in the works. It tightens up security and standardizes key improvements:</p>



 
 PKCE is now mandatory 



 Risky flows (like resource owner passwords) are removed 



 Redirect rules are stricter 
 



<p>[00:06:13]<br>These are great changes. But let’s be clear: OAuth 2.1 is a maintenance release. It’s not a new model for delegation.</p>



 



 What We Actually Need for Delegation 



<p>[00:06:39]<br>When people say we need “richer” delegation, they mean:</p>



 
 Contextual constraints<br>(e.g., access this resource for this purpose within this timeframe) 



 Clear actor chains<br>(e.g., Bob is acting for Alice—and the system knows it) 



 Lifecycle management<br>(e.g., permissions expire automatically with role changes) 



 Auditability<br>(e.g., logs that track who did what, when, and on whose behalf) 



 Transitivity control<br>(e.g., delegate-of-a-delegate rules with tight boundaries) 
 



<p>[00:07:59]<br>Especially with AI, you may want a delegate (human or agent) to be able to re-delegate—but only for specific purposes and within strict limits.</p>



 



 The Problem with Current Systems 



<p>[00:08:08]<br>Without fine-grained control, delegation chains either collapse into chaos or simply don’t work.</p>



<p>And right now, very few systems—or standards—can handle controlled, conditional re-delegation well.</p>



 



 Other Delegation Models to Watch 



<p>[00:08:42]<br>Outside of OAuth, some promising models include:</p>



 
 User Managed Access (UMA)<br>Fine-grained sharing policies—but limited adoption 



 Verifiable Credentials &amp; DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)<br>Let agents cryptographically prove they’re authorized—but still maturing 



 Enterprise Mission Profiles<br>Customized frameworks tuned for high-compliance environments like banking 
 



<p>[00:09:31]<br>All of these agree on one thing: one user, one device, one intent no longer reflects the real world (if it ever did).</p>



 



 Why This Matters 



<p>[00:09:44]<br>I’m not writing OAuth specs, and I’m not proposing another working group (please, no more working groups).</p>



<p>[00:09:53]<br>What I am trying to do—through this podcast and blog—is build a bridge.</p>



<p>Because:</p>



 
 More architects and implementers are realizing delegation is messy 



 AI agents are bumping into walls 



 Critical systems are relying on brittle workarounds 
 



 



 So, Where Do We Go from Here? 



<p>[00:10:14]<br>Standards bodies like the OpenID Foundation and IETF are doing excellent, thoughtful work. But that work isn’t always widely understood or accessible.</p>



<p>[00:10:45]<br>If you’re frustrated that “surely OAuth handles this”—you’re not alone. It doesn’t. Yet.</p>



<p>[00:11:04]<br>Delegation isn’t solved—but it is solvable. With better tools and more attention to real-world needs, we can build systems that reflect the messy, beautiful, multi-actor world we live in.</p>



<p>And while it won’t happen overnight (hello, technical debt), it’s absolutely worth doing.</p>

<p>Aergo Talks returned for its 13th episode with a content-rich discussion hosted by Ben Rogers and Raf, delving into key updates around HPP, the emerging AI layer Noösphere, token market dynamics, and the highly anticipated due diligence platform W3DB. Here’s everything you need to know from the&nbsp;session.</p> Noösphere: A Foundation for AI-Native Web3 <p>The first topic addressed was Noösphere, a new initiative under development as part of the HPP ecosystem. Positioned as one of the foundational tools for the AI-powered blockchain narrative, Noösphere was described as an upcoming product already featured on the Living Roadmap. While specific features were not disclosed, the tone was clear: this is a strategic building block for the ecosystem’s next&nbsp;phase.</p><blockquote>“Expect to see more details soon. It’s a strong sign that both the mainnet and broader vision are well on&nbsp;track.”</blockquote><p>Noösphere is expected to launch in tandem with other AI-focused modules that support decentralized applications demanding scalable, intelligent infrastructure.</p> Token Dynamics: Price, Hype, and the Role of Marketing <p>A multi-part question addressed one of the most common concerns in crypto communities: How to influence the price of a&nbsp;token?</p><p>Ben began with a simple truth: price is determined by the market. Unlike loyalty points controlled by issuers, tokens are valued by what people are willing to&nbsp;pay.</p><p>He noted that while the altcoin market has been shaky, Aergo is holding relatively strong, which suggests latent confidence. However, expectations for a quick return to all-time highs should be tempered.</p><p>Ben then shifted to the bigger picture: marketing. He presented findings from internal research that revealed most traditional Web3 marketing strategies are ineffective:</p>  A six-month study of over 1,400 press releases showed the average viewership was zero after filtering out six anomalies.  Crypto press releases rarely appear in search engines or AI model&nbsp;indexes.  AMA and KOL campaigns show no statistically significant effect on token performance.  <p>Ben advocated for a long-term view:</p><blockquote>“The product is the marketing. Brand is not a logo or a color; it’s the experience users&nbsp;have.”</blockquote><p>He concluded that HPP’s strategy is to build utility first and communicate value in a targeted, data-backed way.</p> W3DB: IMDb Meets Crunchbase for&nbsp;Web3 <p>Raf then brought up W3DB, which Ben described as a revolutionary due diligence platform co-developed with Fastblock and powered by&nbsp;HPP.</p><p>W3DB aims to be the most comprehensive, AI-powered discovery and validation hub for&nbsp;Web3:</p>  Combines project-level data with identity-level insights  Features community verification mechanisms that reward contributors with HPP&nbsp;tokens  Built for both users and developers seeking transparency in the&nbsp;space  <blockquote>“We chose to build on HPP not just because of the tech, but because of the token’s day-one value and infrastructure.”</blockquote> On Futures Trading and Ecosystem Expansion <p>A community question was raised about the ability to trade futures on the Aergo token while maintaining custody. The answer was straightforward: no decentralized futures platform currently supports it. However, the infrastructure is available for someone to build&nbsp;it.</p><p>Stay tuned for more insights to come in the next Aergo&nbsp;Talks!</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w71t9vvrE-M65THn4ZM0W2fmtsBEsnibi3bESgrr0CQ/edit?gid=1840204549#gid=1840204549">Living Roadmap</a> for&nbsp;updates.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-13-ama-recap-74f793a4a530">[Aergo Talks #13]AMA Recap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Let’s get one thing clear: Scattered Spider isn’t “back” – they never left. You’ve seen the headlines. MGM, Marks &amp; Spencer, and others all fell victim to their schemes. Now, this relentless cybercrime collective has a new target in its crosshairs: the U.S. insurance industry. With recent cyberattacks rattling major providers like Aflac, Erie Insurance, and Philadelphia Insurance Companies, the threat isn't just looming; it's here. As it always has been.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As Google Threat Intelligence Group's Chief Analyst puts it, "the threat I lose sleep over is Scattered Spider.” For defenders, it’s time to cut through the noise and face the hard truth. These attackers aren’t deploying zero-day exploits or groundbreaking malware. They’re walking right through the front door using valid credentials.</p> 
<p>They win by mastering the art of social engineering and exploiting the soft spots most enterprises still rely on: MFA push fatigue, help desk fraud, and phishable credentials. If your security posture hinges on the idea that "our MFA is good enough," it might be time for a stark reality check on current adversarial techniques. This guide will break down their playbook and give you a definitive strategy to fight back.</p> 
 Meet the Apex Predator: Who is Scattered Spider?  
<p>Before you can build a defense, you need to know your enemy. Scattered Spider is not a typical state-sponsored group. They are a nimble and amorphous collective of young, English-speaking cybercriminals, reportedly affiliated with a larger network known as "The Com." Their defining characteristic is their methodical approach. They focus their expertise on one industry at a time, learning the sector's unique processes, lingo, and technology stacks. This allows them to craft attacks with terrifying precision and efficiency.</p> 
<p>After a string of successful extortion campaigns against major retailers, Google's Threat Intelligence Group has warned that Scattered Spider has pivoted. Their new hunting ground is the insurance sector, and it's a target rich with opportunity. Think about the data insurance companies hold: a treasure trove of claims information, sensitive health records, Social Security numbers, and other personally identifiable information (PII). For cybercriminals, this data is gold, whether for extortion or sale on the dark web<br><br></p> 
 The Scattered Spider Playbook: Anatomy of a Credential-Based Attack  
<p>To understand the threat Scattered Spider poses, you have to dissect their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Their success isn't magic; it's a repeatable, three-act play designed to dismantle traditional security controls by targeting the most vulnerable asset: people.</p> 
 The Weapon of Choice: Hyper-Personalized Social Engineering  
<p>At its core, social engineering is the art of psychological manipulation to trick people into divulging confidential information or bypassing security protocols. But Scattered Spider has taken this to a new level, especially with the "turbo boost" provided by Generative AI.</p> 
<p>Gone are the days of poorly worded emails with suspicious links. Today's phishing/social engineering attacks are masterpieces of deception. By mining public data about employees from sources like LinkedIn, company websites, and social media, attackers can craft highly convincing and customized phishing lures within minutes. These messages use the right tone, contain local context, and are largely indistinguishable from legitimate communications.</p> 
 The Weakest Link: Exploiting Help Desks and Credential Resets  
<p>Scattered Spider knows that the fastest way around a fortified wall is to find someone to open the gate for you. Their prime target for this is the IT service desk. These teams are often the unsung heroes of an organization, but they are also understaffed, overwhelmed with requests, and fundamentally trained to be helpful – a perfect storm for exploitation.</p> 
<p>The scenario plays out like this: An attacker, armed with a dossier of personal information scraped from the internet, calls the help desk. They might pose as a high-ranking executive with an urgent request or an employee who has lost their phone and is locked out of their account. They leverage this information to sound credible, create a sense of urgency, and deceive the service agent into resetting the legitimate employee’s password or MFA device. Just like that, the attacker is handed the keys to the kingdom, bypassing layers of security without triggering a single alert.</p> 
 The Final Blow: Bypassing Legacy MFA with Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) Attacks  
<p>"But we have MFA!" This is the common refrain from organizations that believe they are protected. The chilling reality is that most traditional MFA methods, passwords, SMS one-time passcodes (OTPs), and even push notifications, are fundamentally phishable. Attackers can trick users into giving up OTP codes or exploit "push fatigue" by spamming a user's device with approval requests until one is accepted by mistake.</p> 
<p>This is where easily accessible tools like Evilginx come into play.</p> 
 What is Evilginx?  
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Think of it as the ultimate digital eavesdropper. It’s a phishing framework that operates as an Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM). Here’s how it works:</p> 
  
  The attacker sends a phishing link that directs the victim to the Evilginx server, which hosts a pixel-perfect replica of the real login page (e.g., your Microsoft Entra ID portal).  
  The Evilginx server acts as a reverse proxy, transparently passing all traffic back and forth between the victim and the legitimate service. The user sees the familiar login screen, complete with a valid TLS lock icon.  
  The user enters their username and password, which Evilginx captures.  
  The legitimate service then prompts for MFA. The user enters their OTP or approves the push notification, which Evilginx also intercepts and forwards.  
  Here’s the knockout blow: Once the user is successfully authenticated, the real service sends back a session cookie to authorize the user's browser session. Evilginx snatches this cookie.  
  
<p>With this stolen session cookie, the attacker can now directly access the user's account, completely bypassing the need for credentials or MFA. They have full control, and the victim may not realize it until it's too late.</p> 
 The 3 Core Principles of a Strong Identity Assurance Strategy  
<p>Fighting an adversary that targets identity requires a defense built on strong identity assurance. The probabilistic security controls of the past, which can only guess if a user is legitimate, are failing. You need a deterministic approach that proves with certainty that a person is who they claim to be. This modern defense is built on three core principles.</p> 
 1. Make Credentials Un-stealable with Phishing-Resistant MFA  
<p>The single most effective way to stop Scattered Spider’s primary attack vector is to adopt a simple philosophy: if a credential can't be moved, it can't be stolen. This is the foundation of true phishing-resistant, multi-factor authentication.</p> 
<p>The Solution: HYPR's phishing-resistant authentication is built on the FIDO standards, the gold standard for secure authentication, and leverages passwordless technology like passkeys.</p> 
<p>How it Defeats Credential Theft:</p> 
  
  Public-Private Key Cryptography: When a user enrolls with HYPR, their device creates a unique public-private key pair. The private key is stored securely in the device's hardware and never leaves. To authenticate, the device simply proves it possesses this secret key without ever revealing it, making it impossible for an attacker to intercept.  
  No Phishable Fallbacks: HYPR eliminates vulnerable, phishable factors. It only uses phishing-resistant FIDO methods and never falls back to easily compromised shared secrets like OTPs or knowledge-based questions.  
  
 2. Eliminate Help Desk Social Engineering Attacks with True Identity Verification  
<p>Securing the front door with phishing-resistant MFA is crucial, but what about the back door? Credential recovery and reset processes are a glaring vulnerability that Scattered Spider ruthlessly exploits. Relying on knowledge-based authentication (KBA), "What was the name of your first pet?", is a recipe for disaster in an era where AI can scrape the internet for answers in seconds.</p> 
<p>The Solution: You must verify the person, not the information they know. HYPR Affirm provides Multi-Factor Verification (MFV), a modern approach to identity proofing that makes adaptive, risk-based verification a core part of the identity lifecycle.</p> 
<p>How it Secures Recovery: Instead of asking flimsy questions, HYPR Affirm uses a layered, deterministic process to verify a user’s identity with high assurance before allowing a credential reset:</p> 
  
  Document Verification: The user is prompted to scan a government-issued ID (like a driver's license or passport) with their smartphone.  
  Biometric Matching &amp; Liveness: The user then takes a selfie, which is biometrically matched against the photo on the ID. A "liveness" check ensures it's a real person and not a photo or deepfake.  
  Configurable Steps: For high-risk scenarios, additional factors like a live video chat with a manager or service desk agent can be required.  
  
<p>This process ensures that only the legitimate account owner can ever perform a reset, turning the help desk from a vulnerability into a fortified checkpoint. View our <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/identity-verification-audit">on-demand identity verification audit</a> solutions page to learn more.</p> 
 3. Guarantee Endpoint Integrity with Continuous Device Trust  
<p>A user's identity is only one part of the security equation. The health and integrity of the device they are using to authenticate is the other. A legitimate user on a compromised device is still a massive risk.</p> 
<p>The Solution: HYPR Adapt adds an intelligent, continuous layer of risk analysis to every authentication event.</p> 
<p>How it Adds Protection:</p> 
  
  Real-Time Risk Signals: HYPR Adapt is a powerful risk engine that continuously analyzes a wide array of signals from the user's device, their behavior, and the broader threat landscape.  
  Adaptive Response: It checks if the device is managed or unmanaged, if its security posture is up to date, and if the user's behavior is unusual. If it detects a high-risk signal, like an authentication attempt from a jailbroken device or an impossible travel scenario, it can automatically step up authentication requirements or block the attempt entirely. This provides an essential layer of protection that ensures the entire access journey, from user to device to application, is secure.  
  
 Leave Legacy Behind: Implement a Modern Identity Assurance Strategy  
<p>Scattered Spider’s assault on the insurance industry is a clear signal that the old ways of security are no longer sufficient. Their strategy isn't revolutionary; it's a methodical exploitation of the trust we place in outdated and phishable identity technologies. Relying on legacy MFA and weak, KBA-based recovery processes is leaving your organization dangerously exposed.</p> 
<p>The path forward is not about adding more layers of complexity; it's about shifting to a foundation of certainty. By implementing a modern identity assurance strategy built on three pillars, phishing-resistant MFA, true identity verification, and continuous device trust, you can move from a reactive defensive posture to a position of dominance. You can build a fortress that doesn't just deter attackers like Scattered Spider but makes their entire playbook obsolete.</p>

			<p>On July 18, 2025, President Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, better known as the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12522">GENIUS Act</a> (S. 919), into law. It marks a foundational shift in U.S. financial policy: for the first time in the U.S., stablecoins would be regulated under a dedicated and bipartisan federal framework, distinct from digital securities or unregulated digital assets.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is the GENIUS Act? 
<p>The GENIUS Act defines payment stablecoins as digital assets:</p>
 
 issued for the purpose of payment or settlement (including margin/collateral), 
 redeemable at a fixed value (e.g., $1), 
 and backed 1:1 by permitted reserve assets. 
 does not offer a payment of yield or interest. 
 
<p>The bill outlines detailed requirements for issuers, including:</p>
 
 Reserve Composition: Only highly liquid and safe instruments are permitted, which include:
 
 coins and currency, 
 insured deposits held at banks and credit unions, 
 short-dated Treasury bills, 
 repurchase agreements (“repos”), 
 reverse repos backed by Treasury bills, 
 money market funds invested in certain of these assets, 
 central bank reserves, 
 and any other similar government-issued asset approved by regulators. 
 
 
 Reserve usage restriction: Issuers would be restricted to using reserve assets for certain activities, including to redeem stablecoins and serve as collateral in repos and reverse repos. 
 Redemption and disclosure: Issuers must maintain public redemption policies and report regularly on outstanding supply and reserve composition. 
 Risk oversight: Issuers above $10B must submit audited financial statements, and all are subject to Bank Secrecy Act compliance and risk management tailored by federal/state regulators. Issuers under $10B may be supervised at the state level, provided the regime is “substantially similar” to the federal one. 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Who can issue stablecoins? 
<p>Under the proposed text, stablecoins may be issued by:</p>
 
 Subsidiaries of insured depository institutions (IDIs), 
 OCC-regulated nonbank entities, and 
 State-regulated entities under $10 billion in issuance. 
 
<p>Nonbank issuers can start under state law, but must graduate to federal oversight once they exceed the $10 billion threshold.</p>
<p>If a foreign-issued stablecoin is not licensed in the US, it can still be traded on US secondary markets, but only if:</p>
 
 The foreign stablecoins have the technological capacity to freeze transactions, and 
 They can comply with lawful orders from the U.S. Treasury Department (e.g., sanctions, asset freezes, law enforcement actions). 
 
<p>These definitions ensure any proposed issuer knows exactly which rules and supervisors apply.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Are permissioned stablecoins the answer to compliance requirements? 
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/majority/myth-vs-fact-the-genius-act?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Myth vs. Fact: The GENIUS Act</a> by the U.S. Senate Committee: “The GENIUS Act requires all stablecoin issuers, including foreign issuers, to have the technological capability to freeze and seize stablecoins and also comply with lawful orders. It also requires all permitted payment stablecoin issuers to comply with U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions requirements, including implementing AML and sanctions programs and annually certify compliance with the bill’s AML provisions. This is a higher reporting obligation than what banks are currently subject to.”</p>
<p>This means stablecoin smart contracts and infrastructure must support:</p>
 
 Transfer freezes or reversals, under compliance or court orders. 
 AML/sanctions screening and reporting capabilities. 
 Annual certifications confirming they meet AML program standards. 
 

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 This legislation effectively requires stablecoin issuers to consider deploying permissioned tokens, using frameworks like ERC-3643, to sophisticatedly meet obligations such as AML compliance, transaction freezing, and holder traceability.

			<p>While this may contrast with the open-access ethos of Web3, it reflects what institutional players need to safely and legally engage with stablecoins in regulated environments. For banks, custodians, and asset managers, having granular control over who can hold and transfer stablecoins is not optional, it’s essential for satisfying legal, operational, and reputational obligations.</p>
<p>ERC-3643, the market technical standard for permissioned tokens, with its identity-linked permissioning and built-in compliance logic, offers a proven path forward for stablecoin issuers who want to meet GENIUS Act requirements while preserving blockchain-based efficiency and interoperability.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Why This Is a Major Development 
<p>While stablecoins have been widely used by crypto users in the Web3 space for trading, institutional players have been reluctant to accept stablecoins as a payment method for tokenized securities, primarily due to regulatory uncertainty and unfavorable accounting treatment (e.g., SAB121).</p>
<p>As a result, true atomic settlement, where both securities and cash move instantly onchain, has faced slow adoption. In many cases, traditional bank transfers are still used, introducing friction, delays, and manual reconciliation steps.</p>
<p>Together, the GENIUS Act and SAB 122 lay the foundation for institutional adoption of stablecoins in the United States. The GENIUS Act establishes a federal framework for issuing compliant, fully backed stablecoins, while SAB 122 (which reverses SAB 121) enables banks to custody digital assets without classifying them as on-balance-sheet liabilities. With these regulatory clarifications, stablecoins can serve as the onchain cash leg for financial institutions, unlocking real-time settlement, composable services, and broader integration with capital markets and DeFi services.</p>
<p>As these frameworks take effect, we expect to see:</p>
 
 More banks issuing stablecoins under federal or state-regulated regimes in the U.S.. 
 U.S. institutions accepting stablecoins for subscription, redemption, and settlement of tokenized securities. 
 Accelerated institutional adoption of tokenized securities, driven not only by the ability to enable atomic settlement, but also by the opportunity to introduce innovative onchain features, such as Delivery-vs-Payment (DvP) transfers between qualified investors to improve liquidity, or integrating DeFi-based services 
 

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 These developments allow institutions to offer smarter and more competitive products and position themselves at the forefront of onchain finance.

			 From Tokenized Cash to Tokenized Securities 
<p>As trusted digital dollars become more widely available, the focus will naturally shift toward the transparency and composition of the reserves backing them. To enable real-time proof of reserves and redemption, these reserve assets themselves should be tokenized and made verifiable onchain.</p>
<p>At the same time, since payment stablecoins are prohibited from offering yield under the GENIUS Act, stablecoin holders will increasingly look for onchain and yield-generating alternatives.</p>
<p>This makes the tokenization of money market funds (MMFs) and other short-duration instruments especially timely, serving a dual purpose:</p>
 
 as onchain compliant reserve assets for stablecoin issuers, and 
 as onchain savings products for stablecoin holders seeking yield in a secure and regulated way. 
 

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>A recent example we supported is the <a href="https://tokeny.com/customer-story-fasanaras-tokenized-mmf/">tokenized MMF by Fasanara Capital</a>, a London-based asset manager overseeing $5 billion in assets. The project was delivered in collaboration with Apex Group, Chainlink, Fireblocks, and Polygon. Seeking to comply with regulations while ensuring open interoperability, it leverages the ERC-3643 market standard via our T-REX Platform.</p>
<p>The fund was launched with onchain compliance controls, integrated cap table management, real-time redemption capabilities, and real-time NAV feeds, demonstrating how tokenized funds can operate efficiently, transparently, and securely within a regulated framework.</p>
<p>There are a few key benefits of tokenized funds:</p>
 
 Instant and 24/7 subscription and redemption<br>
 
 Real-time collateral deployment (e.g., in repo markets) 
 Reduced operational risk through smart contract automation 
 Seamless integration with DeFi protocols and traditional financial infrastructure 
 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 A Call to Action 
<p>A new chapter in finance is unfolding, and it’s happening now. With the GENIUS Act in place and onchain infrastructure finally ready for institutions, the opportunity to lead has never been clearer.</p>
<p>Yet, in a market filled with noise and emerging players, success will come to those who choose partners with a proven track record. The right guidance can help you avoid costly missteps, accelerate your learning curve, and ensure you don’t get trapped in new silos onchain.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, now part of Apex Group, we bring more than seven years of experience building enterprise-grade tokenization solutions. We work closely with our clients to provide the knowledge, technology, and operational support they need to move with speed and confidence.</p>

   Since I wrote last week about MCP and the need for a more structured standards development process, this week I feel like diving into what it means to build an open standard. Unfortunately, "open standard" is a term that often gets thrown around and means entirely too many different things.

<p>“Since I wrote last week about MCP and the need for a more structured standards development process, this week I feel like diving into what it really means to build an open standard.“</p>



<p>Unfortunately, “open standard” is one of those terms that gets thrown around a lot and often means entirely too many different things. For some, it just means the spec is readable online. For others, it’s about process transparency or whether the license is royalty-free. Depending on who you ask, “open” might refer to access, governance, IP rights, implementation freedom, or all of the above.</p>



<p>This fuzziness isn’t just academic. In the world of digital identity, especially as we build wallets, verifiable credentials, and cross-border trust frameworks, how we define and implement open standards will directly shape who gets to participate, how systems interoperate, and whether anyone can avoid vendor lock-in.</p>



<p>So, let’s unpack it. What is an open standard? And why does it matter so much right now?</p>

 What does “open standard” actually mean? 



<p>Ask five people what makes a standard “open,” and you might get five different answers.</p>



<p>Some will say it’s all about access: It’s open if you can download and read the spec without paying. Others will focus on governance: It’s open if the development process is public and inclusive. Still others might zero in on intellectual property: If you can implement it without navigating a minefield of patents, it qualifies.</p>



 The ITU-T’s Definition 



<p>The <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx">ITU-T</a>, a United Nations-recognized standards body, offers a fairly comprehensive <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/ipr/Pages/open.aspx">definition</a>. According to them, open standards are:</p>



<p>“Made available to the general public and developed (or approved) and maintained via a collaborative and consensus-driven process. They facilitate interoperability and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption.”</p>



<p>They expand this definition to include concepts like transparent development, due process, balanced input, fair access to intellectual property, and long-term maintenance. It’s a solid framework, widely used in international policy discussions.</p>



<p>But there’s another approach that resonates more strongly with how the Internet itself was built and continues to evolve.</p>



 The OpenStand Principles 



<p>In 2012, five key organizations—the IEEE, IETF, IAB, W3C, and the Internet Society—affirmed a shared set of values known as the <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bp-openstandards-20120920-en.pdf">OpenStand Principles</a>. These principles describe the processes that gave us the web, email, DNS, and secure communications protocols. In other words, they’re battle-tested.</p>



<p>The OpenStand Principles emphasize five core commitments:</p>



 
 Cooperation – Standards organizations should respect each other’s autonomy and work together. 



 Adherence to core development principles – Including due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness. 



 Collective empowerment – Standards should support innovation, interoperability, scalability, and benefit humanity. 



 Availability – Specifications must be accessible and implementable under fair terms, from royalty-free to FRAND. 



 Voluntary adoption – No mandates, no lock-in. Market success is determined by the quality of the work, not regulatory decree. 
 



<p>These principles prioritize practical interoperability, technical merit, and inclusive participation, not just public availability.</p>



<p>And yes, I’ll admit I’m biased. My work and the ecosystems I care about have benefited enormously from the OpenStand model. It’s one of the reasons the Internet scaled globally. Go, team Internet!</p>



<p>So, while the ITU-T definition is solid, OpenStand captures something deeper: a living, working model of how open collaboration can shape resilient, scalable infrastructure.</p>



<p>That model, of open, resilient collaboration, is directly relevant to digital identity.</p>



 Why this matters for digital identity 



<p>Digital identity isn’t just another software problem. It is critical infrastructure that sits at the intersection of public services, private platforms, and individual autonomy. It needs to work across borders, industries, and decades (there are so many dimensions) and do so securely, ethically, and interoperably.</p>



<p>Open standards are the only viable foundation for that kind of future. And I doubt many people would argue that point. Of course, that is only true until you ask what “open” means.</p>



<p>As our systems evolve, it’s clear that not all “open” is created equal. The technical community frequently uses the term, but how it plays out in practice depends heavily on the organization behind the spec, its governance structure, and who gets a say.</p>



<p>Let’s look at a few examples from the current identity landscape:</p>



 ISO/IEC standards are authoritative but not always accessible 



<p>The ISO <a href="https://www.iso.org/stages-and-resources-for-standards-development.html">standards process</a> is generally respected and deeply formal. Specifications like <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IE</a><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">C</a><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html"> 18013-5</a>, which governs mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs), influence national legislation and industry roadmaps. In some countries, these specs are published for free if required by law. Others adopt them by reference without making the actual text available. In most cases, you’ll need to pay to read the document.</p>



<p>Participation isn’t open in the way many expect from Internet standards. To shape an ISO spec, you need to be part of your country’s official delegation or aligned with a recognized partner organization. It’s possible, but it’s <a href="https://www.iso.org/get-involved.html">gated</a>. And that makes it harder for smaller implementers, civil society groups, or under-resourced countries to engage meaningfully.</p>



 FIDO2: open specs from a closed process 



<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO Alliance</a>, whose work underpins passkeys and other strong authentication technologies, operates with a “pay-to-play” model. To <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/working-groups/">participate</a> in discussions and vote on specifications, you must be a paying member of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>However, once published, the specifications are free, publicly available, and widely adopted. In that sense, FIDO hits an important open standards benchmark: interoperability is possible without licensing barriers or paywalls. But governance remains closed to non-members, raising questions about transparency and balance.</p>



 OpenID4VC: open contributions, gated decisions 



<p>The <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID Foundation</a> is producing specifications for verifiable credentials and decentralized identity (e.g., <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID4VC</a>). Their process is somewhat hybrid: anyone can join the mailing lists, submit proposals, and contribute to discussions. However, only members can vote on final decisions, and membership requires payment.</p>



<p>This model blends inclusivity with formal governance. It’s more open than ISO but still includes structural limitations that can shape who ultimately steers the spec.</p>



 W3C Digital Credentials API: public input, but participation friction 



<p>Then there’s the <a href="https://w3.org">W3C</a>, where the <a href="https://w3c-fedid.github.io/digital-credentials/">Digital Credentials API</a> is currently under development. It started in a Community Group, a setting where anyone could join calls, propose changes, and contribute. But Community Groups can’t produce official <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#rec-track">W3C Recommendations</a>. The work had to move to a formal Working Group to do that.</p>



<p>In a W3C Working Group, you either need to be:</p>



 
 A member of a W3C Member organization (which usually involves a fee), 



 Or an invited expert (which requires an application and approval). 
 



<p>The general public can still file GitHub issues and read the documents. That’s more openness than many standards bodies offer, but it’s not full participation. There’s friction between visibility and influence, especially for newcomers or smaller players.</p>



 So… what counts as “open”? 



<p>With so many variations on “open,” it’s easy to fall into a purity trap where only the most idealistic, frictionless processes count. But that’s not realistic or fair.</p>



<p>Creating standards—real, robust, production-ready standards—takes work. Not just from the people writing specs or implementing test suites but also from the organizations that host the mailing lists, convene the calls, maintain the repositories, manage intellectual property frameworks, and, yes, pay the legal bills.</p>



<p>All of that takes resources. And as much as we’d like to imagine that open standards are forged purely through the goodwill of the global community, the truth is that most standards efforts today rely on a mix of volunteer labor, organizational backing, and structured funding models, some of which include paid memberships.</p>



 A new balance test 



<p>So no, we can’t simply demand that every standard be written by volunteers and hosted for free. That’s not how sustainable infrastructure gets built. But we can and should ask hard questions about transparency, participation, and accessibility.</p>



 
 Is the spec publicly available without a paywall? 



 Can you implement it without having to negotiate a license? 



 Are diverse voices meaningfully represented in its development? 



 Do the outcomes reflect shared infrastructure goals or just strategic product roadmaps? 
 



<p>We don’t need to shut down funding models. But we need to ensure those models don’t shut people out.</p>



<p>The goal isn’t to achieve some idealized version of openness. It’s to build systems that are accountable, adaptable, and inclusive. Standards that reflect a common foundation, not a competitive moat. And that’s a goal we can work toward, even in a world where time and money are very real constraints.</p>



 Open-ish is still better than closed 



<p>As much as we can and should debate the limits of openness in today’s standards processes, it’s worth remembering that things could be a lot worse. While many digital identity specifications land somewhere in the middle, open to read, semi-open to influence, gated in terms of governance, that’s still miles ahead of truly closed standards.</p>



<p>And yes, closed standards still exist, even in 2025.</p>



<p>Some of the world’s most critical systems rely on technical specifications that aren’t publicly available, freely implementable, or open to broad contribution.</p>



 Closed doors in standards 



<p>For example:</p>



 
 National identity systems in some countries are developed behind closed doors. Portions of India’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar">Aadhaar</a> system or certain Gulf nation digital IDs may be guided by specifications that are either not published or only accessible to government contractors. That makes transparency, auditability, and public trust harder to achieve. 



 Vendor-specific federation protocols have a long history in enterprise environments. Before the rise of open federated identity standards like SAML or OIDC, systems like Microsoft’s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adfsod/204de335-ea34-4f9b-ae73-8b7d4c8152d1">WS-Federation</a> created tightly coupled, proprietary identity flows. While still in use in some legacy contexts, these are controlled by the vendor, not a neutral standards body. 



 Biometric matching algorithms and data formats are another example. Many face or iris recognition technologies rely on proprietary encodings that are patented, licensed, or simply undisclosed. Even when governments use them, the standards involved may not be publicly accessible, let alone reviewable. 



 Even account provisioning APIs between enterprise SaaS providers can resemble closed standards. If your identity team has ever tried to automate user provisioning without access to well-documented SCIM endpoints, you’ve probably run into a “standard” that’s really just a private interface. 
 



<p>In that light, the “open-ish” systems start to look less like compromise and more like progress.</p>



 Schrödinger’s standards, both open and closed? 



<p>Yes, it can be frustrating that you need to be a member to vote at the OpenID Foundation. Yes, it’s not ideal that the FIDO Alliance limits participation to paying organizations. And yes, W3C Working Groups aren’t truly open in the democratic sense once you leave the Community Group stage.</p>



<p>But in all these cases, the resulting specifications are:</p>



 
 Freely available, 



 Implementable without proprietary dependencies, and 



 Increasingly shaped by diverse, global input. 
 



<p>That’s not perfect openness, but it’s a long way from closed. And it’s a path we can keep improving.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com">Spherical Cow Consulting</a>. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down the evolving world of digital identity — from credentials and standards to browser quirks and policy challenges.<br>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



 



  What Is an Open Standard? 



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Last week, I explored the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and why we need a better approach to standards development. Today, let’s dive deeper and ask a foundational question: what does it mean to build an open standard?</p>



<p>The phrase “open standard” is used often — and differently — by many:</p>



 
 Some say it simply means a spec is publicly readable. 



 Others emphasize transparency, royalty-free licensing, or governance processes. 



 Still others point to access, IP rights, or implementation freedom. 
 



<p>[00:01:17]<br>And this isn’t just a philosophical debate — it affects real-world outcomes in digital identity systems, from wallets and credentials to international trust frameworks. Open standards define who participates, how systems interoperate, and whether we avoid vendor lock-in.</p>



 



  Defining “Open” — Multiple Perspectives 



<p>[00:01:41]<br>Ask five experts, and you’ll get five different definitions:</p>



 
 Access-focused: If the standard is free to read, it’s open. 



 Process-focused: If it’s developed publicly and inclusively, it’s open. 



 IP-focused: If anyone can implement it without licensing hurdles, it’s open. 
 



<p>[00:02:10]<br>The ITU-T, a UN-recognized standards body, defines an open standard as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Made available to the general public, developed via a collaborative, consensus-driven process, facilitates interoperability, and intended for widespread adoption.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They also stress:</p>



 
 Transparent development 



 Due process 



 Balanced input 



 Fair IP access 



 Long-term support 
 



 



  The OpenStand Principles: Internet DNA 



<p>[00:03:01]<br>Another influential model comes from the OpenStand Principles, endorsed in 2012 by:</p>



 
 IEEE 



 IETF 



 Internet Architecture Board 



 W3C 



 Internet Society 
 



<p>These organizations helped build the foundational architecture of the internet.</p>



<p>[00:03:31]<br>OpenStand emphasizes:</p>



 
 Cooperation between standards bodies 



 Foundational principles: transparency, consensus, balance 



 Collective empowerment: interoperability, innovation, benefit to humanity 



 Availability: fair access, voluntary adoption 



 Success through utility, not mandates 
 



<p>[00:04:14]<br>This model values technical merit, global scale, and inclusive participation — not just a downloadable PDF.</p>



 



  Why It Matters for Digital Identity 



<p>[00:04:35]<br>Digital identity isn’t “just software.” It’s infrastructure at the crossroads of:</p>



 
 Public services 



 Private platforms 



 Personal autonomy 
 



<p>It must work across borders, industries, and time, and do so securely, ethically, and interoperably.<br>And for that, open standards are non-negotiable.</p>



 



  Examining the Standards Bodies 



<p>[00:05:14]<br>Let’s look at how open actually plays out in the real world:</p>



 



  ISO 



<p>[00:05:17]<br>The ISO/IEC standards process is formal and respected. Specs like ISO 18013‑5 (for mobile driver’s licenses) guide legislation and roadmaps.</p>



 
 Pros: Highly structured; impactful. 



 Cons: Often behind a paywall. Participation requires national delegation or official channels — not easy for small players. 
 



 



  FIDO Alliance 



<p>[00:06:12]<br>Known for passkeys and strong authentication, FIDO uses a pay-to-play model.</p>



 
 Participation requires paid membership. 



 Specs are free to access and implement once published. 



 No licensing restrictions = a big plus for developers. 
 



 



  OpenID Foundation 



<p>[00:06:52]<br>Behind OpenID Connect and now working on OpenID for Verifiable Credentials.</p>



 
 Mailing lists are open. 



 Only paying members can vote. 



 All specs are freely available, making this model more inclusive than ISO, though still tilted toward funded voices. 
 



 



  W3C 



<p>[00:07:34]<br>W3C’s Digital Credentials API is a good case study.</p>



 
 Community groups are fully open — but cannot produce official standards. 



 To become a W3C Recommendation, work must move to a Working Group. 



 Working Group participation requires either:
 
 Organizational membership (with dues), or 



 Invitation as an expert 
 
 
 



<p>Public input is welcome, but influence is limited.</p>



 



  Balancing Idealism and&nbsp;Practicality 



<p>[00:08:32]<br>So, what really counts as open?<br>There’s a danger in idealism — assuming only frictionless, volunteer-driven models are acceptable.</p>



<p>[00:08:59]<br>In reality, standards require:</p>



 
 Legal review 



 Infrastructure support 



 Paid staff 



 Long-term maintenance 
 



<p>We can’t demand “free everything” — but we can demand fairness in access and influence.</p>



<p>Ask these questions:</p>



 
 Can you read and implement the spec without legal or financial barriers? 



 Are diverse voices represented? 



 Does the result serve shared infrastructure, or just a vendor’s agenda? 
 



 



  When Standards Aren’t Open 



<p>[00:09:35]<br>Not all standards are even partially open:</p>



 
 Some national ID systems are built on unpublished specs. 



 Many biometric formats are proprietary and patented. 



 Even SaaS provisioning APIs are often undocumented and closed. 
 



<p>[00:10:09]<br>So yes — some open processes have flaws. But compared to that? Even “imperfect open” is progress.</p>



 



  A Positive Example: The Cyrus Foundation 



<p>[00:10:46]<br>A good example of a modern, open-leaning approach is the Cyrus Foundation:</p>



 
 Building an open‑source digital identity wallet 



 Prioritizes public standards like:
 
 OpenID for Verifiable&nbsp;Credentials 



 FIDO2 



 ISO 18013‑5 
 
 
 



<p>[00:11:31]<br>Their code and process are public and transparent, with contributions welcomed from across the ecosystem.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Full disclosure: I serve as an advisor to Cyrus — but only because they’re getting it right.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>[00:11:47]<br>The point isn’t that Cyrus is unique. What matters is their model — balancing practicality with open values, avoiding reinvented cryptography, and treating identity infrastructure as a shared foundation.</p>



 



  The Path Forward 



<p>[00:12:08]<br>And the good news? This future is already happening. We just need to keep showing up for it.</p>

<p>Join 1Kosmos CSO Mike Engle and CMO Michael Cichon as they break down what it means to earn a perfect score in the iBeta Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) Level 2 certification, the gold standard for detecting advanced identity-based attacks.</p>
<p>They’ll explore the key differences between PAD Level 1 and Level 2, why liveness detection is critical to stopping fraud, and how the 1Kosmos platform, also certified to NIST 800-63-3 and FIDO2 standards, delivers comprehensive protection against today’s most sophisticated threats.</p>
<p>
</p>  
<p></p>
 
 
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Hello everybody, this is Michael Cichon, I’m the Chief Marketing Officer here at 1Kosmos. I’m joined today by Mike Engle, our Chief Strategy Officer. 1Kosmos recently announced presentation attack detection level two. What does this mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, no, great to be here, Michael. Good to see you again. PAD, as you mentioned, presentation attack detection is just like it sounds. When you are using online services and verifying your identity, you’re typically presenting yourself by scanning a face, or a document, a driver’s license to a requesting service, right, signing up for a new bank account. So I’m presenting it. A presentation attack is when I’m presenting something that’s false, or faked, fabricated, deep faked, et cetera. So the term, presentation attack detection, is the art of stopping that type of attack. So PAD is really a simple term for trying to stop bad guys that are faking images or videos, et cetera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So as companies are moving to biometrics for authentication, no big surprise, the cybersecurity attackers, the threat actors, whether they’re following this trend or whether they’re ahead of this trend is, I guess, depends on your point of view. The key is that attempts are being made to hack the biometrics, so. What, I mean, let alone PAD 2, what is PAD 1? There’s apparently different levels to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>There is, yeah. So there’s a simpler version of presentation attack detection, PAD 1, we’ve had that for a few years. Pad level 2 is a whole nother level of testing, and it’s a much more sophisticated set of attacks that are done on the testing algorithms, for example. So to give you actually a couple of concrete examples, the lab we use is called iBeta. They’ve been around for like 25 years, they’re recognized by NIST, the government agency, for standards, and they’re also recognized by FIDO. So they’re very well accredited. And we’ve been tested by them for both levels, PAD 1 and PAD 2.</p>
<p>For PAD 1, iBeta will spend about $30 per attack. So how much time, effort, money do you spend creating a fake thing? $30. For PAD level 2, it’s up to $300 per attack. So big difference, you’re talking 10 times the spend. And you also need much more sophisticated equipment, you spend a lot more time on it as well. So instead of spending eight hours on a particular type of attack, they could spend up to four days, so much more stringent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>I see. So a PAD 1 would be something like a paper mask or something like that, and a PAD 2 would be more advanced, potentially even using AI?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, using AI. I mean, typically it’s presenting something in the physical world. AI is certainly something we spend a lot of time focusing on, but, you know Tom Cruise, right? Of course you do, Mission Impossible, they put the rubber masks over their head and you cannot tell the difference. That’s the type of testing that iBeta would do. Latex masks, they do deep fakes and synthetic, the other types of materials as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right. So along with the announcement, we announced that the 1Kosmos platform achieved a perfect score. This was a 0% imposter attack presentation attempt rate, or accept rate. Any details, context around what that means?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Well, yeah, so 0%, I mean, that’s the gold standard. If you have 1% and you have millions of customers coming in, that ends up being quite a number. So 0% is, you can’t get much better than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. Now, we’ve had for a while, liveness detection. How does 1Kosmos’ liveness detection then stand out from other solutions in the market?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Some companies just don’t use it. If you see on LinkedIn, there’s all kinds of posts where people have gotten past identity verification company tech. If they do some basic liveness, they will typically stop basic attacks. And so, you can tell who’s certified and who’s not, it’s actually very easy to do. And so, many times when you check those companies that have been bypassed and you go to iBeta, they’re not on there. When you go to NIST, 800-63-3 certifying company, like Kantara, they’re not on there either, and they’re not on the NIST FRVT or FRVE, which is the independent testing that NIST does as well. So it’s easy to tell who’s certified and who’s not. I haven’t seen a post that’s gotten 500 comments on LinkedIn from an iBeta PAD 2 certified company, so it really is the gold standard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So this certification that we’ve announced, it proves our ability to stop even some of the most sophisticated identity-based attacks. In reality, day-to-day reality, what kind of threats are organizations facing today and how does this help them mitigate those threats?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, there’s a couple. So if you’re doing document verification, you scan the front and back of a driver’s license, check all the security features, there’s an attack on that. Is this a live document? So document liveness is a whole thing that’s different from my face. There’s document liveness and there’s face liveness, we test both of them. So imagine if you’re scanning the front and back of a license and you don’t bother checking to see if that’s a live driver’s license. That’s really important and could be skipped by a vendor, or your provider. Or if you’re doing that, but you’re not doing the live face part. Where live face gets really important, is when you’re injecting into a live video feed. So you’re scanning my face, this could be a deep fake injection right now that we’re doing and there’s ways to detect. There’s the positioning of the eyes and the way the artifacts render around my head, et cetera, et cetera. So those are the two types of liveness that we keep an eye on and they’re both very important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right. So the iBeta PAD 2 certification, it’s the latest in a long list of certifications for the 1Kosmos platform. You mentioned, I think, the NIST 800-63-3, of course, we’re also certified to FIDO2. How do all these work together to ensure a high level of security?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>No, that’s really important. So iBETA PAD 2, amazing. We got it, it takes a lot of elbow grease to get that done. But the bad guys are not going to stop, we’ll probably need PAD 3 someday, it doesn’t exist yet. So there’s an arms race between bad actors and the good guys, like 1Kosmos. One of the compensating controls is, do I have proof that I proved my identity as an individual, right? So imagine if you could ask me for proof of my plastic driver’s license or my passport every time I go and log in. That’s game changing. You don’t even need to check the video feed when that happens. So if you knew right now that I had my driver’s license and it was legit, do you care about the video feed anymore? Not really, right? Well-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>You do, because yeah, you’re a professional. But so what I’m saying is it’s really a digital signature that can be combined with whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish. Digital signatures are backed by cryptography, not how I look on the screen. So what we do with the whole NIST 800-63-3 thing and a digital wallet, is give the user a certificate that can be trusted in perpetuity. So now you don’t have to rely quite as much on all the liveness and deep fake stuff. So those two go hand in hand. And again, the companies that just scan an image or a face, do they deal with wallets and certificates? Probably not, we do, and that’s a real game changer, I think, for addressing this in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, cool. So we have the digital wallet, which is certified to the rigorous NIST standards and the FIDO2 standards. We’ve got the presentation attack level 2 defense. What do you say to businesses that are still hesitant to adopt biometric authentication?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Well, don’t be scared, it’s okay. Just like any technology, you need to get your feet wet with it, A/B tested on a population of users and stay on top of the current attacks. So there’s all these things and acronyms and false acceptance rates and false rejection rates. There’s testing to give some level of assurance that the tech itself and the user experience will stand up to a business’s risk and the requirements for how much pain or ease of use you want to give your customers. So it’s a balancing act, but it’s here to stay. When you go to the airport now, you are using your biometrics all the time, right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>And we create a very delightful experience online, which is what customers want. So it’s coming whether companies want to embrace it or not. I think companies that don’t embrace it, are going to be bypassed by the ones that do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right. Well, yes, if it’s good enough for the TSA, it should be good enough for regular business, if you’ve got the right technologies and the certifications behind them. So Mike, appreciate your time this morning. It’s a very exciting development, one that hardens the 1Kosmos solution against some of the most advanced presentation attacks. So, very happy with this development and very much appreciate your time today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Great to be here. I’ll see you soon.</p>

			<p><a href="https://mtcm.ch/">MTCM</a>, a Luxembourg-based securitization platform serving clients across Europe, the Americas, MENA, and Asia, has entered into a strategic partnership with Tokeny, the leading onchain operating system, to enable the issuance of both traditional and digital securities through a unified workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This collaboration marks the launch of the first dual-format issuance framework in Luxembourg, where an ISIN-listed note and a permissioned security token are minted simultaneously from the same legal compartment, ensuring full fungibility and compliance across both formats.</p>

		 
	 
    The partnership with Tokeny allows us to industrialize a dual-issuance model that was previously not possible. We now produce a fungible twin issuance: one leg as an ISIN-listed note settled via a leading international CSD, the other as ERC-3643-based permissioned tokenized notes onchain. This structure enables investors and arrangers to choose between blockchain or traditional settlement, without compromising on compliance, operational efficiency, or investor protections.  Pedro HerranzManaging Partner at MTCM       The dual issuance model is a practical way to help traditional investors get familiar with the onchain format. Once they try these assets, which are faster to settle, easier to access, and enhanced with features that weren’t possible before, they will naturally prefer the modernized and better way to access, manage, and transfer securities. This would definitely accelerate the demands from buy sides and drive the adoption.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Under a white-label integration, Tokeny’s T-REX tokenization platform has been embedded into MTCM’s comprehensive end-to-end solutions. While MTCM acts as structurer, administrator and calculation agent, Tokeny provides easy-to-use interfaces to all stakeholders.</p>
<p>The integration is now live and supports the full lifecycle of a digital issuance, from onboarding and KYC to subscription and secondary solutions, within MTCM’s white-labeled investor portal. Tokeny’s technology simplifies complex workflows, embedding digital identity, AML/KYC verification, wallet integration, and cap table management into a single interface, reducing onboarding friction and improving transparency for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>This model significantly improves access, speed, and cost efficiency in structured finance. Institutional and professional investors can now self-custody digital securities, bypassing the high distribution and custodian costs typically associated with structured notes. For arrangers, this hybrid issuance opens up a wider distribution universe, combining reach through the traditional investors with new and blockchain-native investor segments.</p>
<p>With over €2.5 billion in assets under service and a 400% increase in AUS over the past two years, MTCM continues to expand its global footprint and lead innovation in hybrid financial structuring.</p>
<p>By merging the benefits of capital markets infrastructure with onchain efficiency, MTCM and Tokeny are redefining how structured investments are issued, distributed, and managed in a multi-rail financial future.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how banks, healthcare apps, or even e-commerce platforms verify your face in seconds? No passwords. No OTPs. Just a camera and some futuristic software. Welcome to the world of face authentication SDKs!</p>
<p>In today’s fast-paced digital environment, verifying real users instantly and securely has become critical. Whether it’s protecting sensitive financial data, simplifying access control in educational platforms, or preventing identity fraud in government systems, face authentication SDKs are the magic wand making it all possible.</p>
<p>This blog will walk you through everything you need to know about face authentication SDKs, including how they work, why they matter, and how Recognito is delivering best-in-class solutions in this space. Let’s dive in. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Face Authentication SDK? 
<p>An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of tools that helps developers build and add features to their apps. A <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face authentication SDK</a> is a toolkit that allows developers to add face recognition-based login or verification features to their apps, websites, or systems.</p>
<p>This SDK leverages:</p>
 
 Real-time facial recognition 
 AI-driven biometric analysis 
 Facial liveness detection 
 Match scoring and identity validation algorithms 
 
<p>In essence, it helps applications detect and confirm whether the person on screen is not only a match for a stored image but also a real, live human being. It’s the backbone of modern biometric security systems.</p>
<p>But wait, isn’t it the same as a face recognition SDK? Not quite.</p>
<p>While both SDKs use facial biometrics, face authentication SDKs go a step further by integrating liveness detection for face recognition, making them more suitable for high-security scenarios like banking, KYC processes, and digital onboarding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Does a Face Authentication SDK Work? 
<p>Let’s break this down step by step in the simplest way possible:</p>
 Step 1: Face Capture 
<p>The camera captures a live video or image of the user.</p>
 Step 2: Feature Extraction 
<p>Facial features like the distance between the eyes, jawline shape, cheekbone curvature, and skin texture are mapped using AI.</p>
 Step 3: Database Match 
<p>The captured data is compared against stored images or documents like driver’s licenses and passports.</p>
 Step 4: Liveness Detection 
<p>Face liveness detection SDK makes sure the person is really there and not using a photo or a fake video.</p>
 Step 5: Authentication Result 
<p>The system delivers a decision in real time, whether the identity is verified or not.</p>
<p></p>
 Types of Liveness Detection: Passive vs Active 
<p>Both active and passive liveness detection methods are crucial components of a robust <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-biometric-playground/">facial liveness detection</a> system.</p>
<p>Active Liveness Detection: Users are asked to do simple actions like blink, smile, or turn their head. These gestures are hard to mimic with static images or deepfake videos.</p>
<p>Passive Liveness Detection: The system checks for life signs without user interaction, such as skin texture, micro-expressions, or subtle movements in blood flow. This technique adds a frictionless layer of verification that’s completely invisible to users.</p>
<p>Recognito supports both, making it one of the most advanced <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">face liveness detection SDK</a> offerings in the market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Is a Face Authentication SDK Essential in 2025 and Beyond? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Cybersecurity First 
<p>Online fraud is at an all-time high. With face authentication SDKs, businesses can prevent spoofing, account takeovers, and unauthorized access more effectively than ever.</p>
 2. Frictionless User Experience 
<p>Say goodbye to forgotten passwords and long login forms. With biometric login, users can access services in under 5 seconds. This makes onboarding fast, easy, and secure.</p>
 3. Real-Time Identity Verification 
<p>With liveness detection for face recognition, verification becomes instant and reliable 24/7, without manual checks.</p>
 4. Easy Integration 
<p>Modern face recognition SDKs like Recognito’s offer detailed API documentation and support for Android, iOS, and web platforms.</p>
 5. Regulatory Compliance 
<p>Industries like banking, fintech, and healthcare require strict KYC and AML compliance. Biometric authentication ensures businesses remain compliant while minimizing operational overhead.</p>
 6. Scalable and Cost-Effective 
<p>Automated identity checks help save time and money by reducing the need for manual verification.</p>

 Reflecting on ReBuilders and what we&nbsp;learnt <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXMgoXn_1sU">ReBuilders programme</a> was a collaboration between Dark Matter Labs, <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">CIVIC SQUARE</a>, <a href="https://materialcultures.org/">Material Cultures</a>, and <a href="https://www.fircroft.ac.uk/">Fircroft College</a>, supported by Innovate UK. This is our first reflection on the programme’s initial iteration; more documentation and resources will be shared by our partner organisations in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>In this piece, we will outline 5 ways we learnt over the course of the programme:</p>  The retrofit design&nbsp;hack  <p>2. In-person visits</p><p>3. The maintenance perspective</p><p>4. Sites as classrooms</p><p>5. Leadership with longevity</p>Image: Angela Grabowska<p>Between September 2024 and October 2025, we came together with a group of ten construction business leaders in the West Midlands to consider pathways toward regenerative ways of building. Over those six months, we visited leading-edge socially- and ecologically-regenerative buildings across England and Wales, met with the trailblazers involved in realising these projects, engaged in hands-on sessions working with natural building materials and assemblies, and thought deeply about organisational design as a cohort. In so doing, the group took steps toward modelling the transition we envisioned — both as individual practitioners and as a collective.</p> Programme highlights: <blockquote>Four<a href="https://www.notion.so/civicsquare/Key-Programme-Dates-Session-Information-6cca5be1f199461db898e0151329e0da"> site visits</a>, to WeCanMake (Bristol), UEA Enterprise Centre (Norwich), Wolves Lane Centre (London), Down To Earth Project (Gower Peninsula)</blockquote><blockquote>Hands-on demonstrations: <a href="https://ecococon.eu/gb/">Ecococon</a>, lime rendering, <a href="https://www.blokbuild.com/">Blokbuild</a>, hempcrete, thatching, clay plastering, earth and light earth, closed-panel timber&nbsp;framing</blockquote><blockquote>One-to-one sessions and group talks with <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Mentor-Directory-10ab14daefb680869fadfdb17e9634e3?source=copy_link">mentors and partner organisations</a> in support of individual participants’ action plans, hosted by Fircroft&nbsp;College</blockquote>Image: Angela Grabowska<p>ReBuilders was established with Bill Reed’s vision of regenerative practice in mind: that which goes beyond what’s deemed green, sustainable or restorative, to do not only less bad but to do more good, using whole systems thinking. Together with our partner organisations, CIVIC SQUARE and Material Cultures, we sought to curate a programme that negotiated the tensions of our aspirations:</p>  Working with locally-embedded practitioners in the West Midlands while acknowledging the wider scale of entanglements in our supply chains, and the planetary-scale impacts of the construction sector  Acknowledging and enabling the idiosyncratic specificities of small-business operations, many of which are driven by personal priorities, while at the same time encouraging networks and identifying commonalities  Growing clarity and agency around the small actions and positions that this group of business leaders could take in the near-term, while keeping an eye on the bigger systemic shifts that are necessary for a just transition in the built environment  Image: CIVIC SQUARE, adapted from Bill Reed, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09613210701475753">‘Shifting from ‘Sustainability’ to Regeneration’</a><p>Ultimately, we aimed to show how outstanding regenerative buildings can catalyse changes in their eco-regions and beyond, and how individual businesses working regeneratively can similarly scale their impact to play an integral role in transitions from the neighbourhood-scale upwards.</p><p>While the programme offered opportunities for direct knowledge transfer across generations, perspectives, and areas of expertise, the transformative qualities of ReBuilders can be seen for their full expansiveness only in retrospect. Over the course of our time with the ReBuilders, in the range of planned and unplanned ways in which we came together, evidence of new ways of learning and working together emerged. These modes and methods sit within the ecosystem of reimagined civic infrastructures that define the area of our ongoing collaboration with CIVIC SQUARE, as laid out in our recent collaborative initiative around 3º Neighbourhoods.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/neighbourhood-public-square/3%C2%BAc-neighbourhood-582903b050b2">3ºC Neighbourhood</a></p><p>In this piece, we will lay out five ways we learnt and explored regenerative building practices in the collective setting of ReBuilders. These ways of learning posed important questions and pointed to possibilities around how we might move toward a self-sustaining ecosystem of regenerative practices and practitioners. In asking not just what but how we learnt, we hope to sketch possible methods for future coalition-building around a regenerative future for the built environment.</p> 1. The retrofit design&nbsp;hack  How can we approach novel problems differently? <p><a href="https://wecanmake.org/">WeCanMake</a> hosted a quick-fire ‘retrofit detail hack’; a thirty minute session that brought together small groups of ReBuilders to think through a particular design issue they’ve come across in their work. Armed with printout detail sections and pencils, the ReBuilders came up with possible solutions to the problem that drew on their different areas of expertise. Having previously presented this same detail to researchers and engineers from the University of Bath, WeCanMake noted that the builders came up with different solutions.</p><p>The nature of the exercise — quick, non-rivalrous and yet still competitive — pointed to new ways to think about solving retrofit problems of seemingly overwhelming scale. By reframing how we collate different types of knowledge and expertise together, the exercise reimagined how we could solve repetitive problems at the scale of a street or a neighbourhood.</p><p>The ideas formulated in these small groups were greater than the sum of individual approaches to the detail. The hack format created space for productive disagreement and collaborative feedback, building coherence across viewpoints and supporting a collaborative spirit in the&nbsp;room.</p>Image: Angela Grabowska 2. In-person visits  What can we gain from seeing evidence of the possible? <p>A key part of the programme was a series of site visits to existing examples of regenerative buildings and projects across England and Wales. Across <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Key-Programme-Dates-Session-Information-6cca5be1f199461db898e0151329e0da?source=copy_link">the sites we visited</a> we met with architects, builders, groundskeepers, community leaders and volunteers, as well as the people who call those buildings their workplaces.</p><p>Seeing the built examples and hearing from different perspectives was beneficial in and of itself, but there was a much more important aspect to these site visits that’s often overlooked in climate and economic transition thinking. The visits made it possible to imagine alternative future lives and livelihoods. Seeing these buildings in real life and meeting the practitioners not only presented evidence of alternative ways of building, but also led us toward a more visceral appreciation of what the ‘work’ looks like that brings these types of construction methods and practices to&nbsp;life.</p><p>Alongside this, we experienced for ourselves the palpable differences in the qualities of spaces created by bio-based buildings such as more comfortable temperatures and improved internal air quality, while hearing how people who lived and worked in these environments felt longer-term impacts on their mental wellbeing and functioning.</p><p>These site visits and discussions opened up different avenues of thought for the group, making the shift we’re working towards more tangible and more enticing.</p>Image: Angela Grabowska 3. The maintenance perspective  Who and what is in our regenerative building coalition? <p>As part of our session with ReBuilders mentor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/irenabauman/?originalSubdomain=uk">Irena Bauman</a>, we met with Lisa, a member of Fircroft College’s cleaning team. In telling us what her team has to consider in planning the college’s maintenance, and giving us a tour of the spaces she works in and things she pays attention to, Lisa widened our view of the processes involved in making a building that’s fit for purpose over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Meeting Lisa raised the question of how we can better design and build in ways that can be regenerative past the point when architects and construction teams leave the site. What constitutes stewardship, when the building is in the hands of those who live in and maintain these structures?How can designers and builders align their work with the maintenance and care work that comes after they hand over the building?</p><p>Our ‘maintenance tour’ showed Fircroft’s building in relation to time. As an historic structure, we saw ways in which the building’s contemporary use doesn’t align with its original design, so Lisa’s team has to fit their large stores of equipment into tiny closets, but we also saw how materials like stone stand the test of time. Equally, Lisa’s work highlighted how important cleaners and other behind-the-scenes workers are to making places habitable through work that happens on cycles from daily to&nbsp;annual.</p><p>The time we spent speaking with cleaners and groundskeepers at Fircroft showed how we need to bring more voices in the room around regenerative building practices. Could we make more progress toward our goal of regenerative building if we better understood how construction workers and those who will later work in these spaces have many of the same priorities? Our cohort was excited by the idea of this continuum of stewardship and knowledge.</p>Image: Angela Grabowska 4. Sites as classrooms  What pathways does construction open&nbsp;up? <p>Community building processes at Wolves Lane and Down to Earth have been actively designed with a long-term vision of distributive, place-based regeneration in mind. Teams in both of these places drew us into their ambition to bring communities into the building process, and showed us how this can amplify the benefits of regenerative construction.</p><p>Community-led construction reframes stewardship of the building and moves beyond the logic of direct monetisation of places. We witnessed how regenerative architecture is defined by the pathways that are opened up over the course of decades, rather than being defined solely by what a building is worth or what it costs to&nbsp;build.</p><p>At Down to Earth, construction is positioned as a form of therapy that benefits health, while at the same time providing affordable, low-carbon homes to local residents in the Gower Peninsula — and they’ve done the quantitative <a href="https://downtoearthproject.org.uk/research-impact/">research</a> to back up these outcomes and share them with a wider audience. At Wolves Lane, the Ubele Initiative has co-designed the construction process with Material Cultures so that nearly everyone who’s likely to use the building has had a hand in its making, supporting the organisation’s aims of empowerment and social change. When we visited Wolves Lane (and got involved in clay plastering), we saw how this approach to construction maximises different benefits that can come from its component processes, treating construction as a durational resource for regeneration rather than just a thing to get done as cheaply and quickly as possible.</p><p>The pathways opened by regenerative building practices show us how it’s not just about the finished building, but about what doors can be opened on the&nbsp;way.</p>Image: Angela Grabowska 5. Seeing leadership with longevity  What comes after the stubborn trailblazers? <p>Barbara Jones of the School of Natural Building and Ecococon, and Mark McKenna of Down to Earth, represent examples of amazing leadership in this field by committed experts who, by their own account, have been told that their ideas were impossible or couldn’t be done countless times. In McKenna’s own words, “the established construction industry is determined, well funded and resolute in how it currently operates”, a challenge that calls for a large dose of stubbornness and belief that change is possible. The tenacity of leaders like McKenna and Jones has made headway for the next generation of practitioners, but it’s taken commitment over decades of learning difficult lessons to get to this&nbsp;point.</p><p>This points to the necessity of working in coalition, building relationships across disciplines and career stages, and fostering mentorship for building tacit knowledge of these practices.</p><p>Networks and forums (like <a href="https://architectscan.org/">ACAN</a>) need to be enabled and seen as a key part of the ecosystem that will enable dissemination of knowledge and opportunity while building momentum and supporting longevity.</p>Image: Angela Grabowska What’s next? <p>ReBuilders offered us a glimpse of what a 21st century, regenerative construction sector looks like. For this sector to be a part of neighbourhood-led, climate and eco-social transitions, there is a need for reimagined roles for construction workers and allied built environment practitioners. We are invested in reimagining and redesigning what future skills training and learning programmes look like, to create genuine routes into these lives and livelihoods. With our partner organisations, Dark Matter Labs is committed to exploring how to realise the emergent networks and initiatives that ReBuilders programme planted as seeds. Please reach out if you have aligned endeavours that we could work toward together.</p><p>For us at Dark Matter Labs, the programme strongly underscored the importance of working in alliance, identifying shared intent, and maintaining momentum toward change. With this in mind, we’ll soon share the collective resource database, initiated during ReBuilders, which we are transforming into a live index for the&nbsp;public.</p><p>Finally, we’re pleased to announce that the ReBuilders programme will be returning later in 2025. This second iteration of ReBuilders will focus on retrofit and embed the principles of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m2hSkCZ_zE&amp;t=1s">Retrofit Reimagined</a>, while further integrating the programme within CIVIC SQUARE’s work at neighbourhood level.</p><p>If you’re a leader of a small or medium-sized construction business in the West Midlands and interested in taking part, please keep an eye out for further news in the weeks to come by following CIVIC SQUARE, Material Cultures, and Dark Matter Labs on social channels.</p>  CIVIC SQUARE: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/civic_square/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/civic-square/?originalSubdomain=uk">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/civic-square-30350377814">Eventbrite</a>  Material Cultures: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/material_cultures/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/materialcultures/">LinkedIn</a>  Dark Matter Labs: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/darkmatterlabs/?viewAsMember=true">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/darkmatter_labs/">Instagram</a>

  <p>SaaS apps not only have to meet the rigorous demands of managing users at an enterprise level but must also be secure and resilient by design.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/technology-blog/open-letter-to-our-suppliers">“An Open Letter to Third-party Suppliers”</a>, Patrick Opet, Chief Information Security Officer of JPMorgan Chase, writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Modern integration patterns, however, dismantle these essential boundaries, relying heavily on modern identity protocols (e.g., OAuth) to create direct, often unchecked interactions between third-party services and firms’ sensitive internal resources.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modern identity secure standards can help with user lifecycle maintenance of SaaS apps, e.g., provisioning and deactivating employees, and everything else in between. These solutions include adhering to protocols that facilitate single sign-on (SSO), user lifecycle management, entitlements, and full session logout across all applications. On top of managing user and non-human identities, e.g., service apps, adding AI access to work applications will bring unprecedented complexity. We don’t have a way to manage these AI tools, but there is a standard solution that aims to solve this problem. First, let’s go over how AI is currently set up to integrate across work applications.</p>

 OAuth for Enterprise AI 
<p>More AI tools are using protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect their AI learning models to make external requests to relevant data and apps within the enterprise. With growing demand and popularity for adopting AI in the workplace, how can we safely integrate AI into the enterprise?</p>

<p>Solution: There is no need to reinvent how we authenticate and authorize AI to protected resources. With recent updates to the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization">MCP authorization spec</a>, we can continue to rely on OAuth and authorization servers from external providers like Auth0, separate from MCP servers, to authenticate/authorize non-human identities, including AI.</p>

 Enterprise AI connecting to external apps 
<p>Right now, app-to-app connections require interactive user consent and happen invisibly to the enterprise IdP. Naturally, AI-to-app connections follow the same setup, which is not ideal because we need a way to move the connections between the applications, including non-human identities, into the IdP, where they can be visible and managed by the enterprise admin. How can we make this possible?</p>

<p>Solution: By combining new and in-progress OAuth extensions called <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining/">“Identity and Authorization Chaining Across Domains”</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/">“Identity Assertion Authorization Grant”</a>, which we’ll refer to as “Cross-App Access” for short. These extensions enable the enterprise IdP to sit in the middle of the OAuth exchange between the two apps or AI-to-app.</p>

 A brief intro to Cross-App Access 
<p>In this example, we’ll use Agent0 (a hypothetical MCP client) as the Enterprise AI application trying to connect to a resource application called Todo0 and its (hypothetical) MCP server. We’ll start with a high-level overview of the flow and later go over the detailed protocol.</p>

<p>First, the user logs in to Agent0 through the IdP as normal. This results in Agent0 getting either an ID token or SAML assertion from the IdP, which tells Agent0 who the user is. (This works the same for SAML assertions or ID tokens, so we’ll use ID tokens in the example from here out.) This is no different than what the user would do today when signing in to Agent0.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, instead of prompting the user to connect to Todo0, Agent0 takes the ID token back to the IdP in a request that says, “Agent0 is requesting access to this user’s Todo0 account.”
The IdP validates the ID token, sees that it was issued to Agent0, and verifies that the admin has allowed Agent0 to access Todo0 on behalf of the given user. Assuming everything checks out, the IdP issues a new token back to Agent0.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Agent0 takes the intermediate token from the IdP to Todo0, saying, “Hi, I would like an access token for the Todo0 MCP server. The IdP gave me this token with the details of the user to issue the access token for.” Todo0 validates the token the same way it would have validated an ID token. (Remember, Todo0 is already configured for SSO to the IdP for this customer as well, so it already has a way to validate these tokens.) Todo0 is able to issue an access token giving Agent0 access to this user’s resources in its MCP server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This solves the two big problems:</p>

<p>The exchange happens entirely without user interaction, so the user never sees prompts or OAuth consent screens.</p>

<p>Since the IdP sits between the exchange, the enterprise admin can configure the policies to determine which applications are allowed to use this direct connection.
The other nice side effect of this is that since no user interaction is required, the first time a new user logs in to Agent0, all their enterprise apps will be automatically connected without them having to click any buttons!</p>

 OAuth’s Cross-App Access protocol 
<p>Now let’s look at what this looks like in the actual protocol. This is based on the adopted in-progress OAuth specification <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining/">“Identity and Authorization Chaining Across Domains”</a>. This spec is actually a combination of two RFCs: <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693">Token Exchange (RFC 8693)</a> and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523">JWT Profile for Authorization Grants (RFC 7523)</a>. Both RFCs, as well as the “Identity and Authorization Chaining Across Domains” spec, are very flexible. While this means it is possible to apply this to many different use cases, it does mean we need to be a bit more specific in how to use it for this use case. For that purpose, Aaron Parecki has co-authored a profile of the Identity Chaining draft called <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/">“Identity Assertion Authorization Grant”</a> to fill in the missing pieces for the specific use case detailed here.</p>

<p>Let’s go through it step by step. For this example, we’ll use the following entities:</p>
 
   Agent0 - the “Requesting Application”, which is attempting to access Todo0 
   Todo0 - the “Resource Application”, which has the resources being accessed through MCP 
   Okta - the enterprise identity provider that users at the example company can use to sign in to both apps 
 

<p></p>

 Single Sign-On 
<p>First, Agent0 gets the user to sign in using a standard OpenID Connect (or SAML) flow in order to obtain an ID token. There isn’t anything unique to this spec regarding this first stage, so we will skip the details of the OpenID Connect flow, and we’ll start with the ID token as the input to the next step.</p>

 Token exchange 
<p>Agent0, the requesting application, then makes a Token Exchange request (RFC 8693) to the IdP’s token endpoint with the following parameters:</p>

 
   requested_token_type: The value <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag</code> indicates that an ID Assertion JWT is being requested. 
   audience: The Issuer URL of the Resource Application’s authorization server. 
   subject_token: The identity assertion (e.g., the OpenID Connect ID Token or SAML assertion) for the target end-user. 
   subject_token_type: Either <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token</code> or <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2</code> as defined by RFC 8693. 
 

<p>This request will also include the client credentials that Agent0 would use in a traditional OAuth token request, which could be a client secret or a JWT Bearer Assertion.</p>

   <code>POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: acme.okta.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
&amp;requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag
&amp;audience=https://auth.todo0.com/
&amp;subject_token=eyJraWQiOiJzMTZ0cVNtODhwREo4VGZCXzdrSEtQ...
&amp;subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token
&amp;client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
&amp;client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjIyIn0...
</code>   

 ID assertion validation and policy evaluation 
<p>At this point, the IdP evaluates the request and decides whether to issue the requested “ID Assertion JWT.” The request will be evaluated based on the validity of the arguments and the customer’s configured policy.</p>

<p>For example, the IdP validates that the ID token in this request was issued to the same client that matches the provided client authentication. It evaluates that the user still exists and is active, and that the user is assigned the Resource Application. Other policies can be evaluated at the discretion of the IdP, just as it can during a single sign-on flow.
If the IdP agrees that the requesting app should be authorized to access the given user’s data in the resource app’s MCP server, it will respond with a Token Exchange response to issue the token:</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store

{
  "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag",
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...",
  "token_type": "N_A",
  "expires_in": 300
}
</code>   

<p>The claims in the issued JWT are defined in the “Identity Assertion Authorization Grant.” The JWT is signed using the same key that the IdP uses to sign ID tokens. This is a critical aspect that makes this work, since again, we assumed that both apps would already be configured for SSO to the IdP and would already be aware of the signing key for that purpose.</p>

<p>At this point, Agent0 is ready to request a token for the Resource App’s MCP server.</p>

 Access token request 
<p>The JWT received in the previous request can now be used as a “JWT Authorization Grant” as described by RFC 7523. To do this, Agent0 makes a request to the MCP authorization server’s</p>
 
   token endpoint with the following parameters: 
   grant_type: urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
assertion: The Identity Assertion Authorization Grant JWT obtained in the previous token exchange step 
 

<p>For example:</p>

   <code>POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: auth.todo0.com
Authorization: Basic yZS1yYW5kb20tc2VjcmV0v3JOkF0XG5Qx2

grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
assertion=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...
</code>   

<p>Todo0’s authorization server can now evaluate this request to determine whether to issue an access token. The authorization server can validate the JWT by checking the issuer (iss) in the JWT to determine which enterprise IdP the token is from and then checking the signature using the public key discovered at that server. Other claims must also be validated, as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant-03.html#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a> of the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant.
Assuming all the validations pass, Todo0 is ready to issue an access token to Agent0 in the token response:</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store

{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "access_token": "2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
  "expires_in": 86400
}
</code>   

<p>This token response is the same format that Todo0’s authorization server would respond to a traditional OAuth flow. That’s another key aspect of this design that makes it scalable. We don’t need the resource app to use any particular access token format, since only that server is responsible for validating those tokens.
Now that Agent0 has the access token, it can request the (hypothetical) Todo0 MCP server using the bearer token the same way it would have received the token using the traditional redirect-based OAuth flow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Note: Eventually, we’ll need to define the specific behavior of when to return a refresh token in this token response. The goal is to ensure the client goes through the IdP often enough for the IdP to enforce its access policies. A refresh token could potentially undermine that if the refresh token lifetime is too long. It follows that ultimately, the IdP should enforce the refresh token lifetime, so we will need to define a way for the IdP to communicate to the authorization server whether and how long to issue refresh tokens. This would enable the authorization server to make its own decision on access token lifetime, while still respecting the enterprise IdP policy.</p>
</blockquote>

 Cross-App Access sequence diagram 
<p>Here’s the flow again, this time as a sequence diagram.</p>

<p></p>

 
   The client initiates a login request 
   The user’s browser is redirected to the IdP 
   The user logs in at the IdP 
   The IdP returns an OAuth authorization code to the user’s browser 
   The user’s browser delivers the authorization code to the client 
   The client exchanges the authorization code for an ID token at the IdP 
   The IdP returns an ID token to the client 
   At this point, the user is logged in to the MCP client. Everything up until this point has been a standard OpenID Connect flow. 
   The client makes a direct Token Exchange request to the IdP to exchange the ID token for a cross-domain “ID Assertion JWT” 
   The IdP validates the request and checks the internal policy 
   The IdP returns the ID-JAG to the client 
   The client makes a token request using the ID-JAG to the MCP authorization server 
   The authorization server validates the token using the signing key it also uses for its OpenID Connect flow with the IdP 
   The authorization server returns an access token 
   The client makes a request with the access token to the MCP server 
   The MCP server returns the response

<p>As the transition period for PCI DSS 4.0 draws to a close on March 31, 2025, PCI DSS 4.0.1 stands as the current version of the standard. More importantly, the March 31, 2025 deadline for full compliance with all new and customized PCI DSS 4.0 requirements is live.&nbsp;</p> 
 What's New in PCI DSS 4.0.1?  
<p>PCI DSS 4.0.1 represents a limited but important revision to version 4.0. While it doesn't introduce new requirements, it <a href="https://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/just-published-pci-dss-v4-0-1">provides crucial clarifications</a> that impact how organizations implement security controls, particularly around multi-factor authentication and payment page security.&nbsp;</p>  
 Key Clarifications in 4.0.1:  
<p>Phishing-Resistant Authentication Emphasis: 4.0.1 strengthens language around phishing-resistant authentication factors, providing clearer guidance on when they can substitute for traditional MFA requirements.</p> 
<p>Enhanced iframe Responsibility Framework: The update clarifies that merchants are responsible for scripts running only on their own payment pages, and provides guidance on how to manage the security of payment page scripts when third-party elements are involved. This distinction is critical for organizations maintaining the security of their payment processing infrastructure, particularly concerning Requirement 6.4.3.</p> 
<p>Refined Payment Page Script Management: Requirement 6.4.3 receives important refinements around how organizations monitor and secure payment page scripts, emphasizing supply chain security and the integrity of these scripts.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Universal MFA Mandate: What Changed on March 31, 2025  
<p>The universal MFA requirement under Requirement 8.4.2, introduced in PCI DSS 4.0, represents the most significant change coming into full effect with the March 31, 2025 deadline.</p> 
 Universal MFA in Practice: From Administrative to Universal Access Control  
<p>Previous Requirement (PCI DSS 3.2.1): MFA was required only for administrators accessing the cardholder data environment (CDE).</p> 
<p>New Requirement (PCI DSS 4.0.1): MFA must be implemented for ALL access to the CDE, regardless of user role or access level</p> 
<p>This expansion affects:</p> 
  
  Cloud-based applications and services  
  On-premises systems and applications  
  Network security devices  
  Workstations and endpoints  
  Servers and databases  
  Administrative consoles  
  
 Expanding the Scope of CDE: Where MFA Must Be Enforced  
<p>Organizations are discovering that their CDE scope is broader than initially anticipated. The universal MFA requirement applies to:</p> 
  
  Direct CDE Access: Any system that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data  
  System Components: All components that support CDE operations  
  Network Infrastructure: Devices that route or control CDE traffic  
  Management Systems: Platforms used to administer CDE components  
  
 Requirement 8.4.2: Exceptions and Edge Cases  
<p>Practical Considerations: PCI DSS 4.0.1 includes specific guidance regarding Requirement 8.4.2, acknowledging that MFA may not be feasible or necessary for every single transaction when cardholder data is accessed as part of a real-time process for a single transaction. Organizations must carefully review the nuances of this requirement to determine applicability, as the broader universal MFA mandate still applies to all CDE access.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pro Tip: Even though PCI DSS focuses on the CDE, we strongly recommend extending phishing-resistant MFA to all workstation logins. Many breaches originate from compromised local credentials that indirectly impact the CDE.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Phishing-Resistant Authentication Advantage  
<p>A key clarification in PCI DSS 4.0.1 addresses <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant authentication</a>. The standard now explicitly states that a phishing-resistant authentication factor can substitute for traditional MFA for non-administrative access in the CDE.</p> 
 What Qualifies as Phishing-Resistant MFA?  
<p>Phishing-resistant authentication methods are designed to prevent credential theft even when users interact with malicious websites or applications. Key characteristics include:</p> 
  
  Cryptographic binding: Authentication is cryptographically bound to the specific service  
  No shared secrets: No passwords, SMS codes, or other interceptable credentials  
  Origin verification: The authentication method verifies it's communicating with the legitimate service  
  
<p>Pro Tip: Don’t just verify users, verify devices too.</p> 
<p>PCI DSS 4.0.1 focuses heavily on user authentication, but many breaches originate from compromised or unmanaged endpoints. To strengthen your posture, pair phishing-resistant MFA with device trust policies: ensure authentication is only allowed from enrolled, secure devices. HYPR supports this by binding credentials to hardware-backed authenticators and enforcing policy controls at the device level.</p> 
 FIDO2 and Passkeys: The Gold Standard  
<p>PCI DSS 4.0.1's guidance continues to reference FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) standards, particularly FIDO2 and passkeys, as preferred authentication methods. These technologies offer:</p> 
  
  Hardware-backed security: Credentials stored in secure hardware elements  
  Built-in phishing resistance: Automatic verification of service authenticity  
  Simplified user experience: Often requiring just a biometric gesture or device interaction  
  
 The Hidden Costs of Traditional MFA at Scale  
<p>While organizations rush to implement universal MFA, many are discovering the hidden costs of scaling traditional authentication methods:</p> 
 Operational Overhead  
  
  Help Desk Burden: Forrester research indicates help desk calls average $42.50 per incident  
  Token Management: Physical tokens require distribution, replacement, and lifecycle management  
  User Productivity: Complex authentication processes can reduce worker efficiency by 10-15%  
  
 Security Gaps&nbsp;  
  
  SMS Vulnerabilities: Text-based codes remain susceptible to SIM swapping and interception  
  App-Based Weaknesses: TOTP applications can be compromised through malware or social engineering  
  Bypass Risks: Complex MFA systems often include bypass mechanisms that create security holes  
  
 Why Passwordless MFA Is the Smart Path to Compliance  
<p>Organizations implementing <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">passwordless authentication </a>solutions are finding significant advantages in meeting PCI DSS 4.0.1 requirements:</p> 
 Simplified Compliance  
  
  Single-Factor Phishing Resistance: Passwordless methods can meet MFA requirements with a single, strong authentication factor  
  Unified Access Control: One solution for all CDE access points  
  Reduced Complexity: Fewer authentication systems to manage and audit  
  
 Enhanced Security  
  
  Elimination of Shared Secrets: No passwords to steal, guess, or intercept  
  Hardware-Backed Protection: Credentials stored in secure hardware elements  
  Automatic Phishing Protection: Built-in verification of service authenticity  
  
 Service Provider Password Hygiene: Moving Beyond Passwords  
<p>Recent compliance updates now require service providers to rotate passwords frequently—a policy that adds operational overhead without truly mitigating risk. Instead of relying on constant password changes, organizations are turning to passwordless authentication to eliminate shared secrets entirely. By adopting phishing-resistant, device-bound credentials, service providers can streamline compliance, strengthen access controls, and future-proof their identity infrastructure against evolving threats.</p>

 Improved User Experience  
  
  Streamlined Authentication: Often requiring just a biometric gesture  
  Reduced Friction: No passwords to remember or tokens to carry  
  Consistent Experience: Same authentication method across all systems  
  
 Beyond Compliance: Building Long-Term Security  
<p>While meeting the March 31, 2025 deadline is critical, organizations should view PCI DSS 4.0.1 compliance as part of a broader security modernization effort.</p> 
 Zero Trust Alignment  
<p>PCI DSS 4.0.1's authentication requirements align closely with Zero Trust architecture principles:</p> 
  
  Never Trust, Always Verify: MFA for all access, regardless of location or user role  
  Least Privilege Access: Strong authentication supports granular access controls  
  Continuous Verification: Dynamic risk assessment and adaptive authentication  
  
 What’s Next for PCI DSS?  
<p>The evolution from <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/pci-dss-4-password-mfa-requirements">PCI DSS 4.0</a> to 4.0.1 demonstrates the ongoing refinement of security standards. Organizations investing in modern, phishing-resistant authentication are better positioned for future requirements.</p> 
 The Universal MFA Requirements  
<p>With PCI DSS 4.0.1 representing the current version of the standard, the universal MFA requirement represents the most significant authentication change in PCI DSS history, affecting every user who accesses cardholder data environments.</p> 
<p>Success requires more than just deploying MFA technology—it demands a strategic approach that considers user experience, operational efficiency, and long-term security objectives. Organizations that embrace modern, phishing-resistant authentication methods will not only achieve compliance but also establish a stronger security foundation for the future.</p> 
<p>The question now isn't whether your organization will implement universal MFA—it's whether you'll do it in a way that enhances or hinders your business operations while meeting the evolving demands of payment card security.</p> 
 PCI DSS 4.0.1 MFA FAQ  
<p>Q: What happens if we don't meet the March 31, 2025 deadline? A: Non-compliance can result in fines ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 per month, loss of payment processing privileges, and potential legal liability. More importantly, it leaves your organization vulnerable to data breaches and associated costs.</p> 
<p>Q: Can we still use our existing MFA solution? A: Existing solutions may work if they can be extended to all CDE access points and meet the security requirements in PCI DSS 4.0.1. However, many legacy MFA systems lack the scalability and security features needed for universal deployment.</p> 
<p>Q: What's the difference between phishing-resistant authentication and traditional MFA? A: Phishing-resistant authentication is cryptographically bound to specific services and cannot be intercepted or replayed, even if users interact with malicious sites. Traditional MFA methods like SMS or TOTP apps can be compromised through various attack techniques.</p> 
<p>Q: How does PCI DSS 4.0.1 affect our cloud-based payment processing? A: The universal MFA requirement applies to all system components, including cloud-based applications and services. The 4.0.1 clarifications around iframe responsibilities help define specific obligations for different aspects of cloud-based payment processing.</p> 
<p>Q: Is passwordless authentication required for PCI DSS 4.0.1 compliance? A: While not explicitly required, passwordless authentication using phishing-resistant methods can simplify compliance and provide stronger security than traditional MFA approaches. The standard's emphasis on <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/guide-fido-authentication">FIDO-based authentication</a> suggests a clear preference for these modern methods.</p>

<p>In today’s competitive job market, a university degree is no longer the only indicator of a graduate’s readiness for the workforce. Employers are looking for candidates who can demonstrate specific skills and achievements that go beyond a traditional transcript. This shift has led to a growing focus on graduate employability and how institutions can better prepare students to succeed after graduation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, transcripts and diplomas don’t always tell the full story. That’s where verifiable credentials come in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These credentials give students a modern way to highlight their real-world skills and learning achievements. By providing a way for students to showcase their skills to potential employers, universities dramatically improve graduate employability outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



 What Is graduate employability?&nbsp; 



<p>Graduate employability refers to the skills, knowledge, and personal attributes that make graduates more likely to be employed and succeed in their chosen careers. Universities are under growing pressure to not only deliver academic content but also equip students with practical, real-world capabilities. Also, employers want greater insight into what a graduate can actually do, not just what degree they hold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is an example for the persistent gap between academic qualifications and labor market alignment:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2021, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/04/12/10-facts-about-todays-college-graduates/">found that</a> 41% of recent college graduates (ages 22 to 27) were underemployed, meaning they were working in jobs that don’t require a college degree. That’s notably higher than the 34% underemployment rate for all college graduates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The role of verifiable credentials&nbsp; 



<p>Verifiable credentials are digital representations of learning achievements that can be easily shared, displayed, and authenticated. Unlike a traditional diploma or certificate, a verifiable credential contains detailed metadata about what was learned, how it was assessed, who issued it, and when.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These verifiable credentials are built using open standards, such as the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/open-badges-3-explained/">Open Badges 3.0</a> specification and the W3C Verifiable Credentials framework. That means they are cryptographically secure, tamper-resistant, and can be verified instantly without the need to contact the issuing institution.&nbsp;</p>



 How verifiable credentials enhance graduate employability 



<p>Here are a few ways credentials can directly support graduate employability:&nbsp;</p>



 Make skills visible&nbsp; 



<p>Verifiable credentials allow universities to highlight specific skills and competencies that may not appear on a transcript. From soft skills like communication and leadership to technical proficiencies like data analysis or project management, credentials give employers a clearer picture of a graduate’s capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



 Support lifelong learning&nbsp; 



<p>Employers value candidates who show a commitment to ongoing professional development. Verifiable credentials can be earned for <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/microcredentials-in-higher-education-benefits-examples-and-how-to-get-started/">microcredentials</a>, workshops, internships, and extracurricular achievements to help graduates build a lifelong portfolio of verified learning experiences.&nbsp;</p>



 Improve trust and transparency&nbsp; 



<p>Verifiable credentials are secure and can’t be faked. Employers can instantly validate the issuer, criteria, and evidence behind a credential. This builds trust in the credential and in the graduate presenting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Enable more equitable hiring&nbsp; 



<p>Verifiable credentials help level the playing field by focusing on competencies rather than pedigree. A student from a smaller or lesser-known institution can stand out based on what they’ve actually learned and achieved, not just the name on their degree.&nbsp;</p>



 Increase student motivation and engagement 



<p>Students are more likely to engage in skill-building activities when they know their efforts will be recognized in a way that’s useful after graduation. Digital credentials offer immediate, meaningful recognition that students can carry with them into the job market.&nbsp;</p>



 Implementing verifiable credentials at your institution&nbsp; 



<p>To effectively use verifiable credentials to boost graduate employability, universities should:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Align credentials offerings with in-demand job skills and industry frameworks.&nbsp;<br> 



 Allow students to collect and manage their credentials in secure digital wallets.&nbsp;<br> 



 Promote employer awareness and acceptance of digital credentials.&nbsp;<br> 



 Embed credentials pathways into existing academic and co-curricular programs.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>At Anonyome Labs, our technology helps universities issue secure, tamper-proof credentials that students can easily share with employers without sacrificing data privacy or requiring ongoing verification support from your institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you’re launching a digital credentials program for the first time or upgrading your current system, Anonyome Labs can help you align with the latest standards and best practices for graduate employability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>World Accelerates Thai Expansion Amid Indonesian Suspension Over Biometric Violations</p>



<p>World, the digital identity platform operated by Tools of Humanity, is expanding rapidly in Thailand through partnerships with 11 local firms, including National Telecom and digital asset exchanges such as Bitazza and Binance TH. Since introducing its iris-scanning Orb devices in March, over 100,000 users have submitted biometric data, with plans to reach 2 million users by year’s end. However, in contrast, Indonesia has suspended World’s services due to regulatory violations related to biometric data collection and inadequate protections for vulnerable populations. Authorities have ordered the deletion of collected data and imposed new compliance conditions. Meanwhile, World has launched its first U.S. ad campaign and expanded its Orb rollout and blockchain integration with stablecoin issuer Circle. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202506/world-announces-expansion-in-thailand-as-indonesia-blocks-its-services?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8I0aiDf0YBzwHIACuT1ekyL-qE3TPKdKBW2955I27jItaZqKYcwjEbnSlg0gWQ31ApGU2l">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>23andMe Fined £2.31 Million by UK ICO for Major Data Breach Exposing Sensitive User Information</p>



<p>The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has fined DNA testing company 23andMe £2.31 million for a significant 2023 data breach that exposed sensitive information from over 155,000 UK users. The breach occurred through a credential stuffing attack, leveraging reused passwords from other breaches to access 14,000 accounts, ultimately compromising data related to 6.9 million individuals. While DNA records were not accessed, exposed details included ethnicity, health information, and family histories. The ICO found 23andMe lacked adequate security measures, such as mandatory multi-factor authentication. Amid ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, the firm’s assets are set to be sold to TTAM Research Institute for $305 million, with new commitments to improve data protections and give users greater control over their data. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grggw4n56o?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9K_OljgepL-ge8pWNldxOsxZMJ8rmO3G7SpLPuVEQrJBJLGKotrJfboazvQk875aVhtfYl">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Louisiana Faces Backlash Over Bills Mandating Online Age Verification and Parental Consent for Minors</p>



<p>Louisiana is at the center of a legislative clash over online age verification, as two major bills—HB 570 and SB162—provoke controversy from tech companies and civil liberties advocates. HB 570, awaiting gubernatorial approval, would require app stores and developers to implement age assurance for apps with adult content, raising concerns from groups like the CCIA and Google about user privacy and disproportionate burdens on developers. Meanwhile, SB162 mandates parental consent for social media accounts created by minors under 16 and restricts targeted advertising and messaging, but is currently on hold due to a legal challenge from industry group NetChoice, which argues the law is unconstitutional and inconsistently applied. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202506/louisiana-sees-age-assurance-legislation-battle-between-big-social-big-app-store?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9CyfThSRznZtRRWOjEU7FPMfySf9uxREcLU92eXvnPKPKpRkP1q4nzGHm_U-HDGUv0fLho">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>DOJ Antitrust Review of Google’s $32 Billion Wiz Acquisition Signals Scrutiny of Cloud Expansion</p>



<p>The U.S. Department of Justice is reviewing Google’s proposed $32 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Wiz Inc. to assess potential antitrust concerns. The deal, announced in March, is part of Google’s effort to strengthen its cloud computing services, following a similar move with its 2022 acquisition of Mandiant. The review is in its early stages and could extend for several months, examining whether the merger could unfairly restrict competition. Google has prepared for possible regulatory hurdles by agreeing to a $3.2 billion breakup fee. This scrutiny comes amid broader antitrust actions against Google, including rulings that found the company maintained monopolies in online search and advertising technology markets. <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/googles-plan-to-buy-security-firm-wiz-gets-antitrust-review-11749847377764.html?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gBy4GKPdt9iEdP-ISFBDojO78zGgdHQbaFbj2NghUiCDsIG1a94JW15QD9eFGzc5kljDw">(Source)</a></p>

  SpruceID is redefining LER verification with open standards and privacy-first credentials that put learners in control of sharing their achievements.

<p>When a learner earns a credential, whether it's a workforce certificate, micro-credential, or degree, they deserve to share it with the same trust, control, and clarity that we expect in any other critical verification process.</p><p>As Learning and Employment Records (LERs) gain traction across education, training, and workforce systems, we're facing a pivotal challenge: Why aren't these credentials built on the same principles of transparency, consent, and interoperability as other verified information in our digital lives? If LERs continue to rely on fragmented standards, formats, and verification practices, learners are left navigating a maze while employers and institutions struggle to interpret records consistently and securely.</p><p>To build trust in the LER ecosystem, we need credentialing infrastructure that meets users where they are: portable, verifiable, and understandable across contexts.</p> The Existing Model: Simple but Limited <p>In many implementations, the credential is uploaded to a central service after issuance. The learner shares a static URL or QR code, and anyone with access can view the full contents and verification status, no wallet or special tools are needed on the verifier's side. This ease of access is a clear benefit.</p><p>However, the model is generally more centralized than might be desired, which comes with some challenges. First is control of and access to data. The verification experience relies on the availability and integrity of a third-party service (or, commonly, services tied to the issuer) that holds the credential data. If the user is removed from that system, they lose the badge information stored in that system. This makes the holder dependent on the issuer to maintain the service and credential info for them. Next is reliability - if the badge-holding system goes offline or is compromised, the verification capabilities are also lost. Lastly, there is the question of privacy. If the verifier must visit a central service, particularly one managed by the issuer, then the issuer knows who is verifying what information about every badge. That is a powerful set of tracking data. </p><p>When the entire credential is shared and made broadly available for verification at a public or semi-public address, there's no opportunity for selective disclosure, either to choose not to share certain information or to give consent per verification request. Even when this type of badge sharing is revocable, these links generally are “all or nothing” and lead to overexposure.&nbsp;</p><p>We want to evolve these solutions as we move towards a more privacy-preserving, user-controlled world of digital data sharing.&nbsp;</p> A New Approach: Privacy-Preserving, Standards-Based Verification <p>At SpruceID, we’ve taken a new approach to building Learning and Employment Record (LER) credentials, one that gives learners more control and privacy. We use the <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Open Badges 3.0</a> standard, which defines a common way to describe learning achievements so they can be recognized across different platforms. Open Badges 3.0 specifies the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM) 2.0</a> for structuring these credentials, enabling cryptographic security, portability, and tamper resistance. This approach gives learners more control over how their credentials are shared and verified while aligning with emerging ecosystem standards.</p><p>For issuing and presenting credentials, we use <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OID4VC (OpenID for Verifiable Credentials)</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OID4VP (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations)</a>, which allow credentials to be securely shared in real-time, with the holder’s consent rather than stored on a central server. To support selective disclosure, we package the credential using <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SD-JWT VC</a>, a format that lets the holder reveal only specific pieces of information rather than the entire credential. </p><p>Altogether, this approach lets learners store credentials in their secure digital wallet and decide exactly what they share, when, and with whom, providing stronger privacy, less reliance on intermediaries, and better alignment with data protection laws.</p><p>In this model:</p>  Credentials live with the holder, not on a hosted server  Verification is interactive, happening in real time between the holder and verifier  Only necessary information is shared, thanks to selective disclosure and user consent flows  Standards like GDPR and FERPA are easier to support by design  <p>This approach preserves portability: learners can use their credentials across platforms and systems, even if the original issuer or platform disappears. It's also designed for longevity, supporting lifelong learning records that the holder truly owns and controls.</p> Why This Matters <p>We believe credential holders deserve the same control over their achievements that they are learning to expect from their identity data. That means user consent, data minimization, and resilience against vendor lock-in.</p><p>For issuers, this means credentials that are portable and can be used across systems and platforms.</p><p>For verifiers, it means a more secure, tamper-resistant way to confirm qualifications, with standards-based integrations that can plug into existing HR or admissions workflows.</p><p>For learners, this means credentials they truly own, not just access to a link but full control over how their accomplishments are shared and seen.</p> A Familiar Yet More Secure UX <p>Although this model introduces more real-time interactions, the user experience remains intuitive. For example, when an employer wants a job applicant to verify their appropriate credential, they can embed a QR code for the learner to scan with their credential wallet. This allows the learner to review the request, simply scan the QR code, and tap “approve” when prompted. As more systems begin to use open standards, any compliant wallet or verifier would be able to participate in building out or adopting these solutions. Broad compatibility is critical for long-term ecosystem success.</p><p>Verifiers will likely need to adapt their existing processes to a small extent. Instead of reviewing a credential on a webpage, a recruiter or admissions officer might need to share an OID4VP QR code and save the results from that request instead. Although this is a shift, it offers more security and reduces fraud, and simple integrations with verifier products will evolve over time.</p> Supporting Optionality <p>We also recognize that one size doesn't fit all. Some credentials are meant to be widely shared and carry less sensitive data. For some use cases, public links will always make sense. These scenarios can still support individuals by adding short-lived presentation tokens or creating one-time verification experiences that can be shared with a key or code.&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal is to offer institutions and holders flexibility to choose between high-trust, high-control models and simpler, open-sharing options depending on what’s appropriate for their business needs.</p> Building LER Credentials for the Future <p>As digital credentials become a foundational layer of how we recognize learning and achievement, it's time to evolve the way we verify them. Static links and centralized systems have their place, and have been a baseline and necessary first step, but there are exciting improvements to these expectations that we are beginning to see around privacy, control, and interoperability.&nbsp;</p><p>At SpruceID, we believe that by embracing open standards, centering learner privacy and consent in these processes, and empowering users with modern, secure digital credential wallets, we can create a verification experience that is simultaneously intuitive, resilient, and trustworthy.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Back in 2018, our conversations revolved around how India’s UPI is picking up, and similarly why document verification is still so time consuming. We were discussing mainly usecases like VISA processing, Higher education across the border, and dreaded Government office visits in India, where every time you visit, there will be one more document missing between us and what we want to get. That is where we focused on solving for ‘trust’ in digital transactions, leading us to dive deep into something called Verifiable Credentials (VC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward five years, and many usecases spanning from nation scale (ONDC, NPCI etc), and small apartment usecases (for the likes of certificates for cultural programs, sports events etc), we’ve gathered some insights we’d love to share.</p>



<p><br></p>



 Understanding Verifiable Credentials (VC) 



<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">VC is a w3c standard</a> for how to share information/credentials. At its core, VC aims to:</p>



 
 Confirm that the credential hasn’t changed since it was issued.<br> 



 Verify the issuer’s identity.<br> 



 Check if the credential is still valid (not expired).<br> 



 Determine if the credential has been revoked. 
 



<p>VCs are a powerful way to manage credentials, helping machines quickly verify digital documents and boosting trust. It also focuses on providing the user the much needed ownership of her/his data. But, alas widespread adoption hasn’t fully taken off yet. The reasons for it are many, and valid when you think from the lens of the adopters. Lets list some.</p>



 
 It is an ecosystem story: You need all 3 parties (Issuer, Holder, and Verifiers) to use it to make it meaningful 



 Interoperability: Even though standard is flexible and provides options to interoperability, majority of the solutions use custom proof section, and ZK (ZeroKnowledge) system, making the issuer data, not easily verifiable from the service providers. 



 Government is a major stakeholder: In many scenarios, and usecases, the ball stops at the government. Because the Government’s adoption is a key blocker to build ‘trust’ in solutions. 



 Changes to existing software products: For many private companies we spoke to, the economics of making changes to existing software stacks was not feasible, and VC standards needed that change to even get started. 



 Who pays?
 
 As it is an ecosystem play, the question in mind of for-profit companies is, who should pay? Why should I pay if I am issuing VC, because the service providers are benefiting from ‘Verifiable’ data. 



 For non-profits, it is not sustainable to keep funding the efforts repeatedly 



 For Govt and Executives, the ‘perk’ is not very clear. If people don’t come to offices, how do they ‘exercise’ their power? 



 Few of the visionaries wanted it, but bureaucracy is such that the very few startups in this space can never work with the government because of stricter tender norms. 
 
 
 



<p>But someone has to break this huge blocker, and here is how we approached the problem and designed the solution stack.</p>



<p><br></p>



 Data Tokenization by Dhiway 







<p><br>This is where data tokenization comes into play—think of it as adding a powerful new capability of verification without changing your existing data. Here’s what makes it valuable:</p>



 
 Integrity Checks: Easily verify if content remains unchanged by comparing hashes.<br> 



 Issuer Verification: Use digital signatures (private/public keys) to confirm who issued the document.<br> 



 Validity Checks: Include expiry directly within your data to manage validity effortlessly.<br> 



 Revocation Control: The issuer can dynamically manage document status through tokens.<br> 
 



<p>But that’s just the beginning. Data tokenization offers even more advantages than traditional VCs:</p>



 
 Easy Integration: Seamlessly connect with your current systems without additional changes.<br> 



 Universal Compatibility: Tokenize any document type, not just JSON-based VCs.<br> 



 Enhanced Trust: Transparent, decentralized logging ensures complete trustworthiness.<br> 



 Time-series Verification: See document changes over time, not just single-point verification.<br> 
 



<p></p>



 <br>Sounds Ideal, What’s the Catch? 



<p>The primary limitation is that unlike VCs, which may be verified offline, data tokenization requires internet connectivity to interact with network nodes for verification. Beyond this, data tokenization is remarkably versatile and simple to implement.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>More Benefits You Should Know About 



 
 Compliance Ready: Fully aligns with data privacy standards like DPDP and GDPR.<br> 



 Flexible Security: Easily rotate keys for added security.<br> 



 Empowerment: Delegate issuance powers, enabling broader participation.<br> 



 Enhanced VC (VC++): Even VC JSON data (without embedded proof) can be tokenized for convenient use, much like a digital wallet.<br> 



 Enhanced mDoc (mDoc++): Supports modern credential formats like mobile Driver Licenses (mDL).<br> 



 Simplified Storage: Store tokenized data flexibly across various platforms like Google Drive, WhatsApp, local folders, or FTP servers, eliminating the need for dedicated wallets. 
 



<p><br>One may ask, “ ‘Tokenization’ is the word which is loosely used with web3 and blockchain technologies, isn’t it for ‘Transaction’ only?”. We always say, tokenization is a key word that came to highlight, because more people are using it. It is already being done. The STOCK MARKET works on tokenized shares today. The Bankers Cheque (Demand Draft/DD) is another such example. We are talking about ‘Data’ here, which is surely a superset of every thing we talk about Tokenization.</p>



<p>Does Tokenization solve all the things mentioned above?</p>



 
 Common Standard. Simple API to access.&nbsp; 



 NO (major) CHANGES to existing software products, they continue to generate documents as is, with a new API added to it.&nbsp; 



 The government can integrate without concern of sovereignty concerns. 



 Who pays? : This will be explained in a separate blog, many interesting pointers here, and we believe you will come back to read about it  



 It is an ecosystem story: Decentralized networks are designed for ecosystems. With CORD’s OnChain Governance, an option to run an enterprise network, the ecosystem should be able to benefit out. 
 



<p></p>



 <br>All good? Let’s see how Dhiway can help. 



<p>What does Dhiway do? Simply put, we’re amplifying trust to find and fulfill opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, our vision is, there would never be ‘one chain to rule them all’, hence providing the document / data creators an option to choose what they need. Public, private, consortium led tokenization network/stack is the right way to make people consume these features faster. Keep customer’s needs, their regulations, and their compliance requirements in mind when we propose a solution.</p>



<p>With that, Dhiway’s CORD based platform allows people to get started quickly on this, and start your journey with ‘Verifiability’.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking a bit about the whole Model Context Protocol (MCP) thing.“</p>



<p>According to its documentation, MCP is ‘an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.’ Given the growing dependence on large language models (LLMs), this is a big deal (remembering that <a href="https://toloka.ai/blog/difference-between-ai-ml-llm-and-generative-ai/">all LLMs are a type of AI, but not all AIs depend on LLMs</a>). If we’re moving toward a world where AIs are expected to do All The Things, interfacing with our applications and services, then having a universal adapter that lets AIs talk to everything is undeniably powerful.</p>



<p>But, me being me, as soon as I saw someone describe MCP as an “open standard,” I immediately had questions.</p>

<p>I’m not a developer; I can’t speak to MCP’s utility from a coding perspective. I’m not an architect, either; I can’t tell you where this fits best in your environment. But I am a standards person. So if you tell me something is an open standard, I’m going to want to know: who is standardizing it? What process are they following? Who’s doing the review? What are the intellectual property considerations?</p>



 What a standards organization does 



<p>Let’s back up for a moment. What does a standards development organization (SDO) actually do?</p>



<p>If you’ve never looked into it, you might joke that SDOs exist to slow things down under the weight of process. OK, fair. But let me ask: why is that always a bad thing?</p>



<p>That process guarantees broader review across multiple dimensions. For example, the <a href="https://ietf.org">IETF</a> requires a security considerations section in every draft submitted for publication. They also mandate cross-area review, requiring input from the different <a href="https://www.ietf.org/technologies/areas/">areas</a>: Internet, Web and Internet Transport, Applications and Real Time, Routing, and Security.</p>



<p>Over at the <a href="https://w3.org">W3C</a>, every spec is <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#doc-reviews">subject to</a> privacy, internationalization, accessibility, and architectural review, often more than once during its lifecycle. And all the formal SDOs I’ve worked with have some kind of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policy, which goes beyond an open-source license to include licensing terms for essential patent claims.</p>



 You have to start somewhere 



<p>To be clear, most SDOs didn’t emerge fully formed. They started with a handful of people who weren’t satisfied with the existing processes or the politics. That’s how the <a href="https://whatwg.org">WHATWG</a> began, opting for a living-document model and less procedural overhead than the W3C. (Though in my opinion, they eventually ended up with just as much process, just differently shaped.)</p>



<p>So maybe MCP is on its way to becoming its own kind of SDO, at least for this protocol. That’s fine. You have to start somewhere. But if that’s what’s happening, I don’t know where those conversations are taking place. Is there a governance plan? An IPR framework? A mailing list that isn’t just announcements?</p>



 So, back to MCP 



<p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>, the company behind Claude, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">announced</a> MCP late last year to address a real problem they’ve faced as an AI vendor: how to standardize context exchange between apps and LLMs—doing so openly and transparently. That’s great. I genuinely appreciate the transparency, and I understand the desire to move fast in an area evolving as rapidly as AI. However, when people hear ‘open,’ they often assume peer-reviewed, widely adopted, and safely maintained. But an open GitHub repo doesn’t guarantee any of that.</p>



<p>By publishing the spec openly and encouraging others to use it, they’re aiming for what’s often called a “<a href="https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/embedded/article/21796209/whats-the-difference-between-de-jure-and-de-facto-standards">de facto standard</a>”, something widely adopted even in the absence of formal standardization. Go team!</p>



<p>But I’m still worried.</p>



<p>I like the structure of a formal review process. I also like being able to point to exactly who reviewed a spec for security, privacy, and accessibility, and knowing that those reviews weren’t optional. Knowing that if you implement something before those reviews are done, you’re doing so at your own risk is critical.</p>



<p>Will adding a process slow things down? Yes, but I don’t think that’s a bad thing. It’s better to go slower than to trip over a hazard that could’ve been avoided with just a bit more thoughtfulness.</p>



<p>Just look at what’s happened in other areas of tech when we skipped due diligence: poor API scoping, security vulnerabilities, and consent models that collapsed under legal scrutiny. A good standards process helps us catch those kinds of mistakes before they happen. I’ve been in those three-hour meetings. It’s not glamorous. But you know what happens in those meetings? Someone catches the thing no one saw coming.</p>



 What happens if MCP becomes the default, without structure? 



<p>Let’s talk about the future we might be sliding into without realizing it.</p>



<p>If MCP gets widely adopted without formal structure—no shared governance, no multi-stakeholder review, no clear IPR policy—we don’t get a win for open standards. We get a de facto protocol that locks in early design assumptions, possibly shaped by a single vendor’s priorities, and leaves little room for dissenting use cases or evolving needs.</p>



<p>That might sound fine in the short term. After all, it’s solving a real problem! But over time, we run into real consequences.</p>



<p>What if MCP bakes in patterns that work well for consumer apps but break down in healthcare or financial services, where regulatory audits and fine-grained access controls are non-negotiable? Or, what if it assumes context is something you pull from a user, rather than something the user pushes or consents to, reinforcing an architecture that sidesteps agency and privacy?</p>



<p>What if an entire ecosystem of tooling gets built around early versions of the spec, and then a major vulnerability or design flaw gets discovered, but there’s no defined process or authority to fix it in a way that maintains trust?</p>



<p>If MCP becomes the default before it’s ready, we risk not just technical debt but governance debt, which is harder to see but far more expensive to repay.</p>



 Call to action 



<p>None of this means MCP is flawed or untrustworthy. It’s solving a real problem, and it’s doing it more openly than many. But openness isn’t the same as structure. So here’s my CTA: does anyone want to help this protocol grow up a bit? </p>



<p>Maybe that means finding a home for MCP within an existing SDO or spinning up something new and bespoke. Either way, the structure needs to happen.</p>



<p>I don’t have any contacts in the project, so this is mostly a wish on my part. But if you have any ideas (and if you agree this is a concern), let’s chat!</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/">Spherical Cow Consulting</a>. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down key topics in the world of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser behavior and policy shifts.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have the time to follow every new specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



 



 What is MCP, and Why Is It a Big Deal? 



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it. I’ve been thinking about the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a trending topic in the tech world.</p>



<p>[00:00:38]<br>According to its documentation, MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs).</p>



<p>[00:00:48]<br>And with the rise of LLMs as a dominant type of AI, this protocol could prove essential.</p>



<p>[00:00:56]<br>If we’re truly heading into a world where AI can:</p>



 
 Summarize documents 



 Write and review code 



 Manage complex schedules 



 Coordinate across digital systems 
 



<p>…then having a universal adapter like MCP is a pretty compelling idea.</p>



<p>[00:01:14]<br>So I get the excitement—really, I do.</p>



 



 But What Does “Open Standard” Really Mean? 



<p>[00:01:16]<br>Me being me, the moment I saw MCP described as an “open standard,” I had questions.</p>



<p>[00:01:26]<br>Now, I’m not a developer or a systems architect. But I am a standards person. And when I hear open standard, I ask:</p>



 
 Who’s maintaining it? 



 What’s the review process? 



 Are there intellectual property rights (IPR) concerns? 



 Who decides how and when it changes? 
 



<p>[00:02:00]<br>Because open can mean very different things.</p>



<p>[00:02:06]<br>For example:</p>



 
 Open source: The code is public 



 Open access: No login needed to read documentation 



 Open to contribution: Community can propose changes 
 



<p>[00:02:20]<br>But a true open standard means much more. It implies:</p>



 
 Governance 



 Transparency 



 Neutrality 



 Stability

 Zooming Out: What Do SDOs Actually Do? 



<p>[00:02:44]<br>Before diving further into MCP, let’s look at Standards Development Organizations (SDOs).</p>



<p>[00:02:54]<br>If you’ve never worked within one, you might think SDOs are where good ideas go to die—buried under mountains of email and bureaucracy.</p>



<p>[00:03:03]<br>And yes, it can feel like that some days.</p>



<p>[00:03:08]<br>But that process exists for good reason.</p>



<p>[00:03:10]<br>Take the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), for example. Every draft must include:</p>



 
 A security considerations section 



 Review across multiple technical areas: transport, application, security, routing 



 Checks that prevent major issues at scale 
 



<p>[00:03:43]<br>Or consider the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). They require:</p>



 
 Privacy and accessibility reviews 



 Internationalization checks 



 Architectural coherence assessments 
 



<p>[00:03:57]<br>These aren’t easy. But they force critical thinking, which ultimately strengthens the standard.</p>



 



 Why Governance Matters 



<p>[00:04:27]<br>When a standard is finally published, developers, vendors, and even regulators rely on it. That trust only exists because of rigorous review and intellectual property safeguards.</p>



<p>[00:04:45]<br>Because with foundational tech, you really don’t want legal issues popping up years later.</p>



<p>[00:04:57]<br>All SDOs start small. For instance:</p>



 
 The WHATWG formed because W3C felt too slow 



 W3C itself branched from IETF for the same reason 
 



<p>[00:05:22]<br>Eventually, though, governance always returns—just with different flavors and speeds.</p>



<p>[00:05:31]<br>Lesson? You can’t escape governance. If your idea scales, governance will find you.</p>



 



 Where Does MCP Stand Today? 



<p>[00:05:55]<br>Let’s come back to MCP.</p>



<p>[00:06:09]<br>Anthropic—the creators of Claude AI—released MCP in late 2024 to address a real challenge: how to standardize context exchange for LLMs.</p>



<p>[00:06:25]<br>They’ve done a commendable job being transparent. The spec is published, and adoption is encouraged. That’s what we’d call a de facto standard—it gains traction because it simply works.</p>



<p>[00:06:48]<br>But there’s risk here. If MCP becomes the norm without governance or formal review:</p>



 
 We’re embedding one vendor’s assumptions 



 There’s no accountability or shared maintenance 



 Critical decisions become hard to challenge 
 



<p>[00:07:07]<br>For example:</p>



 
 It may work for consumer apps but fail in regulated industries 



 It might prioritize AI-driven “pull” models, ignoring consent-based “push” models 



 Future changes could break everything, with no obligation to maintain compatibility 
 



<p>[00:07:19]<br>In short:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What starts fast becomes fragile. What feels open becomes proprietary.</p>
</blockquote>



 



 We’ve Seen This Before 



<p>[00:07:33]<br>Consider:</p>



 
 OAuth2: Took years to retrofit its security model after early, chaotic adoption 



 HTML5: W3C and WHATWG had to reconcile major differences just to move forward 
 



<p>[00:07:43]<br>These were not technical failures—they were governance failures. And they’re costly to fix.</p>



<p>[00:08:19]<br>This is what I mean by governance debt. It’s invisible—until suddenly, it’s not.</p>



 



 A Call to Action: Help Build the Foundation 



<p>[00:08:29]<br>To be clear: MCP is not broken. It’s solving a real problem, and it’s already more open than many other AI protocols.</p>



<p>[00:08:35]<br>But openness ≠ structure. A GitHub repo ≠ a standards body.</p>



<p>[00:08:37]<br>So here’s my question:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who wants to help give MCP a real foundation?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>[00:08:45]<br>That might mean:</p>



 
 Finding a home for MCP within an existing standards body 



 Forming a lightweight, transparent working group 



 Agreeing on a proper review process (including privacy, security, and accessibility) 
 



<p>[00:08:58]<br>I don’t care about the venue—IETF, W3C, something new. I care that we do something.</p>



<p>[00:09:06]<br>Because if this protocol is going to power the AI systems that touch every corner of our lives, we can’t afford to be careless.</p>

 Presentation attacks and deepfakes pose more than just technological threats — they challenge the very foundation of trust that powers every online interaction. Thankfully, IDnow remains dedicated to offering the industry’s most dynamic defense system against AI-generated attacks. 



 



<p>Although face verification has become an affordable and efficient way to authenticate user identities, it remains a vulnerable part of the identity verification process and highly susceptible to fraud attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses that wish to protect themselves – and their customers – from the increasingly tech-savvy fraudster must ensure they leverage the latest technologies, including liveness detection, to stay one step ahead. If they don’t, they run the risk of joining the growing list of European companies that lose <a href="https://www.compliancecorylated.com/news/uk-lost-33-2bn-to-frauds-and-scams-in-2024-the-highest-in-europe/">millions in attacks every year.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow continually enhances its face verification and liveness detection capabilities — not as isolated features, but as integral components of our comprehensive trust ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested in how IDnow has been working to mitigate skin tone bias in face verification systems? Read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/synthetic-face-identity-verification-bias/">blog, ‘A synthetic solution? Facing up to identity verification bias.’</a></p>



 What is liveness detection? 



<p>Liveness detection leverages biometric characteristics, such as facial features or fingerprints, to detect whether the presented subject is a living person. In the case of remote face verification, it ensures the captured digital image features a real face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liveness detection also flags so-called ‘unreal faces’, which fraudsters present during the selfie submission stage of face verification. In these presentation attacks, fraudsters present printed photos, videos on monitors, or even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07383">t-shirts</a> or <a href="https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/data/phymatt">personalized hygienic masks</a> in front of the recording device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liveness detection should also protect against new attack vectors, including those that use invisible noise and patterns to camouflage the attack. The attacker may also choose to exploit capture conditions, such as backlighting, to make detection more difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While presentation attacks have been known to unlock mobile devices, they also pose significant risk during the face verification steps of identity verification and KYC processes. It is for this reason that businesses must ensure they have a robust identity verification process that includes liveness detection, presentation attack detection (PAD), injection detection, and deepfake detection.</p>



 How does presentation attack detection (PAD) work? 



<p>Thankfully, presentation attacks do leave clues that can be identified by liveness experts, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern">moiré patterns</a> (interference patterns that can be subtle and take many forms, such as color alteration, face deformation, or unnatural motion) that appear when recording a screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well-crafted attacks can be difficult to identify by the human eye, but thanks to the rise of deep learning-based AI, PAD is becoming more effective. Trained on massive volumes of data, those models can detect subtle clues and anomalies. Some can point out invisible patterns, while others can detect unusual textures in image patches. Researchers have also managed to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07419">detect infinitesimal face color variations</a> due to blood pulsation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>PAD has improved dramatically in both usage and accuracy over the years and remains an incredibly important area for online fraud prevention. To keep up to date with industry developments and reinforce our detection capabilities, IDnow regularly participates in initiatives like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/research-project-soteria-europe/">SOTERIA project</a> and research papers like the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10744500">‘A Novel and Responsible Dataset for Face Presentation Attack Detection on Mobile Devices,’</a> which was presented at the IJCB 2024 conference.</p>



 



Nathan Ramoly shows how easy it is to create a deepfake.



 Deepfakes and the double edge sword of AI. 



<p>While artificial intelligence has enabled new fraud detection capabilities, it has also proven a powerful tool for attacking KYC systems using deepfakes (AI-generated or heavily modified faces).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the not-too-distant past, the creation of deepfakes was only able to be done by experts, but now, thanks to easy-to-use multiple websites and apps, even those with little technological expertise can generate deepfakes in just a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are three main categories of deepfakes:&nbsp;</p>



  Generated faces: Using Generative AI, the attacker creates a face to resemble the target or creates a whole new fake identity. &nbsp;  



  Face reenactment: The attacker acquires a picture of a target’s face, typically from social media, and uses AI to animate the image; adding motion to a static picture to create a fake video from a single photo.&nbsp;  



  Face swap: Here, the attacker acquires a picture of the target’s face and performs a capture of themself. They then upload both images to a deepfake tool that will extract the biometric traits of the target and modify the attacker’s face in a new capture that resembles the target.&nbsp;  



<p>Once generated, fraudsters inject deepfakes into the KYC process through ‘virtual cameras,’ where images are presented as regular selfies. Sophisticated deepfakes mimic actual capture sessions, with natural motion, lighting and texture that does not deform the face. As such, deepfakes can bypass both face verification and PAD, which makes the business case for implementing robust liveness detection even more compelling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address the complexity of threats posed by deepfakes, we combine our proprietary AI-based detection technologies, including liveness detection, with solutions from our trusted partners. This hybrid approach enables us to offer a powerful and adaptive fraud prevention system that complies with European regulations, without compromising the user experience and appetite for smooth and secure onboarding experiences.</p>



 How IDnow’s liveness detection works. 



<p>Our liveness detection technology features three separate checks:&nbsp;</p>



  Presentation attack detection to flag when living faces are replaced by other media, such as pictures or masks.&nbsp;  



  Injection attack detection to prevent the injection of harmful code or commands into an application, database, or other system.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Deepfake detection to detect face alteration crafted by advanced AI.  



 Facing up to the future of liveness attacks. 



<p>As the ability to detect deepfakes improves, we can expect new types of attacks to emerge, especially adversarial attacks, which aim to exploit new-found weaknesses in AI models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By seamlessly integrating our proprietary AI-driven liveness detection with complementary technologies from our trusted partner network, we’ve created a dynamic defense system that anticipates and neutralizes emerging threats before they can compromise security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, our commitment extends beyond our current capabilities. We’ve positioned our platform to evolve continuously, ensuring that as deepfake technologies advance, our detection and prevention mechanisms remain at the forefront of innovation. In doing so, we enable businesses to build lasting customer relationships founded on unshakeable trust, regardless of how the threat landscape transforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this new era where digital identity verification faces unprecedented challenges, IDnow stands as the trusted European leader in identity verification technology, empowering businesses to turn potential vulnerabilities into competitive advantages through intelligent, adaptive and continuous trust management.</p>

<p>Everything you do online forms data that’s tracked, mapped, shared and sold (oh yeah, and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-shock-stats-prove-most-people-have-had-their-personal-data-stolen/">oftentimes stolen</a>).</p>



<p>A lot of this data turns up in digital graphs called <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">social graphs and interest graphs</a>, which social media platforms build and use to analyze user behavior, personalize user experience, recommend content, and sell advertising and the data itself.</p>



<p>A social graph maps who you know—all your relationships within a social network such as friends, family, coworkers, etc.</p>



<p>An interest graph maps what you like—all your connections to other people based on shared interests, hobbies and topics.</p>



<p>Social media platforms like Facebook, X, Instagram, and YouTube, and short form video and content discovery platforms like TikTok and Snapchat, own and control their users’ data graphs, and monetize them by selling targeted advertising based on user connections and interests, selling the data to third parties (e.g. data brokers) for marketing and other purposes, and aggregating the data for other revenue streams.</p>



<p>Social and interest graphs exist for every platform you’re on and for many of the services you’re using (even banking apps). They’re how Netflix knows what shows to recommend and LinkedIn knows which job vacancies to highlight, but also what garden tool or luxury holiday ads will turn up in your feed and browser, for example.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, these graphs contain masses of personal information about you and therefore reveal an awful lot of personal information about you. And while these graphs have some upsides in terms of tailored content, their downsides for privacy and security are far greater.</p>



<p>Here are 7 privacy and security risks of social and interest graphs:</p>



 
 Unintentional data exposure – Your connections, interactions, and interests may reveal more than you realize, even if you haven’t explicitly shared certain details. We’ve all heard how Facebook can predict whether you’ll <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/14/facebook-love-data/">fall in love or break up</a>, and could know you’re <a href="https://www.kidspot.com.au/pregnancy/facebook-might-know-youre-pregnant-before-you-even-tell-your-partner/news-story/d41fb4e2ef869d5182039045c8e0b163">pregnant</a> before you’ve even told your partner.<br> 



 Third-party access and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/datamining.asp">data mining</a> – Social graphs are pots of gold to advertisers, governments, and cybercriminals. Social network data can be mined to gather sensitive information, including location data, health information, religious identity, sexual orientation, and private messages, which can be used for malicious purposes and surveillance.&nbsp;<br> 



 Identity theft and social engineering – Bad actors can exploit social graphs to steal your identity and impersonate you for financial fraud, impersonate your trusted contacts, craft convincing phishing scams, and guess answers to your accounts’ security questions.<br> 



 Algorithmic bias and manipulation – Social graphs help curate content, but they can also reinforce <a href="https://advertising.utexas.edu/news/what-social-media-echo-chamber">echo chambers</a>, control narratives, and manipulate user behavior.<br> 



 Data breaches – If a platform storing your social graph data is breached, your relationships, habits and other sensitive information could be exposed. 2024 was the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/2024-was-the-biggest-year-for-data-breaches/">biggest year on record for data breaches</a>, and statistics show <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">most people in the world</a> have now had their personal data stolen.<br> 



 Data brokers: Social graph data can be sold to <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a>, who can then use the data for targeted advertising, profiling, and other purposes without user consent.&nbsp;<br> 



 Cyberbullying and online harassment: Social network data can be used for cyberbullying and online harassment, such as doxing, which can cause emotional distress and psychological harm.<br>

<p>Hello OktaDev community 👋! Let me tell you a story – a story of dreams, passion, and the continuous pursuit of curiosity. My name is Sohail Pathan, and I’m thrilled to join Okta as a Senior Developer Advocate.</p>

<p>It all started in Nagpur, a quaint city nestled in central India. As a child, I eagerly peered through my window, convinced superheroes were real and that someday Superman himself would swing by. While superheroes never appeared, another hero soon took their place – technology.</p>

<p>School never captivated me much, but the computer lab was a magical place. Recognizing this spark, my parents gifted me my first desktop computer – a moment that forever changed my life. A formal education in Computer Science followed, where I fell in love with Java and the vibrant Android ecosystem. When <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/android-announces-support-for-kotlin.html">Google introduced Kotlin support in 2017</a>, weekends turned into coding marathons, building Android apps for everyday use.</p>

 My professional journey: from an app developer to a developer advocate 

<p>My professional path started at an EdTech startup. Here, my first role as an Android developer unfolded with both excitement and nervous anticipation. I vividly remember my early days, meticulously building and refining app features, driven by the genuine joy of seeing students interact with the app. On the go, my involvement quickly expanded beyond just coding. I found myself drawn to answering student queries on forums and guiding them through their learning journeys.</p>

<p>

<p>One fine afternoon, the founders approached me. They said – You have a gift for connecting with our users. We’d like you to be our first Developer Community Manager. That moment changed everything. I started organizing meetups where we taught about open-source opportunities like <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSOC</a> and <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>. I used to spend most of my time answering questions on our forums, helping learners one-on-one, and cheering them on as they built their first projects.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize it then, but I was doing the heart of a Developer Relations job – talking to upcoming developers, understanding their struggles, and sharing my own code. The community started growing, and I loved it so much that I decided to make community work my fulltime role without giving up my passion for coding. It was a win-win for me 🎉.</p>

 Adventures in developer relations 

<p>The DevRel adventure deepened when I joined a deeptech startup that aimed to solve a big pain point: making it easier to run Android Studio on the cloud, which could help people with machines that have limited processing power (similar to Google’s Firebase Studio today). As the Head of Developer Relations, my mission was clear – build and grow a community of Android developers who could test, give feedback, and shape our product.</p>

<p>So, it was time to roll up my sleeves. I organized virtual and inperson meetups where developers could share their struggles and ideas. We even hosted hackathons, challenging participants to push the tool’s limits and tell us what worked and what didn’t. Week after week, I collected feedback, sifting through every comment and suggestion.</p>

<p>

<p>For four intense months, we listened, iterated, and tried to find product market fit. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, technical roadblocks and limited demand meant we couldn’t go forward. The founders made the tough call to shut down the company. While it wasn’t the happy ending I’d hoped for, this chapter taught me lessons money can’t buy: the value of listening closely to your community, the courage to make hard decisions, and the resilience to keep moving forward.</p>

<p>With these lessons etched in my mind, I was ready for whatever came next.</p>

 Crafting the API universe at Apyhub 

<p>My next stop was <a href="https://apyhub.com">ApyHub</a>, where I joined as the Developer Advocate (early team). ApyHub was building an API Marketplace for both developers and no-code builders – a place where anyone could discover, consume, and Monetize APIs.</p>

<p>I still remember the excitement of helping the team prepare for very first public launch on Product Hunt. Working side by side with Engineering and Marketing, I helped create sample apps, write tutorials in Go and Node.js, and craft blog posts to spread the word. Single-handedly, I produced code examples that developers could copy, tweak, and run immediately.</p>

<p>Every week brought new adventures: I delivered talks on API design, cataloged hundreds of APIs, and explained API specifications in simple terms. We sponsored hackathon tracks that challenged participants to build real projects using our APIs, and rewarded the best ideas.</p>

<p>

<p>Living in a startup meant wearing many hats. One moment, I was designing microservices used by over 40,000+ developers; the next, I was learning the ins and outs of API gateway, containers, and load balancing – things that require a backend to run smoothly. This hands-on experience deepened my expertise in REST architecture and DevOps practices.</p>

<p>But the heart of my role was listening. Eventually, I became the first responder for our users (paid and free), collecting feedback, identifying what mattered most, and working with the team to make it happen. There’s nothing like seeing a user’s face light up when a tricky bug is fixed, or a feature is added based on their own suggestion.</p>

<p>Through APIs, I also discovered the power of OAuth and identity management. I saw how a few lines of code could secure entire apps and protect user data. It was a revelation that pointed me straight to Okta.</p>

<p>With every sample app, tutorial, and user conversation, my passion for APIs grew stronger. And now, here I am, ready to bring all of that to Okta.</p>

 Why Okta? 

<p>I’m beyond excited to be at Okta, a place where security isn’t just a department – it’s part of our DNA. Our customers come first, and every decision we make is guided by a single goal: to give people safe, seamless access to the tools they love. Whether you’re a startup building your first app or an enterprise rolling out AI solutions, Okta’s mission is to keep you secure without slowing you down.</p>

<p>Ready to dive in! I’m excited to share my knowledge of APIs and identity, and even more so to learn from this amazing community. Our collective efforts can build a future where technology empowers everyone – securely, effortlessly, and intelligently.</p>

 A little fun fact about me 

<p>Beyond tech, I’m an enthusiastic foodie – especially when it comes to biryani (a mixed rice dish made with rice, meat, and spices). I’ve explored almost every regional variety in India and, according to my friends, I’m quite the cook myself! Connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/iamspathan">LinkedIn</a>, and perhaps we can discover the best biryani spots together 🍗🎉.</p>

<p>I’m eager to engage with you all, learn your stories, and build amazing things together at Okta!</p>

<p>“Welcome to this detailed guide! If you’re wondering what a facial recognition SDK is and how it plays a key role in today’s ID verification world, you’re in the right place.”</p>
<p>In today’s digital-first world, protecting identities has become more important than ever. From online banking to remote healthcare, verifying real users quickly and securely is a challenge every organization is facing.</p>
<p>One breakthrough solution is the <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">facial recognition SDK</a>, a powerful tool for real-time, AI-driven identity verification.</p>
<p>If you’re new to this term, don’t worry! We’re here to break it down in a very simple and engaging way, just like we always do.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Facial Recognition SDK? 
<p>A facial recognition SDK (Software Development Kit) allows developers to add real-time facial verification into their own mobile apps, websites, or security systems.</p>
<p>It’s powered by artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning models that map facial geometry, like jawlines, eye spacing, skin tone, and compare it with a reference image to confirm a match.</p>
<p>Most importantly, modern SDKs include facial liveness detection, which ensures that the person in front of the camera is physically present, not a photo, deepfake, or video.</p>
<p>This is the core of modern digital identity systems, and Recognito is leading this evolution with our high-performance SDKs.</p>
 How Does a Facial Recognition SDK Work? 
<p>Let us explain this process in a way that feels easy and logical, step by step. </p>
 Step 1: Face Capture 
<p>Using a webcam or phone camera, the system captures a clear facial image in real time.</p>
 Step 2: Feature Mapping 
<p>An AI-powered engine analyzes facial features and measurements. This is the brain of the face recognition SDK.</p>
 Step 3: Comparison &amp; Match 
<p>The image is matched against a stored photo, ID document, or database for identity confirmation.</p>
 Step 4: Liveness Detection 
<p>Here’s where liveness detection for face recognition plays a crucial role. It detects whether the user is real, using <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">face liveness detection SDK</a> techniques like skin texture analysis, blinking, motion detection, or even blood flow monitoring.</p>
 Step 5: Result Generation 
<p>If everything checks out, the system confirms the identity in seconds. Fast, simple, secure.</p>
<p></p>
 Why Is Facial Recognition SDK Important? 
<p>This tool has become essential for companies across various industries. Let’s explore why:</p>
 1.  Stronger Security 
<p>Using facial recognition and facial liveness detection, organizations can stop identity fraud, spoofing, and deepfake-based attacks.</p>
 2.  Smoother User Experience 
<p>Users no longer need to remember passwords or go through long verification forms. With a few seconds of scanning, the job is done.</p>
 3.  Easy to Integrate 
<p>Modern face recognition SDKs like Recognito’s are developer-friendly with full documentation, APIs, and support for mobile and desktop platforms.</p>
 4.  Regulatory Compliance 
<p>If you’re in finance, health, or telecom, compliance with KYC and AML rules is critical. Facial ID systems ensure your process is secure and regulation-friendly.</p>
 5.  Cost Efficiency 
<p>The automation reduces dependency on manual reviewers, helping organizations scale without hiring extra verification staff.</p>
