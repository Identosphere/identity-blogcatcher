<p>With the rapid advancements in cloud computing, data management and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, hybrid cloud plays an integral role in next-generation IT infrastructure. Enterprise-level businesses rely on hybrid cloud solutions to run critical workloads from anywhere by combining and unifying on-premises, private cloud and public cloud environments.</p>



<p>Just like any other IT solution, adopting a successful hybrid cloud strategy starts with examining how this <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> architecture can drive overall business objectives. As an initial step, business and IT leaders need to review the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid cloud adoption to reap its benefits.</p>



 The rise of hybrid cloud 



<p>Before delving into the advantages of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a>, let’s examine how the hybrid cloud computing model became the essential <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure">IT infrastructure</a> model for protecting critical data and running workloads.</p>



<p>Before cloud computing, organizations had no other option but to store data and run their software applications within a traditional IT infrastructure setting—a form of centralized computing comprised of on-premises <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a>, servers, networking hardware and enterprise software applications. As business processes became increasingly digitized, such on-premises setups required increasing amounts of compute power and physical space, which strained operations and increased costs as organizations had to purchase and self-manage all of their infrastructure in-house.</p>



<p>With the advent of enterprise-level cloud computing, organizations could embark on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration">cloud migration</a> journeys and outsource IT storage space and processing power needs to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/public-cloud">public clouds</a> hosted by third-party cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), IBM Cloud, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.</p>



<p>Today, these providers offer virtualized resources ranging from on-demand, ready-to-use software applications to individual <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a> to complete enterprise-grade infrastructures and development platforms. Cloud-based managed services include <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas">Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS</a>), <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas">Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS</a>). Public clouds operate on a pay-per-use basis, providing a cost-effective solution that limits wasting resources.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/private-cloud">Private clouds</a>—computing environments where all hardware and software resources are dedicated to and accessible only by a single organization—emerged primarily as a way for businesses to maintain strict control over IT infrastructure so they could protect sensitive data and meet privacy or regulatory compliance requirements. A private cloud setup is usually hosted in an organization’s on-premises data center. Still, it can also be hosted on a cloud service provider’s infrastructure or rented infrastructure in an offsite data center.</p>



<p>Hybrid cloud technology evolved out of the need to support and integrate computing, storage and services in different computing environments for more capacity and improved overall performance. Hybrid cloud seamlessly combines public cloud, private cloud and on-premises infrastructure into a single, flexible solution that offers portability for running applications and workloads.</p>



<p>Today, a hybrid multicloud approach has emerged that combines two or more public cloud services from different vendors and a private cloud environment. This modern infrastructure model enables <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> application development (e.g., <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a>) and uses a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">container orchestration</a> platform (e.g., <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/docker-swarm-vs-kubernetes-a-comparison/">Docker Swarm</a>) to automate the deployment of apps across all clouds. When effectively designed, a hybrid multicloud architecture can provide businesses with high-performance storage, a low-latency network, security and zero downtime.</p>



 The advantages of hybrid cloud 



<p>Below are some key advantages of utilizing a hybrid cloud strategy.</p>



 1. Agility and scalability 



<p>The primary advantage of adopting a hybrid cloud strategy is agility, which businesses need to adapt to change quickly and capture opportunities to drive business growth. Hybrid cloud supports agility by rapidly <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/provisioning">provisioning</a> computer resources, whether those resources are housed in an on-premises data center or owned and maintained by a large public cloud provider in a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-tenant">multi-tenant</a> data center.</p>



<p>By significantly boosting the delivery speed of IT resources, a hybrid cloud architecture helps businesses stay agile. For instance, hybrid cloud environments can deliver cloud storage capabilities in just minutes instead of the months it might take to build and install the additional physical hardware needed for data storage in a traditional IT environment.</p>



<p>Hybrid cloud also provides the agility to scale resources up or down quickly (both automatically and inexpensively) in response to unexpected traffic spikes. For instance, airline mobile apps are essential to modern personalized air travel. With a hybrid-cloud architecture, the airlines can deal with fluctuating volumes of data, such as during the busy holiday travel season, which requires scaling up resources and data in real-time to improve workflows and deliver better customer experiences.</p>



<p>Lastly, a hybrid cloud ecosystem delivers the agility that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> and other teams need to rapidly develop, test and launch applications in a cloud-based environment—another critical driver for business growth.</p>



 2. Control and flexibility 



<p>Organizations favor a hybrid cloud approach as it offers control and greater flexibility in the allocation of data and resources, resulting in various deployment options. For instance, an organization can exercise control over workloads with sensitive data (e.g., intellectual property, personally identifiable information (PII), medical records) by storing them in a private cloud setting. Other workloads, such as those tied to mobile devices and applications, are often better suited for public cloud deployment. By migrating resource-intensive tasks, such as data processing and storage, to the public cloud, mobile apps can run more efficiently on devices with limited processing power and memory.</p>



 3. Security 



<p>The migration of resources and workloads across hybrid cloud architecture is orchestrated by containers or encrypted <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">application programming interfaces (APIs)</a> that transfer data between cloud computing services or cloud services and on-premises applications. This centralized management system makes implementing security measures like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">encryption</a>, automation, access control and endpoint data security easier.</p>



 4. Compliance and regulatory requirements 



<p>Staying on top of ever-evolving compliance and regulation rules is difficult because different laws require organizations to store and process data in specific geographic areas or under particular conditions. This challenge holds especially true for heavily regulated industries, such as oil and gas.</p>



<p>Hybrid cloud helps businesses comply with different international regulations, allowing them to decide how data is replicated and encrypted and where it needs to be stored. This cloud security feature makes it easier for companies&nbsp;to adhere to privacy and protection standards laid out by different countries and municipalities.</p>



 5. Cost optimization 



<p>A hybrid cloud strategy helps businesses optimize spending and lower costs, such as lowering capital expenditures tied to acquiring, upgrading and maintaining physical hardware or expanding the buildout of data centers.</p>



<p>With a hybrid cloud approach, DevOps and other teams can optimize their spending allocation across public and private clouds for the most cost-effective solution. Hybrid cloud’s pay-as-you-go pricing model helps teams avoid unnecessary spending and balance overall costs and revenue. A hybrid multicloud environment with one or more public clouds combined with private cloud services means no dependency on a single cloud provider and no cloud vendor lock-in, creating more cost-saving opportunities.</p>



 6. Business continuity and reliability 



<p>All enterprise organizations are concerned about business continuity—the readiness to maintain critical functions in an emergency. Business continuity planning includes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/disaster-recovery">disaster recovery (DR)</a>, which concentrates on restoring data access and IT infrastructure after a disaster, whether a network connectivity natural disaster or military attack that causes outages.</p>



<p>A hybrid cloud architecture aids disaster recovery by allowing organizations to back up important data by integrating local storage with cloud resources. This redundancy prevents data loss if one of the backups is comprised. Hybrid cloud also speeds disaster recovery as data is continuously replicated and refreshed, ensuring data integrity, accuracy, consistency and reliability.</p>



 7. Innovation and transformation 



<p>Undoubtedly, hybrid cloud models support business transformation and innovative new technologies. In a recent IBM Institute for Business Value report, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/DAEL0EQY">Mastering Hybrid Cloud</a>, the estimated value of hybrid cloud investments multiplies up to 3x, on average, when combined with other transformation levers. For some industries, the value multiplier is as high as 20x.</p>



<p>The flexibility, scalability and efficiency of hybrid cloud infrastructure supports <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">application modernization</a>, the process of updating legacy applications to cloud-native application environments, which is a crucial part of digital strategy for business transformation.</p>



<p>Besides modernizing legacy applications, businesses are eager to harness the power of <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> capabilities for customer service, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> and more. Generative AI relies on big data, massive computing power, advanced security and rapid scalability—all advantages of hybrid cloud.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/data-story-hybrid-cloud-ai">Learn how hybrid cloud accelerates generative AI</a>



 Disadvantages of hybrid cloud 



<p>While hybrid cloud has many clear advantages, organizations still need to weigh its disadvantages when considering the best way to leverage this modern infrastructure model.</p>



 1. Implementation 



<p>Initial implementation of hybrid cloud architecture can be daunting from a start-up cost perspective and a design perspective. Before embarking on a hybrid cloud journey, organizations must thoroughly evaluate their business needs and work with a public cloud service provider or supplier who can help translate those needs into the best hybrid cloud implementation approach.</p>



 2. Technical complexity 



<p>As enterprises continue migrating their applications and workloads to a hybrid multicloud environment, integration and management become more complex. According to recent estimates, today’s organizations are running <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/QMRQEROB">up to at least 10 clouds</a>, which makes seamless integration, data synchronization and robust security across multiple environments an ongoing challenge.</p>



<p>Overcoming hybrid cloud complexity requires a clear hybrid cloud strategy built around a single hybrid cloud platform architecture that provides a fabric of cloud services.</p>



 3. Visibility 



<p>In a complex hybrid multicloud environment, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devsecops">DevSecOps</a> (development, security and operations) teams can have difficulty obtaining a comprehensive view of all the systems, applications and processes that span on-premises data centers, multiple clouds (private and public), software as a service (SaaS) applications, and applications and data running in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">IoT</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">edge computing</a> environments.</p>



<p>Organizations can overcome visibility issues by using hybrid cloud <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> software and platforms. These cloud management tools enhance visibility and control by providing a unified platform with real-time monitoring capabilities that break down silos. For instance, by tracking their IT infrastructure components’ performance, availability and health, teams can analyze usage patterns and detect issues like latency caused by increased data volume or resource sharing.</p>



 4. Vendor management and cost control 



<p>Hybrid multicloud environments require managing different vendor services. Besides using multiple clouds, a typical enterprise organization also relies on numerous vendor-related SaaS applications, storage capabilities and other services and products. Managing multi-vendor services and controlling costs requires visibility across a single integrated platform so IT leaders can track resource allocations and manage cloud-related costs.</p>



 Creating a hybrid cloud strategy 



<p>The IBM report <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/DAEL0EQY">Mastering Hybrid Cloud</a> indicated that a hybrid cloud approach yields 2.5x more value than a single public cloud alone. By incorporating workload portability, orchestration and management across multiple computing environments, hybrid cloud architecture delivers the flexibility, scalability and security businesses need to innovate and remain agile. As a leader in hybrid cloud solutions, IBM is helping companies harness the many advantages and benefits of hybrid cloud while overcoming the complexities of modern IT infrastructure to create a successful strategy.</p>

 The next generation wants control over their data for a more transparent lending experience 



<p>Having grown up with the internet, smart phones, and social media, young Millennials and Gen-Z borrowers are particularly savvy about using their digital footprints for their own benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They embrace technology to streamline everyday tasks and they want to make informed decisions about transactions. As they increase their presence in the workforce, they are becoming the generations poised to drive the future of lending. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences, young people’s voices came through: They want a more transparent, simpler, digitally-enabled lending process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And open banking can make this a reality. Using secure APIs, advanced data analytics, and machine learning, open banking technology allows consumers to safely share their financial data, giving a more up-to-date and holistic view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit.</p>







<p>Most borrowers are already on board. According to our survey, 77% of those ages 45 to 60 and 68% of those over 60 are willing to grant access to their banking data to secure a credit or loan. Among respondents 18 to 29, the number shoots up to 84%.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of younger customers have already linked their accounts while applying for a loan. And, as digital natives, nine out of ten would prefer a loan option with a digital application or approval process.</p>







<p>The consumer base is changing, opening a window for the industry to evolve in step. Today’s borrowers are calling for a new, digital-first era of lending, giving applicants more control over the information used to determine their creditworthiness.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>By allowing consumers to share access to their financial data, open banking can provides a current view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit for more transparent lending decisions – and a more financially inclusive economy.</p>

<p>If asked what job role is most associated with Identity and Access Management (IAM), what would you say?</p>
<p>Most of you might think a highly technical specialist, or an “IT person”. However, many CEOs, CFOs, Customer Service team leaders, HR analysts and other professionals across companies are involved in IAM decision making. But why is this? This blog will explore why it is important for companies to invest more time and effort in ensuring that Identity and Access Management is well understood across various job functions.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s understand what Identity and Access Management is.</p>
 What is IAM? 
<blockquote><p>“Identity and Access management is the people, processes and systems used to manage digital identities and their entitlements throughout their life-cycle.” ~ <a href="https://open-measure.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DIC/pages/1409143/Identity+and+Access+Management">Open Measure Dictionary</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Organisations use IAM software to manage and secure the identities of both internal and external users for their services and applications. There are &nbsp;two main styles of IAM systems, that are currently in use:</p>
 Traditional IAM or Internal IAM 
<p>Traditional IAM takes care of the internal identities, mainly employees but also can include other groups of individuals such as subcontractors and representatives from partners and suppliers. Think of an employee, from their user account creation, granting the right access to perform their job, until the account deletion when the person leaves the company.</p>
 Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) 
<p>CIAM forked from IAM when the number of Internet applications in every company’s data environment exploded in numbers. Such growth was clearly reflected in the number of screen icons in our devices. Companies of all kinds expect that their applications will be accessed by thousands or millions of consumers, citizens, remote workers, and other types of users. These “customers” could be B2C or B2B. Particularly with the innovations in the LEI world, B2B IAM is becoming a hot topic that will bring massive benefits to the B2B world.</p>
 Why IAM matters to everyone 
<p>Not long ago, when you started a new job or became a university student, someone from IT would provide you with access to necessary systems, and a username and password that needs to be changed after the first login. All identity and access management processes were semi-manual and done by the IT team. Today, we have modern identity standards, but often IAM is an area that only a small group of people in the organisation are involved in. With companies embarking on digital transformation, a larger percentage of the companies’ staff is now becoming involved in building new web and mobile services. But unless everyone has an adequate understanding of IAM, these projects are doomed to fail. Therefore, knowing IAM is not only for the IT folks as it was at the beginning of the millennium.</p>
 Who normally sees Identity and Access management on their desk? 
<p>Identity and Access Management is not an everyday task for many professionals beyond the IT team (or IAM team if it exists). However, when the time comes for strategic decisions, there are several people who will have a voice and decision power in how IAM is acquired, planned, deployed, maintained and expanded.</p>
<p>Especially for the biggest decisions involving risk and money, several sub-organisations and functions have the responsibility to build consensus with the IAM team in order to get their own business objectives met. The most critical of these stakeholders are:</p>
 
 There is no software that magically makes a company GDPR-compliant. Same with PCI DSS, CCPA and other regulations. Compliance officers use IAM among other tools and processes to fulfil their audits. Undoubtedly the compliance team will have clear requirements about what IAM must offer. 
 With a large portion of employees working from their home offices, the risks of attacks to the companies’ systems have drastically increased. The Chief Information and Security Officer is well aware that IAM has taken a leading role in the organisation’s security. 
 Customer Service. Since the concept of self-service account management appeared, CIAM has made a tremendous impact on customer service, and there are multiple ways that CIAM can help. Even in a utopian passwordless world, users will need account recovery and might end up panickily calling customer service. And customer service will ask CIAM to help. Find out more about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/resources/ciam-customer-experience-marketing/" title="leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here">leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here</a>. 
 Business Development / Umbrella Organisations. New student portals, patient portals, citizen portals, new mobile apps, improved authentication methods for existing applications…; for every new or existing web service, every day a new service is being created or improved, and IAM needs to be in place. That’s why business units must understand IAM very well in order to reach their set goals. 
 Human Resources. Today any HR information system (e.g., SAP SuccessFactors, Workday) is in one way or another connected with the IAM systems, both Traditional IAM and CIAM. There again, several persons in the HR team will have a lot to say about what IAM should do and shouldn’t do. 
 The CFO. We know it well, that IAM is a necessary but also hefty investment for organisations. The Chief Financial Officer will carefully evaluate the financial impact and will ask both the IAM vendor and the aforementioned stakeholders for a clear Return On Investment (ROI). 
 
<p>Most of these people unfortunately only truly care about IAM when an issue arises for them.</p>
 Let’s educate everyone on IAM 
<p>Seeing how relevant IAM is across the functions, shouldn’t we start a crusade to educate more people about it?</p>
<blockquote><p>“30% of the time for an IAM team should be dedicated to education and knowledge transfer to people who are outside of the IAM team, and the rest of the organisation.” ~ <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/iam-uk-public-sector-richard-slater-amido/" title="Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.">Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With my personal experience, spending time on educating around IAM is realistic and crucial. There are commonplace and unconventional ways to make this happen: presentations, pre-recorded demos, mini workshops, discussions on hot topics. The executive who leads IAM in the organisation has to become a persuasive agent and make sure that these activities happen, and that more people will be converted into IAM ambassadors. Everyone in the company will benefit from it. After all, times have changed, and there is no digital transformation without CIAM.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>In my research for this blog post, I wondered where the proverb about glass houses and throwing stones originated. I'm unsure whether there will ever be a definitive answer, but <a href="https://www.almanac.com/fact/where-did-the-saying-people-who-live">this one</a> appealed to my education as an English major:</p>
<p>The proverb appeared in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, written in 1385. Later, George Herbert modified it this way: “Whose house is of glass, must not throw stones at another.” And in 1736, Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Don’t throw stones at your neighbors, if your own windows are glass.”</p>
<p>Then I decided I’d give DALL-E a go at it. I like that it turned out so dramatically:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This image captures quite well the point I’d like to make about breach revelations—piling on the schadenfreude provides little solace when you become the target. And let’s face it, we are all targets now.</p>
 For whom the bell tolls 
<p>When the closing bell rang at the NASDAQ on November 29, 2023, Okta shares (NASDAQ:OKTA) had been devalued by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/29/okta-hackers-stole-data-on-all-customer-support-users-company-says.html">nearly 7%</a> and received <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/okta-hit-with-6-downgrades-following-q3-earnings-4-big-analyst-cuts-3246837">six downgrades</a> from previous estimates, despite the company’s better-than-expected <a href="https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results">earnings report</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20231130546/oktas-stock-falls-amid-wave-of-downgrades-now-is-not-the-time-for-profit-push">TD Cowen analyst report</a>, OKTA's financial performance is reflecting “the impact of recent high-profile breaches involving the company’s solutions.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>In reaction, part practical, part penance, Okta stated it would <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/okta-s-90-day-delay-on-product-releases-is-a-critical-step-analyst">halt product releases</a> for 90 days (presumably, the time it takes to get one’s security glasshouse in order). Such news may seem like a holiday gift to Okta’s competitors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, continuing to draw on my English major, John Donne had this <a href="https://allpoetry.com/No-man-is-an-island">great poem</a> a while back about a bell tolling and then Hemingway went on to develop the concept into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls">novel</a>. This sentiment rings true today, as we step collectively into an era of hyper-exposure to cyber-attacks: everybody’s going to take their turn. From Donne’s poem:</p>
<p>Any man's death diminishes me,<br>Because I am involved in mankind.<br>And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>It tolls for thee.</p>
<p>Speaking of humanity, it turns out the initial account that was compromised was a non-human—or service—account. These types of accounts can be unruly, and they don’t use multi-factor authentication. In a <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@dangoodin/111348246005935166">discussion</a> on infosec.exhange (with Adam Shostack and friends, no less!) commentors offer various summaries on what had just occurred and who was to shame. This one, I think, summarizes it up best:</p>
<p>Yes, let’s all agree, the one-word technical summary is accurate. But—to paraphrase a security professional I discussed the matter with—as large as the providers are these days, you can never be certain you’ll have your bases covered everyone takes a turn, even open-source providers.</p>
<p>And—talk about the mother of all identity providers—the DNA research company 23andMe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/23andme-confirms-hackers-stole-ancestry-data-on-6-9-million-users/">reported a breach</a> in October, as well—and likewise continues to realize new depths of the severity of the attack. And again, lest we forget, this cautionary tale is at least as old as 2011, when KuppingerCole Analysts reported similar findings from the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/rsa-securid-it-will-never-be-the-same-again">RSA SecurID breach</a>.</p>
 Cyberculture and the culture of silence 
<p>So, what is the proper response to getting our security <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-retired-players-agree-to-concussion-lawsuit-settlement-0ap1000000235501">bell rung</a> (as the NFL calls it)? Well, first and foremost, it’s important to talk about it openly. That’s not an easy topic for discussion with investors, customers, and competitors looking on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BeyondTrust, which <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">reported</a> the breach on October 2nd 2023, was likely the first customer to speak up about it, because the attackers had finally showed up at the company’s door (front door in this case). Still, Okta took more than two weeks to admit to the breach. Oddly, even now, BeyondTrust’s detailed timeline of the breach provides a lot more specifics than you can find on Okta’s security blog.</p>
<p>There’s a reason the mantra of physical security states, “if you see something, say something”—the social alert draws in a community to restore safety. For example, BeyondTrust reveals that the attacker requested a HAR file archive (HTML backup) for the ostensible purpose of troubleshooting the website. Obtaining the file, the hacker then reused a session cookie from that HAR file to attempt a replay attack on a web service, which BeyondTrust easily blocked. Undeterred, the attacker then switched to using API calls instead. According to BeyondTrust:</p>
<p>API actions cannot be protected by policies in the same way as actual admin console access. Using the API, they [the attackers] <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">created a backdoor user account</a> using a naming convention like existing service accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great intel on how the threat actor conducts business and everyone should be put on notice. Still, valuable time was spent in a moment or two of silence. Why?</p>
<p>The culture of silence needs to go. We need to swap notes. Safety is a collaborative effort, because we can’t know in advance where the next threat will originate or where it will propagate.</p>
 Going to production requires oversight 
<p>The interesting thing about this breach is that it started with a service account and then moved to human accounts. One way this happens is by not hardening the system sufficiently when moving from development to production environments. The Okta Developer portal makes it easy for developers to get moving on projects but will need a thorough security review when deploying applications.</p>
<p>Also, the LDAP interface is typically enabled by default even when not in use, heightening the risk level. Access control policies for sensitive apps and admin accounts are often not adequately designed to limit risk exposure to breaches.</p>
<p>Okta is now critical infrastructure and needs a run book that ensures security is maintained. One of the shocking findings in the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/CSRB_Lapsus%24_508c.pdf">report on Lapsus$</a> breaches “organizations did not always consider third parties and BPOs in their risk management programs.” Communication with third parties is necessary preparation for moving to production, as well.</p>
 How to learn from—rather that gloat over—others’ mishaps 
<p>Proposals for avoiding and dealing with breaches were plentiful at our recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">Cyberevolution</a> conference. For example, we <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5434/1">heard from</a> Michiel Stoop of Philips, who spoke on “How to Minimize the Blast Radius of an Attack?” In this case, the approach was to minimize access from privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Jorge Monteiro of Ethiack pointed out that it’s actually a good idea to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5439/2">attack yourself first</a>, in his presentation titled “Autonomous Ethical Hacking for Accurate and Continuous Security Testing.”</p>
<p>Emergency preparedness is often overlooked in cybersecurity, with the majority of the attention going to prevention and detection. But, if we already agree that we are all simply waiting our turn to be attacked, it seems only obvious that we prepare plans for that inevitable moment.</p>
<p>One proposal we covered at Cyberevolution is the practice of developing and training on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5468/3">tabletop exercises</a>, which was covered in a panel titled, “Arresting Disaster: Driving Incident Response in Cyber-Regulated Europe in an Age of AI Threats,” which included participants from ArmorText and the law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring.&nbsp;It’s important to recognize that even your messaging platforms like Teams, Slack, Signal, and Telegram become compromised in a breach and so your team will need an out of band “break glass” communication that also meets legal requirements of various governments.</p>
<p>Independent of the measures taken to reduce risk and mitigate cyber disasters, the common thread through all these measures is to communicate openly and quickly with the cyber security community. We’ll all fare much better against attackers as we open channels for honest, detailed, and actionable information.</p>

<p>With employee identity risk and fraud on the rise — to the point that the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI has issued a public warning</a> — it’s crucial to ensure that employees are who they say they are. Is the person you interviewed the same person you actually hired? Is the person logging in a legitimate employee? Is the person requesting a credential reset in fact the owner of those credentials? Robust identity proofing helps you answer those questions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Understanding Identity Proofing and Why It’s Needed  
<p>What is identity proofing? Identity proofing is the process of verifying and validating the identity of individuals accessing digital systems. It ensures that the identity exists and that the person claiming the identity is the real owner. Employee identity proofing is a fundamental aspect of safeguarding sensitive information, intellectual property and overall organizational integrity. It addresses one of the major security weaknesses in most IAM systems — the fact that authentication only validates that the credentials being used to access systems are valid. It cannot ensure that the person using those credentials is the legitimate holder, and further that the legitimate holder is actually who they claim to be.</p> 
 Workplace Identity Fraud Escalating  
<p>The rise of remote work and the increase in attacks on identity processes underscore the critical need for reliable methods of verifying and validating employee identities. Using credentials obtained by brute force attacks, phishing, AitM attacks, social engineering and other methods,&nbsp; cybercriminals can readily gain unauthorized access to systems and networks. Sometimes the attacks aren’t particularly sophisticated, but exploit gaps in verification processes to perpetrate identity fraud.</p> 
<p>Consider the case of the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">attack on MGM resorts</a>. Armed with publicly available details, attackers impersonated an employee and convinced the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. From there they could wreak havoc, stealing sensitive data and deploying ransomware that shut down operations for over a week.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>MGM Resorts attack flow</p> 
<p>By implementing stringent identity proofing protocols, organizations can ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.</p> 
 Key Components of Identity Proofing for the Workforce  
<p>Worker identity proofing should include multiple verification methods to increase the security of the proofing process. The methods used will depend on the situation and context. Ideally all components are connected both to each other and to your other identity security tools and systems.</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Document verification determines whether a document — such as a passport, driver’s license or other official document — is authentic or not. This can be done either in person or digitally. Your document verification process should include technology that is able to detect forgeries or alterations.</p> 
 Location Detection  
<p>Location detection is an important aspect of online identity proofing. Is the employee in the geolocation you expect them to be? If not, this may require further investigation. It’s important, however, that your location detection adheres to global regulations.</p> 
 Facial Recognition With Liveness Detection  
<p>Facial recognition uses facial biometrics to determine if a person matches the identity they are claiming. Usually the person will take a selfie as part of the identity proofing process. Liveness detection is a critical feature when using facial verification in order to detect spoofing tactics such as a photo, video playback or even a mask.</p> 
 Live Video Verification  
<p>Live video verification adds an additional layer of security to the identity proofing process. It takes place face-to-face over a video conference, between the employee and their supervisor or an authorized agent and includes questions and actions designed to confirm liveness and detect signs of spoofing or coercion.</p> 
 Chat Verification  
<p>In some cases, such as a lower risk scenario, chat verification may be sufficient. It also may be used as part of a more comprehensive identity proofing flow. Effective chat verification combines AI and human interaction.</p> 
 Attestation  
<p>Attestation by a responsible party of the identity proofing results is a critical part of the process. This creates an official trail for audit and compliance purposes. Your identity proofing software should retain the attested results, not the employee’s sensitive data.</p> 
<p>The integration of these diverse methods creates a comprehensive identity proofing ecosystem, enhancing cybersecurity measures and safeguarding organizations from unauthorized access and data breaches.</p> 
 NIST Identity Proofing Guidelines&nbsp;  
<p>Identity proofing holds a critical role in IAM. Under the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital Identity Guidelines, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63a.pdf">NIST SP 800-63-A</a> covers enrollment and identity proofing. It outlines a general identity proofing flow and describes three different security levels based on the strength of the type of evidence gathered as well as the verification processes used.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> Level 1 (IAL1): This level does not require the user to be linked to a known, established real-life identity. It uses self-asserted attributes — in other words, no identity proofing.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2): IAL2 introduces the requirement for strong proof connecting the user to a valid, real-world identity. It supports a wide range of identity proofing methods, allowing for either remote or in-person validation. This includes government-issued documentation as well as biometrics;&nbsp; proofing cannot rely on knowledge-based techniques.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3): IAL3 is the strictest identity proofing level, requiring user presence and biometric verification.</p> 
 Best Practices for Effective Workforce Identity Proofing  
<p>Many companies verify a worker’s identity at the time of hire and stop there. Make sure your identity proofing strategy addresses all key workplace scenarios and times of increased risk of fraud. Below are some of the most critical moments to address.</p> 
 Employee Onboarding  
<p>Before giving any new hire access to corporate systems and data, HR teams need to ensure that the person they are onboarding has a credible identity and is the legitimate owner of the identity they are claiming. They also need to verify that the new employee is in fact the person that was interviewed for the role. This means elements of identity proofing need to come into play before a candidate steps a real or virtual foot into the office. It’s also crucial to securely tie the new employee’s verified identity to IAM systems using non-phishable methods.</p> 
 Credential Resets  
<p>In many organizations, identity proofing stops at HR’s door. The newly minted employee is provisioned with a digital identity and from that point on verification involves validation of that digital identity — there is no process for ensuring it ties back to the real world holder of that identity. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks that target the credential reset process. For example, an attacker with the right information can claim to be an employee with a new phone that needs to enroll in MFA on their new device.</p> 
 Changing Roles  
<p>A change in roles often provides an employee with access to systems previously out of reach. Before granting those elevated privileges, organizations should make sure that the role change is legitimate and the user is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p> 
 Elevated Detected Risk  
<p>When identity monitoring systems detect potential risks, re-proofing may be indicated depending on the risk level and threat type. For example, if a user attempts to log in from a device that is not in proximity to their computer or engages in other suspicious activity, they could be automatically prompted to provide proof that they are the valid credential holder.</p>

   Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a system architecture guiding tech choices, not a software or service. It prioritizes the individual, allowing them to control their own information. Blockchain technology, as a decentralized database with data spread across nodes, seems a fit for SSI as it ensures accuracy and security. However, it has limitations like being computationally expensive and complex.

<p>For many in the identity industry, hearing “self-sovereign identity” (SSI) automatically makes you think “blockchain.” And, if you’re like me, as soon as you hear blockchain, you think it’s too darn early to play the blockchain drinking game and move on. In the early days of SSI, most of the discussion was, in fact, about identity on a blockchain. That association did a disservice to the concept of SSI. SSI is no more dependent on using blockchain technologies than a passport is dependent on a particular type of paper.&nbsp;</p>



 What is SSI? 



<p>SSI is an architecture that guides technological decisions. It is not a piece of software to install or a service you can purchase. In an SSI model, the individual is the single most important entity in a transaction. That individual controls what happens with their information. For people to trust the individual’s information, there needs to be some measure of both technical and societal trust in the veracity of that information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the puzzle the technology has to solve. How do you create a digital identity with information that has been verified (or possibly asserted) by a third party (like the government), that allows an individual to control what information is shared, does NOT allow the third party to know about the transaction, and yet can be verified as accurate by whoever is receiving the data from the individual?</p>



 What is a Blockchain? 



<p>Several features associated with blockchain technology suggest it is a good fit to solve that problem. At its most basic, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a distributed database with data spread across any number of nodes in a network. Enough math is involved to guarantee that the information in those nodes can only be altered with a clear record of who modified it and when.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the right technology, such as a digital identity wallet, an individual can share this cryptographically secure information with any other interested party. Suppose that information was initially issued by a known, trusted entity, and the data cannot be changed (only added to in a visible way). In that case, no one needs to check back with that issuer to see if the information is accurate. The issuer will, in fact, have no idea that this information was shared at all. The individual is in control, and privacy is preserved. Win!</p>



<p>You might find this article interesting if you’d like to read more about how SSI and blockchain can transform society.</p>



 Other Options for SSI 



<p>We have some obvious wins here by using blockchain technology to support SSI. Why isn’t it the One True Way? Because blockchain has some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/04/14/the-5-biggest-problems-with-blockchain-technology-everyone-must-know-about/?sh=5c35504c55d2">significant limitations</a>. For one thing, it is computationally expensive (which means slow and power-hungry). It is also far more complicated than is actually required for most use cases (if you haven’t seen Figure 6 in this&nbsp;<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8202.pdf">NIST publication</a>, it sums this argument up nicely).</p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a fundamental part of the SSI model. There is an entire&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">registry</a>&nbsp;of possible methods to use and support DIDs. Some are blockchain-based, but others rely on the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;specifications. There are options; it is better to understand your current infrastructure, what problem you’re trying to solve, and decide what technology you need to support. Don’t try to make your problem fit the tool, especially when other tools are available.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>SSI’s core principle is about enabling individuals to own and control their digital identities. This architecture can be implemented through various technologies, not limited to blockchain. Blockchain offers a way to decentralize and secure these identities, but it’s not the only method to achieve the principles of SSI.</p>



<p>And if you play the blockchain drinking game, too, I hope you read this late in your day and have a designated driver to get you home.</p>

<p>Last year, almost 200 million people shopped on Black Friday. Online alone, they spent more than <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/black-friday-statistics/">$9 billion</a>. This holiday season, shoppers are ready to shop again and they’re prepared to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-holiday-shoppers-are-back-in-the-spirit-of-spending.html">spend even more</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are your IT systems ready to handle any spikes and keep everyone jolly? Or are you worried that incidents—finicky apps, slow page loads or even downtime— might ruin the holiday spirit along with your bottom line? &nbsp;</p>



<p>Time and again, we see IT teams struggle to deal with seasonal spikes in demand and outages. This year’s Black Friday sale wasn’t any different. Outage monitoring platform Downdetector reported an 80% jump in people reporting issues with credit card payments. The culprit: some of the world’s biggest payment processing systems (Chase, Visa and Bolt) succumbing to outages. This resulted in a slew of declined transactions, <a href="https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/breaking-chase-visa-bolt-down-207694">frustrating millions of shoppers</a> in the Americas and beyond. Such fiascos are an IT team’s nightmare— no one wants to be the IT person who let the systems go down on Black Friday or Cyber Monday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A great customer experience is critical to keep shoppers happy no matter when or how they shop. Opting for a “code freeze” approach—locking your website and infrastructure days or weeks before Black Friday—might be tempting. It will keep everything stable of course, but what does it eventually cost you? It’s an outdated and impractical practice for modern eCommerce and ultimately makes you less competitive over time. By implementing a code freeze, you also miss opportunities like optimizing to boost conversion. Plus, you run the risk of accumulating technical debt. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of freezing your way through the holidays, consider taking a more proactive stance to diagnose, handle and react to outages during these peak periods (and all the time, really) with an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/J2A8PAAN">AI-powered approach to incident management</a>. An AIOps solution, one that applies artificial intelligence to IT operations, also helps you move away from the traditional “break-fix” method to incident management and keep your systems up and running no matter what. &nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the best use cases for AIOps is strengthening end-to-end system resilience by consolidating data from multiple sources and correlating events into incidents. This gives you clear visibility into the whole IT environment through dynamic infrastructure visualizations and opens the door for AI to suggest remediation actions. This real-time probable cause analysis enables ITOps teams to swiftly identify the underlying causes of incidents and take immediate action. The result is faster mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help you keep your systems ready, not just for the next holiday rush but all the time, consider event management and incident solutions from IBM® (IBM Cloud Pak ® for AIOps and IBM AIOps Insights). These robust event and incident management solutions give you end-to-end visibility into your entire IT estate—your cloud platform, operating system and the underlying infrastructure. Instead of being surprised when your online store or payment processing system start to struggle, AIOps Insights gives you the power to preemptively detect issues, such as outages, allowing you to address them before they disrupt your customers’ shopping experiences. &nbsp;</p>



 With IBM event management and incident response solutions, you’ll be equipped to:&nbsp; 



 
 Proactively identify issues: Stay ahead of potential outages during peak holiday periods by receiving timely alerts and notifications and take corrective actions before issues cause service disruptions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Monitor health and performance: Gain a holistic view of your IT environment, including platforms like Docker and Amazon Web Services, operating systems like Linux®, applications through solutions like Dynatrace or Instana®, and network data via solutions like SevOne. &nbsp; 



 Streamline management: Configure, install and manage integrations easily to tailor AIOps Insights to your specific needs. AIOps Insights integrates with existing ChatOps platforms like Slack to provide insights directly where IT Operations teams work, and uses explainable AI to provide clear recommendations. &nbsp; 
 



 Get started&nbsp;with an AI approach to incident management 



<p>With IBM event management and incident response solutions, arm your IT teams with the tools they need to stay battle-ready and take on outages during peak holiday seasons—before they disrupt your operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today’s customers and employees expect a real-time, personalized and connected user experience on any platform.&nbsp;As enterprise applications grow and evolve to address these needs, integration between applications has become increasingly important. Building point-to-point integrations manually is time consuming, inefficient and costly; andorganizations need a better way to consume and share data, as well as a more flexible and agile way to add new features and solutions. This is where application programming interfaces (APIs) can help. API-led connectivity, also known as API-led integration or API connectivity, addresses these requirements to helps organizations break down data silos, improve collaboration, respond to change quickly and increase innovation.</p>



<p>An API is a set of defined rules that enables different applications to communicate with each other. APIs provide a modern, efficient way to allow others to access and consume an organization’s data and services—enabling companies to open their application data and functionality throughout their ecosystem, including external third-party developers, business partners and internal departments within their companies.</p>



<p>APIs are light, modular building blocks that can be reused and packaged together in multiple applications to provide consistency and scalability and can likewise be secured and controlled. It’s therefore no surprise that API adoption has skyrocketed in recent years. An estimated 75 percent (Source: <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS49836022">IDC FutureScape</a>: Top 10 Worldwide Future of Connectedness Predictions, November 2022) of all enterprises will be using APIs by next year, both internally and externally, in multiple industries and in a wide variety of use cases.&nbsp;</p>



 API challenges 



<p>While APIs are changing a how business is done, they can become unwieldy. A typical organization has 15,564 APIs in use today (Source: <a href="https://nonamesecurity.com/hubfs/Collateral/451research-bw-api-security-trends-report.pdf">451 Research</a>, sponsored by Noname).&nbsp;When changes occur— such as a new data source added or a change to an existing data source, it can be impossible for IT staff to keep up coding APIs by hand.</p>



 API-led connectivity 



<p>API-led connectivity is a modern methodology to integrate applications and data through reusable APIs. It replaces the complex point-to-point integration style to enable a more flexible, scalable and agile architecture. Using APIs—which can be managed, secured, published and monetized using API management software— as reusable assets enables faster, more efficient and more scalable integration.</p>



 Benefits of API-led connectivity&nbsp; 



<p>An API-led connectivity approach helps organizations in the following ways:</p>



 
 Reduce integration complexity and cost: With API-led connectivity, organizations can create an API once and reuse many times in different contexts to serve multiple business needs across the enterprise, reducing costs &amp; increasing productivity. 



 Improve accuracy: Fewer APIs mean lower risk of errors. 



 Provide consistent customer experiences: The same APIs are powering back-end source systems and front-end customer experiences, helping you to provide consistent customer experiences 



 Gain better visibility and control: When applications are integrated via APIs, they are easier to manage and&nbsp;secure. 



 Adapt faster to changing business requirements &amp; technological advancements: As changes inevitably occur, they can be managed at scale without requiring excessive one-off work. 



 Accelerate your application development initiatives: APIs encourage composability. With effective reuse, one API built by a single developer may power hundreds of integrations and applications in your organization. 
 



 API-led connectivity components 



<p>API-led connectivity is made up of two complementary technologies: application integration and API management.</p>



<p>API management software allows you to govern, manage, secure and monetize APIs. Application integration, as the name implies, is responsible for implementing and integrating them regardless of format. Application integration also allows users to create and author APIs, while API management provides methods to control them.</p>



 Application Integration software accelerates API reuse 



<p>Application integration platforms that support APIs provide an opportunity to change the way IT teams operate— enabling business technologists and less experienced developers to compose apps and integrations, as well as allowing IT staff to focus on more strategic priorities such as more complex, revenue-generating activities and governance.</p>



 API-led connectivity from IBM 



<p>IBM® uses a modular but integrated approach to API-led connectivity, allowing organizations to only purchase what they need. <a href="http://ibm.com/products/api-connect">IBM API Connect</a>® is an API management solution that supports the entire API lifecycle and enables providers to create and manage APIs. They can secure APIs using out-of-the-box security and governance policies. Likewise, they can share APIs within and outside the organization using the the App Connect Developer portal and promote reuse. They can also discover existing APIs through the Developer Portal in a self-service manner and reuse existing APIs for other projects.</p>



<p><a href="http://ibm.com/products/app-connect">IBM App Connect</a> is a user-friendly application platform on which to build and reuse APIs. With a low-code interface suitable for business users, it helps streamline application integration and increase API reusability. It is available as a SaaS offering or on-premises. With IBM App Connect, business users and integration specialists can discover existing APIs through the App Connect catalog. They can reuse existing APIs in App/Data Integration projects and they can create new APIs from model-driven integration flows.</p>



<p>Both are key components of the <a href="http://ibm.com/ipaas">IBM iPaaS</a> solution. Tight integration between App Connect and API Connect allows organizations to collaborate and innovate. An API built with API Connect can be discovered and imported into the App Connect connector catalog and an App Connect user can author a flow for an API and then secure it and apply gateway policies, all within the same user experience.

<p>With over 20,000 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) being published each year1, the challenge of finding and fixing software with known vulnerabilities continues to stretch vulnerability management teams thin. These teams are given the impossible task of driving down risk by patching software across their organization, with the hope that their efforts will help to prevent a cybersecurity breach. Because it is impossible to patch all systems, most teams focus on remediating vulnerabilities that score highly in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)—a standardized and repeatable scoring system that ranks reported vulnerabilities from most to least critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, how do these organizations know that focusing on software with the highest scoring CVEs is the right approach? While it’s nice to be able to report to executives about the number or percentage of critical severity CVEs that have been patched, does that metric actually tell us anything about the improved resiliency of their organization? Does reducing the number of critical CVEs significantly reduce the risk of a breach? The answer is that, in theory, the organization is reducing the risk of a breach—but, in practice, it’s impossible to know for sure. &nbsp;</p>



 CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities to strengthen cybersecurity resilience&nbsp; 



<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) program was formed as a result of the desire to shift efforts away from focusing on theoretical risk and toward reducing breaches. CISA strongly advises that organizations should regularly review and monitor the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog and prioritize remediation.2 By maintaining an updated list, CISA aims to provide an “authoritative source of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild” and empower organizations to mitigate potential risks effectively in order to stay one step ahead in the battle against cyberattacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CISA has managed to find needles in a haystack by narrowing the list of CVEs that security teams should focus on remediating, down from tens-of-thousands to just over 1,000 by focusing on vulnerabilities that:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Have been assigned a CVE ID 



 Have been actively exploited in the wild 



 Have a clear remediation action, such as a vendor-provided update 
 



<p>This reduction in scope allows overwhelmed vulnerability management teams to deeply evaluate software running in their environment that has been reported to contain actively exploitable vulnerabilities because they are proven attack vectors—and therefore, the most likely sources of a breach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Shifting from traditional vulnerability management to risk prioritization&nbsp; 



<p>With a smaller list of vulnerabilities from CISA KEV driving their workflows, it has been observed that security teams are spending less time on patching software (a laborious and low-value activity) and more time understanding their organization’s resiliency against these proven attack vectors. In fact, many vulnerability management teams have swapped patching for testing to determine if:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 These vulnerabilities from CISA KEV can be exploited in software in their environment. 



 The compensating controls they have put in place are effective at detecting and blocking breaches. This allows teams to understand the real risk facing their organization while simultaneously assessing if the investments they have made in security defense solutions are worthwhile.&nbsp; 
 



<p>This shift toward testing the exploitability of vulnerabilities from the CISA KEV catalog is a sign that organizations are maturing from traditional vulnerability management programs into Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)—a term coined by Gartner—programs which “surface and actively prioritize whatever most threatens your business.” This focus on validated risk instead of theoretical risk means that teams are acquiring new skills and new solutions to help support the execution of exploits across their organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The importance of ASM in gathering continuous vulnerability intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>An attack surface management (ASM) solution provides a comprehensive view of an organization’s attack surface and helps you clarify your cyber risk with continuous asset discovery and risk prioritization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continuous testing, a key pillar of CTEM, states that programs must “validate how attacks might work and how systems might react” with a goal of ensuring that security resources are focusing their time and energy on the threats that matter most. In fact, Gartner asserts that “organizations that prioritize based on a continuous threat exposure management program will be three times less likely to suffer a breach.”3&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maturing our cybersecurity defense mindset to CTEM programs represents a significant improvement over traditional vulnerability management programs because it gets defenders tackling the issues that are most likely to lead to a breach. And stopping breaches should be the goal because the average cost of a breach keeps rising. The costs increased by 15% over the last three years to USD 4.45 million according to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">Cost of a Data Breach</a> report by IBM. So, as qualified resources continue to be hard to find and security budgets become tighter, consider giving your teams a narrower focus, such as vulnerabilities in the CISA KEV, and then arm them with tools to validate exploitability and assess the resiliency of your cybersecurity defenses.&nbsp;</p>



 Verifying exploitable vulnerabilities with the IBM Security Randori&nbsp;  



<p>IBM Security® Randori is an attack surface management solution that is designed to uncover your external exposures through the lens of an adversary. It performs continuous vulnerability validation across an organization’s external attack surface and reports on any vulnerabilities that can be exploited.</p>



Figure 1. Randori’s risk-based priority algorithm helps prioritize top targets and shares adversarial insights you need to determine impact and risk&nbsp;



<p>In December 2019, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/armellini-logistics">Armellini Logistics</a> was the target of a sophisticated ransomware attack. While the company quickly and successfully recovered from the attack, it was determined to adopt a more proactive approach to prevention moving forward. With Randori Recon, Armellini has been able to gain deeper visibility into external risk and ensure that the company’s asset and vulnerability management systems are updated as new cloud and SaaS applications come online. Increasingly, Armellini has been using Randori Recon’s target temptation analysis to triage and prioritize which vulnerabilities to patch. With this insight, the Armellini team has helped to reduce the company’s risk without impacting business operations.&nbsp;</p>



Figure 2: Randori helps confirm whether CVEs exist on your external attack surface and are exploitable&nbsp;



<p>The vulnerability validation feature goes beyond typical vulnerability management tools and programs by verifying the exploitability of a CVE, such as CVE-2023-7992, a zero-day <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/x-force/ibm-identifies-zero-day-vulnerability-zyxel-nas-devices/">vulnerability in Zyxel NAS devices</a> that was discovered and reported by the IBM X-Force Applied Research team. This verification helps reduce noise and allows customers to act on real—not theoretical—risks and determine if mitigation or remediation efforts were successful by re-testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Benjamin Franklin once said, “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.” This same sentiment can be true when it comes to a successful risk mitigation plan. The only way for effective risk reduction is for an organization to use a step-by-step risk mitigation strategy to sort and manage risk, ensuring the organization has a business continuity plan in place for unexpected events.</p>



<p>Building a strong risk mitigation strategy can set up an organization to have a strong response in the face of risk. This ultimately can reduce the negative effects of threats to the business, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters and other vulnerabilities the business operations may face.</p>



 What is risk mitigation? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/risk-mitigation">Risk mitigation</a> is the practice of putting an action plan in place to reduce the impact or eliminate risks an organization might face. Once that plan has been developed and executed by the organization, it’s up to them to continue to monitor progress and make changes as the business grows and evolves over time. It’s important to hit every aspect of the supply chain and address risk throughout the entire business.</p>



 Types of risk 



<p>While risks will vary greatly from one industry to the next, there are a few commonly identified risks worth noting.</p>



<p>Compliance risk: When an organization violates rules both internal and external, putting its reputation or finances at risk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Legal risk: This is a compliance risk that involves the organization breaking government rules, resulting in a risk of financial and reputational loss.</p>



<p>Operational risk: This is when there is a risk of loss from the organization’s normal daily business due to failed or flawed processes.</p>



 5 steps to a successful risk mitigation strategy 



<p>There are several tactics and techniques an organization could take to make a risk mitigation plan. Organizations need to be cautious, however, not to copy from another organization. In most cases, a business has unique needs and must make its own risk mitigation plan in order to be successful.</p>



<p>It’s important to take the time to build a strong risk mitigation team to strategize and put together a plan that works. This risk mitigation plan should weigh the impact of each risk and prioritize the risks based on severity. While plans will vary by necessity, here are five key steps to building a successful risk mitigation strategy:</p>



 Step 1: Identify 



<p>The first step in any risk mitigation plan is risk identification. The best approach for this first step is to heavily document each of the risks and continue the documentation throughout the risk mitigation process.</p>



<p>Bring in stakeholders from all aspects of the business to provide input and have a project management team in place. You want as many perspectives as possible when it comes to laying out risks and finding as many as possible.</p>



<p>It’s important to remember that all team members in the organization matter; taking them into consideration when identifying potential risks is vital.</p>



 Step 2: Perform a risk assessment 



<p>The next step is to quantify the level of risk for each risk identified during the first step. This is a key part of the risk mitigation plan since this step lays the groundwork for the entire plan.</p>



<p>In the assessment phase you will measure each risk against one another and analyze the occurrence of each risk. You will also analyze the degree of negative impact the organization would face if the risk were to occur for risks such as cybersecurity or operational risks.</p>



 Step 3: Prioritize 



<p>The risks have been identified and analyzed. Now it’s time to rank the risks based on severity. The level of severity should have been figured out in the previous step.</p>



<p>Part of prioritization might mean accepting an amount of risk in one part of an organization to protect another part. This tradeoff is likely to happen if your organization has multiple risks across different areas and establishes an acceptable level of risk.</p>



<p>Once an organization establishes this threshold, it can prepare the resources necessary for business continuity across the organization and implement the risk mitigation plan.</p>



 Step 4: Monitor 



<p>The groundwork has been laid and now it’s time to execute. By this stage a detailed risk mitigation and management plan should be in place. The only thing left to do is to let the risks play out and monitor them continuously.</p>



<p>An organization is always changing and so are business needs; therefore, it’s important that an organization has strong metrics for tracking over time each risk, its category and the corresponding mitigation strategy.</p>



<p>A good practice might be setting up a weekly meeting time to discuss the risks or to use a statistics tool for tracking any changes in the risk profile.</p>



 Step 5: Report 



<p>The last step of the risk mitigation strategy is to implement the plan in place and then reevaluate it, based on monitoring and metrics, for efficacy. There is a constant need to assess and change it when it seems fit. </p>



<p>Analyzing the risk mitigation strategy is crucial to ensure it is up-to-date, adhering to the latest regulatory and compliance rules, and functioning appropriately for the business. Contingency plans should be in place if something drastic changes or risk events occur.</p>



 Types of risk mitigation strategies 



<p>The risk mitigation strategies listed below are used most often and commonly in tandem, depending on the business risks and potential impact on the organization.</p>



<p>Risk acceptance: This strategy involves accepting the possibility of a reward outweighing the risk. It doesn’t have to be permanent, but for a given period it may be the best strategy to prioritize more severe risks and threats.</p>



<p>Risk avoidance: The risk avoidance strategy is a method for mitigating possible risk by taking measures to avoid the risk from occurring. This approach may require the organization to compromise other resources or strategies.</p>



<p>Risk monitoring: This approach would occur after an organization has completed its risk mitigation analysis and decided to take steps to reduce the chances of a risk happening or the impact it would have if it did occur. It doesn’t eliminate the risk; rather, it accepts the risk, focuses on containing losses and does what it can to prevent it from spreading.</p>



<p>Risk transfer: Risk transfer involves passing the risk to a third party. This strategy shifts the risk from the organization onto another party; in many cases, the risk shifts to an insurance company. An example of this is obtaining an insurance policy to cover property damage or personal injury. </p>

<p>More and more consumers now expect their vehicles to offer an experience no different from that offered by other smart devices. They seek full integration into their digital lives, desiring a vehicle that can manage their operations, add functionality and enable new features primarily or entirely through software.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/software-defined-vehicle-market#:~:text=Software%2DDefined%20Vehicle%20Market%20size%20was%20valued%20at%20USD%2035.8,22.1%25%20between%202023%20and%202032">GMI report</a>, the global software-defined vehicle (SDV) market is expected to achieve a CAGR of 22.1% between 2023 and 2032. This growth is driven by increasing demand for advanced features in vehicles, stringent vehicle safety regulations, increased investments in research and development, and enhanced navigation and connectivity. But what exactly defines a SDV, and what is the architectural foundation behind the car that provides connectivity, automation and personalization?</p>



 The SDV in a nutshell 



<p>In an SDV, the vehicle serves as the technological base for future innovations, acting as a command center for collecting and organizing vast volumes of data, applying AI for insights and automating thoughtful actions. The SDV separates hardware from software, allowing for updates and upgrades, automation or autonomy and constant connectivity. It interacts with its environment, learns and supports service-based business models. Simultaneously, onboard electronics evolve from individual electronic control units to high-performance computers with higher performance and simplified integration.</p>



 A close-up of the SDV architecture 



 The infrastructure layer 



<p>This layer includes not only the vehicle but also the telco equipment, roadside units, smart city systems and similar components, as well as various backend systems of the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). These elements are all part of a cyclical process in which vehicle data is used for development, operation and services. Based on insights from this data, new software is delivered to vehicles via over-the-air updates.</p>



 The hybrid cloud platform layer 



<p>In the IBM approach, a uniform Linux® and Kubernetes-based platform spans from the vehicle to the edge of the backend system. It’s supported by Red Hat® Enterprise Linux and Red Hat® Openshift®, allowing software to be flexibly distributed in the form of software containers, adhering to the principle of “build once, deploy anywhere.” The software can be developed and tested in the backend before being easily deployed into the vehicle or infrastructure. All of this provides unprecedented flexibility.</p>



<p>Standardization through abstraction of application software in the form of containers leads to better maintainability and portability of software, resulting in improved developer productivity. The hybrid cloud approach is complemented by the IBM Edge Application Manager, enabling OEMs to scale and operate edge solutions autonomously, along with the IBM Embedded Automotive Platform, a Java runtime optimized for in-vehicle use.</p>



 The AI and data platform layer 



<p>AI models have long played an important part in vehicle functionalities like ADAS/AD. Some OEMs, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/honda-rd-big-data.">Honda</a>, use AI for knowledge management to deliver safer and more personalized automobiles. Regarding vehicle operation, AI is currently applied in cybersecurity to analyze incoming security events and incidents, and on the analysis of telematics data to gain insights into driving experiences.</p>



<p>Today, generative AI can greatly enhance SDV development and operation by automatically generating artifacts such as test cases, architecture models and software source code. This requires an AI and data platform like IBM <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a>™ to manage various optimized foundation models for each use case, build custom-specific foundation models based on customer proprietary standards and safeguard engineering data from being incorporated into public open source foundation models that competitors might exploit. Furthermore, technologies like IBM Distributed AI API enable OEMs to optimize the deployment and usage of AI models in edge devices such as vehicles.</p>



 The security layer 



<p>OEMs are increasingly adopting a zero-trust framework for cybersecurity to counter external and internal threats across development, in-vehicle operations and enterprise environments. One central element in vehicle security is the Vehicle Security Operation Center, where IBM Security® QRadar® Suite can be used for threat detection and security orchestration, automation and response.</p>



<p>OEMs also need to encrypt messages within a vehicle and all other communications that extend beyond it. This can be achieved through the IBM Enterprise Key Management Foundation. Finally, IBM Security® X-Force® Red provides specific automotive testing offerings.</p>



 The AI products layer 



<p>A modern development platform, such as IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management, allows the automotive industry to practice agile software development in a modern CI/CD environment. It provides traceable requirements engineering, model-based system engineering and testing, facilitating collaboration, managing product complexity, applying data-driven insights and ensuring compliance. Furthermore, AI engineering, supported by platforms like watsonx, enables a personalized customer experience. Engineering Data Management solutions help customers in managing the extensive data needed for autonomous driving development, as illustrated in this <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/continental-automotive">Continental</a> case study. Intelligent platforms, like IBM Cloud Pak® for Network Automation enable the automation and orchestration of network operations, particularly relevant for Telcos in the infrastructure. On the backend, IBM Connected Vehicle Insight helps manufacturers build their connected vehicle use cases. </p>



<p>Equally important, SDVs require many specialized technologies from different providers which is why ecosystem collaboration plays an important part in the SDV architecture.</p>



<p>Ultimately, every component in the architecture plays a well-defined role in ensuring the best possible experience for vehicle drivers and passengers, solidifying the SDV as the next evolution of the automotive industry.</p>

 How open banking paints a more nuanced picture of borrowers  



<p>Even in the best economic circumstances, loans are often a necessity, especially for critical purchases like homes and cars.  &nbsp;</p>



<p> For some insight into the lending landscape, Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The upshot: 89% have been adversely affected by economic pressures, and nearly half are struggling to get the loans and credit they need. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional credit scores do not always reflect an applicant’s ability to make payments. Individuals with thin or no credit history can struggle to qualify for credit. Young adults on their own for the first time, gig workers who deal mostly in cash, new Americans and retirees with a single credit card and no loans can struggle to qualify for leases, credit cards and mobile phone contracts. </p>



<p>To most consumers, change is overdue — 87% believe the decisioning process should make it easier for responsible borrowers to prove their ability to repay. </p>







<p>Open banking could help provide that missing piece. By choosing to share their bank account data, applicants can paint a more complete picture of who they are. Real-time insights into their accounts — such as a thin credit borrower’s biweekly deposits, cash flow or consistent payments for bills like utilities — offer an up to date, more comprehensive view of their financial health. &nbsp;</p>







<p>This shift in consumer mindset opens new horizons for lenders, allowing them to champion more inclusive processes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking has the potential to accommodate millions of thin-credit applicants who have previously had difficulties accessing the benefits of the financial system. Consumers have spoken. They want the next evolution of lending to prioritize transparency, accessibility and empowerment for consumers worldwide to build a more inclusive digital economy where everyone thrives. &nbsp;</p>



 Digital lending is on the rise 



<p>The data revealed in Mastercard’s Lend Report shows global consumer support for a more transparent, digital-first approach to lending. Read more about the future of lending in Mastercard’s Lend Report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finicity.com/future-of-lending-report/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Organizations have always used some degree of technology to provide an excellent<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience"> </a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer experience</a>, but the future of customer service will demand even more advancements to meet customers’ growing expectations. </p>



<p>There is no question that customer service is about to take a massive leap forward, thanks to emerging trends like<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/transforming-customer-service-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-game/"> </a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/transforming-customer-service-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-game/">artificial intelligence</a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/transforming-customer-service-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-game/"> (AI)</a>. In fact, nearly 50% of CEOs feel increased customer expectations that organizations will accelerate the use of new technologies like<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/smart/talks/#s4ep5"> generative AI</a>, according to an<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/customer-service"> IBV CEO Guide to Generative AI for Customer Service study</a>. Undoubtedly, the future of customer service must be AI-based for organizations to improve the customer experience and increase customer loyalty.</p>



 Addressing customer turnover 



<p>In a recent report, Gartner predicted that 80% of customer service and support organizations will be<a> </a><a>applying generative AI technology</a> to improve the customer service experience. In short, CEOs know how important<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/generative-ai-meet-your-partner-in-customer-service/"> generative AI and other AI technologies</a> are becoming to create a future-proof<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-strategy/"> customer service strategy</a>.</p>



<p>The stakes are incredibly high, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic when customers increased their likelihood of switching brands. Studies have shown that<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-ZOKKo7II&amp;t=49s"> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-ZOKKo7II&amp;t=49s">80% of customers</a> are likely to switch to a competitor after more than one bad experience with a brand. Customer support is an incredibly important defense against customer turnover.</p>



 The power of AI-assisted human representatives 



<p>We’re at an exciting time in the history of customer service where organizations can experiment with these new tools and build a path towards a world where AI is the copilot for every customer interaction. The same <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/customer-service">IBV study</a> found that 63% of executives expect to have already invested in generative AI use cases to serve agents directly by the end of 2023. </p>



<p>AI will become the central brain of the contact center, where the organization interacts with the customer base. AI-powered customer service does not necessarily mean that all interactions will be self-serve. It instead means human support teams will utilize AI and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> tools as they are helping customers.</p>



<p>While front-line workers will continue to be an integral part of any customer service interaction, the use of new technologies is quickly becoming a competitive advantage.</p>



 How AI will change the future of customer service 



<p>Here are six AI-based customer service trends that will help provide better customer service across the entire customer journey.</p>



 Generative AI-based customer service team training  



<p>All <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/talent-development">talent development</a> will benefit from personalized training built on generative AI, but customer service training will see specific benefits. As issues can vary from customer to customer, customer service reps will need to remain agile when assisting customers. By using generative AI to train unique scenarios that could occur in real situations, reps will be more adept at handling whatever customer issue comes their way.</p>



 AI-driven personalization 



<p>Organizations looking to increase customer satisfaction should look to meet those customers’ needs before an issue occurs. For example, an organization can use AI to send personalized emails to new customers explaining the benefits and uses of their new products based on the customer profile.</p>



 Generative AI call scripts 



<p>Organizations are increasingly creating the ability for<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/generative-ai-meet-your-partner-in-customer-service/"> agents</a> to interact directly with tech applications to deliver instant assistance to customers. Some customers will still want to talk to a human, but those customer service agents at call centers are increasingly enhanced by generative AI scripts and workflows that can update in real-time. This way,<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-care"> customer care</a> representatives have updated information on hand so they can confidently solve the customer’s issue.</p>



 Conversational AI bots 



<p>Traditional <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbots</a>, while helpful, are somewhat limited by the static scripts on which they are programmed.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/conversational-ai"> Conversational AI bots</a> will be better able to react to inputs from customers and update in real-time with new information. These bots get closer to feeling like a human interaction and are more likely to effectively help customers. They will provide a more engaging and personalized experience for customers who prefer self-service tools.</p>



 AI-driven insights from customer data 



<p>AI excels at finding patterns in data that would either take humans too long to unearth or might otherwise go undetected. Organizations can use AI to analyze the complete history of<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/omnichannel-customer-service"> omnichannel customer experience</a> from customer service call transcripts, emails, social media and forum posts and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/crm">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) platforms to make smarter decisions. It can also feed back data if customers repeatedly misuse the product; in this case, the organization can create more specific instructions that warn against using the solution incorrectly.</p>



 Generative AI-based frequently asked questions (FAQs) 



<p>Organizations can no longer draft FAQs based on their own knowledge and forget about updating them for months or years. In our fast-paced world, FAQs need to update constantly, to reflect new issues or uses of the solution. Organizations can use AI to analyze customer calls, emails and social media posts to compile the most frequent questions. Then generative AI tools can utilize the customer care playbook to create the most helpful responses to help with<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-retention"> customer retention</a>.</p>



 IBM and the future of customer service 



<p>Providing great customer service requires organizations to use every tool at their disposal. As newer technologies like AI become more prevalent, organizations should seek to utilize them for every business unit and support team.</p>



<p>IBM has been helping enterprises apply trusted AI in this space for more than a decade, and generative AI has further potential to significantly transform customer and field service with the ability to understand complex inquiries and generate more human-like, conversational responses. </p>

<p>While Identity and Access Management (IAM) long ago gave IT teams tighter controls against unauthorized access to digital services, it hasn’t exactly been bulletproof.</p>
<p>Yes, IAM consolidated the management and storage of user data and enabled login credentials to be associated with user roles and permissions easily. But it also created a single point of failure that hackers have proven painfully adept at exploiting to gain access to all the resources a user is authorized to access.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/journey-through-identity-models-centralized-federated-decentralized">Federated</a> identity management was supposed to fix that by involving a third party in the management of IAM. Instead, it retained all the dangers of centralized identity while extending the potential blast radius of compromised credentials to vast, interconnected networks. Meanwhile, the global cybercrime economy now tops $7.8 trillion a year. The good news: Decentralized digital identity (DID) management has emerged as a superior approach to managing user identity — if you have the right architecture to support it.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Password or a Pretty Face 
<p>In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we shared the contours of the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a>, which employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with up to 99.6% accuracy. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">Part Two</a>, we showcased how we go above and beyond mere logins by binding identity to a biometric stored within a digital wallet. Yet, as solid as these architectural pillars are, we know that decentralized identity models offer a way to keep these and other personal identifiers and information far more secure than traditional user stores — centralized, federated, or otherwise.</p>
<p>To that end, let’s look at why we designed our architecture to support <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">a reusable identity wallet</a> that enables users to securely gain access to corporate systems using identity details that remain under their own control instead of being stored centrally on servers where they can be altered, misapplied, become inaccurate over time—or be swiped, ransomed, or leveraged to commit fraud.</p>
 Decentralized Identity: What’s In Your Wallet? 
<p>In our view, decentralized digital identity isn’t just important to modern IAM. It’s essential because: 1) it replaces platform-specific user stores that are hard to integrate because of proprietary technologies embedded deeply within those very same platforms, and 2) it replaces incomplete user personal identifiable information (PII) scattered across multiple business applications to one version of the truth managed directly by the user.</p>
<p>By leveraging advances in smartphones, cryptography, and blockchain technologies, our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID solution</a> leverages the 1Kosmos architecture to establish high-assurance trust online in a way that balances security, privacy, and convenience. This enables organizations to confidently accelerate user onboarding and activation of digital services, protect digital accounts from unauthorized access (AKA account takeover), prevent transaction fraud, improve the user experience, and more. Specific features include:</p>
<p>A Reusable Identity Wallet</p>
<p>End users gain secure access not just to corporate accounts and systems but also to digital analogs of verified government-issued ID cards, driver licenses, passports, social security cards, and more—anytime, anywhere, from any device. Users also control what personal information they share with digital services in a manner consistent with emerging <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> frameworks.</p>
<p>Portability and Interoperability</p>
<p>1Kosmos offers the only solution certified to the highest FIDO, NIST, UKDAITF standards for interoperability and security and provides an SDK along with off-the-shelf APIs to simplify data sharing and integration.</p>
<p>Verifiable Claims &amp; Credentials</p>
<p>A way to digitally present in real time claims for a virtually limitless number and variety of machine-verified credentials and safely store them so they’re ready to reuse on-demand with user consent.</p>
<p>These features produce enormous benefits for organizations and end users, including the following.</p>
 Rapid Remote User Onboarding 
<p>The 1Kosmos digital identity wallet organizes and stores information gathered, triangulated, and validated during the identity-proofing stage of self-service user onboarding. This includes attributes from multiple, proof-able sources—and enables a wide variety of applications that require identity verification without requiring physical, in-person presence. Think worker and contractor onboarding, applications for government services and documents, and compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) mandates.</p>
 Security Backed by Public Key Cryptography 
<p>Our digital identity wallet consists of a decentralized identifier along with the cryptographic public-private key pair. Personal information about the user and their credentials are stored within the wallet and require the user’s private key and biometrics to read data from it. Because the private key never leaves the Secure Enclave within the device and the biometric can be authenticated with the highest digital standards available, this approach vastly exceeds the security achievable through passwords, traditional forms of multifactor authentication, and unverified device-level biometrics. In turn, this reduces cyber threats related to credentials stolen through phishing attacks, data breaches, and more.</p>
 User Convenience With Just the Right Friction 
<p>When data from the digital wallet needs to be presented—during login or in the event of step-up authentication—the wallet holder must present their biometric and consent to share that data. When approved, the private key is presented as a credential to unlock the wallet and share the data. The private key never leaves the device and hence the risk of compromise is dramatically minimized. Best of all: There are no passwords to remember or clumsy OTPs to enter.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials for a Zero-Trust World 
<p>Verifiable credentials are a standardized means of issuing and presenting claims about one’s identity—driver’s license, passport, college qualifications, gym membership, etc. Other types of information, such as educational certificates and vaccination records, for example, can also be added to the wallet to make the user’s identity-proofing process indisputable in any number of use cases. The identity wallet can make assertions about identity or credentials that are cryptographically verifiable by the receiving party—without the actual data being revealed. The major cryptographic element used by decentralized identities is known as a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/security-glossary/zero-knowledge-proof/">zero knowledge proof (ZKP)</a>. Zero Knowledge proof measures an information request while protecting user privacy.</p>

<p>The modern pace of data creation is staggering. The average organization produces data constantly—perhaps even continuously—and soon it’s investing in servers to provide ample storage for that information. In time, and probably sooner than expected, the organization accrues more data and outgrows that server, so it invests in multiple servers. Or that company could tie into a data center, which is built to accommodate even larger warehouses of information.</p>



<p>But the creation of new data never slows for long. And if an organization takes its new metrics and performs extensive data analysis on them, one result will be that even more data is created from that analysis. At some point, the organization’s data center assets may outgrow even that storage and the company will need to use multiple data centers. Or different departments within that company might opt to use other data centers for certain informational workloads, even though such action ignores best practices.</p>



<p>Regardless of their origin, there are problems like server sprawl that are created by holding information in disparate physical locations. These are largely problems of inefficiency and require a solution that streamlines data storage processes and keeps an organization’s data resources safely organized within a logical framework. And that’s why companies need an effective data center consolidation strategy.</p>



 What is a data center? 



<p>Because the term applies to installations of various sizes, we should be clear about what constitutes a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a>. First and foremost, a data center is an actual place, whether that be an entire building or a single room. It’s a physical space with definable characteristics that’s dedicated to housing and hosting IT infrastructure.</p>



<p>In their genesis, data centers tended to be singular creations developed for the sole use of a single company. Over time, the term came to encompass large, hyper-scale data centers run by cloud service providers, which host numerous organizations and individuals from different companies. For example, IBM operates over 60 IBM Cloud Data Centers in various locations around the world.</p>



<p>There are three types of data center facilities that vary according to their business uses and the workloads they handle:</p>



 
 In enterprise (or on-premises) data centers, an organization hosts all of its data on-premises, usually because a maximum sense of security is desired. 



 Meanwhile, public cloud data centers are hosted within cloud environments by large corporations and offer the convenience of being accessed through a basic Internet connection. 



 Lastly, there are managed data centers and colocation facilities for those organizations not really equipped to run their own data centers but who wish to avoid using the shared resources found in a public cloud data center. In managed data centers, an organization leases the necessary hardware from a data center provider, which then administers the management of that data center. In colocated facilities, an organization owns the infrastructure and leases all of its hardware from a data center provider. 
 



 What is a data center consolidation strategy? 



<p>What data assets do you have and where will you keep them all? And is there a better way—one that offers greater efficiency? These are the guiding questions behind data center consolidation.</p>



<p>A data center consolidation strategy is a plan an organization creates and implements to shrink its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-storage">data-storage</a> processes and streamline its system of data management.</p>



<p>Usually, when we discuss data management services, we’re talking about how to implement them for the gathering and harvesting of data and how to scale them upward for ever-increasing amounts of data. But in the case of data center consolidation, we’re really advocating for the collapsing of certain systems and the integration of their data into a more centralized location. In other words, data center consolidation is primarily a reductive process—one in which the amount of a company’s data isn’t changed, but the number of its various storage systems typically is reduced.</p>



 How does a data center consolidation strategy work? 



<p>A strategy built around data center consolidation doesn’t need to be very complicated, but that consolidation plan will depend a good deal on other variables, like the number of different types of data an organization needs to retain.</p>



<p>At its core, data consolidation efforts are a fairly straightforward activity that start with gathering organizational data from various sources. Then, the data gets improved as needed by cleaning it and combing it for possible errors. Finally, the optimized data gets stored in one location, where it can be accessed most readily.</p>



<p>At least that’s the simple version. In reality, for most companies, crafting a data center consolidation strategy tends to be a much larger and more involved affair. There may be multiple data centers’ worth of data that needs to be gathered, cleaning that data may actually require several steps, and the organization must make important decisions about current data needs and smart projections about future data storage requirements.</p>



<p>Another key step in implementation depends on the internal public information effort to familiarize employees and other company personnel with the data center consolidation strategy that’s been created. It’s been observed that administering a data center consolidation strategy needs to be an “all-in” proposition, with all stakeholders informed about the strategy and what they need to do to support it. Effective change management can prevent strategy deviations, as could occur if staff members were to set up their own data centers independently of the new company policy.</p>



 What are the primary benefits of data center consolidation strategies? 



<p>Although there are numerous advantages to be gained by the organization that carefully implements a data center consolidation strategy, there’s one benefit that’s almost impossible for most companies to ignore: cost savings.</p>



<p>By reducing the number of data centers and other forms of outdated storage systems, an organization stands to substantially lower its operational costs. For example, a business will need fewer IT assets when it achieves consolidation, and this allows it to commence with the decommissioning of outdated equipment. By the same token, the company will need fewer data centers to warehouse data, and it won’t need to purchase new data centers. Each of these situations could generate a positive contribution to an organization’s bottom line by creating cost reductions like reduced maintenance costs.</p>



<p>The other benefits of having an effective data center consolidation strategy in place include improved performance, a streamlined management system for data storage, and enhanced data security with fewer security risks and outages due to the presence of centralized data assets.</p>



<p>One other benefit is a true “win-win,” both for the organization and the environment. When an organization adopts a data center consolidation strategy, that streamlining also increases the organization’s energy efficiency, which reduces the company’s energy consumption and lessens its carbon footprint.</p>



 Six steps for crafting a data center consolidation strategy 



<p>Typically, a data center consolidation process entails the following steps:</p>



 Step 1: Inventory data holdings 



<p>While there are different approaches recommended for handling a data center consolidation project, there’s little argument over what should be any organization’s first step—evaluating what data assets you have and confirming which data center facilities should house them. This needs to be performed with considerable precision and thoroughness given the profusion of data in most organizations.</p>



 Step 2: Define data centers 



<p>Before launching a data center migration process, an organization must first define the physical parameters of the data center(s). This begins with a study of the real estate involved and geographic aspects (such as physical size and available space). It should also include factors related to the data center’s electrical needs, including cabling, bandwidth, connectivity and the required power supply.</p>



 Step 3: Map the workload 



<p>The next step requires that the organization’s software and hardware configurations be mapped out so a fair judgment can be made about resources and usage. What’s working effectively? What isn’t? Having a well-defined discovery and dependency map assists this process, while techniques like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtualization">virtualization</a> help a company redistribute its workloads so that more workloads are handled by one machine.</p>



 Step 4: Assemble the team 



<p>Data center consolidation projects are not small endeavors. And given that they will affect each department within an organization, these projects must be led by personnel with surefooted project management. Likewise, a company should get some sense beforehand of what these various technical upgrades (like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration">cloud migration</a>) will end up costing before the full procurement budget process begins.</p>



 Step 5: Design the plan 



<p>At this point, an organization should have a comprehensive view of its data assets and a complete idea of how the organization’s new data storage system should work. So, it only remains for the IT architects to take all the assembled data about hardware and software systems and develop the final consolidation design. As soon as that design has been thoroughly vetted, the plan can be implemented.</p>



 Step 6: Test and confirm 



<p>Once an organization achieves a post-consolidation environment, it should take the time to fully test and confirm the viability of the revised data center infrastructure. That means checking all parts of the new system and ensuring the stability of the IT infrastructure.</p>



 Data center consolidation strategy best practices 



<p>Numerous best practices can be applied to data center consolidation:</p>



 
 Monitor power usage: Data center consolidation is as much about power utilization as it is data. As a baseline to use in later comparisons, you need to understand how much energy is consumed by your existing configuration before data consolidation begins. 



 Implement DCIM software: Data center consolidation is a mammoth job, requiring the use of data center infrastructure management (DCIM) software that monitors your IT equipment usage. DCIM software gives you the tools to run more efficiently. 



 Assess assets and storage space: This is really a restating of the entire principle behind the development of a data center consolidation strategy. It all begins with thoroughly checking your data assets and comparing that with the space for allocation. 



 Integrate automated processes: In order to reap the full benefits of data consolidation, it’s important to maximize your power efficiency. You can do that by automating power usage, which will help it reach peak efficiency by being controlled via automation. 



 Eliminate deadweight hardware: A thorough inventory of your assets will likely reveal the presence of so-called “ghost servers” or “zombie servers.” These assets are contributing nothing and are in fact drains on electrical power and physical space. 
 



 Get started with your data center consolidation strategy 



<p>Successful data center consolidation provides numerous benefits to the organization that streamlines its data center operations. Having a consolidated data center lets you boost uptime while simultaneously reducing downtime. Beyond that, it’s an optimization process that aids in effective data center management. When used smartly in conjunction with existing business requirements, data center consolidation initiatives can prove to be the first step in effective infrastructure management.</p>



<p>Regardless of your business priorities, IBM offers the hardware and software solutions you need to safely store and protect your key resources—including storage management software that’s designed to help you consolidate data and do more with it.</p>

<p>In a world inhabited by a multiplicity of truths, how may we develop mechanisms to orient positively therein?&nbsp;</p><p>This article explores knowledge graphs as a tool for sensemaking and epistemic pluralism. Data is not neutral. It is contextual — collected under particular conditions, by particular people. And when we gather data together and attempt to make sense of it, we add meaning to it to produce an insight. Insights can then be repackaged as new data points within a layered graph. Rather than seeing these insights and data points as neutral fact, we explore the way that knowledge is a diverse field, with overlapping interpretations. By building tools that let us see these divergences and track their origins, we believe that we can better enable community and society level sensemaking.</p> Making Sense of Contextual Data <p>Raw data points alone are meaningless without interpretation. They exist as inert quantifications exerting only the direct geometries of their measurements and have no further relation to reality. The quantity of lead particulates in public water systems alone is insufficient to derive meaningful action. First, we must also understand that lead particulates are dangerous to humans when consumed and that humans are dependent on public water systems to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>Insights — defined for this post as artefacts of knowledge — are always in relationship to an ontology; they exist within a framework for sensemaking reality. Thus data points and their descendant insights can be divergent across ontological frameworks. The challenge then — for us as a collective species interdependent with the natural world — is to develop a system within which we can make decisions that benefit us as a whole and enable us to cohere towards some common goal, despite our differing opinions, interpretations, agendas, and means of engaging reality. What is more, we must be able to transcend a mono-ontology to truly understand the complexities in the hearts and minds of the entities that inhabit Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>It is the composition of measurements into published, opinionated claims that thread the fabric of a ‘knowledge topology’ upon a distributed library of available data.</p> Gesturing Towards Pluralistic Knowledge&nbsp; <p>Recognizing the pivotal role of cogent insights in informed decision-making, it becomes imperative to establish a system that can both acknowledge and effectively evaluate a diverse array of perspectives, especially when they range from congruent to starkly divergent. This necessity stems from an understanding that our collective perception of the world is inherently pluralistic, encompassing a spectrum of contexts and ontological frameworks where multiple rich contexts and ontologies need to be able to coexist and organise towards a future that is inclusive, yet coherent, interdependent, self-aware, and common enough such that we can avoid undesirable internecine interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>It is here that a set of tooling in support of a healthy, composable and pluralistic Data Commons is described, or more accurately, a set of tooling to enable data commoning! This tooling extends the distributed data storage, query, and analysis modules described in part one of this blog series.&nbsp;</p> Adapting our collective lens for knowledge <p>The authors do not intend to describe a specific implementation. Rather, this post serves as an investigation into praxes of pluralism and knowledge integration. The exact form of these praxes codified into a product are not the focus of this enquiry, and rather we wish to draw attention to the dynamics this tool may embody.&nbsp;</p><p>While modern science boasts remarkable capabilities in accurately measuring various aspects of our world, this informational chapter of the Anthropocene has repeatedly shown that absolute truth is elusive. This observation does not undermine the pursuit of objectivity in our understanding of reality. Instead, it highlights that the perspectives that shape our collective cultural narrative are diverse and often lead to substantial variations in our conceptual models of reality. This diversity underscores the importance of acknowledging and designing an effective lens for the plurality of views when engaging in our collective quest for knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Consider the following diagrams, where two polar (and very generic) ontologies are described. The authors do not intend to provide an argument for either ontology, but rather give them by way of example. The first is a theistic epistemology, the second is an atheistic epistemology. The nodes in both diagrams are shared data points. The highlighted edges represent the structural relationships between the nodes for each epistemology. The semi-opaque edges represent an opposing ontology and have been rendered for the purpose of demonstrating the pluralism that is the thesis of this post.&nbsp;	</p>Figure 1: A subgraph of the global knowledge graph where the highlighted edges defined by the community determine the structure of their theistic ontology.Figure 2: A subgraph of the global knowledge graph where the highlighted edges defined by the community determine the structure of their atheistic ontology.<p>In the above two diagrams, four configurable ‘insights’ are represented by very simplified nouns. Further, the use of simplified concepts such as God, Humans, Big Bang and All Life are intended to represent more complex composable insights and have been selected for their capacity to demonstrate how the epistemological topology of a community can vary despite using the same nodes. Specifically, it is the relationships between the nodes — their relative structure — that determines their framing and ultimately their meaning within a system of knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the above illustrations is to demonstrate that even with some shared understanding of a set of data points (where both ontologies acknowledge the existence of “humans”), it is the relationship of these data points to other data points that define their ontological framing.</p> Epistemic Pluralism and Peer-Based Graph Structures <p>Software can act as a bridge connecting us to — and mediating our interactions with — the physical world. It can also oversimplify and potentially degrade our experience of reality. This dichotomy underlines the importance of our mission: to design technological solutions that enrich, rather than diminish, our engagement with the world. Our aim is to ensure that these technological interventions augment our understanding of reality, maintaining its depth and complexity in a way that unlocks the rich and existing knowledge mappings that percolate in our brains, epigenetics, culture, and shared interpersonal space.&nbsp;</p><p>With the above framing in mind, we can begin to gesture towards a pluralistic knowledge graph of insights; a multiplicity of complex claims with directed links (references) to the datasets upon which the claims are based.&nbsp;</p><p>Enabling pluralism within a tool for knowledge is non-trivial. The challenge is to determine and promote synthesis and coherence across an agent-centric knowledge mapping tool.&nbsp;</p><p>The reader is encouraged to imagine a graph-builder of sorts, where participants provide insights via some medium as nodes in a graph. These publications will bear some epistemic relationship to other publications. They may be direct responses, endorsements, or rebuttals but they may also have less explicit relationships such as semantic similarity or geopolitical proximity. It is this metadata, the edges of the graph or in other words its relational structure, that represent the social relations through which we have collectively archived and evolved our various cultures for millennia.&nbsp;</p> Designing for Protocols &gt; Platforms&nbsp; <p>This blog post does not delve into the specific design or user experience (UX) of the proposed tool. Instead, our focus is to conceptualize its potential functionalities, particularly when implemented as a protocol for safely sharing data and insights across software ecosystems. We envision it as a flexible module or wrapper, designed for integration by other developers, rather than as a standalone platform. This approach considers an inter-platform collaborative model. A key aspect of this model is the 'safe answers' concept as examined in part one of this blog series, which negates the need for centralized server access to raw data. Instead, it enables communities to retain custodianship over their data, allowing external organizations to send localized algorithms to peer networks. These algorithms can then query data, with granular control over the opacity of the data being used for computation. This means that the return of the algorithm can optionally expose the raw data it is using, or provide some ‘insight’ pertaining to the data. For example, a security camera may expose to a querying party the amount of people who walked past the camera, and not the identity/profile of the individuals walking past. This method fosters a decentralized and secure approach to data analysis and sharing.&nbsp;</p> Finding Integration in Pluralism <p>While there is something just and encouraging about an ecosystem aimed at mapping the pluralistic epistemics that percolate throughout the world, there are also risks therein. What is important is that we avoid a set of disintegrated ‘knowledge’ feedback loops, echo chambers, where those embroiled in misguided or harmful informational clusters are never exposed to counter-arguments or differing schools of thought. It is important that we identify mechanisms through which to measure how coherently any given network’s graph of knowledge integrates with the other graphs in the ecosystem. To achieve this, we endeavour to draw from Integrated Information Theory (IIT).&nbsp;</p><p>IIT, initially formulated to describe consciousness, posits that a system possesses consciousness to the degree it possesses 'Phi' (Φ) — a measure of its intrinsic cause-effect power. It is a system's ability to integrate and differentiate information. Adapting this to our knowledge graph setting, we can interpret 'Phi' as a measure of the extent to which knowledge from one epistemological network is both differentiated from and integrated with another. The higher the Φ, the more integrated (and thus potentially coherent) the knowledge graph is with the broader knowledge ecosystem.</p><p>In practice, Φ along with more traditional graph analysis techniques may be used to reveal areas where connectivity can be enhanced, subsequently tuning search and discovery algorithms. This is crucial in a world increasingly fragmented by differing worldviews, as it enables us to identify points of convergence and divergence across knowledge systems. By analogizing Φ in IIT to the integration of knowledge across different epistemic frameworks, we establish a quantitative measure and orienting function to shift the knowledge network toward greater coherence.</p><p>Just as IIT posits that conscious experience arises from the integration of differentiated information within the brain, we posit that a coherent and functional knowledge ecosystem could emerge from the integration of differentiated insights across various epistemological networks. We suggest that a healthy knowledge graph, like a biological mind, is not just a repository of information, but a dynamic, integrated network capable of evolving and adapting to its environment.&nbsp;</p> Embracing the Dynamics of Knowledge Integration <p>The journey through the realms of data, insights, and knowledge graphs has elucidated the intricate and dynamic nature of knowledge itself. We believe that the concept of a pluralistic data commons, as explored in this article, is not just a theoretical framework but a necessary evolution in our approach to understanding and navigating the complex tapestry of global information. The notion of knowledge as a static, singular entity is a relic of the past. Today, we are called upon to recognize the fluidity and multiplicity of knowledge, shaped by diverse perspectives and evolving contexts.</p><p>This blog post describes praxes for knowledge mapping in a manner that aims to embrace epistemic pluralism, and resists the idea that we as a species can arrive at a positive orientation through a homogenised narrative. Rather, we believe that it is in the intersection of a diversity of narratives that we may come to a model of integrated knowledge. These praxes are important when considering the applications that may sit above the distributed storage layer we described in our first blog post. It is insufficient to merely ‘capture’ data. Data requires contextualisation and application, and it is in these later steps that the capacities and implications of the data becomes apparent. Here we must ensure that our endeavours to synthesise and unpack data are done in an inclusive and life-centric manner, and thus it is important that the communities using the distributed storage tool have the means to find the degree of integration in the knowledge artefacts derived from a given set of data.&nbsp;</p><p>The notion of measuring the integration of knowledge, borrowing from Integrated Information Theory, offers a promising path forward. It allows us to quantify and visualize the interplay of different knowledge systems, identifying points of convergence and divergence. This, in turn, can guide efforts to enhance connectivity and coherence within the global knowledge ecosystem. Such an approach recognizes that the health of our collective understanding is not just in the accumulation of data or insights, but in the integration and harmonious interplay of diverse epistemologies.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of this endeavor will depend on our collective willingness to engage with and evolve differing viewpoints, to challenge our own assumptions, and to remain open to the evolving nature of truth. The creation of these knowledge ecosystems is not just a technical endeavour but a cultural and intellectual one, requiring ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and a shared commitment to exploring the multifaceted nature of reality. As we forge ahead, let us embrace this complexity, not as a hindrance, but as a rich tapestry of human experience and wisdom, from which we can all learn and grow.</p>

 The travel and mobility industries have been anything but stationary over the last year. As we move toward 2024, let us look back at 2023 to reflect on changes and predictions that will drive these industries into the future.&nbsp; 



 



<p>Mobility and travel are industries on the move, literally. Individuals from all walks of life have an almost daily need to get from point A to point B. Our needs, our finances,&nbsp;our environments and even our <a href="https://brilliantio.com/how-does-culture-affect-travel-and-tourism/">culture dictate how we move</a> in our lives, and as times change so we must follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People are traveling more frequently than ever, the only difference is how they are traveling. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/features/mckinsey-center-for-future-mobility/our-insights/european-mobility-finance-a-25-billion-euro-growth-opportunity">McKinsey is seeing developments</a> in full-service leasing, new-car subscriptions and financing for used cars as potential core mobility-finance markets by 2030. Furthermore, micromobility will continue to grow and contribute 5% of total revenue in 2030 compared to 1% in 2023. An additional niche area which will see some growth beyond 2030 is electric vehicle charging infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As consumers are delighted about the variety of mobility trends on the horizon, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-mobility-evolves">respondents from a McKinsey survey</a> found that almost one-third plan to up their use of micromobility over the next decade and 46% have already switched to more sustainable modes of travel with an interest in shared autonomous vehicles. But whatever the mode of transport, safety is key, and the increased need for identity verification has become clear along with the desire of growing digital services.&nbsp;</p>



 Wheels of regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The travel and mobility industries have seen some exciting developments and steps forward this year, thanks largely to the increased adoption and implementation of identity verification solutions across the entire user journey. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, 2023 could also be characterized by a series of significant stops-and-starts. The most pivotal event in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility industry</a> occurred in September when, following an overwhelming vote to ban e-scooters in Paris, the French capital was cleared of the vehicles overnight. The main reason for the ban was safety concerns, following a streak of accidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This set the wheel in motion for the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">strengthening of micromobility regulation</a> in different cities around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Right now, the market can be <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/electric-kickscooters-have-come-of-age-regulators-have-taken-notice">split into four types of cities</a> ranging from unregulated, where e-scooters can be implemented without any limitation or regulation, to complete bans, where e-scooters are not allowed, such as in Paris” stated Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility and Travel Sales Director at IDnow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two regulatory archetypes, in-between no regulation and complete ban, carry certain stipulations such as an age verification process, speed limits, restricted numbers of operators and areas in which to park.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ramifications of the Paris ban are likely to be felt for the next few years as each country and city decides its stance on micromobility. Opponents to the ban argue that it was a step back for sustainable transport, and that there are benefits to embracing a clear micromobility strategy that includes faster, more convenient, eco-friendly forms of transport that can help reduce urban congestion, and offer transport options to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other changes likely to affect mobility in 2024 include ongoing digital transformation efforts, across every step of the user journey highlighting this need for progress.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Processes remain old school in car rental agencies who are now facing strong competition from fully digital car rental companies, so digitalization will play a major part in the development of the car rental space.</p>Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility and Travel Sales Director at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Consolidation will also play a role in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/mobility-report/">future of mobility</a>. “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) will become key</a>, as it will provide a new way to plan a full trip [whether bus, train, e-scooter, e-moped, bike, car or taxi] from one platform and one user experience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Traveling digital.&nbsp; 



<p>When reflecting on 2023, it didn’t come as much of a surprise to Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Travel &amp; Mobility at IDnow that, much like mobility, digitalization within the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel industry</a> played such an important role.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Covid acted as a wakeup call that there was an urgent need for digital services in the travel and mobility sectors, and that the travel industry, in general, had been very lax in dealing with these topics for decades.</p>Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Travel &amp; Mobility at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Michael explains that the major challenge facing the sector is that there is “a shortage of skilled workers and increasing customer expectations on the one hand, and low margins, rising inflation and conservative strategies on the other. Digitalization should be driven forward more rapidly, but most travel and hospitality companies still behave hesitantly and adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the digital skepticism of some travel and hospitality companies, Michael has no doubt that digitalization in every area of the tourism value chain, and user journey, will continue to be the driving force for hotels, airlines and other travel businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">Seamless travel, digital check-in processes and digital identities</a> are hot topics that will simplify travel experience in the short and long-term. It is an ongoing process and courageous companies that prioritize digital projects and implement them ASAP will be able to gain a market advantage and be more successful in the future. Plus, IDnow will be there to support them.”&nbsp;</p>

 A side of hospitality.&nbsp; 



<p>Along with mobility and travel comes their partner, hospitality. Where would travel be without hospitality to lend a hand? Due to the increase in travel, hotels and rental companies are back to business but with a few more challenges on their plate. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Many hospitality businesses have seen a surge in fraudulent attacks in recent years. Coming in a variety of different forms, the most significant include loyalty card programs which fraudsters have developed a liking for and is <a href="https://www.cybersource.com/en-us/blog/2020/loyalty-fraud-how-real-is-the-threat.html">projected to reach a market value at over $11 billion by 2025</a>, as well as the ever-present credit card fraud which the airline industry is also heavily impacted&nbsp;by&nbsp;with <a href="https://chargebacks911.com/travel-forecast-2023/">IATA totaling the loss for airlines at $1 billion a year</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraud is everywhere, no matter the industry. Unfortunately, hospitality is feeling the effects due to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-protect-owners-guests-holiday-rental-scams/">lack of protection and high turnover rate compared to other industries</a>. And it isn’t just a loss in revenue but also reputation. Luckily, thanks to identity verification, chargeback and credit card fraud can be minimized, improving security of both the hotel and the guest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/optimizing-the-online-travel-booking-experience/">from reservation</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/leveraging-digital-check-ins-hotel-operations/">check-in</a> to payment. &nbsp;</p>



 



 

 



 To the reusable future.&nbsp; 



<p>As the travel and mobility industries take stock of 2023 and look to the coming year, digitalization will play an ever-increasing role, especially through the use of reusable digital identities. While they can be applied in almost every industry, reusable digital identities are already taking off&nbsp;within the travel sector where airlines and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have already showcased their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/iata-first-integrated-journey-digital-identity/">Proof of Concept – End to End Digital Identity initiative</a> near the end of 2023 in collaboration with IDnow. With such developments arising in travel, digital identities (travel credentials, boarding passes, visas, etc.) will be stored in digital wallets, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a>, ready-to-use within seconds making the future of travel much more pleasant and stress-free. The possibilities of tomorrow are only a [digital] wallet away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contributions by: Sam Gbafa (Product Prototyping), Wayne Chang (Strategy), Parke Hunter (Content &amp; Editorial)</p><p>Picture this scenario: You're a politician running for state office. It's been a long campaign, and the polls are very close — a virtual tie. It's the night before election day when most of the ballots come in.</p><p>You get a call in the middle of the night, and it's the head of your campaign. There seems to be a fake story about you spreading like wildfire that has come out of nowhere. What's worse is that there’s also a video of you confirming and apologizing for the fake allegations spreading alongside, coming from a verified account with a name spelled in a way that looks visually identical to yours! Your campaign manager has already started damage control. You know that this will be disproven, as the allegations are obviously false. But the election is tomorrow– is there enough time? If only people could see that that apology video is fake and didn't come from your campaign. Your campaign manager asks: how should we move forward?</p><p>Enter a world with content authenticity…</p><p>In a world driven by content authenticity, there is a verifiable way to prove any content's author. In the campaign example, you would have set up a system where you registered digital credentials, including your mobile driver’s license, .gov email, and a state credential that includes your current title to create a verifiable online digital identity.&nbsp;</p><p>Every message, video, and post by the campaign has a small reference with it that can be retrieved and verified by platforms, allowing them to give you a special verification symbol with all of your content. Anyone can check this verification and pull down the original content you posted. Social media platforms would instantly make it clear that the apology video didn't come from your campaign. This fake story is still out there, but its power is diminished.</p> An Introduction to Content Authenticity <p>Throughout time, the ways in which we’ve encountered news and information in the media have shifted dramatically. With the proliferation of AI, social media platforms, and influencers, it’s become a challenge to weed out the truth from misinformation. Not being able to verify the legitimacy of content is problematic, especially when it comes to political news or government information, as portrayed in the example above.</p><p>Multiple organizations are currently working on tech approaches to solve this problem by adding a layer of trust and verification to the content we consume. This layer of trust and verification added to content is called content authenticity. At our core, SpruceID’s mission is to let users control their identity and personal data across the web in a way that facilitates trusted interactions. As a result, contributing to the future of content authenticity, powered by trusted digital identity, is important to us.</p> The Rise of Digital Content, Platforms and Publishers <p>From relying on a few major news providers to the rise of citizen “journalism” on social media platforms—the internet has made it easier than ever for anyone to have a global reach. With this new power, it becomes more challenging for information consumers to differentiate what is real from what is fake.</p><p>To combat this, platforms have traditionally used verification of notable figures. Tools like the Twitter Blue Checkmark or the Verified Badge on Instagram give users a clear way to know who to trust. However, there have proven to be issues with this approach, including platform risk (as seen with Twitter’s recent changes to verification), bias and discrimination (such as a political campaign being unable to make verifiable statements due to their political opinion), and legitimization of harmful entities if someone can game the verification system to post with authority. These platforms also have the power to allow verified posts to look different and appear more frequently. By modifying their platform, they can increase or decrease trust in “verified” content with their audience.</p><p>Currently, these platforms have to design and build their own verification systems, and they are not interoperable with one another. There isn’t a clear way to say that the identity of “The New York Times” on Facebook is the same as that on Twitter (besides the recognition of that entity’s name). These platforms have, in part, understood their responsibility to inform people of what can and cannot be trusted. They have done so with different approaches, including <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/about/introduction?ref=blog.spruceid.com">community notes</a> on Twitter and fact-checking on Facebook.</p> Approaching Solutions&nbsp; <p>Today, we’ve begun to see political figures address the danger of deepfakes and the need for a solution to AI-generated content. On October 30th, 2023, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_JLkU5xF2Y&amp;t=3s&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">President Joe Biden spoke out</a> about signing an executive order on artificial intelligence, which is the first of its kind for the U.S. Government. He stated:</p><p>“With AI, fraudsters can take a 3-second recording of your voice can generate an impersonation good enough to fool you; it’s mindblowing…I said, ‘when the hell did I say that?’”</p><p>With an open <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">executive order</a> calling for technology to solve this problem of verifying who is saying what, this currently remains a pressing issue. We believe that one way to approach this issue is by introducing a way to verify who posted what content by tying said content to the poster’s verifiable identity using digital credentials.</p> SpruceID Proof of Concept <p>In order to demonstrate a potential solution for content authenticity, we created a proof-of-concept using our SpruceKit open-source libraries. We recently presented this proof-of-concept in Washington D.C. at <a href="https://dcfintechweek.org/agenda-2023-2/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">D.C. Fintech Week</a> to show what a solution could hypothetically look like. Here, we’ll break down the technology in our proof-of-concept and describe how these tools can be used to verify content and build trust across all platforms.</p> Key SpruceKit Components for Content Authenticity <p>This proof of concept uses the following technologies we’ve developed as part of SpruceKit, our open-source libraries. We will reference these tools in our walkthrough below:</p><p>SpruceID Libraries used in this demo:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rebase</a> is a tool that allows you to run a credential issuer. Rebase lets you run a witness that can programmatically examine multiple proofs from someone requesting a credential, verify those proofs, and then issue a credential.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Kepler</a> is a data storage system where you permission who has access to this data with your Ethereum keys. You sign in with your Ethereum keys, and that signature permits the app you are using to access and store data.</p><p>Other technologies used:</p><p><a href="https://attest.sh/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Attestation Service</a> is an infrastructure for making attestations on or off of a blockchain about anything. We use it as a place to make attestations.</p><p><a href="https://base.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Base</a> is the blockchain we are using for this demo. It allows for low-cost attestations (100s of attestations per dollar). Someone must pay this fee for a transaction to be posted as a public blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://web3.storage/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">web3.storage</a> are tools we use to store and retrieve data verifiably. IPFS summarizes the file into a Content ID, which can then be used to retrieve that file. It does this in a way so that it’s verifiable that the file you upload is the file you retrieve. We use web3.storage as an easy way to interact with the IPFS network.</p> Content Authenticity in Action <p>In this walkthrough, we’ll break down how to both create and verify Content Authenticity claims in order to make a statement or claim and then “stamp” that claim (with a high assurance credential such as a mobile driver’s license or a .gov email) so that your audience can be confident that it was you who made it.</p> 1) Account Setup and Adding Credentials <p>When you land on the Content Authenticity page, you can either create a Content Authenticity claim or verify one. First, let’s create a claim.</p> <p>To create a Content Authenticity claim, you will first need to sign in. We use Sign-in with Ethereum to connect to Kepler in order to store and retrieve data associated with our account. This data includes the credentials we have and any files we have uploaded.</p> <p>If this is your first time interacting with your account, you’ll need to create a data vault with Kepler (our data storage system). This second signature request creates a place where your data is stored.</p> <p>If you have no credentials, you can easily create them. Our Rebase issuer powers the process of creating credentials. To create a credential, select “issue first credential,” and you’ll be taken to the following page.</p> <p>From here, we'll choose the Email credential.</p> <p>In the process of adding a credential, you prove two things: </p><p>1) you are in control of the keys you want to associate with the email </p><p>2) You control the email you want to associate with the keys. </p><p>If both of these are verified by the witness, then it will issue you a credential. Going through the steps here proves these things to the witness. In step 1, you say what email you’ll be using. Step 2 prompts you to sign a message with the email and Ethereum public key in it. This message and signature are cryptographically verifiable, and the witness checks that. Lastly, you are sent an email with a unique challenge to the email provided. If you have control of this email account, you can respond to the challenge correctly. Providing this proves access to the email. Once proven, the witness will issue you a credential that says your email is the same as your Ethereum public key. This credential is an important pillar in our content authenticity solution, as it anchors the cryptographic signer to other identities.</p> <p>Once they are added, any credentials you have, such as your Twitter handle, email address, etc. will be displayed under the Credential section below.</p><p>In this example, the issuer is the Spruce Rebase Demo Witness, but there can be many other credential issuers, including your organization, your government, or a club you are a part of. These credential issuers may have other requirements besides the simple proofs to issue an email credential. Our demo trusts credentials issued by the Spruce Rebase Demo Witness, but ultimately, a user may have different trust models, such as trusting an issuing key that belongs to the New York Times or the California DMV.</p> 2) Upload Your Content <p>Upload a file to IPFS and get its content identifier to accompany your claim. This identifier is both a cryptographic hash of the content and a way to retrieve the content from the IPFS network. Anything uploaded is public and irreversible.</p> <p>Select the file, and then you can make claims about that content.</p>  3) Make a Claim About Your Content <p>Once you have your credentials and have uploaded the content you want to make a claim about, you can use this tool to make those claims!</p> <p>First, select the credentials you want to use in order to make a claim. I’ll select my GitHub and email accounts.</p> <p>Then, you select the file you want to make a claim about.</p> <p>This flow supports <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Content Credentials</a>, an effort by the <a href="https://c2pa.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</a> to develop technical standards for certifying media content's source and history (or provenance). Some <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/leica-launches-worlds-first-camera-with-content-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">hardware</a> and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/content-credentials.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">software</a> support content credentials, which prove the source and modifications to an image. You can export those and add them as part of this optional step. Depending on the use case, having that cryptographic verification of where an image came from is just as necessary as who is posting it.</p> <p>The uploader can add additional claims you want to make regarding the image. This example demonstrates making a claim about the SpruceID logo.</p> <p>Review and submit the transaction to the blockchain. This page lets you preview the data and submit it to the blockchain. You can go back and fix any errors. Once it’s submitted, it can never be undone. It will be public and permanent.</p><p></p> 4) Verifying a Claim <p>You'll be sent to the verification page once a content authenticity claim has been posted. This page is the public page that others see when examining this content. </p> <p>This page verifies the data and includes cryptographic checks about the credentials, the issuer of those credentials, and the identity of the poster of the claim to ensure they all add up. It also retrieves and displays the content so you can see the content about which a claim was made.</p> Watch a Demo <p>This demo walks you through the same steps above to recap how one would create and verify content authenticity claims.</p> What’s next for Content Authenticity? <p>From the increasing need for solving content trust and verification to our hypothetical example of how this problem could be addressed today, it’s difficult to say exactly how the world will tackle this complex problem. SpruceID has the knowledge and expertise to help tie provable high-assurance identity attributes (such as a mobile driver’s license) into content that is put out to the public in order to elevate the level of trust in the person or entity making the statement. Empowering users to control their identity and personal data across the web is woven into our DNA. We’re excited to share this proof-of-concept to help shape a future with trusted identity and interactions online.</p> <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/digital-identity-now-and-future/digital-identity-today?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More about Digital Identity</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p></p><p></p>

 Change announcements 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in November 2023, we <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">announced</a> the auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies to automatically protect tenants based on risk signals, licensing, and usage. This is to remind you that Microsoft will begin automatically protecting customers with Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies. These are policies that Microsoft creates and enables in customer tenants. The following policies will be rolled out to all eligible tenants:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Policy&nbsp;</p>


<p>Who it’s for&nbsp;</p>


<p>What it does&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for admin portals&nbsp;</p>


<p>All customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers privileged admin roles and requires multifactor authentication when an admin signs into a Microsoft admin portal.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users&nbsp;</p>


<p>Existing per-user multifactor authentication customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy applies to users with per-user multifactor authentication and requires multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It helps organizations transition to Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for high-risk sign-ins&nbsp;</p>


<p>Microsoft Entra ID Premium Plan 2 customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers all users and requires multifactor authentication and reauthentication during high-risk sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll begin a gradual rollout of these policies to all eligible tenants and notify in advance. Once the policies are visible in your tenant, you’ll have 90 days to review and customize or disable them before we turn them on. For those 90 days, the policies will be in report-only mode, which means Conditional Access will log the policy results without enforcing them. For more information refer to the blog, “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.”  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update on Azure AD Graph Retirement&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June of 2023, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> that described the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will be done with incremental steps. We’re committed to supporting our customers through this retirement and migration to Microsoft Graph, and we’re committed to increased transparency and communication as we work through this change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Retirement: Stage One &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first stage of Azure AD Graph retirement will begin later in 2024. We’ll share a specific date in a subsequent update, with a minimum of three months of advance notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we enter this first stage, applications that are created after a specific date will encounter an error for requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net/">https://graph.windows.net</a>). We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph at this point, and we’ll provide an optional configuration to allow applications created after this point to resume use of Azure AD Graph APIs for an extended period. If you develop or distribute software that requires applications to be created as part of the installation or setup, and these applications will need to access Azure AD Graph APIs, you must begin planning to avoid interruption. This optional configuration can be set on an application after it is created, and the configuration change will be done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll provide more detailed guidance on the timeline for this plan and on configuring the optional configuration in our next update.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I find Applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs? &nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re working to deliver a new experience to help our customers identify applications in their tenant that are using Azure AD Graph APIs. This will be enabled through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-use-recommendations">Microsoft Entra Recommendations</a> experience. We’re expecting to enable this experience in the first months of 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to audit logs behavior for custom security attributes&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning in October 2023, changes were made to custom security attribute audit logs for general availability that might impact your daily operations. If you’ve been using custom security attribute audit logs during the preview, here are the actions you must take before February 2024 to ensure your audit log operations aren't disrupted:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Use new audit logs location.&nbsp; 
 Assign Attribute Log roles to view audit logs. &nbsp; 
 Create new diagnostic settings to export audit logs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changing sign-in audience for new applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will change the default value of 'signInAudience' property in app registration from 'AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount' to 'AzureADMyOrg'. Our analysis shows that most new applications do not ever support users outside the application tenant. This will improve latency and security of apps. For more information on application sign-in audience, refer to the documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0#signinaudience-values">application resource type - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling app instance lock by default&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will have “App instance lock” enabled by default. The capability called App instance lock for workload identities was launched in September 2023. This feature allows app developers to protect their multi-tenant apps from attackers tampering with critical properties. Applications created using Entra ID portal already have the setting enabled by default, and going forward, it will be enabled for other app creation surface areas such as MS Graph, PowerShell, and SDKs. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-configure-app-instance-property-locks">How to configure app instance property lock in your applications | Microsoft Learn</a>.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Account is replacing legacy profile page&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-new-feature-and-change-announcements/ba-p/3796396">announced</a> the legacy profile page will be replaced with a new, modernized experience. This is a reminder that My Account (<a href="https://www.myaccount.microsoft.com/">https://www.myaccount.microsoft.com</a>) will replace the existing Profile page (<a href="https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/profile">https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/profile</a>) by January 2024. My Account enables customers to manage account details, language and privacy settings, security information, and more. My Account has been around for several years and has all the functionality of the legacy profile page. This deprecation is moving customers to a better and more modern experience. No actions are required by the customers, as customers will be automatically directed to the new My Account experience. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, we talked about <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">the risks that come with granting OAuth tokens without restraint</a> across your organization and mentioned two ways to manage this process:</p>
 
 You can periodically check your Google admin console to see what permissions are authorized and manually revoke access where needed.&nbsp; 
 Or you can also easily track this information with YeshID.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of access to your Google Workspace, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions granted to third-party applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And today, we’re making it even easier to gather those insights and take immediate action with new data visualization capabilities in YeshID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s explore how data visualization can play a pivotal role in mitigating risks like data exposure and unintentional oversharing of permissions. We’ll introduce you to our new visualization tool along the way.&nbsp;</p>
 Our risk representation of OAuth scopes&nbsp; 
<p>Humans are really good at pattern recognition, and seeing things drawn or color-coded can help us quickly grasp a concept. In this case, we can use data visualization to provide a granular representation of OAuth scopes (the permissions granted to applications), breaking them down into easily digestible components and allowing you to pinpoint areas of high risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This clarity enables informed decision-making when it comes to understanding exposure from connected applications and adjusting permissions to align with organizational security policies. YeshID’s data visualization breaks OAuth scopes into a digestible color-coded graph so you can easily pinpoint areas of risk. We use <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/sensitive-scope-verification">Google’s sensitive/restricted scope classification system</a> to categorize granted scopes on a green, yellow, red basis. Find an anomaly? We also make it easy to revoke or block access.</p>
 Not just a pretty picture 
<p>Once you have an idea of what looks suspicious, YeshID makes it easy to act with options to revoke, block, or manage applications.</p>
 
 Revoking a third-party application’s access essentially invalidates the access that your users have granted to an application. However, this is temporary and your user could grant permissions again. We allow you to mark it as ‘Forbidden,’ and we will highlight it if access has been regranted. 
 Blocking an OAuth token goes a step further by preventing the associated application from requesting access to the user’s Google Workspace data altogether — a cumbersome process <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en">when done through the Admin Console</a>. 
 
<p>Here it is in action.</p>
<p></p>
 Try YeshID now 
<p>Data visualization within YeshID transforms the complexity of app access management into a visual narrative that’s easier to grasp at a glance. By harnessing the power of visualizations, you can navigate the challenges of OAuth tokens, enhance security measures, and foster a culture of awareness and responsibility among users. <a href="https://yeshid.com/visualization/">Learn more</a>.</p>

 How much should a predictoor stake, to maximize revenue and bound&nbsp;risk?  Abstract <p>This article is for predictoors — people running prediction bots in <a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> ecosystem.</p><p>If you stake more, you can earn more, but only to a point. Earnings are bounded by sales of the feeds. So if you stake too much, you will lose&nbsp;$.</p><p>This article provide equations that bound how much to stake, along with general&nbsp;tips.</p> 1. Introduction <p>Ocean Predictoor offers data feeds predicting the price movements of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap during the next 5 and 60 minute intervals. Data scientists can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">run a predictoor bot</a> that submits forecasts for these tokens to Predictoor contracts, and earn&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Rewards are financed by sales of the feeds. These are (i) organic purchases by traders and others, (ii) purchases from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor Data Farming</a> OCEAN side, and (iii) rewards from Predictoor DF ROSE side, which are pro-rata to the other&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Rewards are affected&nbsp;by:</p>  Amount of sales. Sales↑ means rewards↑.  Prediction accuracy. Accuracy↑ means rewards↑.  Amount of stake. Stake↑ means potential for more reward, bounded by prediction feed sales; more on this&nbsp;later.  <p>Given all these factors, much should a predictoor stake, to maximize revenue and bound risk? The article provides some answers to that question.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an equation for payout as a function of such factors. Section 3 has formulae for upper-bound stake amounts; the models have assumptions but are helpful in practice. Section 4 provides general tips. Section 5 concludes.</p> 2. Payout&nbsp;Equation <p>For a given predictoor’s prediction: if the prediction is wrong, stake is slashed, i.e. they lose the stake. If the prediction is correct, they receive a&nbsp;payout.</p><p>Under a correct prediction, payout&nbsp;is:</p><p>The initial terms specify that the rewards are distributed only among those who predicted correctly. In order to maximize rewards, participants must not only be accurate in their predictions but also stake an amount reflecting their confidence in these predictions.</p><p>If all participants stake the same amount, rewards are equally divided among those who predicted correctly. However, if a participant makes a correct prediction but stakes less than others, their reward is smaller. Conversely, placing a high stake on an incorrect prediction results in the loss of the entire&nbsp;stake.</p> 3. How Much To&nbsp;Stake? <p>Given these factors, it’s crucial to carefully decide how much to stake. To better understand this, let’s examine some scenarios from simple to&nbsp;complex.</p> 3.1 How Much to Stake: Single Predictoor Scenario <p>The objective is to determine the appropriate amount to&nbsp;stak.</p><p>Let’s start by assuming there is only one predictoor in the system&nbsp;. Therefore we can ignore factors related to other predictoors’ stakes. We only have to consider reward amount and accuracy.</p><p>Let’s assume that their classifier’s accuracy is 50%, i.e. random, making correct predictions half of the&nbsp;time.</p><p>Then, expected payout E[Payout] is:</p><p>And, expected return E[R]&nbsp;is:</p> 3.1 How Much to Stake: Multiple Predictoors Scenario <p>Assume now that other predictoors enter the game. The main modification to the equations is that the % of total rewards for a particular predictor with arbitrary accuracy Acc, is weighted by the amount of&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Then, expected payout&nbsp;is:</p><p>This assumes that amount staked by all the predictoors does not change with time, and the rewards remain constant across time as well. (Making such an assumption makes modeling more tractable, yet still&nbsp;useful.)</p><p>To further simplify the model, we can assume that each of the n predictoors stakes the same amount sₚ.&nbsp;Then:</p><p>The return is&nbsp;then:</p><p>From the equation above, we see that returns are positive as long as the numerator is greater than&nbsp;sₚ:</p><p>Given a particular value of accuracy Acc, under the conditions presented (all predictoors stake the same amount, stakes and rewards are constant) we obtain the following relationship.</p><p>Stake Bounding&nbsp;Formula:</p><p>This suggests that for a specific level of accuracy, the amount staked should not exceed the figures on the right side of the equation to ensure a positive return, according to the assumptions made.</p> 4. Stake Amount Guidelines <p>Here are some general guidelines on how much to&nbsp;stake.</p>  The lower-bound sales for a given week are the Data Farming Rewards in OCEAN and in ROSE, on the order of 37500 OCEAN and 100000 ROSE. You can use this for r_f in the formulae.  Higher accuracy levels lessen the likelihood of negative&nbsp;returns.  When determining the stake amount, consider the stakes of other users. The system allocates rewards based not only on accuracy but also on the stake amount. Hence, in each epoch, users who predict correctly and have a larger stake will receive a larger share of the&nbsp;rewards.  Start with very small stakes, where you definitely aren’t bounded by sales. Get a feel for how everything works end-to-end, and how the variables above relate in practice. Only when you feel more confident should you&nbsp;increase  <p>Finally — hopefully to state the obvious — it’s unwise to stake all your OCEAN into a single prediction even if your model’s accuracy is extremely high. Because if you’re wrong then you lose it all! All the models above assume that amount staked is significantly lower than this. However there is a way to bound this amount too, such that you never risk it all yet maximize profit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>For anyone <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/how-can-you-protect-your-gpt/500642">paying attention</a> to the OpenAI DevDay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk">announcements</a> a few weeks ago, Gizmodo’s recent article “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/security-vulnerabilities-openai-chatgpt-custom-gpt-1851057912">Be Careful What You Tell OpenAI’s GPTs</a>” shouldn’t come as news. (To refresh everyone’s memory, “GPTs” were announced as OpenAI’s platform for building custom agents that can be shared as apps with other users.) It was clear from the demos and presentations that the GPT Store will expose to the public your prompts, the “Knowledge” files you upload, the APIs used for “Actions,” and any metadata your GPT employs. YouTube videos like <a href="https://youtu.be/gEf0BPkqQSM">this one</a> even demonstrate in detail how shockingly easy it is to acquire this information with a few simple hacks.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious security concerns, it also invalidates any commercial value promised by the GPT Store because there can essentially be no proprietary intellectual property—the GPT Store will simply become one giant copy machine.</p>
<p>But then, maybe we don’t need the GPT Store to be so much an innovation center as a relationship store (as in “storage” in this case). This is something I proposed at our recent cyberevolution conference in my presentation, “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5437/3">Thanks to AI, the Future of Security is Collaborative</a>.” It’s a concept that bears repeating in this context.</p>
 The App Store was Never Actually About You, Anyway 
<p>Apple is lauded profusely for its human-centric design. But I posit that it merely seems user-friendly—it’s actually a developer-centric design with enough glitz to retain the attention of us normals. As Exhibit A, I offer the home screen of the iPhone. Let’s say you want to send your friend Sam a message; the first problem you’re confronted with is which messaging app to use. In your mind, you have to work through a matrix, which looks something like this:</p>



App
When to use
Why use it now?


Apple Messages
Blue contacts (aka “not green”)
Easy access and group chats


WhatsApp
International
I’m traveling


Facebook Messenger
Friends &amp; family
Reacting to a post


Signal
Privacy
News about his firing—needs to be on the DL


WeChat
China &amp; stickers
I want to send a cute sticker!


Snapchat
Generational
Probably won’t use


Line
AsiaPac &amp; stickers
Want to use a sticker that’s not on WeChat


Slack
Work &amp; workgroups
Group conversation about GPT security


Google Chat&nbsp;
Work &amp; play
We use Google Workspace sometimes


Discord
Gamers
We’re playing a game


Instagram
React to images
I’m a promoter


Skype
General purpose
If nothing else seems appropriate at the time



<p>Table 1: A rubric for deciding which messaging app to use right now (e-mail apps excluded)</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, I prompted Stability.ai’s DreamStudio to generate a phone with only messaging apps on the home screen (no need to reverse-engineer the prompt, I provide it for you). The “message” of the image is of course to satirize the consternation this screen evokes in the human who faces so many nuanced options simply to message a friend. I think DreamStudio got this one exactly right because the text under the weird icons isn’t even intelligible 😀.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, who actually benefits from the App Store approach? It’s clearly not the user. Unsurprisingly, App stores are for the sellers and the apps represent a relationship between you and the developer. If you want to chat with a friend, you’ll first need to figure out which of your developer friends you want to broker that message.</p>
 Not Apps, not GPTs—GPme 
<p>I got an e-mail from OpenAI on December 1st, reiterating the company’s desire to empower “builders” with more tools and announcing the launch of the GPT store “early next year.” (Note: e-mail seems a rather old-fashioned way to communicate information about GPTs; but it’s ubiquitous, so I guess that’s the kind of calculation they made in the marketing department.) In case you didn’t get the message, here it is:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Short and to the point—not even any mention of Sam Altman. Perfect. But the e-mail reinforces the point that OpenAI is courting “builders” (erstwhile developers) rather than the natural inhabitants of AI space: personas.</p>
<p>Whether the economic incentives of OpenAI will prove sustainable for builders remains to be seen; but the platform can already support persona-to-persona relationships on the internet. Let me explain.</p>
<p>In my cyberevolution presentation, I introduced a new species, one that lives natively on the internet: Homo ex machina. I asked ChatGPT for a definition and got a surprisingly well-thought-out response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Homo ex machina" is a Latin phrase that could be translated into English as "Man from the machine." This phrase seems to be a play on the term "deus ex machina," which means "god from the machine" and refers to a plot device where a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected intervention. "Homo ex machina" could imply a human being emerging from or created by a machine, possibly referring to the concept of artificial intelligence or cybernetic organisms in a philosophical or literary context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my view, GPTs shouldn’t be viewed as a kitchen appliance like Talkie Toaster or a sentient being like I, Robot, which are separate from natural persons; rather, they should make natural persons more like an internet-native version of Iron Man. DALL-E seemed to get it right away—on the first prompt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DALL-E prompt: A human with a superhero suit on that bestows god-like powers</p>
<p>A GPme (working title) is a personal power up that combines your humanity with superpowers. Your apparent intelligence will be near genius level; your knowledge will be encyclopedic; your linguistic skills will extend to fluency in dozens of languages; your creativity will be unbounded. You may even become a decent driver.</p>
 How GPme Storage would Foster Trustful Relationships 
<p>What we really want those icons on our home screens to represent is the totality of our relationships—our relationships to other people, other GPme’s, groups, businesses, governments, and even our enemies. Behind each of those social emoticons lies an avatar representing our personal interests in that relationship. The GPme would retain all the history, all the promises, all the aspirations as well as an accounting of the contributions made and the current status of the relationship. In this way, relationships will become more symmetrical, fair, and trustful.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A GPme for All Seasons</p>
 GPme’s also change the game for decentralized identity 
<p>For the decentralized identity crowd out there (including all the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> folks), take notice: by using GPTs (or similar agents such as Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio">CoPilots</a>) as a relationship aggregator rather than an app store, we have the beginnings of a new type of decentralized identity. It’s not a wallet, it’s not a self-sovereign identity (SSI), and it’s not a decentralized identifier (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>). Instead, we have a (for lack of digital term) fully fleshed out GPT relationship store, which provides a way for individuals to maintain the totality of their relationships with the assistance of powerful AIs. And beyond providing mere channels for connectivity (as messaging apps do), these GPT relationships could function as a trust base.</p>
<p>This in turn would form a network of decentralized trust anchors consisting of persona-to-persona relationships. In this context, the identity data and metadata wouldn’t need to be directly tied to the natural persons who own or operate these personas, enhancing privacy tremendously.</p>
<p>Returning to SSI, ledgers have an important role to play in GPT relationship stores. Whereas apps are at risk from information exposure, revealing information about your GPT relationships turns out to be very helpful from a trust perspective. In fact, information about your GPT relationships should be public, and verifiable, like on a ledger. This approach enables reputation and cost signaling, which are proven to foster interparty trust (see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-future-of-security-is-collaborative-cre23">my cyberevolution slides</a> for references as well as my recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti">Advisory Note</a> on distributed identity).</p>
<p>In summary, using swarms of GPme’s, natural persons can empower GPT actors to both protect them in a hostile, foreboding internet while engaging in meaningful and productive relationships.</p>

 We interview experts from the world of financial services, crypto and gambling to discover some of the year’s major regulatory and technological surprises, and the trends awaiting the identity verification sector in 2024. 



 



<p>We click, we scroll, we awkwardly stare at the camera, and we do that ‘press, but don’t actually press, just lightly rest it upon the side button thing’ every single day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we approach 2024, it’s no exaggeration to say we spend most of our lives online; personally, and professionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, we’re probably not too many years away from our digital selves becoming more trusted and, in a way, able to do more than our soft, fleshy human forms. Able to register, transact and be recognized quicker and more effectively online than in person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every industry has gone digital. Fact. It’s not even a controversial and outlandishly sci-fi statement to make anymore. We buy, we sell, we save, we transact, we subscribe and gamble – all online, often without physically interacting with another person, whether in person or online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if we’re spending more time online, then it’s important to be able to prove our identity – that we are who we say we are, and that the people we’re interacting with are who they claim to be. This is where industry regulations, rules and established processes like identity verification data and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> come into play. Laws ensure online users behave in a legally binding and appropriate way.</p>



 Accountability vs anonymity. 



<p>But, what about an internet user’s right to remain anonymous and even more importantly, their right to privacy? &nbsp;</p>



<p>The desire for anonymity may not necessarily be rooted in the wish to engage in illegal activities away from prying eyes, but more as a genuine concern for how their personal identifiable information and other important data could be hacked and tracked or even used for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How to balance accountability with anonymity has been a conundrum since the internet was first invented and is a recurring bone of contention whenever new regulation or frameworks are created. The ongoing, fractious exchanges on the details of the proposed Electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS 2.0) have been testament to that. More on that later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite tech titans’ claims to the contrary, there is no simple one-size fits all answer to the question of how to offer both anonymity and privacy. If there was, organizations would never be fined for internal failings like AML and KYC deficiencies; users would never fall victim to fraud; and the internet would be a wonderland, free from financial crime, scams and hate speech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A potential answer lies in the balancing act between the needs of the corporation and the needs of the consumer, in the open and ongoing dialogue between regulatory decisionmakers and industry insiders for the common purpose of a secure and attractive marketplace, and in the clever deployment of technology that can optimize processes while ensuring a superior digital customer experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this blog, we speak to our Spotlight Interview alumni, as well as IDnow’s own experts to discover the sector developments that have surprised them in 2023, and what trends they predict will have the most impact in 2024.</p>

<p></p>
 
 



 Is that the real you, or is that just your identity? 



<p>The global digital identity solution market is projected to grow from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/digital-identity-solutions-market-247527694.html">$34.5 billion in 2023</a> to a staggering $83.2 billion by 2028. The main reasons for the growth are the increasing usage of online services (across an ever-expanding range of sectors and use cases); the introduction of more cost-effective AI/ML-powered services; and the rise in SME adoption of identity management solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of 2024. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are simply staggering.</p>



 Is traditional banking dead? 



<p>Unsurprisingly, considering how important identity checks are in heavily regulated industries like financial services, the banking sector performed the lion’s share of identity verification checks in 2023 (37 billion), which is more than half of the global identification market. The days of visiting branches to verify your identity to open a bank account, or make a transaction payment are nearing the end, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb3f99a2-bd4c-4ba1-8cb9-432ecfbf73ab">closures of approximately one in eight bank branches</a> in the UK in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>In 2023, we’ve seen a lot of interest in FinTechs, including neobanks. The digital-only trend has certainly not gone unnoticed by traditional banks, which are now looking into what technologies and what partners can do to help them improve aspects such as user experience.&nbsp;</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and FinTech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>The use of technology to optimize operational efficiencies, enhance customer experience and ultimately reduce fraud has become pivotal, regardless of the sector, but especially in financial services. Financial services are often at the forefront of technological innovation and leading the charge toward safer and more secure environments for transacting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Little wonder then that the global growth in volume of identity verification checks has been <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">driven largely by banks adopting stronger biometric identity</a> verification methods in a bid to combat fraud, in particular account takeover and card-not-present fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It will come as no surprise that financial services continue to be the industry most exposed to fraudsters,” said Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow. “Fraudsters and the technology at their disposal are becoming increasingly more sophisticated.”</p>



 The never-ending cat and mouse game of fraud prevention. 



<p>The amount of money lost to fraud is staggering. In the UK alone, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">approximately £3 billion is lost every single year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, Lovro said that there were three things that surprised him:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“First was the rapid rise of social engineering, from phone calls to SMS, emails, phishing, everything has increased. The second surprise for me is that physical document fraud has almost completely disappeared – it’s not zero, but it’s a very steep curve down. Unfortunately, the quality of fraudulent documents has improved dramatically, with hologram production at such a high level now that they’re more difficult to detect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third development that surprised Lovro in 2023 was how innovative many fraudsters have become regarding the use of synthetic fraud, synthetic identities and deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I thought it would take another few years before we got to this stage. Up until very recently, synthetic fraud was very rudimentary, but it is getting much better and more sophisticated.</p>Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>As identity verification methods like liveness checks are known to prevent spoofing and other types of fraud, organizations that have not been using biometric verification methods in 2023 should be doing so in 2024 to protect their business, their customers, and their reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the use of the latest forms of identity verification technology can certainly help organizations learn more about their customers, and thereby prevent fraud in the process, there are certain types of social engineering fraud, like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> that take advantage of human emotional frailty, so are harder to safeguard against.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ex-police officer and self-professed fraud nerd, Paul Stratton agrees that the increase in social engineering is a worrying trend that will unfortunately continue into 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Romance and ‘repeat victimization’ fraud (e.g.: a romance fraud victim is steered into investment fraud) will continue to prosper. Breaking the cycle of manipulation and coercion is almost impossible when that person believes it is all legitimate… This is when banks and financial institutions must step in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/"> Jinisha Bhatt, AML and crypto fraud investigator</a>, who also dedicates a lot of her time researching and helping to prevent human trafficking, it’s also important to factor in the link between social engineering fraud, and human trafficking violations.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Today, highly organized scam compounds run rampant in countries like Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar and force ‘workers’ to groom, manipulate and defraud victims of romance and investment scams worldwide.</p>Jinisha Bhatt, AML and crypto fraud investigator.</blockquote>



<p>“The larger the pool of financial fraud victims, the higher the demand for scam factory workers. This is a machine that continues to feed itself at an insurmountable cost to human beings on each end of the cycle. While we focus our efforts on preventing pig butchering scams, we must also continue to enhance international cooperation among law enforcement and strengthen measures to impose human rights-related sanctions against entities and individuals who profit from this crime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever the reason banks or any organization chooses to overhaul their customer onboarding process and internal controls, an identity verification platform that can address the aforementioned three driving forces: optimize operational efficiencies, enhance customer experience, reduce fraud – will further accelerate the mass adoption of digital identity verification services.</p>



<p>As consumers become more wary about sharing their PII data due to privacy concerns or the risk of data breaches and the rise of identity theft, synthetic identity fraud or account takeover there is a need for organizations to switch their focus from frictionless user journeys to optimized user journeys with ‘good friction’ that not only deters fraudsters but also increases consumer confidence and trust in the organizations onboarding process. It is a balance between convenience and security for consumer confidence that needs to be carefully managed.</p>



 Play time’s over: The year that crypto was forced to grow up. 



<p>As a sector that by its very existence questions the limitations of established systems and structures, it is understandable that many crypto firms experiment with new ways of doing business, with some even making the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">risky decision to forgo traditional KYC checks</a> altogether. While 2023 proved an important and somewhat stabilizing year for the evolution of the industry, with both the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulatory framework</a>,( MiCA) and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed regulatory regime,</a> taking significant steps toward completion, it was also a somewhat unsettled year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think what surprised me most about 2023 was the sheer level of turbulence. In fact, there is still ongoing litigation with many major crypto names. Reassuringly however, this hasn’t halted innovation, which is what crypto is all about. We saw the likes of Worldcoin launch, which is a new take on identity and proof of personhood, so it’s these kinds of developments that show that crypto is making significant strides in the right direction,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d153b0-0c28-4946-acbe-2e93329bca52">convict the founder of FTX of money laundering</a> and fraud sent shockwaves through the industry and should act as a warning shot that the upstart industry of crypto needs to play by the established rules of financial services, especially regarding Anti-Money Laundering directives, and KYC processes. Is play time over for crypto? If not, then the days of transacting in complete anonymity, without restrictions, and of celebrities promoting unregulated platforms, certainly are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the digital identity verification industry, and to an extent, the wider technological community is sure to admire the innovative steps taken by crypto to think outside the box in 2023, regulatory bodies are losing patience. And with 2024 likely to be the year that the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer of Funds Regulation</a>,&nbsp; MiCA, and the UK’s equivalent will be implemented, that patience is sure to be tested more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some argue that existing and upcoming crypto requirements are too harsh, prohibitively so, especially the UK’s financial promotions regime for crypto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of crypto firms currently perceive <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-promotions-uk-crypto/">financial promotions</a> as a massive burden and barrier of entry to the UK market. I hope the restrictions are softened somewhat in 2024, otherwise what we may find is a reduction in number of crypto firms in the UK market, which may, in turn push crypto users to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/">either grey market platforms or to offshore operators</a>, which would surely put a dent in the UK’s plans to become an international crypto hub,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, though, Jason remains optimistic about the state of crypto in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re on the cusp of new individuals and new flows entering the crypto space, which will be a very beneficial development and hopefully lead to a more positive crypto environment in 2024. Also, in March of next year, we will see the bitcoin halving, which is an exciting time for the crypto market, because the rate of supply of newly mined bitcoin is halved.”</p>



 



 

 



 



 Regulatory reflection: Betting on an online future. 



<p>Creating regulatory frameworks that not only protect the consumer, but also provide an attractive environment for operators is essentially the role of regulation, and regulatory bodies from around the world have certainly been busy this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the above crypto frameworks to the reassessment of existing gambling regulations in as disparate markets as the UK and Curaçao, 2023 has reminded every industry, especially gambling, of the importance, and opportunity of regularly updated regulation. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“One of the major surprises in the gambling industry for 2023 was that Brazil is now firmly on track to regulate both sports betting and online casinos, it’s the right thing to do because regulating the full portfolio of products will be critical to the success of the Brazilian market, including the ability of the authorities to clamp down on the grey market of operators that choose not to apply for a license,” said Martin Lycka, SVP American Regulatory Affairs and Responsible Gambling at Entain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Elsewhere in LatAm, Peru and Chile have been exploring regulation in 2023, and I do think that North American markets and regulators will also be keeping a close eye on proceedings too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our own gambling expert, Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk agreed with Martin regarding the sunny outlook for the LatAm online gambling market and expressed his pleasant surprise at the pace of gambling regulation in Brazil.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, Roger did admit that not all surprises were of the positive variety.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>One of the major surprises for me was learning of the increasing numbers of German players that were migrating to the grey market, due in part to the high tax rates subjected to regulated platforms, and other player restrictions.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Director of Global Gambling at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Such restrictions include 5 second spin durations, €1 stake limit, and €1000 max deposit per month across all licensed operators. In a bid to cut costs, operators who are compliant and licensed in Germany may decide to either pull out of the market, reduce their sponsorship budget (which will negatively impact grassroots sports), or focus on other markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a lose-lose, and not a great situation for the German economy, but I remain positive that German regulators will take the time to assess the situation and perhaps reevaluate its tax strategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roger also believes that while the UK market is doing the right thing by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">running a series of consultations</a> on revisions to its online gambling regulation, like proposed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">financial risk checks</a>, he did worry about the impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, much like the player exodus in Germany, I fear that 2024 may see UK players start to gravitate to the grey market unless upcoming regulatory changes are attractive to both the market and players.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can regulation ever have a negative impact upon a market’s growth? For Martin, it’s a delicate balancing act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It might be stating the obvious, but if regulations are introduced and it’s required to be implemented, then it’s for good reason in the long run and is money worth spent. But there is a fine line to tread between overly onerous regulation that may not be adding any value, and regulation that is efficient.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the gambling industry can teach us anything, it’s that the pace at which the digital world moves means the need for agile, and regularly updated frameworks and guidelines is paramount to ensure industry players operate in a fair and transparent environment.</p>

 Balancing act: The role of regulation. 



<p>Whatever the industry, there is perhaps no regulation or requirement as important in the digital identification space as KYC. This is why KYC, in some form or another, is mandatory in most industries, including financial services, crypto, gambling, among others. Despite its origins dating way back to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpis-F6rGCAxX8X0EAHTPAAoQQFnoECBAQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dowjones.com%2Fprofessional%2Frisk%2Fglossary%2Fknow-your-customer%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DKYC%2520regulations%2520originated%2520from%2520years%2Cand%25202008%2520global%2520financial%2520crisis.&amp;usg=AOvVaw2o_D_jE3NQ3Ig7i62H2uso&amp;opi=89978449">1970, with the passing of the Bank Secrecy Act</a>, KYC regulations and requirements are regularly updated, with most notable and significant revisions occurring following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 2008 global financial crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Changes to the KYC process can also occur whenever changes to associated regulations like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jinisha has been pleasantly surprised by some of this year’s developments regarding AML and is eagerly awaiting the domino effect of clearer and more consistent legislation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“After hundreds of iterations to AML regimes and endless conversations on beneficial ownership registries, it seems that the global financial crime sector is ready to mobilize support for effective ‘transparency’. As per <a href="https://transparencycanada.ca/news/billc42updatesnovember2-2023">Transparency International</a>, 132 countries have made commitments to beneficial ownership registries. Many G7 and G20 countries have adopted the ‘Open Ownership’s Beneficial Ownership Data Standard’ to ensure their national registries are interoperable with the rest of the world’s. These standards will eventually help us uncover connections between opaque shell corporations, sanctions evaders, and PEPs across the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the concept of AML and KYC has remained the same over the years, the importance and how they are used has changed dramatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Banks are beginning to understand that KYC checks can be seamlessly integrated into the client onboarding process, eliminating the need for customers to feel burdened by them,” said Vivek Mishra, Operations Manager at WNS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital identification solutions are also increasingly being used to enable customers to authenticate their identity online without submitting any physical proof. The focus on the customer experience is a good thing, since it indicates that banks are beginning to prioritize their clients at last. Additionally, it implies that KYC checks are getting more successful and efficient, which is excellent news for banks and their clients,” said Vivek.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increasingly multi-purpose use of KYC, the current and second iteration of eIDAS, and national AML laws are just three regulations and requirements that have greatly improved safeguards in digital transactions for regulated market sectors in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rayissa Armata, Director of Global&nbsp;Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow, said that although many positive steps were taken this year, she stressed the importance of careful route-planning and ongoing collaboration with relevant stakeholders to ensure that the European Union gets important regulation like eIDAS 2.0 right.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>There is still more that needs to be done and the challenge is to support an aligned framework that remains reliable, innovative and secure. IDnow fully supports the call for building a more harmonized framework that addresses interoperability, innovation, and most importantly – security.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director of Global&nbsp;Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Rayissa added that future frameworks should therefore factor in the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Identification that can be reused across borders and sectors (public and private)<br>  Establishing standards for developments in technology with appropriate levels of security<br>  Continued collaboration between the public and private sectors&nbsp;  



<p>For Viky Manaila, President of Cloud Signature Consortium, the next few years will prove crucial for the global digital identity landscape.</p>



<p>“eIDAS 2.0 regulation and its evolution during the trilogue surprised everybody in the identity ecosystem, with positive and less positive amendments. As it comes close to the final destination, the next period will be critical for defining the implementing acts, the standards in support of the new services and certification scheme with cross-border interoperability in mind.”</p>

 2023: The year when digital identity became must-have. 



<p>This year’s growth in popularity of identity verification solutions can partly be attributed to the adoption of additional new use cases, for example in facilitating remote recruitment. In fact, 2023 could be categorized as the year that organizations began to unlock, or at least peek through the peephole into the future of how digital identity verification could potentially be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some EU states have made significant developments in their own digital identity systems, such as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/ukraines-digital-identity-app-growing-and-becoming-an-inspiration-for-other-countries">Ukraine’s digital identity app, Diia,</a> which is used for storing biometric passports, tax IDs and driver licenses, to access private and public services, others are taking a much more considered approach to modernizing their identity landscape. For example, the UK has <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">introduced the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> – a set of rules and standards for identity verification service providers to follow in order to offer certain use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although each country will naturally have its own idea of how it wants its citizens to use their digital identities, the future success of digital identity and the digital wallet will invariably be linked to its interoperability, across sectors (public and private), and across regions. For that to happen, however, a standard and generally agreed-upon course forward needs to be set, which of course requires intensive discussions from all interested parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) published a technical report analysing selective disclosure and zero knowledge proofs for the EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sebastian Elfors, Senior Architect at IDnow, who co-authored the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/119476/01.01.01_60/tr_119476v010101p.pdf">ETSI paper</a>, said: “The report has received tremendous interest from the industry, with constructive feedback from the self-sovereign identity community and experts in W3C, GSMA, and several other standardization organizations. The EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) and ETSI and CEN remain on standby to provide the relevant standards and certification schemes for the EUDI Wallet and Qualified Trust Service Providers under eIDAS 2.0.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remaining cautiously optimistic on the future of digital identity, Viky said: “The new commercial models for services around identity proofing, and verifiable credentials on top of the Wallets have the potential to unleash the missing part of digital transformation. If these services are customer-centric designed, they will take off. Otherwise, they will become just another type of digital platform asking for all sorts of personal information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although 2023 has seen the ongoing development of pivotal regulations like eIDAS 2.0, alongside the introduction of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/world-coin-crypto-iris/">new ways of identifying customers, such as iris scans</a>, the pace of development in the digital identity space hasn’t suited everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m surprised by how many times I still have to enter passwords given that Apple, Google and Microsoft are all implementing the passkeys standard. Only yesterday it took me three guesses to remember my telco password and I had to do a password reset on one of my American bank accounts. Please make it stop!</p>David Birch, global advisor and thought leader in financial services.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>However, David did admit that the upcoming ISO mobile driving licence, which both Google and Apple have added to their wallets is sure to accelerate adoption and put Wallets fairly and squarely in the public discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumers will rapidly become comfortable with this mode of presenting standardized credentials in both face to face and remote environments,” added David.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although it’s difficult to predict the future of digital identity verification with any kind of certainty, it is highly likely that it will continue to be used for ever-increasing and multi-purpose use cases, and that any changes that do occur will be precipitated by a combination of technological advancement, regulatory input, fraud trends, and, of course, consumer preference.</p>



 Risks vs rewards: AI and the modern workplace.&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a reason why <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67271252">Collins Dictionary named AI</a> the word of the year in 2023. Artificial intelligence was on the lips of every organization (and unfortunately every fraudster) this year, and with good reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The potential of generative AI, in particular, has many organizations salivating over their budget sheets due to AI’s ability to automate, augment and accelerate working processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a safe bet, therefore, that industries will continue to experiment with AI-powered processes in 2024. In fact, many industries are already reaping the benefits of AI to increase automation, reduce costs and offer more accurate and streamlined identity verification methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vivek certainly recognizes the value in doing so: “I anticipate that as banks and other financial institutions strive to increase their efficiency and security in 2024, AI-powered KYC and banking solutions will become even more widely adopted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s important to not delegate all tasks to AI. Yes, AI and technology in general, can be used as a competitive advantage, but success in 2024 and beyond will almost certainly come from the clever combination of humans and technology, and recognizing the relative merits of both. In identity verification, this may mean AI is reserved for simpler data-scouring tasks, freeing up resources and enabling staff to concentrate on more difficult jobs, like performing manual identity verification checks on high assurance use cases, or delivering more personalized, superior customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, AI has also been weaponized by fraudsters. While in the past, cybercriminals needed a certain base level of technical skills to produce fake documents or websites, AI-augmented fraudsters can utilize generative AI to create authentic-looking documents, videos, images and audio. A trend that will continue in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I expect to see an increase in the use of AI for fraudulent purposes, which makes the innovative use of AI to combat it, and fingerprint scanning and biometric analysis all the more important, alongside human input,” added Lovro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is your organization prepared for the future?</p>



 Inclusivity and accessibility: Making the connected world a safer, fairer place. 



<p>As our digital identities become more established and entrenched in regulations and legal frameworks, it’s important to remember the importance of collaboration on the common goal of making a safer, more secure online world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, IDnow made significant strides toward making the connected world a safer place, becoming the only European identity verification provider to be awarded two certifications for the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/pvid-certification-idcheck-io-and-videoident/">French remote identity verification standard known as PVID</a> (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) at ‘substantial’ level. We also became certified by the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/diatf-certified-framework-identity-verirification-provider/">UK’s Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework.</a> </p>



<p>IDnow prides itself as being at the very forefront of innovation in identity verification, and believes that believes that with a layered, holistic approach to identity, businesses can elevate trust and empower experience across the customer journey – no matter the region, industry, or required regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Research and Developments teams have been hard at work throughout 2023; contributing on projects as far ranging as a toolkit to identify and mitigate biases in AI algorithms to the verification of optical variable device (holograms). Our Product team has also been working tirelessly to update, improve and optimize our digital identity verification services, making them the most complete IDV solutions on the market. Such updates include IDnow’s&nbsp;360 Signals, which detects attempts of repeat fraud, by collecting risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources to detect single and serial fraud attempts in real time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have some exciting upcoming developments, including paper photocopy detection, automatic bank account ownership verification and plans to implement WCAG Level AA to ensure our services can be used by people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inclusiveness and accessibility will continue to be an important topic in 2024 and beyond, and <a href="https://www.bundesfachstelle-barrierefreiheit.de/DE/Fachwissen/Produkte-und-Dienstleistungen/Barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz/barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz_node.html">organizations will soon be legally required</a> to provide a certain level of accessabilty in their solutions or face legal reprecusssions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many factors that lead to inequality in identity verification. Age, disability, neurodiversity, lack of docs for proof or identity or lack of photo are all problems that identity verification providers must improve to provide access to digital services for all. Bridging these gaps requires inclusive design, technological adaptations, and policies addressing diverse accessibility needs, to ensure equitable digital service access for all. IDnow’s video verification enables organizations to improve inclusivity, accessibility, safety, and convenience for all their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have valued and trusted relationships with various international police and counter fraud organizations, including INTERPOL, and the French Scientific Police (the forensics arm of the police) with whom we exchange knowledge and share best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is these relationships and these industry insights that allow us to move quickly and keep abreast of industry trends and developments to offer a comprehensive&nbsp;multi-jurisdictionally compliant identity verification solution. For example, in preparation for the opening of the Brazilian online gambling market, we integrated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/automated-cpf-database-checks-brazilian-gambling/">CPF database checks</a>. Our market-leading identity verification services enable our clients from a variety of sectors to benefit from our proprietary fraud prevention technology and regulatory expertise to provide peace of mind that wherever they operate, and in whatever industry, they can do so compliantly.</p>



 



 

 



 



 The sky is the limit? 



<p>Another major milestone for IDnow in 2023 included the launch of ShopIdent in gas stations throughout Germany. The on-site identification solution enables customers to activate pre-paid SIM cards, open bank accounts, or verify driver’s licenses directly from their local gas station.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, perhaps the most exciting project that we were involved with in 2023 was assisting the International Air Transport Association (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/iata-first-integrated-journey-digital-identity/">IATA) in creating the first ever integrated digital identity travel experience</a>, streamlining the process from flight shopping to arrival. In the Proof-of-Concept trial, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a> was used to store and present digital travel credentials, such as boarding passes and digital visas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We look forward to 2024 with optimism and excitement for what the future holds. While the future of digital identity verification may be uncertain, one thing’s for sure, the sky is no longer the limit.</p>

<p>I am very excited to announce that 1Kosmos is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/integrating-amazon-cognito-with-1kosmos-blockid-for-enhanced-security-and-user-experience/">official AWS Cognito Passwordless MFA partner.</a></p>
<p>Amazon Cognito places the utmost importance on online account security. To bolster the protection of account holders, starting in 2024, Amazon Cognito made it a goal to expand its multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements, ultimately partnering with 1Kosmos to help the Amazon Cognito team reach its customer security initiatives.</p>
 A Better MFA 
<p>It’s no secret that MFA significantly augments the security of web and mobile applications by necessitating additional identification methods beyond just a password. By implementing various forms of MFA organizations can effectively mitigate the risks associated with user account takeovers, phishing attacks, and password breaches.</p>
<p>To take things a step further, users can elevate their account security through biometric authentication features like TouchID (fingerprint), FaceID and LiveID (a 1Kosmos architectural advantage). Additionally, it offers one-time passwords (OTP) through SMS and email, time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) via a linked mobile authenticator, and push notifications. This flexibility empowers Amazon customers to select the MFA methods that best align with the requirements of their application ecosystem.</p>
 User Experience is Important 
<p>The team at Amazon Cognito places delivering a seamless user experience high on its list of requirements, and that is why partnering with 1Kosmos was a perfect fit. The 1Kosmos MFA capabilities provide a diverse array of authentication choices to accommodate a broad spectrum of users and devices, all with a similar user experience. The 1Kosmos BlockID and Amazon Cognito partnership strikes the right balance between security and usability when developing customer-facing applications.</p>
 Easy Access to Passwordless 
<p>1Kosmos is a trusted AWS Partner and AWS Marketplace Seller offering BlockID and passwordless MFA solutions to elevate online account security. The platform boasts FIDO2 and NIST 800-63-3 certifications, further affirming its reliability. Amazon Cognito customers can easily deploy and directly acquire BlockID through the AWS Marketplace, enabling the implementation of a phishing-resistant passwordless MFA solution.</p>
 Identity Verification 
<p>An optional capability of the 1Kosmos platform, 1Kosmos BlockID provides organizations an automated and cryptographically secure way to verify a virtually unlimited array of identity details including government issued ID, education qualifications, healthcare data, financial account details, and other third-party machine-readable personal information while respecting an individual’s privacy. This provides progressively higher levels of identity assurance for authentication and digitally transforms a broad range of business processes such as worker or contractor onboarding, new customer account origination, and provisioning of digital services.</p>
 Combination of Verification and Authentication 
<p>This capability of the BlockID cloud service has been meticulously crafted to combat identity impersonation, thwart account takeovers, and prevent fraudulent activities, all while offering a user-friendly and frictionless login experience.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID leverages identity-based verification to transparently authenticate users, effectively shielding against account compromises and fraudulent activities. The result of implementing BlockID identity verification with the integration of Amazon Cognito enables organizations to have a higher level of assurance for the users they have under management.</p>
 Privacy by Design 
<p>The 1Kosmos decentralized private blockchain technology empowers individuals with exclusive access and full control over their personally identifiable information, ensuring a privacy-centric design. This approach allows end users to review and authorize or decline the sharing of their data with online services they want to utilize. All personally identifiable information (PII) undergoes end-to-end encryption, guaranteeing that it remains shielded from exposure. Users can directly grant or deny sharing requests to the applications they connect with, without any involvement of third-party intermediaries, such as external public key servers or messaging hosts, ensuring that their data, keys, and plain text messages remain inaccessible to these entities.</p>

<p>Effective collaboration is essential for organizations to innovate, make decisions, and drive progress. Over the past few decades, digital technologies have dramatically expanded how we are able to collaborate remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>The introduction of tools like email, instant messaging, wikis, and video conferencing enabled new ways for distributed teams to communicate and work together.</p><p>More recently, all-in-one SaaS collaboration suites from vendors like Slack, Microsoft, and Google have been widely adopted by companies looking to centralize their key business applications.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as remote and hybrid work environments become more prevalent, teams are finding that centralized legacy models for digital collaboration have limitations. This is driving the exploration of distributed and decentralized frameworks that offer greater <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/walkaway-or-why-forking-matters/">control, transparency, and flexibility</a>.</p> The Rise of Centralized Collaboration Suites <p>In the early 2000s, the rise of software as a service (SaaS) paved the way for full-fledged collaboration suites delivered through the cloud. Vendors like Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce began providing bundled productivity and communication applications all under one platform.</p><p>According to Ian Tien, CEO of Mattermost, “When I started, I was at Microsoft, right? And collaboration was easy. It was all through the intranet on a centralized server.”&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last decade, this market has continued rapidly expanding. Tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Workspace have become essential platforms that consolidate messaging, video meetings, file sharing, knowledge management, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>While early digital tools enabled discrete modes of teamwork, these centralized suites aim to be comprehensive one-stop shops.&nbsp;</p><p>In the interview, Tien notes that customers are looking to “integrate [tools] with all your different infrastructure, your compliance, and your tools.” For many organizations, adopting an integrated SaaS platform became the obvious path forward as remote and hybrid work began accelerating.</p><p>However, concerns and limitations around relying solely on centralized providers have started to emerge.</p> The Emergence of Distributed Collaboration <p>While centralized systems have become popular, some organizations are exploring alternative distributed frameworks for collaboration. According to Ian Tien, CEO of Mattermost, "The biggest one is, and I'm sure you see it all over the place is this: How do I take these new sorts of LLM AI models and use them to accelerate my work?"&nbsp;</p><p>Tien also states that "the core of it is that when you take the information, let's say, and just like your workplace communications, right, it's not that valuable."&nbsp;</p><p>However, he notes that aggregated data from collaboration tools can provide insights companies may want to keep private. Holochain and other distributed projects aim to give users more <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/what-is-digital-identity/">autonomy and control</a> over their information.</p><p>LLMs combined with generative AI harness enormous amounts of data. While the systems can’t understand data like a human can, they can still create generalizations based on the extremely large datasets.&nbsp;</p><p>If Slack were to implement an LLM model with generative AI, it’s unclear whether your data would be used in conjunction with other company’s data.&nbsp;</p><p>With distributed models, validation happens at the app level between users rather than via centralized consensus. This enables customized security policies tailored to specific collaboration use cases.</p><p>As remote and hybrid work expand, teams want the flexibility to collaborate effectively while maintaining autonomy over their systems and data. Distributed models provide an alternative approach with transparent peer-to-peer connections.</p> What the Future Holds <p>While centralized suites solved many early collaboration challenges, new needs are emerging around flexibility, transparency, and control. Ian Tien summarizes this well:</p><blockquote>"The future of digital collaboration will require increased transparency around data provenance and usage. How can we enable explainability around why systems make certain determinations? What audit trails exist to show the origins and lineage of data used for collaboration?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>“Users want more clarity not just on what algorithms decide but the underlying data and logic driving those decisions. As collaboration platforms leverage more AI and machine learning, robustly documenting data provenance will only grow in importance. Companies want to ensure they can control and account for how data gets managed in collaborative processes."</blockquote><p>Distributed collaboration frameworks like Holochain offer an alternative paradigm with direct peer-to-peer connections instead of intermediary servers. This agent-centric approach gives users autonomy while still enabling effective teamwork across organizations.</p><p>There are still challenges to making distributed collaboration <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/becoming-viable-seeds-to-saplings/">seamless and scalable</a> for the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>But with the right blend of usability, security, and customizable control, these emergent technologies could empower teams with a new generation of tools for digital teamwork. The ideal future likely incorporates both centralized and decentralized elements across hybrid technology stacks.</p>

				  Indicio Proven™&nbsp; now provides a privacy-preserving way to record, share, and verify educational achievements.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, Dec 5, 2023, <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading world’s leading provider of digital trust solutions, today announced the addition of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-badges/">Open Badges</a> 3.0 digital credential format to Indicio Proven™, Indicio’s flagship product for creating and communicating verifiable data.</p>
<p>Open Badges is a powerful digital format for recording educational achievements, skills, and other accomplishments. Increasingly popular as a standard, Open Badges are shared on social media and stored and managed on third-party platforms.</p>
<p>The addition of Open Badges into Indicio Proven, the leading software for enterprise adoption of verifiable credentials, makes it possible for the badge to be directly held and controlled by the person who earned the achievement in a wallet on their mobile device instead of being forced to access their records through a third-party provider or platform.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven makes holding, sharing, and verifying an Open Badges credential truly portable. Now, anyone using the same open-source issuing software can create an Open Badges credential, anyone with the app can receive and share an Open Badges credential, and anyone with the verification software can verify the source and the integrity of the data in the Open Badges credential.</p>
<p>By removing the need for a centralized Open Badges Platform, users have control over their privacy, they can consent to share Open Badge data in secure, privacy-preserving ways, and they — and not the platform — fully own their Open Badges credentials. Indicio will be the first to use the new Open Badge verifiable credentials, issuing them&nbsp; to those who complete training and workshops in the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-academy/">Indicio Academy</a> training and workshops.</p>
<p>“Combining the Open Badges format with a verifiable credential releases its full power,” said Heather Dahl, CEO and co-founder of Indicio. “Similar to the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">Digital Travel Credential we developed on ICAO standards</a>, we’re creating simple ways for our customers to build seamless processes with verifiable data. The Open Badges format is a great way to share and verify detailed academic records and information about skill sets. But now we’ve freed Open Badges to be even greater — to take advantage of interoperable, open-source technology,&nbsp; to be used in faster, more private, and more secure ways, and, of course, to be a record of achievement that can be owned and verified forever.”</p>
<p>Technical details</p>
<p>Indicio’s unique approach combines open-source verifiable credentials based on the W3C Verifiable Credential Data and 1EdTech Open Badges 3.0 (OBv3) standards with open source technologies from Hyperledger Foundation. This enables people to hold the records of their educational achievements in a digital wallet under their own control in perpetuity. These JSON-LD based credentials can be used to easily share verifiable information on social media, when applying to a job online, or with any verifier using open source verifiable credential technology to read the badge.</p>
<p>Open Badges can be issued using Indicio Proven for a wide range of participatory, educational, and learning scenarios and can be verified by ACA-Py and AFJ based agents. Badge types include:</p>

<p>As another year draws to a close, it’s time to start thinking about what trends and challenges may face us in 2024. Next year promises to be a pivotal moment in the evolution of identity management and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). As we grapple with the challenges posed by sophisticated phishing attacks, deepfakes, and the ever-expanding influence of AI, the need for innovative solutions has never been more critical. This blog post explores the emerging trends that will shape the identity landscape, from identity inclusion and access movements to the intersection of AI and security.</p>
<p>Inclusion and Access: Bridging the Digital Divide</p>
<p>The fusion of our physical and digital lives requires a fundamental shift in how we approach identity. As we move toward a future where digital identity underpins social and economic mobility, the importance of inclusivity cannot be overstated. In 2024, there will be a heightened focus on ensuring secure and convenient identity verification, both online and in-person.</p>
<p>Regulatory Surge in the Cyber Risk Landscape</p>
<p>With the Biden administration’s landmark Executive Order setting new standards for AI safety and security, 2024 is poised to see a regulatory surge. Chief information security officers (CISOs) will need to prepare for continued AI regulation, new post-quantum guidance, and anticipated legislation around Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines. As guidance from governments increases, businesses must adapt their cybersecurity strategies to navigate a patchwork of regulations and ensure the security of customer data.</p>
<p>AI-Powered Phishing and the Banking Dilemma</p>
<p>The age-old threat of phishing takes on a new dimension in 2024 as AI-enabled phishing becomes more sophisticated and widespread. The financial industry faces a dual challenge with AI. While AI presents opportunities to enhance customer experience and reduce costs, it also intensifies the arms race with hackers. The scalability and effectiveness of AI-driven attacks means that financial institutions must continuously innovate their security and risk management strategies to ensure continued security to their most important assets: PII data and monetary instruments.</p>
<p>Post-Quantum Cryptography: A Looming Challenge</p>
<p>While post-quantum cryptography may not be a top priority for many CISOs today, its existential threat cannot be ignored. In 2024, businesses, especially in the banking sector, must upgrade their cryptography to post-quantum standards. The long data retention mandates in banking make it imperative to prepare for “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” quantum attacks (in which encrypted data that is stolen now could then be accessed once a suitably powerful quantum computer is available), even if quantum computers are not yet a reality. Failure to do so could have repercussions for decades to come.</p>
<p>Open Banking and the Cybersecurity Wild West</p>
<p>Open banking regulation is set to accelerate in the U.S., posing challenges and opportunities for financial institutions. While consumers seek convenience, banks must navigate the potential threat to direct customer relationships. The cybersecurity landscape will undergo growing pains as open APIs introduce new access points and players. Collaboration with regulators and fintechs, combined with advancements in identity verification, is crucial to ensuring the privacy and transparency of financial ecosystems.</p>
<p>Simplifying Tech Complexity for Enhanced Security</p>
<p>Banks face a growing challenge in managing the complexity of their tech stacks, particularly in the realm of identity verification. Fragmentation increases the risk of attacks, making it essential for institutions to consolidate vendors and streamline their ecosystems. Vendor consolidation not only adds an extra layer of protection against bad actors but also facilitates a more seamless experience for consumers.</p>
<p>Biometrics: Striking the Balance Between Security and Convenience</p>
<p>Advancements in biometrics offer a transformative solution to balancing security and convenience in the digital realm. Banks will increasingly use biometric technology, smartphones, and document recognition to enhance security measures. By adopting innovative solutions, institutions can create a system that deters fraud without frustrating users, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>As we embark on the journey through 2024, the intersection of identity, AI, and cybersecurity will define the technological landscape. From changes in how we view identity to the regulatory surge in AI and the ongoing challenges of phishing and post-quantum cryptography, businesses and individuals alike must stay vigilant and adapt to these transformative trends. It’s a year of innovation, adaptation, and collaboration as we navigate the complexities of the digital age.</p>

			<p>Product Focus</p>
 Introducing Multi-Party Approval for On-chain Agreements 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in November of 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Welcome to the November edition of the Product Newsletter, where we highlight the product team’s latest upgrades each month.</p>
<p>This month we are discussing the implementation of the multi-party approval feature, an enhancement of the already existing Conditional Transfer Feature.</p>
 We Upgraded The Conditional Transfer Feature 
<p>In our ongoing efforts to streamline and secure the movement of tokenized securities, we recognized a crucial need for our clients:&nbsp;a system that requires approvals from multiple parties before a transfer can proceed.</p>
<p>Our previous&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/security-tokens-conditional-transfer/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8COCRyIXJFk84a0AvtQsPi2B4w9GRwb6NUlUQ5AlZWZTu4ZrU5yaThZsOrBbLwo_YWYfAZ">conditional transfer feature</a>&nbsp;only allows issuers or agents to have one&nbsp;single-party approval. By adding the&nbsp;multi-party approval&nbsp;feature we create a flexible transfer approval process, catering to the diverse needs of our clients.</p>
 The Multi-Party Approval Transfer 
<p>Multi-party approval transfer elevates the transfer validation process by requiring multiple approvals.&nbsp;Issuers gain the flexibility to&nbsp;create custom approval workflows, tailoring the process to fit their specific transactional needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, as&nbsp;multi-party approvals are set up at the smart contract level, approvers have the freedom to choose their preferred wallet solution in order to approve or disapprove transactions, be it multisig wallets, self-hosted wallets, or hard drive wallets.</p>
<p>It’s designed to provide a&nbsp;unified, on-chain agreement signing process, which further streamlines operations, ensuring transparent and immutable recording of approvals on the blockchain. This feature aims to not only&nbsp;streamline the complex token transfer process&nbsp;but also&nbsp;enhance counterparty interactions&nbsp;in asset management.</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 How it Works: 
 
 Setting Up:&nbsp;Issuers, their agent, or equivalent set the rules for each multi-party approval transfer, including who needs to approve it and in any specified order.<br>
Types of approvers:<p></p>
 
 
 
 Recipient of the transfer 
 Custodians of the seller and the buyer 
 Any other approver the issuer or compliance agent wants to appoint 
 
 
 
 
 Initiating Transfer:&nbsp;When an investor requests a transfer, it’s held in a ‘pending’ state, awaiting approvals. 
 Multi-party Review:&nbsp;Issuers and appointed parties review and&nbsp;approve or disapprove&nbsp;the request. 
 Completion:&nbsp;Once all approvals are in place, the transfer is automatically executed, ensuring both security and efficiency. 
 
<p>Please contact us if you are interested in learning more or trying out this feature.</p>

   Background&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many customers face challenges in managing their Conditional Access (CA) policies. Over time, they accumulate more and more policies that are created ad-hoc to solve specific business scenarios, resulting in a loss of overview and increased troubleshooting efforts. Microsoft has provided <a href="https://aka.ms/ca-zt">guidance</a> on how to structure your Conditional Access policies in a way that follows the Zero Trust principles, using a persona-based approach.&nbsp;The guidance includes a set of Conditional Access policies that can serve as a starting point. These CA policies can be automated from a CI/CD pipeline using various tools. One such tool is Microsoft365DSC, an open-source tool developed by members of the Microsoft Graph Product Group, who are still actively involved in its maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft365DSC can automate the configuration of various Microsoft 365 workloads, including Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access policies. The diagram below illustrates the role of Microsoft365DSC as a tool for automating Microsoft 365, complementing the automation of Azure that’s typically achieved using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and/or Bicep templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has already been documented how you can use Microsoft365DSC to automate and maintain your Conditional Access policies. Two such sources are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/get-started/integrating-with-azure-devops/">Integrating with Azure DevOps</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/ConditionalAccessGovernanceAndPrinciplesforZeroTrust%20October%202023.pdf">Github Conditional Access for Zero Trust Resources</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These solutions work, but they need to either use a self-hosted agent with a managed identity in Azure DevOps or use a shared secret, and neither of the two solutions are optimal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim at being able to do the automation from Azure DevOps using a Microsoft-managed agent for the CI/CD pipeline and no shared secrets. The introduction of Workload Identity Federation with Azure DevOps can help us do exactly that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting Started&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution we’re aiming at is depicted in the figure below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea is to have our CI/CD pipeline files hosted in the Azure DevOps repository and make values in an Azure Key Vault available in the pipeline based on configuring Workload Identity Federation between the Azure DevOps project and Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps to do this are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Configure a service connection the Azure DevOps project settings as shown below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recommended choice can be selected; however, it would automatically create a service principal in Entra ID with permission to the whole Azure subscription that you specify in the settings. To adhere to the principle of least privileged, we suggest using the manual configuration, which means that you manually create the service principal and only assign it permission to the Key Vault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create an Entra ID App Registration using Federated credentials as shown below:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Add application permissions to the service principal for it to be able to create and update Conditional Access policies. Permissions may include: Policy.Read.All, Policy. ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess, Application,Read.All.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Create a Key Vault in a distinct resource group in an Azure subscription. This subscription should be specifically designed to manage sensitive identity-related workloads. Ideally, it should be located under the “Platform” management group within the “Identity” subscription, provided are adhering to the Enterprise Scale landing zone architecture as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/">documented here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Create two certificates in the Key Vault, one certificate that will be used to sign Microsoft365 configurations and one that will be used to authenticate Microsoft365DSC tools to Entra ID. See below.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. In the Key Vault access control, assign M365DSCWorkloadIdentity the “Key Vault Secret User” role for it to be able to read secrets that you create.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you should have the basic prerequisites in place for you to create or change your CI/CD pipeline to take advantage of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline definition 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest using a multi-stage pipeline defined in an YML file in your repo, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/caautomationpipeline.yml">specified in this example YML file</a>. When utilizing Microsoft365DSC, the Conditional Access policies that we aim to configure or enforce within our Entra ID tenant should be clearly defined in our repository. Also, as a prerequisite, you need to configure the groups that you refer to in the Conditional Access policies definition either manually in the portal or using automation described in the referenced GitHub resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This information should be contained within a file, which could potentially be named ‘ConfigureCAPolicy.ps1’. The content for this file can be generated through various methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Create your Conditional Access policies in the Entra ID portal and use export-m365DSCConfiguration as documented here: <a href="https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/get-started/snapshot-of-existing-tenant/">Taking a Snapshot of Existing Tenant - Microsoft365DSC - Your Cloud Configuration</a>.&nbsp; 
 Create it manually using any editor.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/ConfigureCApolicy.ps1">Here’s a sample of a Conditional Access policy</a>. You will notice that the file must define that we want to authenticate using the certificate. You can get a full list of the Conditional Access policies in Microsoft365DSC format based on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/tree/main/ConditionalAccessSamplePolicies/Microsoft365DSCCAPolicies">persona-based approach configured for Zero Trust here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Build Stage 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pipeline for building the solution is divided into two scripts. First, we import the certificates from the Key Vault into the Windows based CI/CD pipeline agent and compile a Microsoft365DSC configuration file into a MOF file that is to be pushed to our Entra ID tenant in the deploy stage. The reason for having this is two scripts is just for ease of debugging. You may choose to combine them into <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/prep.ps1">one script as shown here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/build.ps1">second script here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Deploy stage&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now have our artifacts stored in Azure DevOps and would like to deploy them to our Entra ID tenant. This is done in the deploy stage where the deploy.ps1 is called. The content if <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/deploy.ps1">deploy.ps1 is located here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Final comments&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information provided, you should now have a clear understanding of how to automate your Conditional Access policies within Entra ID and manage changes using Azure DevOps, all without the need to store shared secrets within Azure DevOps. We strongly recommend that you experiment with this process and utilize the resources mentioned in the article for more detailed information about the configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we primarily focus on implementing this process through Azure DevOps, it's important to note that GitHub Actions also supports Workload Identity Federation. This provides an alternative solution if you prefer GitHub over Azure DevOps.&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today’s interconnected digital landscape, where applications seamlessly integrate to enhance productivity, is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, information is more accessible than ever, requiring switching between apps and services, ostensibly increasing productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the importance of robust identity management cannot be overstated, and if you’re not careful you can lose track of who, what, and where you’ve authorized permissions — and with companies under 2,000 employees <a href="https://youtu.be/s149kAiuCns?t=44">averaging more than 73 SaaS app integrations in 2020</a>, it’s clearly a growing problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s crucial to recognize the potential risks associated with <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth (Open Authorization)</a> grants and how they impact your organization’s data security. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the intricacies of OAuth and shed light on the vulnerabilities that may lurk beneath the surface.</p>
 Broad OAuth access can mean identity sprawl 
<p>Many applications today build on top of each other, using the data from one to power the other. A common example is Google. Google is not one thing; it’s Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc. And for each of these services, Google has a fine-grained API that engineers can use (usually read-only or read-write) to integrate with their products. OAuth is the standard authorization technology across services and is part of what makes an “interconnected” internet experience possible. For example, YeshID Onboard leverages OAuth APIs from Google, Slack, Zoom, and other platforms <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">to streamline identity management</a> for your organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the devil is in the details when it comes to OAuth scopes, which are the permissions granted to applications. An alarming aspect is the breadth of these scopes. Some vendors offer OAuth APIs in an all-or-nothing approach, which hampers the ability to employ least-privilege access principles. This contrasts with providers like Google Workspace, known for their granular scopes, allowing for more specific permissions like manipulating mailbox settings, accessing sensitive files, and even user impersonation. However, granularity does not inherently mean restraint; vendors may still request more permissions than necessary, increasing potential risks.</p>
<p>Complicating matters, the risk of data exposure and account takeover is substantial if an OAuth-integrated application is compromised. This situation is akin to any custodian acting on our behalf; the extent of the compromise is proportional to the level of trust and access we’ve granted. So understanding the granularity and necessity of OAuth scopes is crucial in safeguarding your organization’s sensitive information. It’s imperative to assess not just what permissions are possible, but also what permissions are truly necessary for the task at hand</p>
 OAuth can introduce unintentional vulnerabilities 
<p>One of the major risks lies in users granting OAuth access without fully comprehending the implications, which can lead to unintended vulnerabilities. Consider the scenario of a vulnerability in a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism</a> that allowed unauthorized access using Google credentials. Users, in their quest for convenience, might inadvertently expose sensitive company data by granting access without due diligence.</p>
<p>The accidental use of work credentials in personal applications further exacerbates the problem. This unintentional mingling of professional and personal spheres can result in a breach of company data, underscoring the need for user education on OAuth access and permissions. Here’s an example of what you might wind up with.</p>
 Navigating OAuth security concerns 
<p>Enhancing the security of your accounts can be achieved by clearly understanding the difference between “session length” and “grant validity period.” In OAuth, permissions granted to applications often allow extended, but not indefinite, access to company data, raising potential security concerns. This issue becomes particularly critical when applications with extensive permissions retain this access for prolonged periods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mitigate risks like unauthorized access, data exposure, and account takeover, it’s essential for leaders to proactively manage and monitor these OAuth grants. Regular reviews and audits of the grant validity periods are key practices in ensuring these permissions are necessary and relevant, and in maintaining the overall security and integrity of your organization’s data. <br>
<br>
Here’s a look at the OAuth request lifecycle to illustrate the issue:</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way to do this is by <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgmail-high-risk-oauth-scopes%2Cdrive-high-risk-oauth-scopes">using your Google Workspace console</a> and navigating the following path: Security &gt; Access and Data &gt; API Controls &gt; Manage third party app access &gt; View list. There, you can view apps with access, revoke access if needed, and just get a general view of what’s going on in your app environment. Check out the video below, where I walk you through it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, you can also easily track this information with YeshID. Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of app licenses, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions across different applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.</p>
<p>As leaders in the SMB space, it’s imperative to understand the intricacies of OAuth and its potential risks. By educating users, understanding OAuth scopes, and implementing security measures, SMBs can fortify their identity management practices, ensuring a robust defense against the evolving landscape of digital threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID is your partner in this effort, showcasing the identity sprawl within your organization and aiding in the vigilant management of OAuth access.

				 <p>In the inaugural episode of the <a href="https://untrustables.io/">(un)Trustables Podcast</a>, we delve into the fascinating landscape of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity (NDI) project. This groundbreaking initiative introduces Bhutan’s “edge wallet,” a highly secure mobile wallet designed to safeguard what Bhutan refers to as ‘foundational digital identity,’ the first verified credential issued to citizens.<br><a href="https://untrustables.simplecast.com/episodes/ep001-bhutan-has-launched-a-national-digital-identity-program">Listen to the full episode</a></p>
 The Birth of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity 
<p>Our conversation with Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments, reveals the genesis of Bhutan’s NDI project. This audacious endeavour embodies the vision of Bhutan’s monarchy, aligning perfectly with the principles outlined in the SSI book by Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed. The aim is clear: to create a citizen-centric digital identity system that empowers individuals and streamlines their interactions with the government and private sector.</p>
 Building Blocks of a Bhutanese Digital Identity 
<p>Bhutan’s digital identity framework is a marvel of innovation. It includes unique identifiers, permanent and current addresses, and other critical data points that form the bedrock of citizens’ digital identities. Beyond foundational identity, the NDI opens the door to many use cases, spanning government services and commercial applications.</p>
 Empowering Bhutanese Citizens with Digital Convenience 
<p>The NDI project isn’t just about innovation; it’s about transforming the lives of Bhutanese citizens. It eliminates time-consuming journeys to government offices, saving citizens valuable time and resources. Even in remote areas, the NDI project enhances accessibility, simplifying processes with mobile solutions.</p>
 Drummond Reed’s Perspective on Bhutan’s SSI Journey 
<p>Renowned digital identity expert Drummond Reed shares his initial astonishment at the audacity of Bhutan’s plan to implement a self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution at the national level. He reflects on Bhutan’s forward-thinking approach and alignment with the SSI book’s principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did research and then we read the SSI book which Drummond and Alex wrote, and we just felt so strongly that it’s exactly the vision of His Majesty, our King. We said, why don’t we just build the book? That was kind of our starting place. Since then, we embodied the principles. We really thought about what the idea of the book is and how it should benefit people. We wanted it to be very citizen-centric. – Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments</p>
</blockquote>
 Crafting Legislation and Governance for Digital Trust 
<p>Translating the SSI book’s vision into tangible legislation was a crucial step. Jacques explains how this process, guided by Drummond Reed and informed by extensive consultation with experts, culminated in the unanimous passing of an Act in Bhutan’s parliament. This legislation ensures a citizen-centric approach to digital identity.</p>
 Building an Ecosystem for Digital Trust 
<p>Drummond underscores the importance of creating a comprehensive digital trust ecosystem involving various stakeholders. Bhutan’s NDI project serves as a blueprint for other nations seeking to embark on similar digital identity journeys, emphasizing the collaborative nature of such transformative endeavours.</p>
 Addressing Device Accessibility 
<p>Inclusivity is a priority for Bhutan’s NDI project. Jacques outlines Bhutan’s strategies to ensure device accessibility for all citizens, including a fund to provide devices to families without them. For those in remote areas without mobile coverage, a unique biometric verifiable credential bridges the digital divide, enabling access when they visit friends and family with smart devices.</p>
 Digital Horizons Unveiled 
<p>Bhutan’s NDI project is a testament to the transformative power of digital identity. It offers citizens convenience, efficiency, and accessibility while laying the foundation for a more connected and digitally empowered society.</p>
<p>As we conclude Episode 1 of the (un)Trustables Podcast, we invite you to stay tuned for future episodes where we continue to explore digital trust and transformation worldwide.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Earlier this year, Wenjing and I delved into the fascinating intersection of Digital Trust and Generative AI in an SSI Orbit podcast episode (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/digital-trust-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/">here</a>), which serves as an excellent primer on the subject for those unfamiliar with it. Since that episode, the landscape of generative AI solutions has undergone significant transformations, prompting us to record a follow-up discussion.</p>
<p>In this Part 2 episode, we were joined by Sankarshan, who co-chairs the ‘AI and Metaverse Task Force’ at the Trust over IP Foundation, alongside Wenjing. His insights added a valuable dimension to our conversation, particularly as we tackled prevalent misconceptions in the field of AI.</p>
<p>One key misconception we discussed is the belief that AI systems are purely statistical and random. We emphasized that, in reality, the world itself is inherently statistical, and AI systems are designed to mirror human decision-making processes, which are also based on statistical reasoning.</p>
<p>Another topic we explored is the common overestimation of AI’s logical reasoning capabilities and the underestimation of the constraints within AI systems. This discussion led us into the realm of AI governance. We debated the suitability of non-profit models for managing emerging technologies like AI, considering their capital-intensive nature and ongoing maturation. Examples like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/our-guide-to-openai-sam-altman-and-what-the-heck-happened-34da070b">OpenAI </a>and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-operating-costs/">Signal</a> were brought up to illustrate these points.</p>
<p>We aimed to focus part of the discussion on identifying practical solutions and low-hanging fruits for building digital trust tools. These tools are crucial for consumers to discern truth in an era increasingly dominated by generative AI-driven content. Additionally, we delved into strategies to mitigate and prevent the risks of AI abuse, especially as AI systems become more integrated with our daily lives.</p>
<p>A topic that resonated with me was the importance of provenance and authentication in AI systems, especially in content creation. We underscored the need for more robust tools to authenticate AI-generated content. However, we also acknowledged the limitations of current tools in ensuring provenance and their inability to address all security risks comprehensively.</p>
<p>Our discussion also touched upon the influence of human nature on AI development and governance. We pondered whether the current ideal-driven structures would evolve towards more traditional capitalist models, accompanied by regulation. This led to a broader conversation about the purpose of technology, which usually gets categorized as ‘a benefit to mankind’ by its creators. Yet, the complexity of implementing this ideal becomes apparent when considering who should govern these technologies and how they should be regulated.</p>
<p>This podcast episode not only sheds light on the complexities of digital trust in the age of AI but also opens up avenues for further exploration and discussion. As we move towards 2024, these conversations are more relevant than ever, guiding us towards a future where technology is both a tool for advancement and a subject of thoughtful governance.</p>
 
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Wenjing, Sankarshan and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 OpenAI Drama – Discussion about the recent OpenAI drama, including Sam Altman’s firing and rehiring, and Microsoft’s involvement. 
 AI Governance and AI Misconceptions – Why we should focus on AI governance rather than getting caught up in daily news and doom scenarios. Discussion about misconceptions in AI, specifically statistical and computational misconceptions. Exploring practical solutions for digital trust in AI. 
 Provenance and Authentication in AI – The importance of provenance in AI applications, such as robotics or content creation. Challenges in authentication and the need for stronger solutions. The applicability of these solutions across various domains. 
 Content Authenticity – Defining content authenticity and its governance. The distinction between machine-generated and human-verified content. 
 Digital Trust and Content Authenticity – Discussing digital trust in the context of AI. Separating protocols from end-user platforms. The role of content authenticity in digital trust. Examples of current approaches to content authenticity on the internet. 
 Truth and Trust Registries – Human pursuit of truth and the influence of context and consumption. The role of trust registries in providing inputs for trust decisions. The need for widespread inputs to aid in making trust decisions.

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF66 is live today, Nov 30. It concludes on Dec 7. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF66  Section 5: Challenge DF Wind-down   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has three substreams.<br>– Volume DF.

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF66 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Challenge DF Wind-Down <p>DF66 is the final round for Challenge DF.</p><p>Starting in DF67, the 1000 OCEAN/week will be redistributed equally to Volume DF and Predictoor DF.</p><p>The Active DF budget will be 37.5K / 37.5K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor DF respectively.</p><p>For more information, please read the announcement <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#d8d5">here</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $24K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Nov 23, 2023: $0.46 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.071 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.46 / OCEAN * 37,000 OCEAN = $17,020&nbsp;USD  $0.071 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,100&nbsp;USD  Total: $17,020 + $7,100 = $24,120 ≈ $24K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are four ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), Challenge DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash bad Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF63 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Challenge DF Wind-Down <p>DF66 is the final round for Challenge DF.</p><p>Starting in DF67, the 1000 OCEAN/week will be redistributed equally to Volume DF and Predictoor DF.</p><p>The Active DF budget will be 37.5K / 37.5K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor DF respectively.</p><p>For more information, please read the announcement <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#d8d5">here</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $21K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Nov 16, 2023: $0.41 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.066 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.41 / OCEAN * 37,000 OCEAN = $15,170&nbsp;USD  $0.066 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $6,600&nbsp;USD  Total: $15,170 + $6,600 = $21,770 ≈ $22K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>As part of ongoing support, we are releasing two service patches against SSO 9.2 and SSO 9.3. Found within both of these patches are several corrections against SAML authentication-related issues. The SAML authentication issue has existed for a number of years, but was uncovered with improvements to SSO cacheing performed in SSO 9.2. Specifically, the Microsoft service SignIn with SAML, has permitted non-uniqued entityIDs to exist. Our improvement to caching uncovered this potential minor configuration issue, which is fully corrected in the patches.</p>
<p>Additionally, for SSO 9.2.1, we have included the recent update of OpenLDAP 2.5.16, which includes OpenSSL v3 libraries. For any customers using LDAPS, we encourage you to install one of these latest service patchs.</p>
<p>Please find the SSO 9.2.3 and SSO 9.3.1 patches at: <a title="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/" href="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/">https://downloads.ubisecure.com/</a></p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your Identity Platform in a timely manner. Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility, security, and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.</p>

<p>Keeping up with the latest security challenges can feel like you are running a race that has endless hurdles. From rapid advancements in technology – rendering old hardware obsolete – to increasingly stringent requirements and regulations, the time and costs can quickly become enormous.</p>
<p>Many of these challenges are related to the migration of compute, storage, and backup services to cloud services. Picture this, you have moved your databases to the cloud. But are you in control of your encryption keys? Do you know who has a copy or could access a copy?</p>
<p>Today’s solutions offer your organization a choice of how to most effectively secure your encryption keys. You can select a solution that allows your organization to secure your keys in an on-premise HSM or one that allows your organization to protect your keys via a secure connection to a cloud-based HSM with an HSM-as-a-Service (HSMaaS) offering such as Entrust’s nShield-as-a-Service solution.</p>
<p>Entrust recently partnered with TechValidate to conduct a survey to understand how companies view and are implementing HSMaaS solutions.</p>
<p>From On-Premise to the Cloud</p>
<p>For years, the best practice was to use an HSM deployed on-premise. Concerns about security of software based key storage, separation of keys, and sovereignty requirements made it the only viable option. Over time, as-a-service HSM offerings appeared in the market offering lower costs, and a level of security comparable to on-premise HSMs, with more flexibility and quicker implementation.</p>
<p>The Survey Says</p>
<p>Today’s organizations are looking to save time and money. The survey showed that 57% of organizations said a key reason for considering subscribing to an HSMaaS offering is to reduce IT management costs. Further, 69% of respondents said that their organizations would realize reduced spend on physical infrastructure. The next closest benefit noted was improved efficiency with 46% of the respondents selecting that benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The focus on saving time and reducing expenses has also been a significant driver of cloud adoption. With the rise of cloud service providers, as-a-service-HSM offerings evolved even further. Leading cloud service providers offer their own unique approach to securing your encryption keys. While these offerings provide convenience and cost-effective solutions, they do not always meet internal security requirements set by some organizations adding further to the complexity involved when deciding how to store your encryption keys.</p>
<p>In addition to saving time and money, HSMaaS solutions like Entrust nShield-as-a-Service provide the same level of support for a wide range of applications. This is something that was also reflected in the survey results. Respondents indicated that once onboarded, they would leverage an HSMaaS solution for a variety of functions.</p>
<p>The top functions ranked were public key infrastructure (PKI), which was mentioned by 60% of respondents followed by key management which was selected by 57% of respondents. Data encryption/decryption and digital signatures were also mentioned by nearly half of the respondents (49%). These results reinforce the similarities in functionality between on-premise HSM and HSMaaS offerings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Important Cloud Key Management Considerations</p>
<p>Saving time and money are necessary criteria when considering implementing an HSMaaS solution. However, they are not the only considerations you should have when deciding what as-a-service HSM offering to use when storing your encryption keys. It is important to also consider:</p>
 
 Security – Make sure you understand how the HSMaaS offering works. Are you sharing the cloud-based HSM with other users or is it for your exclusive use? This is often referred to as single-tenancy vs multi-tenancy. You must ensure that you chose the right solution to match your risk profile and requirements. 
 Sovereignty of keys. Can the HSMaaS provider guarantee what country or region your keys will physically stored in? Will you be compliant with the regulations affecting your organization? 
 Integrations and the compatibility of the key management software with other vendors. Does it integrate with the other products and services used by your organization? 
 Ease of comprehensive key management for the entire organization. Does the solution give you the ability to rotate, generate, discard, and easily access information required during an audit? 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>When evaluating these considerations and HSMaaS solutions, partnering with a company that understands your holistic security and encryption needs will simplify this process. While cost is always a driving factor, ensuring you are in control of your keys is the most important. Ensuring where your keys are stored for key sovereignty requirements, the available integrations and the key management capabilities need to be carefully reviewed. The right keys need to be stored in the right places, using a solution that will protect your business and significantly enhance your organization’s security.</p>

<p>With credential stuffing attacks on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/">23andMe</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/no-okta-senior-management-not-an-errant-employee-caused-you-to-get-hacked/">Okta</a> just the latest breaches to make headlines in recent weeks, the push for biometrics-based authentication is gaining momentum for Identity and Access Management (IAM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem: Biometrics aren’t all created equal. Yes, device-based biometrics such as Touch ID, Face ID, and Windows Hello can help reduce the threat of password-based account takeover (ATO). But they can still leave IT guessing about the identity behind the device. While hardware tokens and Apple, Microsoft and Google’s decision to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/google-makes-passkeys-the-default-sign-in-method-for-all-users/">passkeys the default</a> for logins are also helpful, they really only confirm possession of a device or biometric and assume (but don’t validate) identity. Thankfully, it doesn’t have to be this way—if you have the right IAM architecture.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Device: Enabling F-Word Free Authentication&nbsp; 
<p>Whether it’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/public-schools-in-denver-colorado-hit-with-breach-fingerprint-scans-grabbed">fingerprints</a> or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/heres-the-newest-camera-hack-fraudsters-are-using-to-beat-facial-recognition">facial recognition</a>, that which is stored can be stolen or spoofed by cybercriminals to infiltrate corporate systems. Hell, even without a hack, traditional forms of biometric authentication only confirm the person accessing an account is the same person who initially enrolled to do so—but not whether that person is really who they claim to be. This matters when enrollment fraud leads to more than <a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/javelins-identity-fraud-study-highlights-the-changing-nature-of-fraud/">$3.2 billion</a> in losses annually. For me, “fraud” is an f-word that typically leads to others we could all do without. That’s where 1Kosmos comes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity-Backed Biometrics &amp; Modern IAM Architectures 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we saw the urgency of finding a way to easily and accurately verify and authenticate identity in a way that can’t be vouched for by mere password, one-time passcode, or a static (and spoofable) biometric. That’s why we set out to modernize IAM by combining strong identity verification and authentication within a unified architecture. One that offers unrivaled identity assurance behind each device used to access online services, along with a seamless account enrollment and authentication experience. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we provided an overview of this architecture and the pillars it’s built upon. In this post, let’s double-click on a core pillar: <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">biometric-based user authentication.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a> employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with 99.6% accuracy, stores them under user control, and binds them to an identity wallet and biometric with liveness detection. This gives IT the security and control they need while providing users with a seamless login experience. The benefits are threefold:&nbsp;</p>
<p>High Assurance</p>
<p>Biometrics verified through liveness testing deliver the highest digital identity assurance possible and enable fast, frictionless multi-factor authentication. When matched to a verified identity, they eliminate fraudulent identities hiding behind valid credentials.</p>
<p>User Convenience</p>
<p>Physical attributes used for biometric authentication are not vulnerable to damage and unexpected alterations. They provide quick, user-friendly authentication with or without passwords.</p>
<p>Flexible Use Cases</p>
<p>Whether the use case demands a fingerprint, voice match, a live biometric or other identifier, the 1Kosmos architecture provides affordable authenticators that adjust to varied and evolving business needs.</p>
 Building Bulletproof Biometric Authentication 
<p>We didn’t just follow the most effective approach to identity-backed biometric authentication. We defined it. 1Kosmos offers the only IAM architecture built with four crucial elements of identity-backed biometric authentication:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certification to FIDO2, NIST 800-63-3 and UKDIATF Standards</p>
<p>Our BlockID platform is certified to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO</a>, <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST</a> and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/kitcp-06-01-certificate-1kosmos/">UKDIATF</a> standards, having undergone rigorous testing to verify quality coding and ensure the use of common devices to authenticate users. When combined with a verified identity, you’re talking about unmatched security and convenience. BlockID supports USB keys, keycard authentication, fingerprint readers, and hardware tokens and provides a robust framework to implement or augment passwordless authentication without being forced into using a single provider. With identity-backed biometrics, you also benefit from stronger security using physical traits. Think fingerprint scan with a USB security key or FIDO-compliant facial recognition, for instance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>iBeta Certified Biometrics</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, biometrics can improve security by replacing or augmenting the use of passwords, but they can also be subject to theft or spoofing. iBeta is an independent, NIST-accredited biometrics testing lab that has developed certification programs to verify biometric applications to recognized standards to prevent these things from happening. When enrolling with our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID</a> solution, the user can perform an advanced form of biometrics called a liveness test that prevents false facial verification using a photo, video, mask, or other substitute for an authorized user’s face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometric Encryption</p>
<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/12/what-is-biometric-encryption/">Biometric encryption</a> leverages a biometric template and public-private key pair to encrypt and decrypt personally identifiable information for authenticating a user and sharing data with an online service. This approach relies on the uniqueness of biometrics to ensure that hackers can’t reverse-engineer a password or key. Without the biometric and matching private key, all data in the digital wallet isn’t accessible, usable, or even legible. There’s no central storage of user biometrics, ensuring these biometrics remain private. Biometric authentication is easy to use and requires little, if any, user training.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flexible Levels of Identity Assurance</p>
<p>With BlockID, you determine the type of biometric appropriate for a given application and the level of identity assurance appropriate to the business risk. For <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/customer-onboarding-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/know-your-business-compliance-guide/">Know Your Business</a> (KYB) standards, Identity Assurance Level 2 can be achieved using <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">LiveID</a> and identity verification using government-issued credentials, such as a driver’s license or passport. A liveness test confirms a user’s facial match to the enrolled biometric and verified documents in real-time.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Lesser forms of identity assurance can be achieved using information from banking, telco, or corporate databases or through “inferred” identity based on access to an email address or logged-in device, as appropriate for the intended use. For additional use cases, 1Kosmos can also verify a user’s social security number (SSN) against the SSA, a driver’s license against the American Association of Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), a passport against ICAO or the US Department of State, or verify a user is indeed a physician by validating their NPIN (National Physician Information Number).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As documentation and accounts are enrolled, the location and phone number are verified against the issuing authority. The user’s LiveID scan is then validated against the picture extracted from the documentation. Once complete, their biometrics are captured, and the data is encrypted with the user’s private key and stored within a private and permissioned blockchain.</p>
<p>An Unbeatable Advantage&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Part Three, we’ll drill down on another core pillar of the 1Kosmos architecture: decentralized digital identity and how it provides users with secure anytime, anywhere access to ID cards, driver licenses, social security details, and more through a reusable identity wallet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  Die Abkündigung von SAP Identity Management (SAP IDM) stellt Unternehmen vor eine kritische Herausforderung. Die bisherige Lösung erreicht das Ende ihres Lebenszyklus, und Organisationen müssen sich nun die Frage stellen: Wie kann trotzdem weiterhin Compliance aufrechterhalten werden?  Die Gewährleistung der Identitätsverwaltung unter Berücksichtigung der gesetzlichen Bestimmungen entwickelt sich zu einem zentralen Anliegen für Fachleute im Bereich Informationstechnologie. 

In diesem Kontext suchen Unternehmen nach effektiven Wegen, um die bisherigen Ansätze und Verfahren aus dem SAP IDM-Umfeld auf andere Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)-Systeme zu migrieren. SailPoint und IBM präsentieren innovative Ansätze, wie moderne Technologien eingesetzt werden können, um IGA-Systeme zu erweitern und deren Vorteile optimal zu nutzen. Dieser Schritt eröffnet neue Wege für Unternehmen, um ihre Identitätsmanagement-Strategien anzupassen und den Herausforderungen des Endes von SAP IDM proaktiv zu begegnen.

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Heather Flanagan, Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and David Birch, Principal at 15 Mb, author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. 
<p>This is the 100th episode of Let’s Talk about Digital Identity – in this special episode two of our most popular guests, Heather Flanagan and David Birch, rejoined the podcast to explore what is exciting them in passwordless, identity wallets and digital money.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This is episode number 100 of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And for this special occasion, we have invited back Heather Flanagan, and David Birch.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>We have invited back to the show two of our most popular guests. So, these two guests, let me introduce them is Heather Flanagan. She is Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and Acting Executive Director for IDPro. Hello, Heather.</p>
<p>Heather Flanagan: Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Nice having you back.</p>
<p>And our second guest is David Birch. David Birch is an author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. He is Principal at 15 Mb, his advisory company. Hello, David.</p>
<p>David Birch: Hi. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a real pleasure having you both for this special episode, a bit different style, so being out of our usual script. But yeah, hearing a little bit more about yourselves.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to hear something in particular, because we want to hear something – a moment in your lives. So, what I want to hear – think of one specific moment in your career in which you told yourself, “Yes, this is why I love working in the identity industry.” Which moment would it be? Who wants to start?</p>
<p>David: Well, and it’s a bit self-centred, but probably when my publisher agreed to publish my first book. I thought I had some interesting ideas about identity – I mean you always think that your ideas are – but when you get that kind of validation that your ideas actually are interesting to other people. That really did change my career. Yeah, otherwise, I probably would have just carried on being a pretty average consultant and carried on in payments and banking. So yeah, it’s – but I put it all down to my publisher.</p>
<p>Oscar: Which one was this book? Tell us which book was this.</p>
<p>David: Identity is the New Money. It was Diane Coyle, the Economist, who encouraged me to publish it. So yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Heather?</p>
<p>Heather: I don’t have anything. I’ve been actually thinking about this question for a while, and it’s really hard to point to any one thing, because there were no lightning from the sky moments. It’s just, it’s always been such a foundational aspect of everything that I’ve ever done since I started in tech in the mid ‘90s. Where the first question was always – when you’re taking over something from a bulletin board system to an email server, “Who can access this? What permissions do they need to have? How do you set up accounts for them?” That was where everything always started. So, no one moment, it’s all of the moments.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, that’s great that there are several exciting moments. I’m sure for all of us, it’s been like that. Several moments in which we feel that this is exciting to be in this industry. But thank you for sharing that with us.</p>
<p>Being already towards the end of this year 2023 – so there are some keywords which were buzzing in the last years. But some of these buzzwords today are more reality, we have access to those. What do you think, what you feel about these technologies or techniques. And let’s get started with passwordless. So, if I ask Heather, what excites you today about passwordless?</p>
<p>Heather: I’m really excited about the fact that the technology itself is solid, the standards themselves are really, really well-done. But as excited as I am, I am concerned. Like at all the new modern technologies, I look at them and go, “Wow, that’s really cool.” and little anxiety making because for passwordless, what I observe is when you actually get out of the tech field and talk to my mother, she doesn’t trust it because it’s too easy.</p>
<p>And so, I do wonder about as bad as passwords are, the friction that they add, it’s something that people can wrap their heads around. Whereas they don’t understand the magic that’s happening behind the scenes that makes passkeys better. And if they don’t trust it, they won’t use it. And if they don’t use it, we lose out on all the benefits. So, one of the things I’ve been trying to think about for you know, the future is OK passkeys are amazing, but how can we make them less magic scary?</p>
<p>David: I’m a bit frustrated with it really, because I’m extremely lazy. And so, you know, like eBay, for example, uses passkeys, the whole thing works perfectly. So as soon as I go to a site, as in fact I just did 10 minutes ago to look at something and it’s log back in. I’m like, “What I have an account? I didn’t even know I had the account.” And then I had to remember the password. And of course, I didn’t get it. So, I had to click on, I forgot my password, and then I got the password reset. And then I put in the new password. And it said, “You can’t have a new password that’s the same as the old password.” And we just go around in this loop. And it drives me crazy. I’m like, “Why can’t you just all implement this?” Despite the fears of your mom, which I mean I can’t discount those because they’re real. The sooner we make people stop using passwords, the better.</p>
<p>I was reading a fantastic story in the Insider this morning. Did you see this story about the Zelle fraud on Insider? It’s typical kind of thing, you know, guys getting some work done by a contractor. The hackers get into the contractor’s email account, they send him a thing to send money to a different account, which is the hackers’ account. And they make off with all of the money. And so, they go and talk to the contractor and said to him, “You know, did you know that your email has been compromised, you should change your email password.”</p>
<p>And the guy, it says in the article, “We may as well have been speaking Romanian.” The guy had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. Because he’s a normal person. He doesn’t care about all of this stuff. You don’t say to people, “Oh, here’s a car, would you like a seat belt with it? Or would you like a piece of string that you could attach in, you know, particularly opt in place.” You know, as a society, it comes to a point where you say, “I’m sorry, not wearing seatbelts, there’s just too many people dying. So, cars have to have seatbelts. And you have to put the damn things on. End of story.”</p>
<p>And I sort of feel we’re getting to that point. Fraud and scam, it’s just so completely out of control. And this thing about whether you know, you need to put people in charge of their own data and so on. I just don’t believe that for a moment. I just don’t. Most people don’t have the persistent competence that – including me, by the way, I’m not casting the first stone, I’m one of those people that lacks the persistent competence to make this happen. There are reservations but passkeys are a billion times better than passwords, and we should make people use them. I’m sorry, you got to stop pandering to populism.</p>
<p>Heather: No two ways about it – Passwords have got to go. As we’re moving to passkeys, I think there’s always room for improvement on – even on them. If nothing else, focusing a little bit more on the user experience so that people will have a better understanding of what this means. And when they click this button, why would they click this as opposed to clicking something else that might be a phishing site that they wouldn’t recognise. So, it’s an ongoing education.</p>
<p>David: Then you sort of think of contactless as the, you know, in the early days of contactless people, “Oh, it’s too scary.” And in some parts of the world, it appears to be witchcraft, that you can pay for things by not touching it with your card and this, people are going to come and steal all the cards. And there are going to be people of Eastern European origin on the subway system, putting their hands inside your clothes to read your cards and all this. Remember all of this stuff that was going on?</p>
<p>And now, you walk into a store, anywhere in the world. I’m not talking America, I’m talking about developed countries, of course. You walk into a store anywhere in the world, and there’s that little contactless symbol and you pay, and you go, and no one thinks anything about it anymore. It’s a bit different in America. In America, you have to look for the till and where’s the sign? And then you have to press some buttons. And then sometimes you have to sign something as well. It’s baffling. I don’t understand any of it.</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, the day you understand what happens in the United States will be a marvellous day. Because nobody understands what happens.</p>
<p>David: No, it’s mysterious. But the point is, generally speaking, you know, we came up with this symbol, and everybody knows, you tap your card there, and it works. And guess what? All of your money isn’t stolen by Eastern European fraudsters. So, they’re not all Eastern European, obviously, other fraudsters are available. Because the corollary is going to be basically, people like us will start using passkeys, and so all the fraud will transfer onto people like your mom. That seems a little unfair to me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, seeing that you are excited indeed with passwordless. But of course, there are some concerns and some things to improve. Absolutely. Interesting what Heather said that, yeah, some people have been using password for so long, but that anything else feels like how do you say the…</p>
<p>David: An improvement? Real security? System-wide integrity? I don’t know, what’s the word you’re searching for there? I don’t know.</p>
<p>Oscar: How you say the…</p>
<p>Heather: Magic.</p>
<p>Oscar: Magic. Yeah, magic.</p>
<p>David: So, I’m excited as Heather is, I’m probably just a bit more militant on how quickly we should be pushing it out.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, we’ll see what comes in the next year as how it really rolls out. But the next one is about identity wallets. So, what excites you today about identity wallets?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, I have a list on that one. I’m particularly excited over how – as much as I worry about people not understanding the magic, they do understand the concept of flipping through a wallet to get to the right card, the right credential, the right thing they need and then using it and giving them that level of control is a vast improvement, I think over some of the other technology has been going on today.</p>
<p>I’m watching what’s happening in Europe quite closely because I think that – how the governments are handling digital wallets and digital identity is a very interesting model. I will be curious to see how other countries do it. How they do it well, how they do it poorly. And if there’s some way we can actually – I’d love to standardise ‘what’s a wallet’, you know. That’s one of my little pet peeves, there is no standard for a wallet. There’s standard for credentials, but there’s not a standard for ‘what is a wallet’.</p>
<p>David: I mean, it’s interesting to see what the Open Wallet initiative and various other people are doing in this space. I agree with Heather. I think as much as the technology is important, and certainly, in technological terms, the wallet is the sort of crucial pivot between the kind of online and offline world. It’s very central to the next phase of evolution of commerce. A lot of it has to do with – in fact, we won’t even call our wallets now identity wallets, we just call them wallets. But if you actually open up my wallet, I mean, I won’t do it over there. If you open up my wallet, it has no money in it. Everything is in my wallet, it has to do with identity, driver’s licenses and loyalty cards. And my wallet is already an identity wallet, we just don’t call it that.</p>
<p>So, extending that wallet across sort of virtual and real world seems to me, pretty straightforward. But of course, that does rather interestingly open up what I think will be quite a vicious battle about who’s actually going to control those wallets. Because certainly, Heather mentioned kind of the European approach. They’re very, very unhappy with the idea of big tech controlling those wallets. We’re very unhappy with the big tech or big government controlling the wallets. People like me will prefer that it was regulated institutions – banks primarily, that control those wallets. Other people think banks should be absolutely the last people to have any sort of control over those wallets. So really, I’m not smart enough to figure out like the end dimensional gameplay as to how this is going to work out. But it’s pretty serious. It’s pretty serious.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, people understand the concept of a wallet. But what we’re talking about in today’s world is that, you know, “how many wallets are you going to have to carry?” Because there may be one that’s issued by big tech, perhaps via your browser or via your mobile device. But then, you know, as governments are saying, “No, we’re going to issue something that’s completely separate and have its own app, and what is that going to look like. And then how are people supposed to be able to find the credential they need across 2, 3, 5 different wallets?</p>
<p>David: No, I agree with you completely on that, Heather. But I think there’s another level of complexity there as well, which is – because is the wallet going to be like if you imagine there’s some kind of standard wallet, is that wallet the app? Or is that wallet, essentially the underlying SDK the apps plug into?</p>
<p>So, my British Airways app and my Barclays Bank app, they’re all actually the same wallet underneath. They’re all plugging into the same wallet. But is it going to be like that? Is there going to be like a travel industry wallet? Or is British Airways going to have its own wallet? That’s really hard to know. I would think, and this comes from kind of what I think is a reasonably rational calculus. The credentials that are going to be in those wallets are the embodiment of individual reputations.</p>
<p>My British Airways credential is the embodiment of my relationship with British Airways, that I want to take and show to other people. It’s not obvious to me that British Airways would benefit from owning the wallet, because they’d have to maintain it and upgrade it and whatever. They’re having enough trouble just with their own website to do that. On the other hand, I can see why they’d be nervous about just handing the whole thing over to Apple and Google, because then they’ll end up paying a tax, which I’m pretty sure they don’t want to do. So, I don’t know how that’s going to work out. But I listen to a lot of smart people about this. It’s a very fascinating topic to me.</p>
<p>Heather: I talked to Don Thibeau and Juliana Cafik and a couple others about “what was the Open Wallet Foundation trying to do?” And they’re trying to work towards interoperability in code and maybe a standard will come out of that someday when they see what works and what doesn’t work. But at the moment, they are not standardising wallets. They’re just…</p>
<p>David: No, that’s true. There’s…</p>
<p>Heather: They’re just putting together a platform to try and make it work together.</p>
<p>David: But as you pointed out earlier on, some of the components are standardised. We have VCs, we have MDL. We’ve got MDL 7 and 9 coming in a few months, a year or something. So I mean, there is some pretty useful standardisation going on anyway.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, more in the credential format space.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That might give us enough interoperability to get started.</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ll see. Indeed, it sounds like it’s…</p>
<p>David: I’m a naturally simple and optimistic person. Heather’s looking at all the nuances here. And that’s why she’s so, that’s why my superficial, cheery approach to this – it’s not washing with her I can see it from her face.</p>
<p>Oscar: You seem to be both excited about identity wallets, I think.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I think wallets are really interesting topic for the coming year.</p>
<p>Heather: Huge potential.</p>
<p>Oscar: You, David, mentioned that as far as I understood, you don’t carry cash anymore, that was my understanding how you have your wallet, your real wallet without cash.</p>
<p>David: No, actually, I mean I don’t carry my real wallet, it’s in the drawer over there. So, I had an interesting conversation with somebody last week about premium cards. That’s how interesting my life is, Heather. I just, I benchmark, I had an interesting discussion with someone else last week about premium cards. This is a tragic trajectory of my life.</p>
<p>But I have this fancy new American Express Platinum Card, which is made out of some sort of metal. I don’t know if it’s actually platinum, but it’s sort of metal. And it’s really fancy and heavy and solid and whatever. And I couldn’t even tell you where it is. It’s in the house somewhere. I haven’t the slightest idea.</p>
<p>Oscar: Don’t activate it.</p>
<p>David: No, no, because as soon as I got it, it’s on my phone. I only ever use it on my phone. I don’t know where the actual card is, I have no interest in that. I’m going into London in a minute, I have a ring. So, the ring I use for getting on the subway and bus because I don’t always want to take my phone out. But if I’m paying in a restaurant so I got to use my phone. I think the days of physical wallets, I mean, lots of people keep saying, well, there’s going to be a backlash at some point, and people are going to want to use cash, sort of the way they want to use vinyl records, I suppose. But I think that will just be like a few hipsters. I don’t think it’ll be the rest of us.</p>
<p>Heather: I don’t trust having network access consistently enough to go without some kind of physical something. Do I use my wallet on my watch and my phone more often than not? Well, when I’m in Europe, yes. When I’m in the US, maybe. I don’t count on it. I don’t think I can count on it yet. So, there’s always the physical components that I think I have to have.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I mean, I would say that’s an interesting argument in favour of using offline verifiable credentials. And it’s also a crucial argument in favour as to why Central Bank Digital Currency should operate offline. So, I mean, I agree with you about that. As to the state of things at the moment, well, if the transit gates fail and can’t go online, they have to fail open, it’s a public safety issue. You can’t fail transit gate shut. So, they have to, they should have – I can always get home, you know, but it’s never happened. But when push comes to shove, I’ll get home, so I’m fine.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and that related to my last question, but just to hear what you liked the most. So, what excites you about this digital money that we were already starting to discuss?</p>
<p>David: I’d say there’s probably three things. I mean, Heather’s going to disagree with me on every single one of them, which is why it makes for an interesting conversation. But I’d say there’s probably three things.</p>
<p>So, the first thing is digital money, well, certainly digital currency is the subject of irrational delusional comment by conspiracy theorists, which makes for entertainment. So, I get emails, “oh, you know, Central Bank Digital Currency is the mark of the devil. And we know this because Bill Gates implanted microchips in us through the vaccine, and the microchips are going to steal the digital currency from unvaccinated people and send it through the 5g towers to Satan.” Or somebody, I can’t remember exactly, I don’t remember. But you get emails like this, which add to the gaiety of the nation.</p>
<p>So, the first thing is, there are parts of America where non-existent digital currency is already being banned. So, this is all getting a bit, sort of witch trail-y, so that’s quite entertaining.</p>
<p>The second thing is, and I wasn’t joking about that offline point, which is any scale digital currency in any developed country, even where you have networks and infrastructure has to work offline. It’s the crucial design requirement of it. If you’re going to have a cash substitute, it has to work offline. And that, for me, poses very interesting technological problems, all of which I think, have already been solved. But nonetheless, it’s really intellectually interesting, so I sort of like that.</p>
<p>And the third thing is, I think a lot of people look at digital currency as ‘the thing’. Like, you know, we need digital currency. And that’s it. I mean, what we need is a platform for innovation and development. Digital currency in itself is sort of not that interesting. As we’ve just established, I can already buy milk in the supermarket without using physical cash. So that’s not, but this idea of permissionless innovation that you could bring into our space from the cryp– because digital it doesn’t involve any credit risk, you see. So, you could imagine a situation where as long as you’ve got an approved chip in your iPhone, or something, they’re certified as being capable of storing digital dollars or something like that, then you can use the API to do whatever you like, there’s no credit risk involved. So, allowing people to experiment with interesting new things – micro payments, and Escrow and blah, blah, blah. On top of it is really where it’s at. And that’s why, you know, I get it a bit when people say, “Well, what are the sort of key uses?” Well, I don’t know, I’m too old. Give it to some kids in a garage and let them come up with something.</p>
<p>Heather: OK. So, for one thing, I really want to see your emails about this because they sound hilarious. I admit, I’m absolutely a digital currency sceptic. For one thing, as David has said, right, you don’t generally need to carry cash now anyway, so what is it getting you? And everything I understand about it is like, “Well, yes, but then you’ll be able to transfer money quickly without the bank getting in the way.” And I’m like, “Hmm, you say the bank getting in the way and verifying the transaction is a bad thing.” “Oh, but it’s expensive.” And I’m like, “Well, that’s a different problem, not just because the banks are charging a lot.” So that’s like a completely different problem to solve that it’s not a technology problem at all.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’m definitely not convinced. Having the permission to innovate and work with this kind of currency, to me in a way, that’s like saying, “Yup, let’s turn this into a barter system, except you’re bartering these digital currency components.” “OK. Go for it, go to town.” That’s just people agreeing with each other. And it’s a completely different system in the same way that a barter system is completely different with my cash system.</p>
<p>David: That’s a really interesting point. And I don’t mean that in any sort of patronising sense, I really mean that because you’re right, of course. And what that means is, if this stuff worked, then downstream you could imagine an environment where if you and I engage in some sort of transaction, right, I’m going to pay you to write something or you’re going to pay me to come and speak or something like that. My, you know, supercomputer at the end of a wire, it can be a through my mobile phone, my giant killer robot artificially intelligent wallet will negotiate with your super intelligent giant killer robot Terminator wallet to exchange baskets of tokens to an agreed –</p>
<p>The idea that you would need money as an intermediary when you have that kind of barter that works. I think that’s really, that’s as a very interesting point. So, if our super computers could agree on these baskets of assets to exchange, which sounds weird when its people talking about it, but it’s a few nanoseconds for super computers. Why would you turn those assets into dollars or something in the first place? Why wouldn’t you just swap the assets around?</p>
<p>So, I actually rather agree with that point. But I think that’s much further downstream. I think, in the short term, you see the demand for dollar stable coins in particular, as an indication to me that a lot of people around the world and in America, for that matter, wants to hold digital dollars. They would find digital dollars useful to do things with that you can’t do with regular dollars, and I sort of agree.</p>
<p>So, I can see sort of both things. But to me, the short term and the long term are quite different there. Because I probably do drink my Kool Aid, and I’d probably do think that that’s kind of a stupid expression actually it’s, don’t drink that Kool Aid because everybody that drank the Kool Aid died, didn’t they? Or am I getting the stories mixed up?</p>
<p>Heather: I wasn’t going to say it.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, no, I think they did. OK, that’s a bad example. But the point is, I think in the long run, you might well be right. I think in the short term, digital currencies, I think would add to the net welfare. I mean, I can imagine, you and I agreeing to something, and the money just goes from my digital wallet to your digital wallet. It never goes anywhere near the banking system. It just goes over Bluetooth or whatever but yes. It is exciting. That’s true.</p>
<p>Oscar: Heather, what’s not so exciting to digital money?</p>
<p>Heather: We’ll see.</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ll see. We’ll see. Anything else that it’s for you is exciting?</p>
<p>David: What’s not working digital money, you know, these answers are intertwined, because the thing that’s broken in digital money at the moment, is identity, not the payment bit. Like the reason why you’ve got Zelle frauds and authorised push payment frauds and these massive crypto scams going on all the time. It’s because nobody knows who anybody is. It’s not because the payments don’t work properly. It’s because identity doesn’t work properly.</p>
<p>If the identity, you know, I’m going to sound like a broken record on this one for the teenagers there. I’m going to sound like a vinyl implement that used to go around whether it has a scratch in it. So, this sort of needle would prompt up, down and come back to this, I have to talk them through this metaphor. But I’m going to sound like a broken record on this. Because if you fix the identity problem, payments are easy.</p>
<p>If you know the reputation of all of the counterparties in a transaction, then pricing the risk in that transaction is easy. And that’s kind of what we should be aiming for. The next phase of evolution is really about identity. It happens that I think, and I can’t prove this with any kind of actual analysis, this is just my sort of crackpot theory about this. But actually, if central banks do drive forward with digital currency, digital currency doesn’t work unless you have digital identity. You can’t give people wallets unless you know who those people are. You can’t maintain limits on personal holdings unless you know who’s got the wallets. There must be an identity system for the currency system to work. So it could be that Central Bank Digital Currency actually turns out to be a vector for people like Heather to actually get something done about wallets and digital identity. So, there’s an interesting interrelationship there.</p>
<p>Heather: They are certainly tied together. There’s no two questions about that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Anything else that you think that is exciting today in the identity world that we have not covered?</p>
<p>David: Well, there’s two things I’m excited about today. I can tell you what I was doing before I came on this call. So, one is – I’m very excited about only because I’m not a normal person. I’m very excited about ultra-wideband technology. So, all iPhones for a while, you know some of the top end Samsung’s you know Apple Air Tags, things like this, they all have this thing in them called you UWB, Ultra-Wideband which a lot of people kind of overlook a little bit because we focus everything on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. But when Bluetooth and Wi Fi came out there were actually three wireless standards. There was Bluetooth, UWB and Wi-Fi. And UWB never really got used because the Wi-Fi chips got cheaper much quicker, and everybody just started building Wi-Fi into things. And meanwhile Bluetooth ranges went up.</p>
<p>But ultra-wideband, which is short range, medium speed that uses this pulsed radio. Because of the way it works, it can only tell where things are, this is how Air Tags work. But it can also tell whether you’re moving towards something or away from it. So, this idea of having a phone that knows you’re walking up to the point-of-sale terminal or knows you’re walking up to a door. And the way that Apple are part of this digital car keys alliance, which I’m very interested in with Google, and I think BMW and people like that.</p>
<p>So, this idea that you have one technology like this, which locates you, you’re walking towards the POS terminal, and then it flips to Bluetooth to execute an actually secure transaction with real cryptography, and real keys. I’m really interested in that at the moment for a variety of different ways. So that’s the first thing.</p>
<p>And the second thing is, and I think we have touched on this before, we think of identity as being about people. But actually, everything needs identity. And when everything has an identity, working out how to get both privacy and security in that environment is really rather complicated. It’s very intellectually challenging. And that’s what I’m spending the rest of my time on with another startup at the moment. So yeah, there’s no end of things to be excited about in this space, honestly. And frankly, figuring out how people can log into their bank account without password is the least interesting of the things that’s going on at the moment.</p>
<p>Heather: Probably the most interesting thing that I’m trying to stay on top of right now is watching the standards development space, because that is like one of my favourite things to do. Because I might also be a little bit of a strange person. So, standards development space, seeing how ISO, the IETF, the W3C, as well as some of the smaller standard’s organisations like the OpenID Foundation, the Decentralised Identity Foundation, Trust Over IP, how they’re all circling closer and closer to each other and sometimes hitting each other, bouncing off.</p>
<p>You know, it’s becoming a really dense space to try and follow and understand what’s happening with W3C verifiable credentials? How do those relate to the ISO MDOC standards, and what’s happening with the IETF’s OAuth and CBOR and you know, all of these different standard’s groups are all starting to get closer and closer at nibbling down this problem. And they’re never going to succeed because they’re reaching the point where it’s not a technical problem anymore. It’s a societal problem. And the regulators are starting to move ahead of them and saying, “No, this is what, you know, we need to happen. And it’s not about technology, as much as it is sometimes about the society and the cultural requirements.” So, seeing these organisations tighten up, it’s pretty cool.</p>
<p>David: I was just going to ask you, because I’ve sort of lost the thread on this a little bit, because unless you follow it with minute detail every day, you don’t. I wonder if the whole kind of MDOC thing doesn’t have its own momentum. So, in other words, in a lot of circumstances, you can see why people are going to go to MDOC and MDL part 5, even for something that’s not a driving license, just because. It reminds me a little bit, and here’s another one of the teenagers, it reminds me of X.500. Because having spent part of my young life, she doesn’t even know what X.500 is, how he’s been part of my – X.400 was the ISO messaging standard that existed before the internet and that no longer exists. And X.500 was the directory standard for that. And that no longer exists. An X.509 was the standard for exchanging public keys in that directory. And X.509 version 3 is how everything works on the internet.</p>
<p>So, the whole of X.400 has disappeared, the whole of X.500 disappeared. And I just wonder if MDL isn’t going to be in the same place, like people are going to end up using MDL just because it exists. It may not be the optimum for a lot of the appli– but it doesn’t matter. The format exists. Wallets can understand it. Apple and Google Wallets can understand it. The MDOC stuff will carry on standardising, and I think maybe a lot of stuff will just get sucked into that.</p>
<p>Heather: What’s getting complicated about it – is the MDL standards. They are in their own way the X.509 to the modern world. They’re specifying a credential. This is a discrete concrete, and this is what this is supposed to be used for. It is your driver’s license. It is your identifier. Verifiable credentials using W3 capital V, capital C verifiable credentials. That’s not what they are really, those are much more generic thing that’s actually more an authentication thing. So, the fact that they’re hitting each other in the ways that they are is very interesting and a little disturbing. And the fact that the browser vendors are debating within themselves, which one they’re going to support when ultimately, they serve different purposes, I worry that we’re going to be driven towards…</p>
<p>David: No, no, I… your analysis is spot on. I agree with you completely Heather. I’m just saying that in practice, what seems to be happening is like people like me would say, “Well, actually…” you know, use the canonical example going into the bar, you know, people like me would say, “Well, you should be presenting an ISO W3C verifiable credential that says that you’re over 18 or over 21. So, I’m going…” But that doesn’t exist. The standard for the credential exists, but the contents, whereas on MDL, OK, that’s not really what it was meant for. But actually, demanding to see your MDL driver’s license, I can do because the standard exists. And I, you know, so I agree with your analysis. I’m just saying I wonder if actually, well, Trust Over IP and all these other things are kind of circling around, bumping into each other. MDOC is just steadily progressing, you know.</p>
<p>Heather: Told you Oscar, I told you, you’re going to have all sorts of fun things to talk about.</p>
<p>David: He’s going to get very bored on our – just our island, Heather. Like after the plane crashes, we’re going to be fine. He’s going to be, I don’t know what he’s going to do all day, making those little token at men or something.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, fantastic. Hearing all this from you. You’re definitely super passionate about – many of these things that you’re talking about, frustrated about some of them, but yes, super excited about most of them. So, thank you very much for joining us in very special episode for us. So, thank you very much. And please tell us how people can learn more about you, Heather?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, easiest thing is – go to LinkedIn and find me there. I check it every day. It’s one of my major social media accounts.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I mean, I spend more time on LinkedIn now since Twitter kind of went all weird. So, I mean, I’m on LinkedIn too. But it also you can just look up www.dgwbirch.com.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, thank you very much. So, let’s see how exciting comes the next coming months, years and yeah, how all the things we were discussing today will roll out. So, again, thanks a lot and all the best.</p>
<p>Heather: Great. Bye</p>

   Evaluate your access management (AM) strategy with guidance from Gartner 

<p>Access management (AM) has become instrumental in fueling business growth while protecting against modern attacks. Today's economic environment makes AM even more critical, with enterprises seeking a converged access management solution that can address myriad use cases for multiple populations. But what capabilities should you prioritize for your organization?</p>

<p>The 2023 Gartner® Critical Capabilities for Access Management report is a technical companion to the Gartner Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management. While the Magic Quadrant provides an overview of a vendor including its market share, Critical Capabilities is purely a technical analysis of a vendor's products and services.</p>

<p>This year Gartner scored 11 vendors against four common use cases, including workforce access management, business-to-consumer access management (B2C), business-to-business access management (B2B), and application development.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce that ForgeRock received the highest scores in two of these use cases, namely B2C and B2B customer access management.</p>

 11 critical capabilities to consider for your 2024 roadmap 

<p>In addition to the four use cases, Gartner outlines a set of critical capabilities essential for any organization's access management strategy:</p>

 The future of digital finance is evolving, and it’s happening just in time 



<p>Over the last few years, the move to digital finance has accelerated. Consumers are adopting emerging financial apps and services, empowering them to take control of their financial health. The same technological leaps that are enhancing payments, financial management and banking are also changing lending for the better, and they couldn’t have come at a more opportune time. </p>



<p>That’s because consumers are feeling the impact of economic uncertainty and worry about the effect that it may have on them. In a 2023 survey, Mastercard spoke to 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the U.K., Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences. &nbsp;</p>



<p> Over 89% of respondents say that they’ve been negatively affected by economic uncertainty. &nbsp;</p>







<p>At the same time, whether they’re making big purchases like homes or handling everyday needs like transportation or food, consumers worry that they won’t be able to borrow what they need. &nbsp;</p>







<p>Open banking data can help consumers get to the bottom of these challenges.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, open banking allows consumers to permission access to their bank account, allowing lenders to augment their credit decisioning models with real time information that gives a better view of the consumer’s ability to repay a loan.&nbsp;That’s important because 95% of those who have been denied a loan in the past two years want more insights into the lending process. People are willing to share secure access to their bank account data, if it means better interest rates, instant approval for a loan, improved chances of being approved for a credit card or to secure an increase in the limit on a credit card.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lenders benefit, too. By augmenting traditional credit models with open banking, they can improve operational efficiencies, lower costs and create innovative new lending models that can give consumers the credit they deserve, when they need it.  &nbsp;</p>



 The world is going digital 



<p>The data revealed in Mastercard’s Lend Report shows global consumer support for a more transparent, digital-first approach to lending. Read more about the future of lending in Mastercard’s Lend Report <a href="https://www.finicity.com/future-of-lending-report/">here</a>.</p>

				  Decentralized identity technology is increasingly being adopted to quickly and securely share data in the private and public sectors. With widespread interest in the technology’s ability to create verifiable data and streamline processes, the question of how you create a solution has never been more important.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>More people are interested in verifiable credentials and decentralized ecosystems than ever— which is awesome to see! But as new people enter this space the amount of information and the options available can be complicated and overwhelming. For those seeking to learn about the technology, the fundamental concepts, and how it works, Indicio recommends this quick, but comprehensive, <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">Beginner’s Guide</a>. But once you have decided that a decentralized solution is what you want for your organization, there are several things to consider when it comes to actually making a purchase.</p>
<p>Vendor / Platform lock-in</p>
<p>Being locked into one vendor or platform can have downstream consequences: surprise costs, slow responses to adding new competitive features, and the risk that should something happen to the vendor, your platform suddenly becomes unsupported. In today’s business world, vendor lock-in is often seen as unavoidable for some things; for example, many companies are reliant on Microsoft for their entire office suite and the licenses they can provide. But it simply doesn’t need to be like this for your decentralized identity solution — and shouldn’t be. The space is new and growing so fast that it doesn’t make sense to tie your hands to a proprietary solution from a particular provider.</p>
<p>Instead, do as we do: Indicio builds on open-source technologies whenever possible. For example the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven™</a> line of products are built on the open-source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy">Hypereledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries</a> codebases. Open source gives you freedom: freedom to build what you need to succeed, freedom to add what you need when you need it to meet opportunities, and most importantly — freedom to walk away.</p>
<p>Open source codebases incubate innovation and resilience: the more people using the code, the more it is tested, the better it becomes, and the quicker it evolves. However, do note that open source comes in two flavors: free and supported. Many companies opt for a supported solution (e.g., the Red Hat model), which saves their developer teams from having to climb the learning curve of unfamiliar codebases and frees them to focus on business solutions. Indicio provides supported open-source product solutions, both pre-designed and customized, so that you get to implementation as quickly as possible and have all the technical support you need to grow.</p>
<p>Do they sell all the pieces you need?</p>
<p>There are four major pieces of technology that form a working decentralized ecosystem for the secure exchange of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<p>Issuer agent— for creating and issuing a credential</p>
<p>Mobile wallet — for holding and presenting a credential</p>
<p>Mediator — coordinates messages between wallets on mobile devices and verifiers / issuers</p>
<p>Verifier agent — for verifying the credential</p>
<p>Not all vendors sell these as a package. Some only have one or some of the parts to create the functionality you want. It is important to understand exactly what it is that you’re getting. Just being able to download a mobile wallet will not give you the ability to create your own credentials.</p>
<p>Indicio offers each of these components separately if you want, (learn more about our mobile wallet <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a>, or play with <a href="https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/">one of our mediators</a>), but if you are seeking to implement a complete ecosystem, it is better to buy a complete ecosystem. That way, you get everything “in the box,” so to speak, and you know that everything will work together smoothly. This was the impetus for Indicio to create Proven as a complete, off-the-shelf ecosystem.</p>
<p>Interoperability</p>
<p>The world will never operate completely on one system. The more credential formats your decentralized solution supports, the more people will be able to use and benefit from it. Building this kind of support into solutions takes time and money, so not all vendors provide it or plan to do so, and instead pick a format in hope that it will become the format that catches on and everyone uses.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how this can go wrong, building special integrations for Internet Explorer would have looked like the smart move in 2009 when it had <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/worldwide/2009">65% of internet browser market share</a>, but today, even after a rebrand to Edge, it is now <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">hovering at just over 5%</a>, and only 5% of customers being able to use your integration would be severely limiting to your business.</p>
<p>Indicio is committed to building as much interoperability into our solutions as possible, commonly using a variety of verifiable credential formats including Anoncreds, SD JWTs, JSON-LD, JSON-LD BBS+, Open Badges 3.0, W3C, and Mobile Drivers Licence. Our team has years of experience implementing successful solutions, and we can advise you on the credential types that best meet your use case’s requirements, or help build a custom solution using an additional credential type your organization needs.</p>
<p>Network</p>
<p>You’ll need to host your verifiable credential solution on a blockchain-based distributed ledger network — or have someone else take responsibility for writing credential data to the ledger. Either way, you’ll want to make sure that the network supporting your solution meets your needs.</p>
<p>A distributed ledger network, typically, consists of several networks: one for developing and testing a solution, one for demonstrating a solution, and a main or production network to support your finished product. There may also be a temp network for stress testing, which gives you the freedom to push your solution to breaking point and easily reset, something better done before going to market.</p>
<p>In all cases, there are several important questions: how much does it cost to use each of these networks (singly or bundled), including how much does it cost to write credentials to the main or production network and, if necessary, revoke them? How much will it cost to scale your solution, and whether “all-you-can-write” packages can simplify payments and deliver significant cost savings in the medium and long term.</p>
<p>Second, what kind of technical support or support packages are provided? If you are new to verifiable credential technology, is there full customer onboarding and operational support for each network? What kind of engineering support is there for solutions that are mission-critical?</p>
<p>You’ll also want to assess the network’s performance by asking for uptime metrics and ask how the network is monitored to ensure that any problems can be quickly addressed. (For example Indicio’s network has a 99.97% uptime)</p>
<p>In terms of resilience, you’ll need to know how many nodes support the network and how extensive their geographic distribution, as some customers, particularly governments, have regulations on where nodes can be hosted.</p>
<p>Governance</p>
<p>What rules will be in place for your decentralized ecosystem? Who will implement these rules and how will they be integrated into the system? While your solution might function from a technical standpoint, its usability in the field depends on governance. When considering a solution or provider, examine how rules such as trust lists for approved credential issuers are implemented. How are credentials verified in near-offline or offline conditions? Governance in decentralized identity often seems complex. It doesn’t need to be.</p>
<p>Indicio developed machine-readable governance to deliver this simplicity. This enables governance rules to be published in a machine-readable format (currently in development as a specification at the Decentralized Identity Foundation), propagated to all participants in a decentralized identity ecosystem, and cached in their software. This enables the governance authority responsible for the use case to quickly implement system-wide rules and rule changes, manage trust lists and provide offline verification. Indicio developed a <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">Governance Editor</a> to simplify creating the governance files. You can try it out <a href="https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/Indicio-tech/governance-editor/tree/main">here.</a></p>
<p>We hope this article gives you a decent starting place when evaluating your options for a decentralized solution. You can never ask too many questions, especially when building something to last. If you have an idea for a decentralized identity ecosystem the Indicio team is ready to answer any questions or help you get started, you can <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out here.</a></p>

<p>Use of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/certificate-solutions/learn/certification-authority-authorization">Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)</a> was mandated for TLS certificates in September 2017. The primary purpose of CAA is to allow the domain owner to authorize specific CA(s) to issue TLS certificates for their domains. It also prevents other CAs from issuing TLS certificates for those domains. CAA limits the risk and scope of certificate issuance to only approved CAs.</p>
<p>When the Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) Requirements were introduced in July 2021, CAA was included with the “issuevmc” record. It was important to have a new record, so TLS CA authorizations would not impact VMC issuance.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/smime-br/">S/MIME Baseline Requirements</a>, there is now a place to provide standard requirements for S/MIME certificate issuance. One goal was to extend CAA to email addresses for the issuance of S/MIME certificates. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9495.html">Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Processing for Email Addresses- RFC 9495</a> has just been published to support this requirement and provide the “issuemail” record to permit CAs to issue S/MIME certificates.</p>
<p>The standard CAA record form for email addresses would look like this:</p>
 
 mail.client.example &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAA 0 issuemail “authority.example” 
 
<p>The “authority.example” identifying domain value would be provided by the CA in their CPS. The Entrust CAA identifying domain is “entrust.net”.</p>
<p>Domain owners are encouraged to use CAA to streamline the CAs that can issue TLS, VMC, or S/MIME certificates for domains. From a risk mitigation point of view, this stops CAs from issuing requests that have not been approved. An unapproved CA request could come from an attacker or could also come from a colleague who is not familiar with your CA selection process.</p>
<p>Note; There has been no CA/Browser Forum ballot to date, so the S/MIME Baseline Requirements have not been updated to require CAA to be checked before issuing S/MIME email certificates. We expect a CAA checking requirement to be added to the S/MIME BRs within the next year.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In the second release cycle of 2023, we have updated our SSO to include Client Credentials Grant. &nbsp;In addition, we have performed several corrections and improvements as well as regular security updates and life-cycle management on the Identity Platform. For full details, please review the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9084600321/Identity+Server+2023.2+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
 Features 
 Client Credentials Grant with OIDC (OpenID Connect) 
<p>In brief, the Client Credential Grant permits an application (or client) the ability to request an access token. This token is used instead of having the application configured with an administrator password, thus being more secure.</p>
<p>Ubisecure’s <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9138405377/Client+Credentials+Grant+reference+-+SSO">Client Credentials Grant</a> implementation supports two key use cases for the flow.</p>
 
 Authorised Access use case, also known as Common flow – the Client’s access token is used to impersonate the client and request resources from other servers or applications. 
 A lessor used, but available within the specification, configuration method is the Single application use case. In this flow a server is using its own credentials to access local resources on the same server, requiring user’s access rights. 
 
 Improved Stability 
<p>Also found in this development cycle are several smaller stability improvements. Memory and cache cleaning improvements will help environments with very long uptimes or very high utilisation for SSO. For CustomerID we have resolved a number of registration work-flow errors that could result in additional manual clean-up requirements of the LDAP directory.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>With the CI running updates continuously for many of the utilised third-party libraries, we have been able to focus on additional security items. We have updated OpenLDAP MDB to 2.5.16, which includes OpenSSL v3 – an essential update as OpenSSL v1 is no longer being maintained. This OpenLDAP update has been backported to IDS 2023.1 release (SSO 9.3, in SSO 9.2.3).</p>
 Improved Information 
<p>Addressing a concern raised by a number of customers, we’ve also reorganised the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9103376399/Change+Log+-+Identity+Platform">Change Log for Identity Server</a>.&nbsp;With this new format, you can quickly see which version of SSO should be grouped with which version of CustomerID and if there have been essential patches to each core application.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>Over the coming winter, we will be focusing on essential improvements around Swedish BankID, namely the support of the required animated QR codes. We’ll also be performing essential life-cycle management updates – we expect you to be able to see these clearly on a new area of the Developer Portal that will help to illustrate the overall system requirements and maintenance for your on-premise environment; note that using our Identity Cloud will ensure that all of the life-cycle management and upgrade requirements are fully managed by Ubisecure’s Operations Team.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>In my presentation at the KuppingerCole's <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution 2023 conference</a> in Frankfurt, entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/beware-of-easy-paths-cre23">"Beware of Easy Paths: The Journey Towards NIS2 Compliance",</a> I focused on the complexities of the revised Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2) issued by the European Union. While I am neither a lawyer nor an auditor (so they might be important peers to talk to on your NIS2-journey), my focus is on the practical implications of this crucial piece of cybersecurity legislation. As a critical component of the EU's cybersecurity strategy, NIS2 extends its influence across various essential sectors, encompassing energy, transport, banking, and health. This directive marks a significant shift in the cybersecurity landscape, setting forth new challenges and requirements for organizations, particularly for medium-sized and large companies, as they strive to align with these evolving regulations.</p>
 Understanding NIS2 
<p>NIS2 is a pivotal piece of legislation issued by the European Union, aimed at fortifying cybersecurity measures across its member states. This directive serves as a cornerstone in the EU's strategy to enhance resilience and response capabilities in the face of growing cyber threats. NIS2 applies broadly within the EU, encompassing a variety of sectors deemed critical for the economy and society. These sectors include energy, transport, banking, health, digital infrastructure, and public administration, among others.</p>
<p>Crucially, NIS2 came into force on January 16, 2023. However, its practical application involves a multi-stage process. First, member states are required to transpose the directive into national law. This aspect underscores the need for harmonization of cybersecurity standards across different jurisdictions while allowing for some degree of customization to address national specifics. Second, the organizations within the scope of NIS2, particularly those categorized under <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80065/kritis-understanding-and-protecting-critical-infrastructure">KRITIS</a> (Critical Infrastructures), are mandated to comply within a 21-month period. This staged approach aims to provide a structured and feasible pathway for entities to adapt and align with the directive's requirements.</p>
 The Scope and Impact of NIS2 
<p>NIS2 significantly expands the framework of cybersecurity obligations compared with its predecessor. It encompasses a wider range of organizations by categorizing them as either "essential" or "important" entities. This distinction is critical, as it brings a greater number of companies under the purview of NIS2, particularly those that were not previously subject to such stringent cybersecurity regulations.</p>
<p>For essential facilities, the level of criticality and obligations is higher. Important institutions, although new to this level of regulatory scrutiny, now also fall under the ambit of NIS2. This expansion significantly broadens the range of affected companies and organizations, moving beyond the traditional sectors of critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Moreover, NIS2 introduces specific thresholds for determining which companies are considered medium-sized or large, making many more companies subject to these regulations. &nbsp;Medium-sized companies are defined as having 50-250 employees and a turnover of €10-50m and/or a balance sheet of less than €43m.&nbsp; Large companies are those with more than 250 employees and a turnover of €50m and/or a balance sheet of €43m. The implications of these thresholds are substantial, especially for medium-sized companies, which may find themselves grappling with a massive tightening of cybersecurity requirements.</p>
 Requirements and Enforcement under NIS2 
<p>NIS2 introduces a blend of specific and generic requirements to ensure comprehensive cybersecurity across various sectors. Article 21 of NIS2, for instance, lists several specific mandates, particularly focusing on risk management, incident response, authentication, and other measures. However, NIS2 also emphasizes adherence to current best practices, certifications, and a generally high and appropriate level of security. This dual approach allows for flexibility while maintaining a baseline of cybersecurity standards.</p>
<p>The enforcement of NIS2 is marked by firm oversight and significant sanctioning power. Supervisory bodies are designated at the national level to monitor and enforce compliance. This includes strengthened supervisory measures ensuring entities' adherence to cybersecurity protocols and the introduction of severe penalties for non-compliance. Cross-border collaboration is a key feature, enhancing cooperation between member states for consistent enforcement. And requirements for transparency and disclosure are stipulated, mandating clear communication regarding cybersecurity incidents and measures. NIS2 encourages initiatives exceeding minimum requirements, fostering a culture of cybersecurity excellence, and promotes public-private partnerships to enhance overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
 Focusing on Compliance: A Tailored Approach 
<p>From KuppingerCole’s perspective, a key aspect of complying with NIS2 is recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, no matter what vendors, consultancies or whoever tells you. Each organization must define and implement NIS2 compliance in a manner that reflects its unique context and challenges. This tailored approach is crucial, considering the diverse range of sectors and company sizes affected by the directive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image: NIS2 - From Initial Assessment to Continual Implementation</p>
<p>Organizations should prioritize a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, as advocated by NIS2. This involves not only identifying and assessing cyber risks unique to their operations but also developing bespoke strategies to mitigate these risks. Compliance, therefore, becomes a dynamic and continuous process, necessitating ongoing adjustments and improvements in line with the evolving cyber threat landscape and organizational changes.</p>
<p>Key areas of focus include risk management, incident reporting, supply chain protection, and cyber hygiene. Each of these areas requires a detailed and customized strategy, taking into account the specific needs and capabilities of the organization. For instance, incident reporting protocols must be efficient yet sensitive to the particular operational context of the business.</p>
 Practical Implementation Strategies 
<p>For practical implementation, especially for SMEs, the focus should be on developing manageable and cost-effective cybersecurity strategies. SMEs often face resource constraints and skill gaps, making it imperative to find solutions that balance cost with effectiveness. Simplifying compliance processes and tailoring strategies to the operational realities of SMEs can significantly aid in meeting NIS2 requirements. Collaboration and community initiatives can also play a pivotal role, allowing SMEs to pool resources and share knowledge to enhance their cybersecurity posture collectively.</p>
<p>In summary, the implementation of NIS2 demands a thoughtful, customized approach, particularly for smaller organizations facing unique challenges in their compliance journey.</p>
 Navigating NIS2 Compliance 
<p>NIS2 marks a significant shift from the conventional checkbox compliance to a more integrated approach, embedding cybersecurity, compliance, and resilience into the very fabric of organizational processes. It prompts a departure from the simplistic, procedural adherence to regulations, focusing instead on a comprehensive assessment of risks. The directive advocates for a customized journey to compliance, one that is not generic but tailored to the specific needs and risk profiles of individual organizations, underscoring the need for a strategic and nuanced application of its mandates.</p>
<p>In addressing NIS2 compliance, it is clear that a uniform solution is not feasible. Each organization must approach compliance in a manner tailored to its unique context. Seeking assistance from a range of professionals, including peers, consultants, analysts, lawyers, and the enforcing bodies is advisable for navigating this complex regulation. Collaboration with these experts can provide the necessary insights for effective compliance strategies.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole Analysts, we focus on offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-nis2-directive-who-what-and-how">realistic strategies for NIS2 compliance</a>. We understand the challenges involved and aim to provide pragmatic solutions, recognizing that each organization's journey towards compliance is distinct.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the path to NIS2 compliance is intricate and requires a bespoke approach, there are <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/advisory">resources</a> available to guide organizations through this process, ensuring a secure and compliant digital environment.</p>

<p>Sudo Platform is a continually evolving offering as we develop new products and enhance existing services. Common services such as accounts, entitlements and profile management, underpin our offerings.</p>



<p>To find out more, check out <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/how-you-can-use-sudo-platform-digital-identities-and-decentralized-identity-capabilities-to-rapidly-deliver-customer-privacy-solutions/">how you can use Sudo Platform to rapidly deliver customer privacy solutions</a>.</p>



 <br>Sudo Platform combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of SDKs 



Figure 1: Sudo Platform



<p>Sudo Platform is built for developers by developers.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Sudo Platform is a set of scalable hosted services that provide the capabilities to an enterprise developer. You can integrate these hosted services with your systems to provide entitlement, federated single sign-on, and other integrations that allow your existing customers to seamlessly access the Sudo Platform services you want.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform hosted services are also integrated into various third party systems such as cloud providers, telephony carriers, banks, payment processors, blockchains, and more. These hosted services are deployed individually for each of Anonyome’s consumer-facing customers/partners, completely separating them from other customer/partners’ data and services and providing the ability to customize that environment for the individual organization.</p>



<p>Above the hosted services sit SDKs, documentation and sample apps distributed through GitHub which allow Sudo Platform customers to quickly develop applications using Sudo Platform services. This software is open source so you can quickly become productive. All Sudo Platform SDKs are offered in Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript/TypeScript, which means you can freely enhance any of your web, mobile or desktop products that make up your full software suite.</p>



<p>If you’d prefer a faster route to market or lack the internal expertise or capacity to create and deploy applications to end users, we also publish UI kits that enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications that can be quickly branded and delivered to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms. This rapid white label offering is very attractive to organizations that want or need to move quickly.</p>



<p>A UI kit gives you access to libraries of advanced software modules with complex data and graphical flows that go beyond basic Sudo Platform service access. The first library contained in a UI kit is the core library, which provides complex business logic for data management and functional utilities that span one or more of the Sudo Platform services. The second library contained in a UI kit is the UI library, which has widgets, screens and minor user flows that give recommended user experiences for a feature and can be integrated into your application. UI kits are supported across Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript/TypeScript.</p>



<p>An unbranded application (or white label application) allows you to take advantage of fully developed and supported applications for web, mobile and desktop platforms. Our unbranded apps deliver an optimal user experience of Sudo Platform services, and you can add your logo, color palette and other branding requirements. Once complete, you simply add your new apps to your product portfolio for fast deployment and integrate them with your user management and accounting systems.</p>



 Sudo Platform keeps up with the privacy landscape 



<p>We can only achieve privacy if Sudo Platform products and services adapt to the ever-evolving data surveillance landscape. We have built Sudo Platform offerings against enhancement roadmaps and with a philosophy of continuous development so it stays abreast of user needs. Each release incorporates the latest support for all mobile, web and desktop platforms and features regular security updates for packaged software dependencies.</p>



<p>The Sudo Platform GitHub site is shown below. We include our SDKs and sample apps (including source code) to make it easy to leverage the capabilities into your applications.</p>

<p>The instructions for how to build Sudo Platform capabilities into your applications are included in our documentation site:</p>



Figure 3: Sudo Platform documentation



<p>You can find more information about Sudo Platform in our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/">documentation</a>, open source <a href="https://github.com/sudoplatform">SDKs</a> for mobile, web and desktop, and official <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asudoplatform+sample">sample applications</a>.</p>



 Getting started takes just 4 simple steps 



 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create an account 



<p>Start by creating an account so you can access, configure and integrate Sudo Platform services into your products.</p>



<p>Creating an account is simple. Each Sudo Platform account has two key characteristics:</p>



 
 complete account isolation 



 feature service customization. 
 



<p>Unlike accounts with traditional multi-tenant SaaS companies, Sudo Platform accounts are individual and isolated from others within the system so that core services and data are unique to each deployment. In real terms, this helps to eliminate any risk of information cross-contamination within our internal systems.</p>



<p>Each Sudo Platform account is unique for each customer based on individual need. When you create a Sudo Platform account, your selection of features and any subsequent configuration makes your deployment different from other customers’ deployments on Sudo Platform. This means:</p>



 
 You only pay for what you need. 



 The deployment is implemented against your compliance, data and location requirements. 



 You have clear visibility into what you are developing against. 



 Manage your account with the Sudo Platform management console<br><br>The management console lets you manage your administrative and end users, gain critical insight into the analytics underlying your deployment, and explore ways to enhance your Sudo Platform experience. 
 



<p>Your Sudo Platform management console is a real-time reflection of your deployment. It lets you view and alter the features that back the integrated products and affects how your services interact with Sudo Platform. This means you can easily adapt your customers’ experiences with Sudo Platform features and your existing authentication, subscriptions, billing and entitlements systems.</p>

This means you can easily adapt your customers’ experiences with Sudo Platform features and your existing authentication, subscriptions, billing and entitlements systems.</p>



 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start with a sample app or go straight to SDKs 



<p>Once you have your Sudo Platform account, why not check out what it can do? You can do this via a sample app or jump right into integration with our SDKs.</p>



<p>Using a sample app is the fastest way to see how the Sudo Platform services work and the value they can provide. You can easily explore the technology and imagine the potential for your products, either as an enhancement or brand new offering.</p>



<p>If you dive right into integration with our SDKs, you’ll find they are designed for seamless integration with all your existing and new applications. Each SDK is built to run natively on all supported platforms, so they have the highest chance of compatibility with your applications, independent of the frameworks and architecture you employ.</p>



<p>To integrate with the platform you’re developing on, simply use the appropriate package manager (see table below) and add a dependency to the Sudo Platform SDKs you need for your project. If you need help using one of the listed package managers, refer to its documentation.</p>



PlatformPackage manageriOS (Swift)Cocoapods: https://cocoapods.org/Android (Kotlin)Maven Central: https://search.maven.org/Javascript/Typescriptnpmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/



<p>See our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/getting-started">documentation</a> for more information.</p>



 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain your Sudo Platform application 



<p>Maintaining a Sudo Platform application is an important exercise once you have integrated our SDKs. Everything you need to know each release to plan or automate how you pull in fixes, updates and new features is available in GitHub and the Sudo Platform documentation.</p>



 Changelogs 



<p>Changelogs for all Sudo Platform SDK releases are available in the associated GitHub repository. Within these changelogs there is information about each release, including:</p>



 
 a description of changes that are newly available 



 an indication of SDK versions that are compatibility breaking 



 a description of fixes that are available 



 assets associated with a release. 
 



<p>To access this changelog information for each release, simply go to the appropriate GitHub repository and click the ‘Releases’ link in the right pane:</p>







<p>The next page gives you access to the changelogs associated with each release of the SDK:</p>







 Versioning 



 Rules 



<p>Our versioning adheres to semantic versioning-like rules so integrating up-to-date releases into your CI/CD development pipelines is easy. Introducing Sudo Platform products from official release repositories into your dependency pipeline and adhering to versioning rules ensures constant compatibility with the services in your Sudo Platform deployment.</p>



<p>The rules in Sudo Platform versioning are:</p>



 
 MAJOR version when incompatible API changes are released 



 MINOR version when backwards compatible functionality is released 



 PATCH version when backwards compatible bug fixes are released. 
 



<p>If we deviate from these rules, we will let you know in the documentation as soon as possible so you can adapt.</p>



 Compatibility 



<p>Another important consideration is the compatibility of the version of the SDKs your application uses and the version of the SDKs supported by the services within your Sudo Platform deployment. Ignoring the compatibility of your application’s SDK versions can cause your application to stop functioning correctly or completely.</p>



<p>We have an API that lets you verify the general compatibility of your application against your deployed instance. This API gives you information about the compatibility status of your application and any features that are incompatible. As a result, you can design your application to appropriately respond to this API based on your needs and the overall scenario:</p>



 
 understand the compatibility of an application during development 



 inform a user about the need to update their application installation to a compatible version 



 gracefully disable select functionality of the application based on the nature of the compatibility issue. 
 



<p>You can find specific guidance on each platform’s implementation of this API and some sample code in our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/getting-started#verifying-the-app-compatibility-with-backend-services">documentation</a>.</p>



 Those 4 simple steps achieve 3 big rewards 



 
 You access a unique, comprehensive, performant, scalable, and secure way of introducing privacy-first services and paradigms into your products.<br><br> 



 You get the services and development building blocks you need to build solutions that meet your users’ demands quickly, seamlessly and with future vision.<br><br> 



 You deploy cutting-edge capabilities across communication, collaboration and commerce, and integrate them into your products and processes so you can:
 
 enhance your users’ privacy 



 fill gaps in your product portfolio 



 help mitigate the ever-increasing threat of data surveillance.

<p>To act in the world we must first make sense of it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the world is complex, containing an amount of information exceeding the processing capacity of any individual or group. Adequate sensemaking in the context of complexity and info-abundance therefore requires the ability to process and analyse data. </p><p>We refer to this capability as data-driven sensemaking.</p><p>Yet, today the means for data-driven sensemaking are unevenly distributed. In our essay, <a href="https://www.culturehack.io/issues/issue-02-territories-of-transition/data-commoning-as-a-territory-of-transition/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Politics of Data: Data Commoning as a Territory of Transition</a>, we described how data is shaping the landscape of power, perpetuating and amplifying asymmetries. Unsurprisingly, the principal beneficiaries are large corporations and state actors with the financial and technical resources required to undertake data collection, processing and analysis at scale. As with ‘natural resources’ and ‘labour’, the dominant economic and cultural logics of today regard data as another resource to be extracted, siloed and abused in service of narrow objectives and/or for the benefit of a few.</p><p>While data alone cannot orient us, it can help to reveal new possibilities and trajectories. Yet, data only realises its potential as a coordinative aid if it is able to flow freely through our digital territories. Practices of data sharing are important — surely — but data must also be capable of transmutation; of undergoing a kind of alchemical process of reconfiguration and recombination in the midst of varying contexts. This conception regards data — or information — as a living process rather than a static object or resource. Data is made more contextually relevant when the logics and infrastructure we employ to generate, channel and transform data support these kinds of evolutionary dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this series of posts and the technical interventions described, we are seeking to understand and embody this conception of data as a living process, and to articulate interventions intended to help unlock data toward greater service to life. In other words, like many in the Holochain ecosystem, we are endeavouring to engage in data commoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we will introduce the technical stack for a data commons, discussing data collection, discovery, and analysis; considering distributed computing and large language models; and proposing an algorithm library for analytic tools. We then go on to discuss the social effects of narrative and to think about how data and sensemaking could be reframed to support a generative future. Finally, in part two of this article series we will dive deeper into knowledge graphs, so don’t forget to read that article as well.</p> The Data Commons Stack <p>The capacity for commoning derives in part from maintained symmetry in power dynamics preventing data from becoming a source of extraction, enclosure, and ultimately tragedy. Consider that, the moment we click 'send' or 'save', our tweets, notes, and messages are expedited to a remote data warehouse controlled by the respective platform provider. Here our data becomes a means by which platforms increase revenue and market dominance rather than as a means for collective sensemaking. The digital spaces where we gather, lauded as the 21st century ‘town squares’ are, in truth, more like vast feudal estates. The conversations occurring within are, in many respects, the property of our digital usurpers rather than the domain of public knowledge.</p><p>Yet we remain hopeful that these power asymmetries can be mitigated — even corrected — given the right cultural and technological conditions. We’ll begin by addressing the technological dimension and speak to the cultural dimension toward the end of this post.&nbsp;</p> Layer Zero <p>Agent-centric, peer-to-peer (P2P) frameworks like <a href="https://holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> support data commoning by providing certain assurances with respect to access, control, and provenance of the data we collectively generate. On the one hand, local-first storage affords us privacy and control with respect to our personal data whilst distributing and validating shared data among peers allows more flexible, selective means of data access. Here, data can be stewarded and evolved in a cooperative manner with reduced risk of extraction and exploitation. With these foundations, it becomes possible to support what we call 'generative information ecosystems': spaces in which information evolves toward greater complexity, relevance, and integration.&nbsp;</p><p>While Holochain's agent-centric architecture and data integrity mechanisms provide essential ingredients toward data sovereignty, it does not automatically grant the capability to discover and derive insights from data. Hence, an initial focus for our team at Arkology Studio is developing a suite of modules for data discovery and analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>For us, important sensemaking occurs in the context of our lived realities; human beings embedded in community and specific bioregions, rather than just the halls of academia and research laboratories.&nbsp;Hence, the hope is that the affordances of open, data-driven sensemaking tools can be matched with the orienting/decision-making capacities of grassroots organisations and communities attending to local challenges. By empowering local actors to share, discover, and draw insights from data, we may see connective tissues expand, and local solutions spread and adapt to new contexts.&nbsp;</p><p>The following diagram offers an initial high-level overview of a ‘data commons stack’, indicating the five functional categories or ‘layers’: collection, storage, discovery, analysis, and knowledge. </p>Figure 1: high-level systems overview of the ‘data commons’ stack<p>While the diagram above depicts a linear progression for illustrative simplicity, in actuality there exists a variety of feedback loops between the many subsystems. Note, for example, that published insights at the knowledge layer may themselves become data points in the data storage layer, to be included in later analyses (this unlocks, for example, interesting possibilities for narrative analysis, which we investigate in part two of this article series). Furthermore, there exists a feedback loop between our understanding of the world and our behaviour in the world. In other words, knowledge can engender change in material reality, which in turn may affect our understanding of said material reality. It is these sorts of feedback loops which reveal the complex, dynamical nature of a data commons and, if supported, enable it to adapt to evolving contexts.</p> Collection <p>Since data-driven sensemaking is impractical without a diversity of data, methods for channelling and/or exposing data from a multitude of sources is paramount. On the one hand, this involves developing standardised, consensual methods for data collection from applications, including IoT devices, traditional web apps, and other Holochain apps: what we term ‘data channels’. Data entering the ecosystem from the ‘outside’ (i.e beyond the data-sovereign membrane) is always mediated through an agent (e.g. a human or IoT device), who submits the contents along with a record containing metadata that can be recognised and validated by other agents (see <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain’s validation rules</a>). In other words, we record the provenance and context associated with any data point. Since other Holochain apps are already operating within their respective data-sovereign membrane, and self-host their own data, participants in those networks may reveal relevant data to the data commons ecosystem for query. As for storing all this data, Holochain already provides us with mechanisms for distributed data storage (see <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain’s DHT</a>), with capacity scaling linearly with the number of peers.&nbsp;</p> Discovery <p>With a data commons, one is presented with the challenge of effective data discovery. Since those who control the map control the territory, it is important to mitigate against monopolies on discovery mechanisms. Google’s search engine dominance engenders a kind of monoculture with respect to the very way we discover new information. Since search/discovery algorithms privilege certain data over others by design, it may be necessary to mitigate against algorithmic monopolies by encouraging a multiplicity of discovery services. Since the data commons is essentially a giant peer-to-peer (P2P) network composed of human and non-human agents, it may be useful to conceptualise these services as ‘personal agents’ who crawl the data commons on our behalf, surfacing data relevant to our needs. Imagine, for example, that you are undertaking interdisciplinary research on a controversial topic and are aware of potential biases. Here, you may be inclined to engage a search agent proficient at discovering diverse/divergent viewpoints. Furthermore, agents may operate on our behalf even when we are not actively engaged in search/discovery. For example, you may initiate an agent to notify you of regional climate events or the latest research results in cancer treatments. Since the way we acquire data is an essential step in data-driven sensemaking, it is important that we have the means to parameterize and personalise data discovery in accordance with our intentions and aspirations.</p> Analysis <p>One of the first and most exciting mechanisms for sense-making that becomes available to participants of the data commons can be conceived as similar to both <a href="https://openpds.media.mit.edu/?ref=blog.holochain.org">SafeAnswers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation?ref=blog.holochain.org">secure-multiparty computation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, ‘safe answers’ refers to the ability to perform computation on user data without revealing the raw data itself. The analyst is responsible for sending an inspectable analysis algorithm to the agent whose data is being processed for insight. This way, all computation is performed locally on the machines where the data is stored (the machine of the agent on a Holochain network). The analyst receives only the return of the algorithm and has no access to the raw data itself.&nbsp;</p><p>One can imagine the unlocking potential of this type of distributed computation when it comes to personal or sensitive data. This is demonstrated by an example pertaining to personal health data. On the one hand, it can be very useful to understand, say, the amount of people in a given area who are predisposed to cancer. The disposition may be informed by genetics, lifestyle, and other factors. In a traditional data relationship between an app user and a company stewarding their data, there is no assurance that the company will not use/sell their data in a compromising way, such as to an insurance firm that may increase the excesses to the user given their predisposition. By running an algorithm on the devices of the users who are being considered in the analysis, it becomes possible to undertake sensitive and important investigations without creating a honeypot of compromising data.&nbsp;</p> Algorithm Library&nbsp; <p>A library of datasets alone is necessary yet insufficient for effective sense-making. Tools are required to effectively traverse and distil the meanings and implications contained within the datasets in order for the data to affect meaningful change in the world. In order to unlock the agentic capacities of groups endeavouring to common around data towards data-driven sensemaking we are proposing a library of open-source algorithms aimed at crowd-sourcing data-science expertise in order to make data-driven sensemaking more accessible to less data-literate folk. By introducing algorithms into the data commons ecosystem, our intuition is that a data commons is not just informed by inert data points, but rather is the interaction of these data points and the actors that engage with them towards distilling an understanding of reality. In this way, it can be useful to think of this project as a praxis for data commoning, more than simply a 'data commons'.</p> Large Language Models <p>The speed of Large Language Model (LLM) development is overwhelming, with a multitude of new tools being released that are changing everything from education, to search engines, to AI assistants. Without dedicating too much of this text to this topic, it is important to indicate the possibilities for organisations and communities to develop specialised agents fine-tuned on the capacities of the data that they are commoning around. In some ways, a generative model trained on a given set of data is a codified narrative; an artificial agent acting on behalf of the semantic patterns that inform it.&nbsp;</p> Narrative Ecosystems &amp; Cultural Evolution <p>The transformative potential of a given technological ecosystem is <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/?ref=blog.holochain.org">limited by the values and ontologies</a> associated with the dominant cultural environment in which their activity is based. Hence, while we think tools that improve our capacities for sensemaking are important — especially when grounded in data-sovereign infrastructure like Holochain — they are not panaceas. Responding to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBoLVvoqVY&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">poly/metacrisis</a> requires a transformation of the dominant culture, not merely technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In light of this, Arkology Studio has been collaborating with <a href="https://culturehack.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Culture Hack Labs</a> to advance a set of tools for narrative research. For Culture Hack Labs, effective system change necessitates understanding the narrative forms and narrative ecologies that perpetuate social and ecological breakdown. Here, <a href="https://www.culturehack.io/curriculum/curriculum/introduction-to-narratives/module-2-introduction-to-narratives-2/?ref=blog.holochain.org">narratives can be understood</a> as “interpretive social structures that frame our experience and function to bring meaning to our everyday reality, guiding our actions and decisions.” In other words, one can transform culture by intervening at the level of narratives.&nbsp;</p><p>The narrative, ‘data as resource’, reflects the tendency of modern, industrialised societies to regard nature — including her living creatures and material output — as something to be exploited for human benefit (or, rather, for those with the means to exploit her first). Through this framing, data is something to accumulate (‘big data’), gatekeep (e.g. academic journals), and exploit (e.g. behaviour profiling to sell ads). Contrast this narrative with ‘data in service to life’ or ‘data as living process’, which invites us to consider data and its associated processes as a fundamentally cooperative dynamic.&nbsp;</p><p>In recognising the power of narratives to guide cultural evolution, we have begun to explore what meaningful narrative interventions could look like in the context of a data commons. In particular, what would it mean to meaningfully shift narrative ecosystems toward more life-affirming frames without necessarily prescribing, in a top-down manner, the frames themselves? Is it conceivable, in other words, that the very insights generated within a data commons might help steer society toward a more generative future?&nbsp;</p> What’s Next? <p>In part two of this series, we investigate this question through a speculative discussion on the ‘knowledge’ layer of the Data Commons Stack. Specifically, we explore how to represent knowledge in a manner that is pluralistic rather than homogenising, and how we may more readily perceive the influence and evolutionary potential of the narratives that live within and amongst us. We propose a toolkit that draws from the knowledge emerging out of cooperative communities and allows the construction of agent/community-centric knowledge graphs; networks of insights built upon a shared node library and structurally arranged to represent the epistemic geometries of their ontological framing.&nbsp;</p><p>Our inquiry also leads us into a discussion on knowledge discovery and the risks of epistemic pluralism; in particular, how we might use open discovery patterns and quantitative measures from Integrated Information Theory to move us toward more integrative frames.</p> Guest Authors <p>This guest post, the first of two articles on data commoning, was written by Ché Coelho and Ross Eyre of Arkology Studio.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arkology/about/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Arkology Studio</a> (‘architecture’ + ‘ecology’) is a transdisciplinary design and software engineering studio whose mission is to support the development of commons-oriented socio-technical interventions for systems change. </p>

<p>It’s becoming increasingly clear that standard password security is not an effective method for ensuring privacy and mitigating costly breaches. In fact, last year alone, it’s reported that over <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/privacy/password-statistics#:~:text=More%20than%2080%25%20of%20confirmed,(LastPass%2C%202021)">24 billion passwords</a> were exposed by hackers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As organizations look to adopt <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/passwordless.html">passwordless security solutions</a> that provide robust and accurate identity verification without frustrating users, QR code authentication is quickly growing in popularity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continue reading below as we explore QR code authentication as a passwordless security method and discuss how organizations can implement it. We will take a look at the advantages and challenges that can come from adopting QR code login and cover some of the possible use cases for this security method.</p>

			 Gonzalo García Arahuetes is a Back-End Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-garcia-arahuetes/">Gonzalo García Arahuetes</a>, and I was born in Segovia, Spain. I work as a Back-end Developer at Tokeny, although it would have been crazy for me to think of such a job some years ago, since my initial formation had nothing to do with computers. I started Law and Business Administration studies in Madrid but soon changed it for Humanities and moved to Barcelona for my master’s degree. Although I did a lot of research on Literature and Philosophy, I eventually started some courses on Digital Humanities, focused on database maintenance and data management, and this is how I became more and more curious about technology and its ethical and political implications. With that in mind, I started another master’s degree in Web Development and began to study the consequences of blockchain for economies and individuals.</p>
<p>I love keeping those two paths alive, as I regard them as complementary. While my professional career is devoted to web development and tech-related issues, I am still working on a Ph.D. thesis on Peter Sloterdijk’s early work, and I dedicate a great deal of my free time to books, writing, and research.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>I was working for a small start-up as a Full-Stack developer. One day, I saw a job offer from Tokeny for senior developers. I applied, specifying that I was not a senior at all but that I had plenty of curiosity for the blockchain world and was eager for an opportunity like this. Of course, I expected no response, but Luc himself, the CEO, replied! We had a very pleasant meeting, and he told me that all he wanted were ‘smart and motivated people.’ The process took some time because Tokeny was opening its Spanish office in Barcelona, but joining this team was the perfect decision for me.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Luc wanted a team of ‘smart and motivated people,’ and I think that is what he got! Working at Tokeny means sharing time and goals with some of the most fun, skilled, and professional people I have met. On top of that, it is a company committed to remote work, which makes life so much easier for all of us in terms of schedule and location. In a few words, I would say that Tokeny always considers the workers’ necessities in the first place.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life?  
<p>My family is at the top: my wife Yaos and my little Lila, who was born in June. Other than that, I am very passionate about many things: books, films, my guitars, my friends, cooking, sports… In this regard, being passionate about something reveals its ambiguity (for the word ‘passion’ has a very ancient origin, always related to suffering): I love all these things, but often, it is demanding to keep up with them and not end up frustrated or exhausted.</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I am rather cautious when it comes to making long-term plans for my life, not to mention having big dreams about changing the world. I always remember Walt Whitman’s beautiful verses: “The Earth, that is sufficient, I do not want the constellations any nearer, I know they are very well where they are, I know they suffice for those who belong to them.” In my opinion, being focused on big dreams and aims keeps us from noticing that sometimes we are just carried away. Knowing that the tide is dragging you may or may not make a better swimmer out of you, but at least you will take it easy and stop worrying about reaching a certain place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>My personal view is that we are on the verge of mass adoption for blockchain technology. Given that scenario, being part of a company so involved in the transformation of the entire financial industry is a thrilling and adventurous experience. There is so much yet to learn and to witness!</p>

<p><br>
Northern Block Product Update: Supporting Mote Credential Exchange Protocols and Credential Formats<br><br></p>
 
<p>We’re excited to announce that Northern Block products now support two credential exchange protocols – DIDComm/Aries-based protocol implementations and the newly added OpenID4VC. Additionally, we’ve expanded our support to three credential formats: AnonCreds, JWT, and JSON-LD.</p>
<p>As staunch advocates for open agent technology, which is crucial for digital wallets and achieving digital trust, we’ve consistently integrated DIDComm and various Aries-based implementations (such as ACA-Py, AFJ) into our products. The recent focus on the European Union’s Architectural Reference Framework (ARF) has highlighted the importance of the Open ID for verifiable credential specifications. We’ve embraced these specifications in response to feedback from issuers who appreciate the protocol’s simplicity and the widespread availability of OpenID/oAuth resources, making the issuance of verifiable credentials more streamlined.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide our customers with the flexibility to receive and store their preferred credential format via any protocol. We also strive to enable verifiers to accept a diverse range of credentials and protocols available in the market. Looking ahead, we plan to support the mobile driving license (mDL) standard.</p>
<p>Here’s what we now offer:</p>
 
 
 For Issuers: Our platform now allows issuers to use either DIDComm/Aries or our OpenID4VCI issuer to issue an AnonCred, JWT, or JSON-LD credentials. (Note: our issuance service allows users to issue AnonCreds and JSON-LD through DIDComm, and JSON-LD and JWT through OpenID4VCI) 
 For Holders: Customers using our wallet or wallet SDK can now receive and store in any of the three formats over DIDComm/Aries or OpenID4VC implementations. 
 For Verifiers: Our verifier customers can now consume credentials in their preferred combination of formats and protocols. (Note: our verifier toolkit allows for presentations of AnonCreds and JSON-LD over DIDComm, and JSON-LD and JWT over OpenID4VP) 
 
 
<p>We’re excited to see how these enhancements will empower our users and pave the way for more innovative uses of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Here’s a short video showcasing how our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet can now receive credentials from various protocols:<br><br></p>
 
 
    
 
 
<p><br>Contact us for a demo/conversation – or feel free to test it out yourself. We’re happy to chat with anyone 🙂 –&gt; info@northernblock.io</p>

Join this insightful conversation as they unpack the significance of 1Kosmos’ recent certification by the Kantara Initiative for the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. Watch now:<p></p>
  
<p></p>
 
 
 Robert MacDonald:<p></p>
 
<p>Hi, Rob MacDonald here, vice president of product marketing at 1Kosmos, and welcome to our vlog.</p>
<p>Today, I’ve got Huzefa with us, our co-founder and COO. How you doing today, Huzefa?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Very good, Robert. Very good to see you. It’s been a while.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>It has been a while. I guess the unfortunate thing of working remotely, we don’t get to see each other more often. But, welcome.</p>
<p>Today, we want to talk a little bit about one of our latest announcements. So we just announced a new certification by the Kantara Initiative and it’s for the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. So for those of you that know the acronym, that’s UK D-I-A-T-F. I know you had a lot to do with that so why don’t you tell me a little bit about what that framework, the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework is all about?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>No, absolutely. So the UK Digital Identity Attribute Trust Framework came into existence a few years back and it was a standard that has been designed by the UK government, primarily designed that’s just not for corporations, but for regular citizens where any time if you want to hire somebody, if you’re renting an individual or any kind of a background service they’re providing, which requires a user to be proofed, how do you do it based on standards?</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Okay, right.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>This is a very good development in general because traditionally we’ve all been used to the NIST standard here in the United States. I know it’s been more widely being adopted as well.</p>
<p>Now local governments are creating their own standard for identity proofing. Yeah. So we saw that, we said, you know, our friends at Kantara were the ones who were reviewing and approving vendors who wanted to sign up for the standards. So we went through that process and came through it.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. So are there specific specifications that we’re certified to against that framework?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yes. So there are specifications around how you would proof an individual, what are the different levels that would go with respect to it. And we have subscribed to a level which will require a user to scan one of their digital documents, take a live selfie, and prove that cryptographically that we have a secure credential for a specific user.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>And since UK, how do you make sure that you are keeping the data very secure on our end as well?</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Great. Fair enough. So what does that certification in general say about our platform?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>This is something that we have looked at it just from the inception of the company. Don’t just build technologies, but do it based on standards as well.</p>
<p>I believe our first certification that we signed up for was for the NIST 800-63-3. We are very much into the weeds of the revision four, which is coming out, too. We saw the UK standard that was developed and then we signed up for it. And I don’t want to peel the curtain a lot, but we are involved in a lot of new standards that are coming across the globe as well, right?</p>
<p>So at 1Kosmos, we want to prove that who the individual is behind the device. To do that, you have to effectively proof a user and you have to do that based on standards as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Fair enough. So we continue to add a lot of certifications to our list. We’ve got a whole webpage dedicated to it on our website. We’ve got corporate certifications like ISO and SOC 2. We’ve got product certifications like NIST, FIDO, and iBeta. What does this certification mean to us as an organization?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, we love certifications. We have a lot of time to go through the certifications.</p>
<p>I mean that’s important, right? It’s important because have different geographies, you want to make sure that those users understand that what we are providing, that this particular technology has been vetted, vetted by their local government based on their standards as well. So I think it’s extremely important, specifically in this case for the UK market, that we are providing a digital identity platform that has been proofed, verified and not just a set of capabilities that are available for them to use.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Fair enough. And that kind of leads into my next question. It is probably more important than the last, but what do these certifications mean to our partners? What does it mean to our customers and even future partners and customers of 1Kosmos?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So anybody, so I’m talking specifically with respect to the UK certification that we have, right? If you are an entity in UK, especially if you are in the public service area, and if you have citizens that need to be proofed or even if you’re in the private sector and you are looking to hire individuals and you want to do that based on a company that is subscribing to these standards, a company that can prove those individual users and securely have them provide access to whatever service that they would like, they can sign up with us.</p>
<p>And what we would then allow to do is these individuals have been proved, have been verified based on this particular standard, this is a result of what the proofing is, we would then provide it to that particular service as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Cool. So what is it about our platform that enables us to meet these seemingly pretty stringent guidelines in your opinion?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>I would say that our platform has been very, very modular, right? So anybody who’s new to this particular podcast, we provide a set of different capabilities, identity proofing, using that particular identity to give secure access to a variety of different systems by using user’s biometrics. And the third aspect of it is to create a digital identity wallet, which will allow a user to be in control of their identity and share their attributes to whatever service that they would like.</p>
<p>What this has allowed us to do is that every specific capability, we have pretty modular where if there are certain standards, if there are certain capabilities that we need to prescribe to, it’s fairly easy for us to make that available as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Cool. Okay. So thank you for all that, by the way.</p>
<p>What’s next for 1Kosmos? I mean, like I said earlier, we kind of touched on it briefly, some of the other certifications we have, but what’s next in line for us?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>More certifications.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Continue to update the website, Rob, okay.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>We’re going through FedRAMP right now. Hopefully we will go through that process fairly soon.</p>
<p>I alluded to this earlier, but there are more government-based standards that are coming up and we are looking to prescribe to that. We are looking to get certified against them as well, not just in US and North America or in UK, but we’re talking about Asia and other parts of Europe as well. So just stay tuned, right? These are developments that are happening and we’ll be looking forward to announce them soon.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. Listen, Huzefa, thank you for taking the time to talk to us about the certification today. This is pretty awesome news and I look forward to talking to you about the next one.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Wonderful. Good catching up with you as well, Rob. Thanks.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Talk to you again.</p>

				  Indicio’s Digital Travel Credential streamlines identity verification at border crossing points for a faster and more secure journey.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>Never would I have thought I’d use the word ‘beautiful’ to describe my experience passing through immigration when traveling internationally, but that’s exactly how it felt last week in Aruba. The reason? <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-301989815.html">Aruba’s Happy One Pass (AHOP).</a> I was able to walk through border control without having to take my passport out of my pocket. It was so quick and smooth that I didn’t realize it happened.</p>
<p>With this system, you can actually go from the airplane to the beach in just 30 minutes, completely transforming the typical airport and arrival experience. And lucky travelers to Aruba will begin using the same technology to enter and depart the island nation in March 2024. This is not a federated system that sends information to other third parties and is held by others. Travelers hold their digital passport data just like they hold their physical passports — and there is full consent for data sharing at each step of the process.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. Every traveler must apply for an Embarkation Debarkation card (ED card) to enter Aruba. The night before flying to Aruba, I downloaded the AHOP app on my personal mobile phone using a special invitation sent by the Government of Aruba. Then I used my mobile phone camera to scan my passport and the RFID scanner to collect the information from the chip inside, allowing me to create a Digital Travel Credential (DTC). After taking a selfie, my face was matched and liveness was checked to ensure the passport was actually mine. Then, I sent my DTC, directly to the government of Aruba during my ED Card application process. They used my biometrics and personal information to process my application and send me my approved digital ED card. In other words, the Government of Aruba was able to check my passport and clear me for arrival all while I sat on my couch.</p>
<p>The next day when I landed in Aruba, instead of standing in a long line in the immigration terminal to get my paper documents and passports visually inspected, I headed toward the “AHOP” line, where I was presented with a camera that took my photo. Within seconds, the system had matched my face with the photo I’d sent the night before, verified my immigration status, showed the security officer the match, the green light flashed and I went on my way. It was the easiest immigration system I’d ever encountered.</p>
<p>In adopting this technology, Aruba isn’t just positioning itself as a global leader in digital travel, it is extending the seamless digital experience to everything a tourist might need or want when they visit the island, from hotel check in to booking activities with approved tour operators.</p>
<p>This seamless approach to guest services fully aligns with consumer expectations that anything and everything digital should be quick, contactless, and frictionless. The bonus with the technology used by Aruba is that it does all this while providing travelers with state-of-the-art data privacy and protection.</p>
<p>While this technology will change the experience of travel and tourism, the underlying technological accomplishment — the ability to verify the source of any data and that the data hasn’t been altered — will transform every facet of digital interaction across every sector.</p>
<p>AHOP is a milestone for Indicio, its partner in the air travel sector, SITA, and Aruba. Next stop, the world.</p>

<p>Ensuring the safety of sensitive data and privacy shifts from just a priority to an absolute necessity. Authentication, the gatekeeper of these digital resources, is crucial in this fight against cybercrime.&nbsp; In this article, you will learn what it is, why it’s helpful, how it differs from other types of authentication, and how you could implement it in your organization.</p>
 What is Step-Up Authentication? 
<p>Step Up Authentication is a dynamic form of multi-factor authentication. It works by adjusting the level of security and user verification based on the associated risk of a specific action, transaction, or mobile account.</p>
<p>Different triggers can prompt Step Up Authentication’s activation, like irregular user behavior, access requests from unfamiliar locations or devices, or high-risk transactions accessing sensitive data. Users may initially authenticate via traditional methods (username/password), but Step Up Authentication comes into play as the perceived risk escalates, demanding additional login credentials.</p>
<p>Step Up Authentication uses a hierarchical model adaptive authentication scheme, scaling from simple to complex; it provides the flexibility to apply the optimal level of security based on the perceived threat or the user’s risk profile.</p>
 The Anatomy of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes operation of Step Up Authentication is a balance between risk assessment and corresponding adjustments to the step up authentication work up level. Each transaction or request initiates a process where the system evaluates the risk level and prompts the user for a related step up authentication.</p>
<p>To make these decisions, the system utilizes various risk assessment metrics. These include factors such as the sensitivity of the requested data, the location of the user’s location request, the behavior of the user, and even the time of the request.</p>
<p>Policy management plays a big role here, as it sets the rules and parameters for when and how the system should step up the authentication process. These policies, dictated by the nature of the business and its unique security requirements, ensure that the system remains secure and user-friendly.</p>
 The Evolution of Authentication 
<p>The progression of authentication techniques paints an interesting picture of human ingenuity in the face of evolving threats. Beginning with the humble password, these techniques have developed in response to escalating risks and more sophisticated threat actors.</p>
<p>The initial stage was dominated by password-based authentication systems, a straightforward and user-friendly method, yet not without its weaknesses. Passwords, being susceptible to breaches via techniques like brute-force attacks and phishing, necessitated a more robust system.</p>
<p>Subsequently, security tokens emerged as a new layer of protection. Yet, their physical nature introduced inconvenience and added risk of loss or theft. Later, the advent of biometric authentication marked a significant stride forward against identity theft, tying access to unique human characteristics such as fingerprints or retinal patterns.</p>
<p>The most significant leap in this evolutionary process was the introduction of multi-factor authentication, combining multiple layers of security to create a formidable barrier to unauthorized access to sensitive information.<br>

</p><p>While both Step-Up Authentication,&nbsp; Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Adaptive Authentication serve the goal of improved security, they differ significantly in their approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MFA  involves presenting two or more independent credentials at every step up authentication vs. event. This could include something the user knows (password), something the user has (token), or something the user is (biometrics). MFA’s strength lies in its layered defense, using multiple authentication factors and making it challenging for unauthorized users to gain access even if they compromise one aspect.</p>
<p>Adaptive Authentication employs real-time risk assessments, considering many factors such as device reputation, IP reputation, geolocation, and behavior anomalies. Based on these assessments, Adaptive Authentication may permit, or deny authentication apps, or step up the authentication process.</p>
<p>Step-Up Authentication adjusts its various authentication factors and requirements based on the perceived risk level of a transaction or request. It might begin with a simple or two-factor authentication, such as a password, and add more layers as risk escalates. It offers the flexibility of user-friendly authentication for low-risk actions and robust security for higher-risk operations.</p>
 Viewing vs. Editing Data 
<p>One of the significant features of Step-Up Authentication is its ability to adapt to the nature of the user’s actions. For instance, when a user views data, the authentication process might require only the user’s password or a simple username and password in/password combination. This allows users to perform low-risk actions with minimal friction.</p>
<p>However, when the same user attempts to edit or export sensitive data, the system recognizes the higher risk and steps up the authentication process. This could involve using additional authentication credentials, such as a one-time password, biometric verification, or answering security questions. This dynamic response to requires users based on the action type underlines the adaptability and intelligence of Step-Up Authentication.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication in Practice 
<p>In practice, you’ll encounter Step Up Authentication in different scenarios, Financial institutions often apply it during high-value transactions. Cloud services employ it when users request access to susceptible information. It’s becoming increasingly ubiquitous across digital platforms, from email services to social media networks.</p>
<p>Sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and corporate entities, utilize Step Up Authentication as an essential tool in their security arsenal. It is increasingly recognized as a powerful means to secure sensitive data, protect user identities and stolen credentials, and maintain system integrity.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication Use Cases 
<p>Step-Up Authentication is not just a theory but a reality with practical applications across various digital platforms. For example, take a standard action like transferring funds from a banking app. Users might log in to the app using a username/password or biometric authentication. However, when the user initiates a high-value transfer, the system might request additional identity verification as a one-time password (OTP) sent to the user’s registered mobile number or email.</p>
<p>Another use case can be found within corporate systems; an employee may be able to access common, low-sensitivity resources using a simple password. Still, when attempting to access further sensitive resources, more sensitive information, or administrative controls, the system prompts them to undergo further authentication, such as answering security questions or presenting a physical token.</p>
 The Strengths of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>By assessing its impact, the merits of Step Up Authentication become abundantly clear. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to bolster security, creating a robust defense against a wide array of cyber threats.</p>
<p>But its benefits extend beyond security; it contributes significantly to improving user experience, as the need for rigorous additional authentication factors and measures only arises under elevated risk conditions. This reduces friction and potential frustration in day-to-day user interactions.</p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, Step Up Authentication also aids in meeting regulatory requirements for data breach protection. Moreover, it has become a potent tool in the risk management arsenal, offering an adaptive and responsive approach to data breaches and threat mitigation.</p>
 Pitfalls and Proactive Measures 
<p>Like any system, Step Up Authentication has its potential pitfalls. These include technical implementation challenges, user acceptance, and the ever-present struggle to balance security with ease of use. However, with a strategic approach, these obstacles can be navigated effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proactive problem-solving measures, such as comprehensive user education programs, policy optimization, and ongoing system monitoring and updating, are key to addressing these challenges.&nbsp;</p>
 Security Implications and Concerns in Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Though a significant security improvement, step-Up Authentication has potential risks and vulnerabilities. Understanding these security implications and how they can be mitigated is essential to ensure robust protection against cyber threats.</p>
<p>One potential concern is user acceptance and cooperation. Given its nature, users may need clarification on the changing requirements for authentication. This issue is not just a usability concern but also a security concern, as user non-compliance or bypass attempts can introduce vulnerabilities into the system.</p>
<p>Another concern revolves around the accuracy of risk assessment. The effectiveness of Step-Up Authentication depends primarily on correctly identifying and responding to potential risks. Inaccurate risk assessments can lead to security breaches if high-risk actions are not identified correctly and high-risk resources don’t trigger a step-up in authentication.</p>
<p>The additional security measures used in Step-Up Authentication, like biometrics or security questions, bring potential vulnerabilities. For instance, biometric data can be spoofed, and security questions can often be guessed or discovered through social engineering.</p>
 Mitigation Practices for Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Mitigating these concerns involves several strategies:</p>
 
 Clear communication about how the system works and its necessity can be beneficial to increase user acceptance.&nbsp; 
 User training can also help ensure that users understand the authentication requirements. 
 Refinement of the risk assessment algorithm and learning from past mistakes are critical for improving risk assessment accuracy.&nbsp; 
 Regular auditing and testing can help identify potential weaknesses in the risk assessment process. 
 
<p>As for the vulnerabilities related to additional security measures, it is key to ensure these are implemented with their own security best practices. For instance, biometric data should be stored securely, and liveness detection tools, like <a>BlockID,</a> should be used to prevent spoofing.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Within an organization, inactive user accounts can persist for various reasons, including former employees, service providers, and service accounts associated with products or services. These accounts may remain inactive temporarily or for extended periods. If an account remains inactive for 90 days or more, it is more likely to remain inactive. It’s crucial to periodically review these inactive accounts and eliminate any that are unnecessary. Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews now offers the capability to detect inactive accounts effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Entra ID Governance Access Review feature, it’s possible to identify accounts that have not been actively used to sign into Entra ID, either interactively or non-interactively, for up to 720 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accounts that are left inactive are susceptible to being targeted by cybercriminals for several reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inactive accounts may still use well-known passwords or credentials that have been compromised.&nbsp; 
 Inactive accounts are less likely to have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.&nbsp; 
 Due to their inactivity, these accounts may go unnoticed by advanced security controls in place.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While organizations with a formal JML (Joiners, Movers, and Leavers) process in place can mitigate some of these risks, regular reviews are still essential to ensure that security measures are effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding the standards for monitoring accounts&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-navigator">CIS Control V8 Safe guard 5.3</a> it’s recommended to delete or disable any dormant accounts after a period of 45 days of inactivity, where supported. This is also aligned with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-privileged-access#pa-4-review-and-reconcile-user-access-regularly">Azure Security Benchmark v3 PA-4 Control</a> - Review and reconcile user access regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yuting and Nico are the founders of ZKorum. Yuting earned her Bachelor's degree at NYU Abu Dhabi and her Master's at ESSEC Business School. Nico is a Software Engineer and previously worked on projects that utilized Filecoin. </p><p>Nico is passionate about self-sovereign identity, and when he and Yuting joined forces, they started building this vision of a social network that runs on verifiable and anonymous data. </p><p>They both recognized a big problem with social media today. It's incredibly invasive and full of bots, scams, and disinformation. We cannot trust anyone online, and we have no way to prove that we are who we say we are unless we trust a third party to verify our identities. For example, some apps require you to verify your identity by uploading your ID. But this is very invasive. </p><p>Furthermore, our personal information is being collected and sold online every day by data brokers. In fact, the global data broker market was valued at <a href="https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/report/global-data-broker-market#:~:text=The%20global%20data%20broker%20market,US%24545.431%20billion%20in%202028.">$319 billion</a> in 2021. According to the <a href="https://epic.org/issues/consumer-privacy/data-brokers/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a>, data brokers collect and aggregate numerous types of personal information, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, gender, age, marital status, children, education, profession, income, political preferences, cars, and real estate owned. </p><p>Is there a better solution? How can we verify ourselves without trusting the third-party verifier and keeping our personal information safe?</p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs! A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method or protocol used to demonstrate the authenticity of a statement or the possession of certain knowledge without revealing the actual information or knowledge itself. </p><p>Currently, ZKorum uses zero-knowledge proofs by acting as both the issuer and the verifier of Verifiable Credentials. Most large organizations already own a domain name and distribute unique email addresses to their members. Using this infrastructure, ZKorum can issue the user corresponding Verifiable Credentials, such as "female employee of XYZ Company." In this way, the user can prove her eligibility without revealing any unique identifier. ZKorum's closed-source competitors also rely on email addresses to verify that users indeed belong to those companies, but by being 100% open-source, ZKorum minimizes the trust that users need to put in them. In other words, "Don't trust, verify." Even in the event of a security breach, data would already be anonymized and unlikable to user profiles. &nbsp;</p> ZKorum as a Social Site <p>Yuting and Nico wanted to build an online forum where communities and verified members could create and participate in anonymous polls, surveys, discussions, and votes - a progressive web app where anyone can browse the existing public surveys and view their results.</p>Example Poll (Source: ZKorum)<p>ZKorum strives to create a safe and inclusive space where everyone feels secure and comfortable sharing their experiences and exchanging opinions without fearing backlash. That is why privacy-preserving technology is so important!</p> How is ZKorum using Fission Tech? <p>ZKorum is using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> for passwordless authentication between the client and the server. Since ZKorum took a DID-centric authentication approach using a wallet, they needed cryptographic keys.</p><p>However, ZKorum innovated even further by taking the security and seamlessness of UCAN authentication and combining it with the ease of use of email address verification. A one-time code is used to register a new user and their device, and then every request is signed using the device’s DID. Currently, ZKorum is utilizing the WebCrypto API to store cryptographic secrets in the browser, but eventually, it will switch to passkeys. ZKorum opted to hide the UCAN authentication behind the email address login flow because users are used to it, and they did want to overwhelm folks with technical jargon or multiple steps. ZKorum's end users are not expected to be highly technical users. They might be, but there is no assumption there. The idea is that anyone who can answer surveys on a computer will be able to understand how to use the ZKorum web app.</p> Future Plans <p>Yuting and Nico see ZKorum as a powerful way to protect people's privacy by separating a user's profile from their actions, also known as unlinkability. They want to build an open-source library providing this core feature of unlinkability, making it available for other developers to use across different products of their own.</p><p>ZKorum also actively provides feedback to the EU regulators and builders working on the EU ID Wallet. ZKorum aims to be compatible with official Verifiable Credentials, such as the European Digital Identity.</p><p>Yuting and Nico are also working with the Master's Program at ESSEC Business School in France to issue Verifiable Credentials, which would be a novel way to engage the student body and gather their opinion.</p> <p>If you want to learn more about Zkorum, please visit their <a href="https://zkorum.notion.site/9c3e955c69204a2a82d23dd2e2621a30?v=1d312aa5f20b43a09f95a94ca98b75ac">website</a>.</p>

A 3-way points tie for 3rd place brought 5 participants to the podium in this data challenge. Overview <p>This data challenge leaped into the fascinating world of automobile reviews with the “AutoInsight Challenge.” This challenge invited participants to delve deep into Doug DeMuro’s car review score. Here data scientists could explore, analyze, and uncover the data’s myriad stories and insights directly from Doug’s scoring metrics. Participants were able to navigate various aspects of the car reviews, from understanding correlations between different scoring categories to exploring how these scores might influence car prices. This data challenge received the most amount of submissions to date in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges">Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Program</a> and as a result, this experiment produced some of the highest-quality reports recorded to date. Enough high-quality reports to grant a 3-way tie for a 3rd-place finish on the&nbsp;podium.</p><p>The dataset, pulled from <a href="https://www.dougdemuro.com/">https://www.dougdemuro.com/</a> comprises 585 car reviews, revealing a balanced representation between weekend and daily scores across 80 car&nbsp;brands.</p> Objectives <p>The challenge embraced several data analysis dimensions: from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to insightful data visualization and predictive modeling. Participants unraveled the data, made it clean and coherent for analysis then subsequently explored it to uncover insights, correlations, and patterns within the data. The key purpose for participants in this challenge was to Submit a comprehensive report synthesizing their findings from the data analysis in a format that is accessible and engaging for a non-technical audience, such as car enthusiasts or prospective car buyers; or even Doug DeMuro&nbsp;himself.</p><p>The winning reports for this challenge are as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st place — Luca Ordronneau <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:8883bc816cea8651382e83caa1193a1c7ac3fbe7ef0ad4abaca3415c21d2677b">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:8883bc816cea8651382e83caa1193a1c7ac3fbe7ef0ad4abaca3415c21d2677b</a></p><p>Due to an emphasis on the business readiness objective of this challenge and reporting structure, the review committee agreed that the report entered by Luca Ordronneau included the most precise, clean, and thorough information about the data and challenge at hand. Luca’s report efficiently demonstrated relationship analysis in the data, a complete understanding of the dataset, and business-ready formatting in this winning&nbsp;entry.</p><p>A snippet above shows a slide from Luca’s report that tells an audience the top 20 cars with the highest Doug score. Further data organization leads readers to learn that Doug often favors German vehicles, and as the year of the car model increases, so does the average score that Doug gives to the given car make &amp;&nbsp;model.</p> 2nd Place — FonkMasterFlexr <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:858bb213650fe33e086560e7743c52ff2ba37817a8678dad5ca1c43cc26c4141">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:858bb213650fe33e086560e7743c52ff2ba37817a8678dad5ca1c43cc26c4141</a></p><p>The 2nd place finish in this challenge includes a high-speed and high-impact approach to navigating through Doug’s car scores. FonkMasterFlexr, in this exercise, displayed great execution in delivering clear-cut and direct findings from the dataset and recommendations to prospective luxury car buyers whilst leveraging data science&nbsp;tools.</p><p>The above shares a snippet from FonkMasterFlexr report: here the Fonk Master shows readers a dual nature between the weekend score and daily score. If you know Doug’s brand and channel, you know there are different sides to not only the personalities of weekday and weekend vibes of classic cars but also the personalities of the people driving said&nbsp;cars.</p><p>This data challenge received a record-high 18 qualifying submissions. After scoring and review, the calculations for podium finishes and prizes resulted in a 3-way tie for 3rd place. To accompany so many high-value reports, the Ocean Data Challenge team approved allowing all 5 submissions to enter the podium finish. The 3-way tie for 3rd place includes the following:</p> 3rd — Haumea <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:969d503eb93dbe852748159ce9422f3eb99670f02bf80ad6432e1f20973730ad">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:969d503eb93dbe852748159ce9422f3eb99670f02bf80ad6432e1f20973730ad</a></p><p>The report “The World of Cars through Doug DeMuro’s Eyes” by Haumea analyzes Doug DeMuro’s car review dataset to understand how various factors influence a car’s overall rating. Relevant findings include a negative correlation between Practicality and Fun Factor, with Practicality scoring negatively influencing the overall DougScore, and a strong positive correlation between Acceleration and Handling, suggesting sportier cars excel in both, though at a cost to Comfort, especially for cars with Acceleration ratings above 6. The report also identifies a weak correlation between Styling and Quality, indicating that a car’s aesthetic appeal doesn’t always match its build&nbsp;quality.</p><p>The analysis shows that sport-oriented brands like Lamborghini and Ferrari typically score higher on Weekend Scores, while family-oriented brands like Lexus and Hyundai excel in Daily Scores. The study also reveals non-linear relationships and interaction effects between scoring components, such as high Acceleration and Handling scores disproportionately boosting the overall DougScore, while improvements in Styling or Comfort have diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds. The report’s insights provide a nuanced understanding of Doug DeMuro’s scoring system and offer valuable perspectives for automotive industry professionals and car&nbsp;buyers.</p> 3rd — Nicolas&nbsp;Landry <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:b1eee66c360e73b45844689f05614260bf3e285748fe57d2f9d53a6fbcb4ebad">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:b1eee66c360e73b45844689f05614260bf3e285748fe57d2f9d53a6fbcb4ebad</a></p><p>A standout finding is a negative correlation between Practicality and Fun Factor, with vehicles like the Rivian R1T and GMC Hummer EV Pickup ranking high in these categories, but Value remains a distinctly independent factor. The analysis also uncovers a strong positive correlation between Handling and Acceleration, indicating that cars that accelerate faster generally handle better. However, this comes at the expense of Comfort, especially for cars with an acceleration rating above&nbsp;6.</p>The image above shows a heat map of interaction effects found between DougScore indicators.<p>Further, the report explores the nuanced relationship between Styling, Quality, and Cool Factor, with a subtle positive correlation between Styling and Cool Factor, but a weak negative correlation with Quality. Brand-wise, sports brands like Lamborghini, McLaren, and Ferrari focus on Weekend Scores, contrasting with family-oriented brands like Lexus and Hyundai, which excel in Daily Scores. The report is insightful for its exploration of how different scoring components interact, particularly highlighting the disproportionate impact of high acceleration and handling scores on the overall DougScore and the diminishing returns in areas like styling or comfort beyond certain thresholds. This comprehensive analysis offers valuable perspectives for both the automotive industry and potential car buyers, dissecting the nuances that make a car stand out in Doug DeMuro’s&nbsp;reviews.</p> 3rd — Philip&nbsp;Roman <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0cf0fbd28a359ce8ff06c5f1bab47f2e70a4e25f6e0c51fd7dd110890fec04b3">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0cf0fbd28a359ce8ff06c5f1bab47f2e70a4e25f6e0c51fd7dd110890fec04b3</a></p><p>Key findings in this 3rd place tying report include strong correlations between score categories, such as the negative correlation between Fun Factor and Practicality, and the positive correlation between Acceleration and Handling. It reveals the interaction effects of score components and their non-linear influence on the final DougScore. The report also explores relationships between car origins and scores, indicating higher average DougScores for cars from Germany, Italy, and the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>Notably, this report uncovered diminishing returns in the DougScore for cars with very high ratings in specific categories. Overall, the report highlights the complexity of the DougScore, emphasizing the importance of a balanced car profile in achieving high&nbsp;ratings.</p>Here Philips report compares fun factor and practicability scores.

<p>In a previous blog we introduced <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/digital-certificate-linting/">Digital Certificate Linting</a>. It is interesting how certification authorities (CAs) have deployed certificate linting of public trust certificates without policy requirements from the browsers or the CA/Browser Forum. Linting does not need to be mandated as it naturally helps CAs to be compliant by limiting certificate miss-issuance. This also increases customer service as certificates do not need to be revoked and reissued.</p>
<p>Over a number of years, Entrust has slowly deployed linting. Our first goal was to ensure the linters were not developed by the same team which developed our products. The thought was to minimize the duplication of errors in the policy software and the linting software. We focused on using third party linters for TLS certificates such as cablint and <a href="https://github.com/zmap/zlint">zlint</a>.</p>
<p>Entrust first ran linting against all of our active TLS certificates to find issues and remove errors. We ran post-issuance linting to detect errors, which do not interfere with certificate issuance. When we were happy with the results, we implemented pre-issuance linting.</p>
<p>With pre-issuance linting, if there is a linting error detected a certificate should not be issued. When a pre-certificate is issued for certificate transparency (CT) logging, then the pre-certificate with a linting error will be revoked. The goal of pre-issuance linting is to not miss-issue certificates and provide the details of the error to the team in order to correct the issue.</p>
<p>Although the public certificate linters were designed for TLS certificates, we expanded post-issuance linting to all certificate types. This was done first by only using the non-TLS components of the linters, plus adding other specific components. For each issuing CA, we created a certificate profile, which the CA could issue. This would separate each CA to its certificate type and would narrow down the CA scope to its key usage, extended key usage, permitted key size, hash algorithm, certificate policy, CRL link, etc. We also added in weak key checking, CT logging requirements, and ensured the subject name met the requirements which were validated.</p>
<p>Certificate linting can support the three per cent self-audit requirement from the CA/Browser Forum baseline requirement documents. In fact, since linting is done in an automated fashion, it can be extended to 100 per cent of the certificates. The result is the most extensive and non-subjective self-audit methodology, which may be the primary source of detecting certificate miss-issuance. In the case where a CA miss-issues a certificate which is not detected by linting, the CA may consider updating the linting software to better detect the error in the future. In addition, the linting results and actions can also be provided to the compliance auditor, which shows extensive monitoring and actions when an error is detected.</p>
<p>All CAs issuing publicly trusted certificates should consider certificate linting. Also, CAs which perform linting, but have miss-issued certificates should consider whether linting can be updated to detect the error in the future. Updates to shared linting software will reduce the risk to browser users and the inconvenience to secure server operators.</p>

 ForgeRock Product Capabilities 

<p>ForgeRock Access Management capabilities come together seamlessly through identity administration and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">access orchestration</a>.</p>
	
<p>ForgeRock's identity administration capabilities help our customers connect and manage their identity data in ways that align with their business objectives. For example, our customers can create organizational hierarchies that represent the reality of their specific customers, brands, partners, suppliers, and more. Next, customers can create relationships between users and organizations to best manage different experience and security requirements for each different user population. At runtime, this data is provided as an input to the orchestration flow, which delivers personalized user journeys based on the dynamic data inputs — all from a single platform.</p>
	
<p>Recent <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> enhancements noted by Gartner include:</p>

  <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">New signals for threat detection</a>: Our AI/ML-powered big data architecture ingests data from various sources and converts that data into signals, giving customers fine-grained control over how the signals are weighted for risk, synthesized, and interpreted. Out-of-the-box signals detect anomalous user behavior, suspicious IP addresses, credential stuffing and brute-force attacks, impossible traveler scenarios, and bots. We are bringing rich signals and prevention from the endpoint to the application and building practical features around those signals to ensure they are explainable and usable in real-world scenarios. 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration/capabilities">New flows and connectors to orchestration trees</a>: Intelligent Access (“Trees”) gives customers ultimate control of their user identity experiences through the use of low-code orchestrated identity journeys. We continue to evolve this capability, providing new journeys and nodes (the building blocks of journeys) for common use cases. We also have extended our cloud solution to include Trust Network marketplace nodes for common partner integrations. 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">Passkeys compatibility</a>: We have always been a leader in the passwordless space with early adoption and support of FIDO standards, including WebAuthn. This year, we added support for passkeys, further strengthening our ability to support CIAM and workforce use cases looking to go truly passwordless. 
  ForgeRock and Ping Identity: A Winning Combination 

<p>As we look into the next year, the combination of ForgeRock and Ping Identity will drive further innovation and greater customer value in the access management space. I believe having a unified vision and strategy is a winning combination for customers seeking the best solutions for their often complex needs — and our collective team has years of expertise and diverse backgrounds to help on that journey.</p>

<p>To learn more about the access management market, I'd encourage you to read this latest version of the Gartner Magic Quadrant and check Ping Identity's positioning. I believe analysis by Gartner can help you select a partner that can support your enterprise's need for a modern access management solution.</p>

<p>In the digital age, the symbiotic relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity is undeniable. As AI technologies advance, so do the methods and tactics employed by malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. The intersection of AI and cybersecurity creates a dynamic landscape where innovation and risk coexist. As AI becomes increasingly embedded at every level of our daily lives, it’s important to understand not just the risks from AI, but also the risks to AI.</p>
 Identifying the Threats 
<p>Let’s start with one of the most direct threats to AI, which is what is commonly referred to as data poisoning – the idea of corrupting the data that the AI model learns from. These alterations are strategically crafted to manipulate the behavior of the AI system, causing them to produce unintended outputs or become biased. This could lead to several threats, including propagation of false information, generation of malicious content such as spam, phishing emails, and even flawed code. Data-poisoning attacks can have dire and harmful consequences. For instance, an image recognition system might misclassify a stop sign as a yield sign in real-world applications like autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Even if not directly and deliberately poisoned, it’s also important to consider what data a given AI platform is being trained on. At the moment, there is something of a free-for-all when it comes to scraping data for input for many of the popular generative AI platforms and other large language models. This is undergoing something of a backlash, both technological and legal. Where an AI application gets the data it learns from has implications for bias and hallucination, but also potentially opens the door for proprietary information getting out.</p>
<p>On a related note, with so many vendors trying to jump on the proverbial AI bandwagon and add AI capabilities to their applications, it’s right to be concerned about the levels of robust design, learning, and testing being implemented in the rush. This is a complex domain and is rapidly becoming not just a new tool but also a new attack surface.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ethical implications of AI pose a unique set of cybersecurity challenges. Issues such as biased algorithms and the misuse of AI for malicious purposes raise concerns about the potential for discrimination and privacy violations. Cybersecurity measures must not only focus on protecting AI systems from external threats but also address internal risks related to the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.</p>
 Mitigating Risks 
<p>A bit like Isaac Asimov’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">three laws of robotics</a>, we have the three Hs to manage the potential risks due to advanced AI systems – to be Helpful, Harmless, and Honest. For an enterprise looking to implement business, security, or automation AI-enhanced tools within their business, this boils down to asking where, in all of the interactions with the AI tool, can verification steps be added and what assurances can the vendor provide.</p>
<p>To mitigate these cybersecurity threats, organizations must adopt a multi-faceted approach based in the same core principles of Zero Trust, treating output from AIs as “Never Trust, Always Verify.” Establishing standardized best practices, sharing threat intelligence, and fostering an environment of continuous learning are essential components of a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem. Additionally, robust encryption and authentication mechanisms are essential to secure the communication channels between AI systems and prevent unauthorized access. Regular audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to identify and address potential weaknesses in AI infrastructure.</p>
<p>When it comes to managing the ethics side, collaboration between the cybersecurity community, industry stakeholders, and policymakers is crucial to developing and implementing effective strategies against AI-related threats.</p>
<p>As AI continues to revolutionize industries and reshape the technological landscape, the importance of safeguarding these powerful systems from cybersecurity threats cannot be overstated. By maintaining core development principles and fostering collaboration, we can navigate the nexus of AI and cybersecurity to harness the full potential of artificial intelligence while minimizing the associated risks.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The European Digital Identity (EUDI), a cornerstone of the eIDAS regulation, represents a cross-border digital identity initiative set to revolutionise electronic identification in the EU. Available to all EU citizens, residents, and organisations, EUDI is designed to offer a unified, secure, and efficient method for online identity verification. Central to its functionality is the innovative EUDI Wallet, a sophisticated platform for electronic identification that digitally encapsulates individual identities. This wallet integrates various attributes and credentials, ensuring they are stored and managed with utmost security and respect for privacy. As an integral part of the EU digital identity and trust services framework, EUDI extends beyond the wallet, offering a comprehensive solution for digital identity management across the European Union.</p>
 Why is EUDI Needed? 
<p>Although the majority of countries within the EU have some form of national digital identity solution or eID, only 60% of citizens from 14 member states are able to use their eID in another state (cross-border). That leaves over 150 million people in the EU alone without access to strong cross-border authentication, and with only 14% of public service providers allowing cross-border authentication. Yet, 63% of EU citizens want a single eID for online services across the EU according to the Eurobarometer survey (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU Commission</a>). The EUDI will provide an EU-wide digital identity that will allow for cross-border trust service usage.</p>
 Key features of EUDI 
 User-Centric Control: 
<p>At the heart of the EUDI’s design is user-centric control, aligning with eIDAS principles. It empowers both individuals and businesses to manage their electronic identification and digital identity with autonomy. Users have the discretion to select the information they share, the entities they share it with, and the purposes for which it is used. This feature not only enhances user autonomy but also bolsters privacy protection within the digital ecosystem.</p>
 Interoperability: 
<p>EUDI exemplifies interoperability as envisaged in the EU digital identity framework. It offers a harmonised solution across the EU, enabling seamless cross-border access to digital services. An EUDI issued in any member state is recognised across all others, facilitating service access without the need for redundant verification. This interoperability is a significant step towards realising a cohesive digital Europe.</p>
 Security: 
<p>Security is a paramount feature of the EUDI, incorporating state-of-the-art encryption and authentication mechanisms. These technologies protect against identity theft, fraud, and other cyber threats, making EUDI a reliable and secure tool for electronic identification and online transactions.</p>
 Accessibility: 
<p>The EUDI champions digital inclusion, crafted to be accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities or limited access to technology. This inclusive approach is integral to the EU digital identity and trust services ethos, ensuring equal access to online services across all member states.</p>
 Expandability: 
<p>Designed to be versatile, the EUDI supports a wide array of applications, from basic online authentication to more complex uses like digital licenses and insurance. It even facilitates instant payments using the digital Euro, showcasing its adaptability to various digital identity needs and trust services within the EU framework.</p>
 Benefits of EUDI 
<p>The EUDI will be available for all EU citizens that are eligible for a national ID card and will be recognised across the EU. It will be a secure way to share information with services, allowing users to control how much information they want to share. The EUDI will be operated via digital wallets on mobile phones and other devices and will enable users to identify themselves both online and offline. The EUDI wallets will allow users to store and exchange government-provided data (i.e. name, date of birth and nationality), information provided by trusted private sources, and to use the information as confirmation of the right to reside, work, or study in a certain member state. It ultimately provides a cross-border digital identity that will benefit citizens across the EU.</p>
 Practical Uses of EUDI 
<p>There are a variety of key use cases that the EUDI can be used for, including public service applications and requests, opening bank accounts, tax returns and applications to universities, alongside proof of identity, storing medical prescriptions, and securing transactions. There are some use cases that underpin the development of the EUDI Wallet, to support meeting objectives.</p>
 Practical Example of EUDI Usage 
<p>Currently, opening a bank account involves multiple steps that may involve in-person meetings, signing paperwork and a tedious back and forth if any documents are missing. In addition, any cross-border banking is hampered by the lack of standard document formats, document coverage/accuracy and even simple language barriers. However, with the introduction of the EUDI a user would simply be able to respond to the bank’s request by selecting the required documents that are stored on their EUDI wallet, already in a standard format. These documents will then be sent securely to the bank as verifiable digital documents, for the bank to process and continue with the application.</p>
 The interplay between EUDI pilots and eIDAS Regulation 
<p>After a six-month delay, the EUDI pilots are now starting and will continue well into 2024. Unusually, the actual eIDAS legislation is still being developed at the same time, even as the pilots are running. In addition, there are two further parallel streams: writing of the standards and documenting the reference implementation. All four of these elements: legislation, standards, reference implementation and the pilots, are dependent on each other. The standards must comply with the law, the reference implementation needs to implement the standards, and the pilots should utilise the reference implementation. Ideally, feedback from the pilots should in turn guide the legislative process, closing the circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loop of interdependencies is caused both by the repeated delays in defining the base architecture and by the aggressive “Swiss knife” approach to the EUDI by the European Commission. What is often missed, however, is that the main hurdles regarding the whole EUDI project are not technical, or legal framework but political. The EUDI is designed to be much more than a simple mobile authenticator and therefore it must forge a compromise between 27 nation states from minute technical details to very profound decisions potentially affecting hundreds of millions of people – for example, whether to force every resident to adopt a persistent unique identifier.</p>
 The road to hell is paved with eternal secrets 
<p>When we think of strong digital identities, likely the first thing that we visualise is a unique identifier or a “name tag” that is then linked to a natural person for life. That is indeed one possible solution, but perhaps surprisingly there are alternative designs as well. The 27 EU member states have widely varying approaches. In some member states, one is automatically assigned a persistent unique identifier before leaving the maternity hospital. Elsewhere one will be assigned only in specific circumstances, while finally some member states do not assign such identifiers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On paper, having an identifier can simplify many governmental processes and ease digitalisation. However, its unchanging nature makes it very unwieldy in practice. The identifier will continue to exist, unchanged, for the lifetime of an individual. As the end users are required to use it to identify themselves in both on- and offline transactions, it becomes very challenging to simultaneously keep it secret for their entire lifetimes. The same applies to every private and public organisation who stores or processes it, and sadly it takes just a single data breach to lose control of it forever. In the age of pen and paper perhaps this was deemed a not so omnipresent threat. But as digitalisation marches on and KYC legislation spreads from finance to the hospitality industry and beyond, having copies made of one’s personal documents is turning from an exception to a standard policy. As it stands, the persistence and omnipresent use of the unique identifier leaves the unfortunate victims of identity theft with only bad options: either be on constant lookout for any misuse for life or go through the massive process of changing the identifier (if allowed by national legislation) and then getting every single document from one’s birth certificate to school records to work contracts changed to reflect the new identity.</p>
<p>Nothing is certain until the legislation is finalised, but currently it seems likely that the EUDI will controversially force everyone to adopt such an identifier yet seeks to bypass some of the shortcomings both via the magic of public key cryptography and by optionally allowing the creation of pseudonyms – aliases that only officials are able to link to an individual. For example, there could be a ‘healthcare me’, distinct from a ‘banking me’ and a ‘social media me’. Officials would be able to link all three together, but a cybercriminal or a data breach would be (hopefully) limited to an identity affecting a single sector. Of course, this is not a perfect solution, but it certainly is better than no solution.</p>
<p>Once again it should be emphasised that the 27 member nations have very differing opinions on how to best proceed and marking features as optional – like the pseudonyms mentioned above – is a well-known compromise when the standardising body cannot gather enough support to either include or exclude it from the core standards. Optional features rarely become universal, and worryingly it seems likely that any optional features of the EUDI will not be exceptions to this rule. Any optional features will be adopted by some of the member states, while others will decline to take them into use. This threatens the fragmentation of the whole European digital market from day one… which is exactly how the situation stands after eIDAS version 1, and what the EUDI is seeking to solve.</p>
<p>Controversies around the fundamental design principles highlight both the importance of the whole EUDI project, as well as how politically influenced or even driven any cross-border effort can be. It is wrong to say that international projects would be generally disadvantaged from intense debate though, as having over two dozen interest group opinions and different viewpoints is a tremendous advantage to any undertaking. The varied features and pilots of EUDI would not be possible if a single member state would have to carry all the burden by themselves.</p>

             November 2023   
	 
		 
			 Navigating the Booming Trend of Tokenized T-Bills&nbsp; 
 
<p>In recent weeks, the tokenization of Treasury bills (T-bills) has become a trending and popular topic, with on-chain data from our friends from RWA.xyz (see the chart below) revealing a total value of approximately $750 million and an average yield of 5.24%.&nbsp;This marks a remarkable 700% increase for the year, sparking market enthusiasm. However, it’s worth noting that the actual aggregate value of tokenized real-world assets, including T-bills, exceeds reported figures due to traditional players withholding on-chain data, indicating&nbsp;a larger market size than apparent.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>While it is fascinating to see the surging assets brought on-chain, a fundamental question arises:&nbsp;‘Why tokenize?’&nbsp;If the motivation behind tokenizing T-bills is solely market-driven, without added value, it won’t succeed in attracting traditional issuers and investors into the market.&nbsp;Traditional T-bills are already extremely accessible and liquid&nbsp;for US citizens. Individuals outside the US can easily purchase and sell T-bills ETF via fintechs or distributors.</p>
<p>The true value proposition of tokenized T-bills lies in transferability and interoperability,&nbsp;providing holders with unique utilities and automation beyond the scope of traditional forms. This encompasses the capacity for peer-to-peer transfers with eligible counterparts, trading across diverse platforms, utilizing them as collateral for borrowing, and staking to earn additional yields.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>To access these advantages,&nbsp;issuers need control to enforce compliance at the token level, requiring sophisticated smart contracts. Basic standards like ERC20 and ERC721 (NFT) are inadequate, as they are inherently permissionless, allowing unrestricted transfers. This limits issuers to conducting KYC only during the onboarding and redeeming process, with intermittent actions going uncontrollable by issuers.</p>
<p>Hence, the issuance of tokenized T-bills must adopt&nbsp;permissioned token standards such as ERC3643. This enables tokens to embed data and compliance rules&nbsp;to ensure compliant automation, transfers, and interactions throughout the entire token lifecycle while enabling issuers to obtain controls.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Having successfully supported clients in tokenizing T-bills and money market funds through the ERC3643 standard, we’re here to assist if you’re contemplating a similar issuance with a turnkey and white-label solution.</p>

<p></p><p>It was Friday night in New Orleans, and I was ready to kick off the weekend in true local style with a drink. I ordered my favorite wine on a food delivery app, but before the sale could be finalized, the wine store needed to verify my age. Seamlessly, they connected to my digital <a href="https://lawallet.com/">LA Wallet</a>, and without sharing any extra details, my wallet confirmed I was 21+. Within 30 minutes, I was sipping my wine, in awe of the blend of tradition and cutting-edge technology - technology that I'm fortunate to work on, and also enjoy the convenience of.</p> LA Wallet<a title="Direct link to LA Wallet">​</a> <p>Louisiana leads the way with its fully operational mobile driver's license (mDL) system. In the Big Easy, where I live, we go with the flow - meaning you never know what your day may entail. In such a culture, I've really enjoyed the convience of having things like my driver's license and COVID vaccination cards readily available on a mobile app for whenever I may need them.</p><p>Recognized legally as an equalivalent to physical identification, LA Wallet is my go-to for age-restricted purchases/entry, voting, and (heaven forbid) police encounters.  Because of this, the mDL ensures legal compliance and security while leveraging the convenience and accessibility of mobile technology. They accomplish this by using Verifiable Credentials.</p> Verifiable Credentials<a title="Direct link to Verifiable Credentials">​</a> <p>In the simplest terms, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> are digital versions of traditional documents like driver's licenses, passports, or university degrees. But they're more than just digital copies; they're secured with encryption, making them tamper-evident and instantly verifiable.</p><p>When the store connected to my LA Wallet, it wasn't just pulling up a digital version of my driver's license. Instead, the app used a Verifiable Credential – a piece of digital data that proves certain information about me without revealing everything. In this case, it confirmed that I am over the age of 21. The beauty of this system is in its respect for privacy; it didn't disclose my exact age, or any other personal detail that would be available had I shared my full driver's license.</p><p>Once my age was verified, the vendor allowed the purchase, and the delivery proceeded as planned. The entire process was seamless, fast, and respectful of my privacy. This is particularly interesting in my scenario where there's likely legal responsibilities for the delivery company as well as the wine vendor to verify my age. My mDL is a trusted source that can provide this proof to all of the involved parties without sharing all of my details.</p><p>This experience is a prime example of how Verifiable Credentials can simplify and secure everyday transactions. As we move more into the digital realm, the need for secure, private, and efficient verification methods becomes increasingly crucial. Verifiable Credentials meet these needs by offering a way to share necessary information without over-sharing.</p><p>The use of Verifiable Credentials is set to expand in various sectors, from healthcare to finance. As technology continues to evolve, it's exciting to see how innovations like Verifiable Credentials are making our digital lives more convenient and secure. It's not just about the technology; it's about how it enhances our daily experiences, one verification at a time.</p>

<p>Understanding federated identity and how it compares to self-sovereign identity (SSI) requires a basic understanding of when, where, and how digital identities are used online today. There is no “one size fits all,” though passionate proponents of various technologies may beg to differ. Alas, the world is not that simple: Different use cases drive different architectures and prioritize different technologies. That makes for quite a bit of confusion and a rather long blog post.</p>



 Why the confusion? 



<p>One question you might ask is, why is there so much confusion, anyway? The terms don’t look anything alike, so surely they must be entirely different things! Well, no, not at a functional level. (The technology stacks used to support that functionality differ, but we’ll discuss that later.)</p>



<p>First, let’s recognize that not everyone even likes the term SSI. It’s unclear whether digital wallet technologies fall under this category; some people say they do, others don’t. Other people are immediately turned off by how early proponents of SSI focused almost exclusively on blockchain technology. For the sake of this post, know that I’m coming at this from the perspective of SSI as an architecture that encompasses a user-centric focus for digital identity credentials. YMMV.</p>



<p>Both Federated Identity and SSI models support similar (but not wholly overlapping) use cases. For example, both models can support remote identification, authentication, and/or authorization to online services. Both require an entity that holds the source records, issues credentials, and supports the possibility of a third party using those credentials. It’s also possible (but rarely implemented in the Federated Identity model) that the person engaged in the transaction has some control over what exactly is shared with the third party requesting the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more!&nbsp;</p>



 Discovery 



<p>In both models, there is also the requirement that an individual be able to make some choices about what credential they want to use. Within Federated Identity, that means being able to pick the identity provider (IdP) from a list or type an identifier for it into a dialog box. In the SSI model, that means being able to pick from a list of locally stored credentials OR picking the correct container (aka, the digital wallet) used to store the appropriate credentials.</p>



<p>If this sounds like a UX nightmare, it is. Federated identity has been used in production environments for decades, and they still haven’t definitively solved what’s referred to as “the discovery problem.” In the research and education sector, for example, a single relying party (RP) might need to offer a choice of nearly 6,000 IdPs for the user to select from. The SSI model is realizing the same pain now, exacerbated by the desire not to let any third party know more information than they absolutely have to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there is just enough functional similarity to make things interesting when talking about these two architectures. Some might even say that SSI is just another flavor of Federated Identity (note: that way lies madness). Now, let’s talk about some of the differences.</p>



 Federated Identity 



<p>What use cases drive decisions toward one model and not the other? Well, for one thing, it provides the company that operates the IdP control over the authentication process and the information shared during the transaction. In the case of an enterprise organization, that makes a lot of sense. Authentication and authorization in this use case is by, for, and about an individual as they relate to a company. It’s not about the individual’s private information; it’s the data about them as associated with and owned by the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s all a question of functional requirements. The technology stacks, however, are quite different. When talking about federated identity models, protocols like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml">Security Assertion Markup Language</a>&nbsp;(SAML),&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol">OpenID Connect</a>&nbsp;are what describe (and constrain) everything including the claims, the assertions used, the structure of the attributes shared, the way identity provider discovery is handled, and more. A great deal of control is given to both the RP and the IdP, and there is a coarse level of control for the individual (generally in the form of “you can either choose to log in or not, but you aren’t guaranteed control over what information is shared as a result”).</p>



 SSI 



<p>The SSI model is a very different beast in the underlying assumptions, protocols, and architecture used. The most important entity involved in any transaction is the individual, aka the user (not my favorite term, but it’s pretty common in the documentation). The individual decides what information is shared and with whom. In a typical use case, when an individual uses a credential in an SSI model, nothing reports back to the issuing authority that lets them track what the individual is doing with their credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, the individual has discrete control over every bit of information in their credential. In fact, the protocols are being designed to ensure a minimum of information is shared in an identity transaction. For example, when a third party asks for verification that the individual is over 55, all they should get in return is a ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ They should not get the date of birth, home address, a photo, and whether the individual has chosen to donate organs upon death: the information shared when presenting a physical US driver’s license to verify age. Another name for this is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dock.io/post/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a>.</p>



<p>When considering the protocols, SAML (as far as I know) will never properly fit in an SSI world. OAuth and OpenID Connect may, and there’s work in progress to make that happen (check out&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;if you want to know more). Work is also underway regarding the credential itself, most notably the W3C’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/">Verifiable Credential</a>&nbsp;efforts, the&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF’s SD-JWT specification</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ul.com/resources/new-isoiec-standard-electronic-credentials">ISO’s mdocs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 New Solutions 



<p>The good news is that, as one likes to see when it comes to evolving technologies, SSI is helping solve some of the challenges that traditional Federated Identity models weren’t able (or chose not to for reasons that made sense at the time) to support. I already mentioned selective disclosure. SSI models have this as a fundamental requirement of the technology, not just something that an IdP might implement on behalf of its users but rarely under the control of its users. Big privacy win here!</p>



<p>Another possibility in this brave new world is cross-device support. Rather than a password that has to be memorized and/or copied over to multiple devices (for example), a credential that lives on one mobile device can be used in an authentication or authorization process on another device, like a desktop or tablet. (I will note that this may fall under the category of “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.” There will be a LOT of different types of credentials, even identity-focused ones, available to the individual. They are not all designed with authentication in mind.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, when a credential is designed for authentication and authorization AND moves us away from relying on passwords, it is really a Very Good Thing.&nbsp;</p>



 New Problems 



<p>Sign me up! Let’s do it! Rah Rah, go, team!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or, maybe not quite yet, because new challenges must be addressed before people decide to jump on the SSI bandwagon.</p>



<p>For one thing, the UX challenges are pretty significant. The technologies under development to move ahead in an SSI model support more than just identity. They also support payment systems, transportation tickets, library cards, insurance cards, hotel keys, car keys – the list goes on. It’s one thing to compare this model as similar to having all these cards in a physical wallet, but there comes the point where there are too many cards for me to find the right one when I need it. Surely, a computer can search for the one I need, right? Right?</p>



<p>Well, not yet. This is where the privacy considerations make usability that much harder. Credentials are often stored in a digital wallet, and that wallet protects the credentials from any random request. Arguably, the wallet shouldn’t have anything to do with the credentials it holds any more than a physical wallet has anything to do with the cards it holds. Just to make sure we’re maxing out on the potential for complexity here, there may be more than one wallet holding various credentials!&nbsp;</p>



 More New Problems 



<p>Not everyone wants to live in a paternalistic nation-state that assumes people are unlikely to make good choices and protects their population by restricting various freedoms and technical innovations. That said, not everyone wants to live in a completely libertarian environment that leaves individuals responsible for their actions, whether or not the ramifications of those actions are clear. Trying to find the compromise in the middle usually involves some level of transparency and accountability so that it’s possible to verify all parties did the right thing as defined by contract or law.</p>



<p>That’s not too hard in a traditional Federated Identity system. The IdP has logs of transactions. The RP has logs, too. The only entity that (probably) doesn’t have logs is the individual (although the IdP and the RP sometimes make their logs visible to the user). With two out of three parties having info on what happened, cross-checking becomes possible if something goes to court.</p>



<p>However, In an SSI model, the entity that issues the credential knows that it issued it. When it comes to the credentials being used, however, they (in some implementations) don’t know anything – on purpose. The RP (aka, the Verifier) may only know a potentially small subset of information that doesn’t identify the individual at all. Whether the individual (or the device or application holding their credential) has a transaction log is still under debate and may be an implementation detail. Some developers may implement one (and get yelled at regarding the privacy implications), and some may not (and get yelled at for not supporting accountability and transparency).&nbsp;</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>The functionality of Federated Identity and SSI architectures is similar if you tilt your head just right. Both serve to support remote authentication and authorization. Both have one party responsible for creating the digital identity credential, another party expected to consume it, and an individual (and their devices) instigating the transaction in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technical decisions that inform the protocols and subsequent implementations, however, are where the designs quickly divide. While no one wants to support more identity systems than is necessary; the traditional Federated Identity model and the newer SSI architecture are not mutually exclusive. They just focus on solving different problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t help that SSI technologies are very young and under active debate and development. The technology you see right now is not fully baked, and it still needs to grow to solve everything technologists hope it will. Of course, you can wait for that and ask someone to let you know when it’s all resolved. Or, as always, my preferred option: you can get involved in the discussions to ensure you help guide these technologies’ development and deployment.</p>

 Although financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK’s financial services industry, when it comes to crypto, there appears to be confusion over what is and what isn’t allowed, and who the new rules actually apply to. Our Global Head of Crypto and FinTech, Jason Tucker-Feltham explains all. 



 



<p><br>Within just 24 hours of the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a> (FCA) releasing its<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-issues-146-alerts-first-24-hours-new-crypto-marketing-regime#"> financial promotions regime</a> for the crypto industry, it had issued 146 alerts of unregulated crypto firms illegally promoting crypto assets in the UK.</p>



<p>While these startling high numbers could be interpreted as a reflection of the FCA’s commitment to safeguarding consumers and fostering a responsible crypto industry amidst ongoing regulatory developments, it also showcases how unprepared the UK’s crypto industry is. Or, at the very least, how difficult the FCA registration process for crypto firms can be.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a financial promotion? 



<p>According to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/section/21">Section 21</a> of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, a financial promotion refers to “an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, communicated by a person in the course of business.”</p>



<p>In other words, financial promotions are advertisements or other promotional materials used by financial firms to market their products to consumers. Financial promotions can be disseminated via newspapers, mailings, product brochures, social media platforms (remember the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183/"> Kim Kardashian scandal for touting crypto in 2022?</a>), websites, in fact, any medium if they include an invitation or incentive targeting consumer credit activity.</p>



<p>The FCA regulates the conduct of nearly 50,000 firms to ensure the fairness, honesty, and competitiveness of the UK’s financial markets. According to the <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/">FCA Handbook</a>, all financial promotions must be clearly identifiable, accurate, balanced, and not misleading. Promotions must explicitly mention prominent risk warnings and must not contain inappropriate incentives. Since financial promotions by firms can influence a consumer’s decision when choosing a financial product or service, they must comply with specific FCA rules. Firms must also, of course, be registered with the FCA.</p>



<p>The fact that the FCA had to issue so many alerts on the first day of the new regime emphasizes its vigilant approach to crypto asset promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s not only the UK that has measures in place to protect consumers from unregulated entities. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) regulates financial promotions in the US, while in Canada, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency.html">Financial Consumer Agency of Canada</a> protects the rights of consumers of financial products and services.&nbsp;</p>



 Financial promotion punishments. 



<p>So, what punishment awaits the 146 companies that broke the rules on the very first day of the regime? Well, as per the FCA Handbook, anyone committing a financial promotion criminal offense may face up to two years of imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The FCA will assess the severity of the breach to determine the appropriate penalty level, which ranges from Level 1 to Level 5.</p>



<p>Crypto firms in the UK have been aware of the upcoming rules, and the potential repercussions of sending out financial promotions for quite a while. In 2022, there were <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/annual-reports/annual-report-2022-23.pdf">1,882 warnings issued</a>, marking a 34% increase from the previous year. As a result, 8,582 financial promotions were amended or withdrawn, which was 14x more than observed in 2021. Financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK financial services industry.</p>



 Riding the wave of crypto. 



<p>The rise of crypto and <a href="https://crypto.com/university/bull-vs-bear-market-difference">extreme market cycles</a> have resulted in many wondering if they too could benefit financially from investing in crypto assets. Recent reports suggest there are as many as <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/newsroom/press-releases/crypto-wealth-report-2023#:~:text=There%20are%2088%2C200%20crypto%20millionaires,investment%20migration%20specialists%20Henley%20%26%20Partners.">88,200 crypto millionaires</a>, including some fairytale stories of people amassing their wealth by investing very small amounts. However, the sheer number of <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/heres-how-many-crypto-coins-failed-last-year/#:~:text=How%20many%20cryptocurrencies%20have%20failed,to%20fail%20than%20new%20ones.">cryptocurrencies that have ceased to exist</a> is less highlighted, and as a result, many people’s investments have just been completely wiped out. As such, the financial promotions regulation seeks to protect the most vulnerable, especially from influential celebrity endorsements.</p>



<p>In March 2023, the SEC charged eight celebrities, with some of the most notable examples including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/22/sec-sues-celebrities-cryptocurrencies-lindsay-lohan-tron">Lindsay Lohan and Jake Paul</a>, for failing to mention that they were partaking in a paid promotion.</p>



 UK’s proposed crypto regime. 



<p>The addition of crypto to the UK’s financial promotion regime marks a step toward a full <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">crypto regulatory framework</a>. Much like its European equivalent, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> (Markets in Crypto Assets), a core aim of the UK’s proposed crypto regime will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>The UK’s proposed crypto regime is expected to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">take effect</a> in 2024, and crypto firms wishing to operate in the UK must register with the FCA and adhere to its regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government’s proposed <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">changes</a> for crypto firms include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/britain-sets-out-plans-to-regulate-crypto-industry-in-wake-of-ftx-collapse.html">Establishing</a> a world-first system for crypto lending<br>  Introducing new regulations to safeguard consumers from market manipulation<br>  Enforcing a market abuse system for cryptocurrency trading<br>  Requiring crypto exchanges to have clear and detailed requirements for admission criteria<br>  Mandating disclosures for new crypto assets<br>  Offering a 24-hour <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/letter-to-cryptoasset-firms-financial-promotions-regime.pdf">cooling-off</a> period for new investors<br>  Banning referral bonuses  



<p>The FCA will regulate crypto firms under the current <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/finalised-guidance/fg23-3.pdf">promotions</a> law, which is expected to protect consumers from misleading or inappropriate crypto <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/cryptoasset-registration-flowchart.pdf">promotions</a>. The FCA’s rules for marketing crypto assets include the following:</p>



  Advertisements must be transparent, fair, not misleading  



  Crypto asset firms must ensure consumers have the necessary understanding and expertise to invest in crypto<br>  Crypto promotions must establish clear risk warnings  



 Weighing the benefits and drawbacks of the new regulations. 



<p>These new crypto regulations will prevent users from being exposed to unregulated platforms and crypto scams like the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/09/ftx-takes-its-place-among-historys-most-infamous-financial-scandals/">FTX scandal</a>, which involved the collapse of a crypto exchange, in November 2022. The collapse was due to a liquidity crisis that revealed an US$8 billion hole in company accounts.</p>



<p>Of course, a potential drawback of the financial promotions regime is that only firms registered with the FCA or partnered with someone registered by the FCA will be able to operate in the UK, which may pose a barrier to entry for firms. This is because becoming FCA-<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/registering">registered</a> in order to comply with the financial promotions regime could prove costly, not to mention time-consuming. Registering as a crypto asset firm falls into <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/FEES/3/Annex1A.html">Category 6</a> of the FCA’s pricing categories, meaning that firms currently have to pay at least £10,000 to register. The FCA also imposes an annual fee following authorization.</p>



 Promoting crypto in the UK? 



<p>The recent publication of the UK’s revised ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets</a>’ marks a crucial advancement in the nation’s journey towards cryptocurrency regulation. The document, released by HM Treasury, outlines the present regulatory framework for crypto assets, definitions of different kinds of crypto assets, and a proposed policy approach to introducing crypto asset activities under the UK’s regulatory boundaries. As of April 2023, the FCA had registered just <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/business-plans/2023-24">41</a> crypto asset firms under its AML regime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balanced regulation that ensures consumer safety while maintaining an attractive marketplace for crypto firms is crucial, especially to fully realize the UK government’s aims to become a major crypto hub.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, they are also a requirement to be able to comply with FCA requirements. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>We often think about our personal identities when we think of verifiable identifiers and verifiable credentials. We think of things like personal credentials, mobile driver’s licenses, or professional accreditations. But what about using the same tools and principles when it comes to managing the identity of an organization? How do the same tools and principles apply when managing the identity of an organization? Is it easier or more challenging to implement these concepts for organizational identities compared to personal ones? And importantly, what are the implications and impacts of effectively managing organizational identity?</p>
<p>In this podcast conversation with Lance Byrd, we delve into these questions, exploring the nuances and potential of organizational identity in the digital age.</p>
<p>Lance has been closely involved with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/">GLEIF</a>), an initiative born out of the 2008 financial crisis. GLEIF’s primary mission is to foster a transparent global system for identifying legal entities, known as the Legal Entity Identifier (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">LEI</a>). This system is crucial for enhancing transparency in organizational identities, which is essential for effective regulation and risk assessment. More recently, GLEIF has focused on expanding the LEI’s utility by transforming it into a verifiable credential, termed the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">vLEI</a>. This discussion with Lance taps into various use cases, frameworks, and insights from GLEIF, providing a deeper understanding of the complexities and significance of organisational identity.</p>
<p>In our conversation, I was particularly intrigued by Lance’s insights on the contrast between administrative and cryptographic trust. Administrative roots of trust, which are widespread in our daily lives, often lead to persistent cybersecurity challenges. Lance elaborated on how cryptographic roots of trust offer more secure and dependable methods for identity verification. We delved into real-world scenarios, including the recent MGM/Okta cyberattack, to illustrate these concepts.</p>
<p>This discussion was enlightening, and it felt like we could easily spend many more hours exploring this topic. There might be more on this in 2024! I hope you find this podcast episode as engaging and informative as I did.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Lance and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 Differences Between Personal and Organizational Identity: We explored the unique challenges and political concerns surrounding personal identity, contrasting them with the complexities yet seemingly smoother processes in organizational identity. 
 Legal and Privacy Concerns in Identity Management: The discussion highlighted how legal structures and privacy concerns shape the management of both personal and organizational identities, with a special focus on GDPR and its implications. 
 Governance and Trust in Organizational Identity: The conversation shifted to the role of governance and trust in shaping organizational identity, using examples like the EU Banking Authority to illustrate these concepts. 
 Integrity of Signatures and Cybersecurity: We discussed the critical importance of signature integrity in preventing cybersecurity attacks, examining recent incidents like the MGM Okta attack. 
 Security Mechanisms and Key Rotation: The podcast touched upon the importance of security mechanisms like key rotation in enhancing digital security, differentiating it from traditional password changes. 
 The Interplay of Security Features and User Experience: We delved into how user experience and design play a crucial role in the adoption of security technologies, balancing ease of use with robust security measures. 
 Differences in UX Between Consumer and Organizational Contexts: The discussion concluded with an examination of the varying approaches to user experience in consumer versus organizational settings, and the challenges in changing consumer behaviour regarding privacy and security.

<p>We frequently use the word “identity” when we don’t really mean it. We frame digital identity solutions around proving who you are or proving who someone is.</p>
<p>But IRL we rarely want to know who someone else really is (and from the personal perspective, we rarely want to reveal who we really are).</p>
<p>The fact is, we do not routinely ask “Who are you?” not with any seriousness anyway. “Who you are” is just vernacular, or shorthand. And it stands for something that is very different from identity.</p>
<p>In business and administration, we are always much more precise about what we really want to know about the other party.</p>
<p>Two parties always go into a transaction with a clear idea of what they need to know about each other and what they are going to have to prove about themselves.</p>
<p>These are known unknowns. In the case of business applications, the unknowns are defined when the systems are designed (typical examples are usernames, legal names, account numbers, licence numbers, government IDs and device serial numbers). And there are recognised sources or systems from which pertinent information originates, together with conventions and mechanisms for telling if the information is reliable.</p>
<p>In general, “digital identity” should not be the question. When we design a transaction system, we should start by asking What Do We Really Need To Know about each party. And the answer should include the all-important metadata that confirms the information is fit for purpose.</p>

<p>If you were present for CEO Boris Mann's presentation at the PL Summit, you heard the alpha on Everywhere Computer. Yes, that's right. After several years of being deep in the protocol mines, Fission is thrilled to launch our first product! </p>IPVM Protocol | Everywhere Computer | Homestar Mascot<p>We've shared several exciting announcements over the past few months, so let's break them down in full context now.</p><p>IPVM is the open source protocol that powers Everywhere Computer.</p><p>Homestar is the individual node that makes up the network (similar to how IPFS Kubo, Iroh, Nabu, or other implementation nodes make up the IPFS network). It's written in Rust, and is designed for performance and composability.</p><p>Everywhere Computer is Fission's platform: a branded and supported distribution that bundles Homestar + control panel, a function &amp; workflow marketplace, and managed compute resources.</p>Slide from Boris Mann's PL Summit 2023 Presentation Writing Wasm Functions  <p>Today we've got a few sample functions to test the network, with Rust → Wasm being the happy path. We'll have some tooling and examples for JavaScript → Wasm soon.</p><p>Like NPM providing a library of functions that developers use to quickly write applications, Everywhere Computer's directory will lead to re-use of serverless functions. UCAN can be used to gate access to functions, or specific communities or companies can federate their own set of functions for internal usage only, or to share with everyone.</p> Goodbye Cloud, Hello Crowd <p>As an application developer you can take advantage of Everywhere Computer's Wasm functions to replace backend functions in a serverless style. You're not locked into any one cloud provider's serverless stack, and can pick functions from the directory rather than needing to write them from scratch.</p><p>Additionally, not every job needs to go to the cloud. Many jobs can be done locally on an application's clients desktops and browsers. Every compute cycle that gets done locally is one that you don't need to pay for in the cloud.</p><p>When it's time to scale up, you can utilize Everywhere Computer's distributed network to orchestrate jobs along the parameters you've set, allowing it to utilize whichever platforms are most efficient. Everywhere Computer never locks you into any subscription. You pay when you compute, so you never worry about getting locked into one provider. </p><p>This means your job could run on your desktop, Homestar nodes in your community network, or managed compute services from Fission and other compute providers.</p> What's Coming Next - Future Plans <p>Speaking of writing functions and workflows, one of the things we'll be exploring is to fix some of the issues with directories where developers don't get directly compensated even though potentially 10s of millions of applications use their libraries. We will look to support development of high quality, performant, and maintained functions by having compute providers pay the developers who write them.</p><p>Don't have a Wasm-compatible function but still want to connect to Everywhere Computer, taking advantage of its distributed and interoperable network? If your service is <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a>-enabled, you will soon be able to plug it in, introducing new functionality to the entire network. As has always been the plan, UCAN's capabilities model provides a flexible IAM-like backbone that can connect the open web, rather than locked to one cloud provider.</p> <p>We are so excited to share <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> with you. If you'd like to join the early access beta, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfREjmoTBOW2gyUSFypn3omifibvptH0K_IQwtFWiGORU5vAQ/viewform">complete this form</a>. We're looking for enthusiast hackers &amp; node hosts, function writers, and compute providers.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about the underlying IPVM protocol, you can join the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM Working Group</a>.</p>

 <p>Een consument doet op de website een aanvraag voor een lening, en krijgt direct uitsluitsel of de aanvraag geaccepteerd wordt of (nog) niet. Oftewel; volledig STP (Straight Through Processing) accepteren, het kan!</p> 
 <p>Dat was de afdronk van de rondetafel die we organiseerden in samenwerking met iLoan. Het onderwerp: "STP Acceptatie: Hoe bereik je dit in overeenstemming met de regels".</p> 
 <p>In de consumptief krediet sector worden daar snel grote stappen gezet. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van het Keurmerk Private Lease en de VFN gedragscode.</p> 
 <p>Tijdens de rondetafel deelden we met 20+ experts van de grootste consumptief krediet- en private lease-organisaties in Nederland tips, ervaringen en inzichten die we samen met <a href="https://www.iloan.nl/">iLoan</a> en klanten zoals <a href="https://ockto.eu/kennisbank/praktijkcase-toyota-louwman-financial-services">Toyota Louwman Financial Services</a> hebben opgedaan.</p> 
  10 inzichten over STP accepteren  
 <br> 
   
   Volledig STP werken is mogelijk - voor zowel private lease als huurkoop/consumptief krediet.<br><br>  
   100% STP betekent ruim 300 businessrules die akkoord zijn; op basis van Keurmerk Private Lease of de VFN leennormen.<br><br>  
   Een lager percentage STP betekent nog steeds veel efficiency omdat de Loan Officer/Acceptant nog maar op enkel van de ruim 300 checks een oordeel hoeft te geven (in plaats van op allemaal).  
   De normen geven nog een behoorlijke interpretatieruimte; enerzijds een kans, anderzijds ook onderwerp van in- en externe discussie.<br><br>  
   Zorg dat je 'audit trail' op orde is: doe A/B-testing met een x-aantal dossiers waarbij je de consument eerst accepteert op basis van documenten, en vervolgens met (enkel) brondata &amp; banktransacties.<br><br>  
   Gebruik die testen om business rules te finetunen, om interne goedkeuring te krijgen én een goedkeurend knikje van de toezichthouder.<br><br>  
   Volume en continue verbeteren is key: dit spel krijg je niet op orde met tientallen dossiers. Er moet veel volume/data door het proces omdat je dan onderscheid zult zien in de verscheidene 'persona's': een groep die makkelijk als STP is te definiëren, kansrijke 'oranje' aanvragen en de 'hard-rode' gevallen. Met continu verbeteren stel je doorlopend de engine bij, en zorg je ook voor draagvalk bij de loan officers/acceptanten.<br><br>  
   De loan officers/acceptanten zijn wellicht wel de belangrijkste stakeholders: zij moeten vertrouwen krijgen in het digitale proces en ook vertrouwen dat (bijvoorbeeld) 296 businessrules al automatisch gecontroleerd zijn en zij enkel de nog resterende 4 oranje velden checken. Bezuinigen op FTE kan een doel zijn, maar veel partijen focussen juist op STP van de massa om de loan officers/acceptanten vooral in te zetten op enkel de oranje posten én om meer volume aan te kunnen zonder afhankelijkheid van meer handen.<br><br>  
   Er is sterke behoefte aan een ketenoplossing zoals bijvoorbeeld gebruikt wordt in de hypotheeksector (<a href="https://ockto.eu/ockto-brondata-service">Ockto Brondata Service</a>): adviseur/dealer laat een Ockto sessie doen, Ockto slaat deze max. 90 dagen op, kredietverstrekker krijgt sleutel mee bij de aanvraag en kan met eigen datafilter toegang krijgen tot de initiële brondataset van de betreffende consument. <br>Er zijn ontwikkelingen op dit gebied met diverse partijen.<br><br>  
   En last but not least: er blijkt veel behoefte te zijn om periodiek gezamenlijk te sparren over dit onderwerp. Als ketenpartners gezamenlijk tot oplossingen komen op gedeelde uitdagingen, dan is dat winst voor iedereen én hoeft het concurrentieel voor- en nadeel daar niet meer over te gaan. Plus kunnen er in de normenkaders ook sneller verbeteringen worden doorgevoerd.

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees to your IT systems is like an intricate dance — it can either be a graceful waltz or an out-of-sync electric slide. In this post, we’ll talk about four potential trip-ups when thinking about employee access management. We’ll also show you practical steps you can take today to streamline onboarding and offboarding. Let’s take it for a spin!&nbsp;</p>
 Using a tool that’s too big (or too small) 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Imagine trying to dance the tango in tap shoes or attempting a waltz in hiking boots. Similarly, using tools that are either too complex or too basic can throw off the entire rhythm of your onboarding and offboarding dance.</p>
<p>With advanced providers like Okta, for example, you have to configure SAML, SCIM, and JIT to authenticate and manage users. This is known as <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">the SSO tax</a> and can mean a lot of work on technology that you might not really need yet. On the other hand, people who try to manage the process with Jira tickets or Notion/Docs, often forget to track and update things.</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Find a tool that’s your perfect dance partner — one that adapts to your rhythm by helping you accomplish what you need to get done today and grows with you. Instead of taking an over-comprehensive approach to SSO that may overwhelm customers and inflate costs, focus on the tasks you face today — the stuff you just need to work and to be secure. And with the right tool, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>, which will help you scale as your business expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. It’s also free for now (<a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">find out why</a>).</p>
 Trying to do it all yourself 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Picture a solo dancer trying to cover the entire stage – it might look impressive, but the risk of exhaustion and missteps is high. If you’re the Google Admin for your small startup or company, odds are you’re an overachiever, but stretching yourself too thin can have negative effects on your work and your health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Enter your dance ensemble – your application administrators. Delegating tasks during the onboarding and offboarding performance lightens the load and ensures a smoother routine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Onboard, you can assign an admin to each app your company uses, then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper admins. We also help you empower employees to initiate requests for new application access, which can also be routed to the proper application administrator.</p>
<p>In this way, automation becomes your dance partner, stepping in to handle repetitive tasks while you take center stage. Things like customizable templates, task assignments, and email notification not only help you save time but also minimize the chances of errors.&nbsp;</p>
 Putting off best practices until “later”&nbsp; 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Delaying the incorporation of best practices is akin to attempting a complicated dance routine without rehearsal – it leads to chaos and missteps. Maybe it’s too expensive to manage right now — time or budget wise — but what you end up with is a messy company footprint and opening yourself to security risks.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/right-sized-onboarding-and-offboarding-free-for-the-first-100-signups/">Onboarding and offboarding tools have overlooked the middle of the marke</a>t. There are plenty of smaller businesses that want to easily manage their processes now while setting up good practices for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>We created YeshID Onboard because we saw that gap. Specifically for 50-250 people, Onboard provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 Only focusing on onboarding, not offboarding 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. And focusing solely on onboarding is like nailing the first half of a dance and forgetting the finale. Onboarding is about efficiency, but offboarding is both a security and compliance requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. This is another area where your Product Administrators can play back-up dancers, ensuring a seamless transition.&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s dance 
<p>In the dance of onboarding and offboarding, perfecting each step is essential for a harmonious performance. Choose tools that dance to your rhythm, build a team of Product Administrators as your dance ensemble, kick off best practices from the first note, and never forget the importance of the grand finale – offboarding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID Onboard is your dance instructor for small to medium-sized businesses, offering a strategic approach to identity and access management. Users also get access to an exclusive Slack community of small business hustlers and heroes just like you so we can share, support, and celebrate together. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Sign up today</a>.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: On this episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity we are joined by Gautam Hazari, from Sekura.ID as we discuss what is the missing Identity layer of the Internet. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hello and thank you for joining us, a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Today’s guest is Gautam Hazari. He is a mobile identity guru, a technology enthusiast, artificial intelligence expert and futurist. And he is the CTO of Sekura.id, the global leader in mobile identity services. Gautam led the implementation of the mobile identity initiative Mobile Connect for around 60 mobile operators across 30 countries. He has also been an advisor to startups in Digital Identity, healthcare, the Internet of Things and fraud and security management. Hello, Gautam.</p>
<p>Gautam Hazari: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good, happy to have you here in the show.</p>
<p>Gautam: My pleasure. Thanks.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s going to be super interesting. Now, we are focusing on mobile – mobile initiatives, like the one you are working with, can help us to solve the identity problems we usually discuss in this show.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself. So, if you can tell us your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. Thanks, Oscar. I have been in the identity space for quite some time now. And it started in the telecom world and that’s why I talk about mobile identity a lot. So I spent many years of my life in the telecom, so I worked with the Vodafone group for nearly 14, 15 years. What I realised is that there is one thing that the mobile operators have done quite efficiently is solving what I call the identity crisis of the internet. I started to talk about it quite passionately in different forms.</p>
<p>And in 2013, end of 2013, GSMA approached me. GSMA as you know is the GSM Association which is the trade organisation for the mobile operators. So the GSMA board was discussing that there were some assets within the mobile operators which can actually help in solving the identity crisis in the internet. Then they approached me that, “Hey, you were talking about this identity thing for quite some time, do you want to come and join?” And that’s when I joined GSMA to do the initiative for mobile operators to solve the identity crisis of the internet.</p>
<p>Then I led the technology for what was known and still known as Mobile Connect Initiative. I was the Chief Architect for Mobile Connect. And then me and my team created the reference architecture, the specification. And then of course, that’s not enough, so I went around the world, worked with the mobile operators to implement it as well. You know, at that time, there were around 62 mobile operators around the world who implemented it. And they did very passionately and this is where I met some of the founders, Mark and Keiron, in GSMA, working with the same team. And then I’m taking that journey forward in a much more accelerated and commercial way in Sekura.id.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Well, definitely a lot of your journey is in identity already and mostly in mobile, as you said. Before we start going to what you are doing in Sekura.id and we definitely want to hear more about that. I know that you have a special experience which is you have even a TEDx talk. So if you can tell us a bit of that experience.</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah. Thanks, Oscar. It has been a fascinating experience actually, while preparing for the TEDx talk and also after that. So I was invited to do this TEDx talk to share my vision and dream of a world without passwords. I have been talking about these things passionately and that’s kind of my personal journey has been as well.</p>
<p>So, I had a lot of learning, you have to compact all that you want to talk within 18 minutes and that’s very interesting, right? If you have a free floating, I mean I’m really, really passionate about this identity thing, I can keep talking for days. But if you need to give your message within 18 minutes that’s quite interesting. So I learned how to deliver the message in that concise way.</p>
<p>And after delivering that, and once the TED organisation published the video in their YouTube. Interestingly, they didn’t actually remove any part of that, generally they do some editing but they didn’t do that for me. I’m really thankful to TED on that. So it happened end of last year. It’s been just one year completed and it has been viewed more than 157,000 times. And I have been receiving some very, very interesting messages from all around the world. From identity enthusiasts to security specialist, and also, from general public as well, saying that awareness is important. And we are having some inertia, right? We have been using passwords since, you know, 1961 actually, even before the internet was invented in 1989. But we don’t actually think that we are actually using it, and the complication that it brings too. I have been fortunate enough to hear lots of personal stories as well. These viewers, they have been sharing their personal stories related to passwords, and discussing what is the solution that can actually solve this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it has been a fascinating experience and I’m really, really thankful for all the viewers who have been watching it and also most importantly, interacting with it and sharing their stories.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Yeah, I also watched and as you said, the way you explained also definitely appeals to the general audience which is of course what mostly TEDx is about, reaching wider audiences. So it’s definitely a good job you have done there. And I am happy to hear also that there have been a lot of conversation because that’s also important that people not only hear the stories or the ideas but also get involved in, spreading those problems, sharing their own pains, et cetera.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: I also know that you have written, of course, you write blogs, particularly, I read the you talk about the missing identity layer of the internet, missing identity layer of the internet. Could you tell us what is that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. I mean it’s extremely important that we acknowledge and realise that. Let me go back to when the internet was invented, right? Let’s face it, the internet was never designed to identify the human users. It was designed to identify the computers, right? That’s why there are IP addresses. Fortunately, or unfortunately, we humans don’t have IP addresses.</p>
<p>So, in the initial days of the internet, if you remember, all we used to do in the internet was browsing, right? We used to browse AOL, we used to browse Yahoo, different stories within Yahoo. So, it did not matter if for me, Gautam, is browsing AOL or Yahoo, or it’s Oscar browsing, or there’s fraudster who is browsing, right?&nbsp; Because all we did was browsing the internet. Yes, the returning user needed to be identified, not as Oscar or Gautam but whoever was browsing, right? So that’s why cookies were invented just to provide a continuity of the experience, right?</p>
<p>But then we started to do interesting things on the internet. We started to do commerce on the internet. We started to look for things on eBay and started to pay for those things. We started to do banking on the internet. We started to interact in the social media in the internet. And then it did matter whether it’s me, Gautam, doing that commerce transaction, whether it’s me, Gautam, who is doing that banking transaction or it’s you, Oscar, or it’s the fraudster. Or, in the current days, if it is that AI chatbot who is doing that transaction, right?</p>
<p>Internet was not designed to do that. Internet did not have that identity layer. So what did we do? We created a trustless model. So, if I want to pay for some things that I found on eBay, or if I want to do a banking transaction, my bank will say, “Hey, you cannot do that, because I don’t trust you. First, I’m challenging you to prove that you are Gautam.” That’s what we created, because the internet didn’t have that identity layer.</p>
<p>So how did that challenge happen? And they initially did this, this challenge happened in the form of user ID and password, right? And again, we all aware of all the complications related to password from convenience to security, right? Then we said, “Hey, passwords are not enough. Let’s add other things.” So, we started to talk about MFA, Multi-factor authentication, we added SMS OTP, right? And again, OTP, the last P is about password, right? Just changing the acronym doesn’t change the problem.</p>
<p>But then again, they said, “OK, maybe that’s not enough. Let’s add the biometrics on top.” But again conceptually what we are doing is, we are creating a trustless model where these services are challenging me and the human user to identify myself, right? And whenever the human user is involving in providing a response to the challenge, for example in form of I need to type back the password, or I need to provide back the OTP, however I give, whether by typing back the OTP or some auto read happens. Or even if I do this, let’s say, biometrics in the form of facial recognition and so on, I, as a user, is the weakest link in the chain. I do something wrong, which is perfectly fine because me, as a user, is not a security architect. As a normal user, I am not aware of all those security complications that can go away, right? And that’s where all the problems that you have seen and again, why? Because the internet was not designed to identify this human user. Internet never have the identity layer. It still doesn’t have.</p>
<p>But we almost ignored the fact that almost at a similar time, there was a parallel internet that was getting created. So, as you know, I’m actually using the world wide web as synonym to internet, so when I say internet, it’s actually the world wide web, right? So, 1989, this wed, world wide web or internet as we call it was invented. In 1991, there was a parallel internet that was created. And we never call it the internet, we call it the mobile network, right? The first SIM-based GSM mobile network was used in 1991. And that parallel internet worked completely differently.</p>
<p>So, as we discussed, in the traditional internet, if I want to do any interaction, where I, as a human user, needs to be identified, I’ll be challenged, right? My bank will challenge me, my social media will challenge me, my e-commerce provider will challenge me, even my grocery store, online store will challenge me, right? But this parallel internet, which we call mobile network, worked completely differently, still works differently.</p>
<p>If I need to make a phone call, receive a phone call, send an SMS, receive an SMS, it doesn’t challenge me. My mobile network doesn’t say that “Hey, I don’t trust you. First, you prove that you are Gautam, then only you can make a phone call.” It doesn’t work that way. It just knows that it’s me, who is Gautam. So how did they do that? They actually created this identity layer. They actually created a mechanism which identifies this human user from day one, since 1991.</p>
<p>But we know this. How did they do that? They did that using this small gadget that we always carry in our mobile phone, this is the SIM. We almost forget that I, in the SIM, stands for identity. It’s Subscriber Identity Module. SIM was created to solve this identity problem in that parallel internet, which we call the mobile network, right?</p>
<p>So, isn’t that a solution? We were just ignoring it and also, just unfortunately, these mobile operators knowingly or unknowingly, kept this with themselves, right? What we are doing at Sekura.id, I’ll just mention here, that we are bringing in that identity layer from this parallel internet which we call the mobile network into this traditional internet so that we actually solve the fundamental problem rather than keep creating technologies on top like password, like SMS OTPs, like biometrics. And that is what will solve the problem from its root and bringing in an identity layer from this parallel internet to the traditional internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you for the explanation, of the lacking, missing identity layer of the internet. And then you put a parallel, I haven’t thought of it in that way, the parallel of the mobile network which always had this identifier of the subscriber. As you say, even in the term it’s subscribe, the SIM card. So, I understand that Sekura.id solution is primarily based on the SIM card. Tell us a bit more how it works and if you can give also how it works, Sekura.id besides being based on the SIM card.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. So, GSMA doing this Mobile Connect, the conceptual idea was very similar, right? It’s to utilise the assets from the mobile operators, not just the SIM card. SIM card is a cryptographic engine. But there’s a lot of data available with the mobile operators which can help to identify the human user without challenging them. &nbsp;And also, protect them without putting a hurdle for the user, like what user ID, password, OTPs or biometrics are. They are hurdles, right? They are actually saying, “Hey, you cannot access the service until you pass that hurdle.”</p>
<p>This is where Mobile Connect started and this is the journey that we are continuing in Sekular.id as well. So, in Sekular.id, what we do is, as I say, the SIM is a cryptographic engine. And now, in the digital world, there is realisation that all the different, let’s say, identification and authentication methods where the user is actively involved, which means the user is challenged to prove who they are, or authenticate themselves, that is a limitation. A limitation in the form of that you know, if let’s say the user has got an OTP they have received, these fraudsters will always call this user and say, “Hey, I’m calling from your bank, or I’m calling from the government, you have received an OTP, can you hand it over, right?” If the user is not involved, right, these fraudsters can call the user but they have nothing to handover. So in that case, we solved this problem of all the fraudulent activities that’s going on.</p>
<p>So now, there is a realisation in the digital world as I was seeing that we need to avoid involving the user. So we need to do passive authentication. And how do we do that? Cryptographic authentication is one way to do. So, Apple last year in WWDC announced these passkeys which is basically based on the FIDO, the Fast Identity Online mechanism, where this is reliance on cryptography and cryptographic key on the device. And then that’s how we identify the user, right?</p>
<p>But exactly same mechanism is what happens in the SIM. And it is happening for the last 30 years. There is a cryptographic key which sits in the SIM which the user is not even aware of. And that’s an important thing. The user is not aware. As soon as the user is aware, or the user is involved in that awareness, OK, all these problems will happen because these fraudsters will approach the user and try to do some funny things, right?</p>
<p>And that’s another aspect that we say that here, this cryptography is humanised. If the user is not involved, it just happens behind the scene. In that case, this technology is humanised. Invisibility is more humanised. Steve Jobs used to say that technology should either be beautiful or it should be invisible. So here, this technology is invisible so that makes it much more humanised, right?</p>
<p>So, at Sekura, we’re utilising this cryptography in the SIM to seamlessly, invisibly authenticate this user. At the same time, there are a lot of what we call signals associated with the SIM which can help protect the user, at the same time, identify the user. For example, one of the largest fraud happening in the digital space right now is SIM swap fraud, right?</p>
<p>If we can identify that hey, is there a recent SIM swap happen? By recent, I mean in the last few hours, for example, to one day. If there is a SIM swap happen, in that case, that’s a red flag, that might mean that the user who is in the transaction process, who is interacting with the digital service may not be the genuine user, it could be a fraudster who have got access to the phone number of the user and using their own SIM. That’s one data signal that’s there in the mobile, with the mobile operator, that doesn’t need to involve the user to ask if something has happened or not.</p>
<p>Similarly, setting up a call redirect, right? The fraudsters can actually setup a call redirect for my number calling up the operator, doing some mechanism, some process there where they can say, “Hey, I have lost my phone, or I left my phone at my home and I’m expecting an urgent call from my family who is in the hospital. Can you please redirect all the calls to my number to this?” If I can convince the operator, in that case what will happen is, all calls, SMSs will be redirected or forwarded to me as a fraudster, right? So, if we can actually identify, is their call forward active for this number? That data itself can protect the user, again, without involving the user. So, we have identified 66 such potential data signals which can invisibly protect the user and their identity. And that’s what we do at Sekura, working primarily with the mobile operators.</p>
<p>Oscar: I like the idea of this invisibility because from the beginning you started that the human side is going to make security fail, right? But if the human doesn’t have to be involved, yeah, I’m sure, there will be less hacking. So that is definitely the concept, it’s very interesting.</p>
<p>Gautam: And just to add there, Oscar, you know, of course, there is this identity protection, there is this authentication without involving the user. That element is there. At the same time, it is allowing these good guys to access the service, right? So, as I was giving that example, it’s me, right? I’m not the fraudster. It’s me who wants to pay a particular merchant online, right? And I’m assuming I’m the good guy, right? And I want to pay. In that case, there shouldn’t be a barrier for me, right? And it’s good for the business because the business will get me to pay them. That’s what they want, right? So, in that case, it’s important that the good guys should sail through, right? For them, there is no barrier.</p>
<p>If we make it invisible for the user, in that case, these good guys can actually access, you know, without any trouble. At the same time, because it’s invisible, we can actually protect this user behind the scene as well. What does that mean is – it’s not just helping out with the identity verification, security and authentication, it’s also getting better business. Because if we put barrier to the good customers, good users, in that case, there are dropouts happen.</p>
<p>We have been told by our clients all around the world that on an average globally 20% of the users dropout due to all these, let’s say, challenges. They say, “Hey, I’m not going to use it.” SMS OTP is needed to do our transaction or to pay and OTP doesn’t get delivered or it is delayed, the user say, “Hey, I’m not going to pay now, right?” So that will direct 20% on an average globally, dropouts happen.</p>
<p>Here, if you make it invisible, you don’t have any dropouts, right? Because there are no barriers. There is no door which is closed that needs to be opened. So, in that case, the businesses get 20% more conversion, so that’s more business, more revenue. So that element is also there, if you make is invisible using the mobile operator’s asset like the SIM and all the data. That needs to be considered as well alongside security.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what if, myself as a normal user, I want to try Sekura.id, how can I use it already? There might be some services which is already available?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. So one element here is you know as you can understand, this is B2B service, right? So the businesses are using us. Businesses are protecting that. All our services are, you know, they go through one single API, right? So, it’s not the user who is accessing our services directly. As I was giving the example, I, as a user, accessing my banking service, right? And my banking service is using the Sekura.id services through the API, right? So that’s how I, as a user, as a consumer use it. Not directly through Sekura, through my services. And then again, I may not be even aware that that service is getting used, right? Because this service, as I said, for the human user it’s invisible.</p>
<p>So majority of our clients right now are mostly from the financial services, so the major banks in the UK, they are using our one or more of the services like Barclays is using our services, Virgin Money is using our services. In the US as well, Morgan Stanley, they are using our services, Flora Bank, they are using our services.</p>
<p>But again, just to reiterate, it’s not a B2C service, right? So it’s not that me, as a consumer, is using the Sekular.id services. It’s my business who is using the service to help me as a user getting protected. And at the same time, no buyer has been put by the businesses to access it. And we are actually expanding globally. As I mentioned to you earlier, I was in India, I came back yesterday, we are actually launching in there. We have some very, very exciting discussions happened across the use cases there, not just in the financial sector, beyond as well. And then we will be announcing those pretty soon.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK,as soon as they are launched, it will be interesting to know what are these use cases. So, very interesting initiative that you have in Sekura.id. So what happens for instance if – because this depends on people having good mobile networks and good phones, so what happens if that’s not available in some regions in the world?</p>
<p>Gautam: That’s a very important question you ask, right? And there are two elements you said, one is good mobile phone. One of the thing that we really passionately believe in Sekura is inclusiveness. And that’s very important for us. We have a mission statement for identity for all and everything. So no one should be excluded from identity protection, right? And this is why we tackle it from multiple angles.</p>
<p>So for example, we have platform that we have created from ground up based on all our learning from the GSMA and also my learning from Vodafone. That platform can integrate with any mobile operator in the world, right? Because all mobile operators are different. There are 700 plus mobile operators there. Right now, we are connected to around 75 mobile operators globally and we want to connect to all. Why? Because we don’t want any operators to be excluded because if we exclude that, their consumers or their users will be excluded.</p>
<p>So, one example is in India, one of the phone smallest operator is BSNL, right? It’s government-owned operator. They are quite small. They don’t have platform. And they were actually not included in this identity space. So what we have done is we have provided our platform to them so that, that platform can actually connect to that mobile operator and then it can actually expose their services, right? So that we don’t want to exclude their users.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important, as you rightly asked. What happens if I don’t have a good phone? So, this is where the principle that we use in all our services has got two major aspects. One, I already talked about – not involving the user because if you don’t involve the user, we increase the security, because user is the weakest link, right? And rightly so. And the second thing is not depending on the mobile device, because that’s extremely critical. Because let’s say, if the user can afford an iPhone 15 right? Of course, that’s extremely secure. The key chain there where the keys are stored is a hardware, right? That’s an HSN. So, it will be extremely secure.</p>
<p>But what about the user in let’s say Southeast Asia or in Sub-Saharan Africa where it’s a sub $10 phone? That may not have that much security. So, it’s unfair on the user because they cannot be pay for that advanced phone, they are getting excluded from security and identity verification. At the same time, it is unfair on the businesses, they cannot rely on a security because the user cannot afford that high end phone.</p>
<p>That’s why that’s the principle we use. We don’t rely on the mobile device. What do we rely on? The SIM. The exact same SIM is in the iPhone 15 or any of the high-end devices or in the low-end, not so expensive phone and provides the exact same security, right? The cryptographic security that I talked about doesn’t differentiate whether it’s a very high-end, expensive phone or not so expensive, much simpler phone. So that’s an important element here, right? So, our services don’t rely on the device. It doesn’t matter what device the user is using.</p>
<p>Secondly, all the data elements that I talked about is in the mobile network. This is completely independent of what device it is. So that way as well, all those data elements that I talked about, all those 66 potential data elements are independent of the device. So, that’s how we use the service and then make it inclusive end to end, for any user, right?</p>
<p>The other thing you asked about is what if there is no mobile network? It doesn’t really matter. So, the way to look into this thing is, we are relying on the mobile network. But the user doesn’t have to use the mobile device even at that moment of time for majority of the services. For the authentication services, the mobile device need to be in the network. But again, if the mobile device is not in the mobile network, it is connected to Wi-Fi or any other networks, in that case, we have fall back mechanism because we cannot really, rely on the mobile network because the device is connected to Wi-Fi, still we have a fallback mechanism.</p>
<p>And in some regions, like in US, we have worked with one of the large mobile operator there. Where we have worked with them to utilise the SIM, even if the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Because even if the mobile device is not connected to the mobile network, still there is a SIM there, right? If you can reach out to the SIM, we protect the device anyway.</p>
<p>And the other thing I was talking about, all these 66 potential data signals, they are available at the mobile operator’s secure CRMs, CVM and all the OSS, BSS system, right? So they don’t need the user to be using the mobile device at that moment of time. For example, if there is a SIM swap that has happened in the last few hours, the mobile operators databases, they already are aware of that even if there is no network. So, all our services other than the authentication service which we call SAFr Auth, all our services are data-related or signal-related services where these businesses, let’s say, this is a bank or an e-commerce provider or even a social media provider, their server makes the API call to our platform to get this data signal. So the mobile device is not involved, mobile network is not also involved there. Because again, we want that inclusivity for every user to be involved in there.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Well, definitely very novel way of addressing these problems. So I’d like to ask you one final question, Gautam, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot Oscar for asking that. The most important thing to add into their agenda is an acknowledgement that the internet doesn’t have that identity layer. Because that’s a fundamental problem. Because if we start to add technologies on top to fill the gap, that will not solve the problem. And we have seen over the years, right? We have seen user ID password, they didn’t solve that, SMS OTP or any form of OTP, they didn’t solve that. Then we added all sorts of other OTPs, right? TOTPs, authenticated apps, we even used those RSA tokens that we used to carry on. Then we evolved into biometrics. And by the way, biometrics, I’m sure your audience is aware of this, after Generative AI, every form of biometrics is challenged.</p>
<p>And then actually, you know, interestingly, LexisNexis, which is one of the largest fraud management provider on app based in US, their CEO of the government affairs came to the press. This person gave an interview to Fox News in June, saying that we are so much relying on these biometrics and after Generative AI revolution, there is a financial impact in the industry and then that impact is around 1 Trillion USD because every form of biometric is challenged through this Generative AI. Not just through deep fake, through all sorts of mechanism. I mean you can actually search the internet on those kind of fraudulent activities happening on almost a weekly basis.</p>
<p>So, let’s acknowledge that there is a fundamental issue with the internet and that’s no one’s fault because internet was not designed for that. If you acknowledge that, then we can solve the fundamental problem, right? And that can be done through the already existing identity layer which is existing in the mobile operators. Let’s work through that and solve the problem forever.</p>
<p>So, basically, what I am saying is, let’s bring in that identity layer from that parallel internet which we call mobile internet into the traditional internet. And let’s solve that problem at the root. And that’s what we are doing in Sekura.id. And that’s what we would invite all the leaders in the digital space to look into and solve the problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you very much, Gautam, for this very insightful conversation. And let us know if people would like to find more about you on the net, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot, Oscar. Thanks for inviting me. I am on LinkedIn. Please connect to me. It’s Gautam Hazari, G-A-U-T-A-M H-A-Z-A-R-I. If you Google me, you will find me there as well. And also, please visit Sekura.id, S-E-K-U-R-A.ID. You will find insightful solutions there and also we post lots of insightful stories, articles, blogs and what the future is looking like. Recently, one of my article is published in Forbes, I’m calling it Internet of Thoughts, where the future is coming and where, if you don’t solve this identity crisis in the internet it may create more issues. So, please reach out. Please look into Sekura.id and let’s solve this identity crisis together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, of course. Again, thank you very much Gautam for this conversation, and all the best.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thank you very much Oscar for having me.</p>

<p>Exactly one year ago, on November 16, 2022, the first post on Bluesky was created:</p>

The first post on Bluesky.
<p>Fast forward a year later, and we’ve just crossed two million users after opening the app to users around February. We’re excited to continue growing a truly open social network.</p>
 Toward Federation 
<p>Imagine you’ve just spent 10 years building your audience and making friends on a social platform, only to decide that it’s no longer for you. When you leave this platform, you’re essentially leaving behind all of your relationships, your saved posts, and more.</p>
<p>We’ve been there too, and we’re similarly tired of packing our bags each time another platform winds down and everyone collectively moves to the next big thing. Signing up for a new social network every few years and losing all our data on former ones shouldn’t be the price that we have to pay in order to keep our relationships online.</p>
<p>That’s why our biggest priority right now is launching federation, which is <a href="https://atproto.com/blog/2023-protocol-roadmap">timelined</a> for early next year. This is one of the core features of Bluesky that makes it “billionaire-proof” — you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too.</p>
 A Public Network 

<p>More exciting news: around the end of this month, we’ll release a public web interface. With this, you’ll be able to view posts on Bluesky without being logged in on an account.</p>
<p>This will make posts on Bluesky much more accessible, which will be especially useful for real-time commentary and breaking news.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Bluesky is a public social network, so your posts, likes, etc. have always been publicly accessible through the API. We designed Bluesky with the openness of the internet in mind, and you can think of your profile as a blog on the internet. To read more about data privacy on Bluesky, here’s our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/5-19-2023-user-faq">user FAQ</a>.</p>
 Other Updates 
<p>In between all of the above, we’ve also shipped some much-requested features, including:</p>
 
 Mobile push notifications: receive notifications on your phone 
 General user lists: add users to shareable lists and see their posts in one feed 
 Email verification: verify your account email for added security 
 Advanced feed and thread preferences: sort replies by time, likes, or randomly; see replies from your follows first; show/hide replies or quote posts in your feeds, and more 
 Media tab for user profiles: easily find and see the photos that a user has posted 
 A Likes tab on your own profile: see all your liked posts in one place 
 Improved startup and loading time: reduces the time spent loading the app 
 Suggested follows: get recommended follows based on each user 
 Accessibility improvements: improvements to alt text, component labels, screen flashing, and more 
 
<p>And there’s much more to come — join us for the ride! See you on <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>!</p>

  <p>Most contemporary digital identity discussions deserve another label: They are mostly about electronic trust ecosystems, considering all kinds of attributes beyond just pure identity. Additionally, nowadays they include natural persons, legal entities and (internet of) things. Everyone seems to agree the future is decentralized and all this only works with these curious wallets. Andre Kudra takes us on a journey through electronic trust ecosystems, diving into questions like: Which ones do we already have today? Some are successful, others not – why? Regulators are on it, too: What will eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDIW bring? What’s in the pipeline in other parts of the world? Will organizational digital identity (ODI) now invoke the breakthrough of decentralized identity overall? Why is decentralized identity the only way for Zero Trust Architectures which deserve the name?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/electronic-trust-ecosystems-cre23"></a>

  <p>As artificial intelligence continues its upward trajectory, a radical proposition emerges: Could AI take the helm of cybersecurity leadership? This bold discourse dives into the heart of this debate, exploring whether AI can effectively shoulder responsibilities traditionally assigned to a chief information security officer. Areas of exploration include AI's potential in threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response.</p>
<p>But where does human judgment fit into this AI-dominated picture? Is the seasoned expertise of a CISO irreplaceable? This electrifying discussion stirs the pot of the future of cybersecurity leadership, grappling with the balance between emerging AI capabilities and indispensable human expertise.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-will-not-do-ciso-job-cre23"></a>

  <p>The realm of cloud security has been extensively covered in books and articles, yet a crucial aspect remains ripe for exploration. It revolves around the fundamental understanding of what your cloud service provider offers and, equally vital, where your responsibilities lie in the realm of cloud security.</p>
<p><br> When embarking on the journey of adopting a cloud service, the foremost question to answer is, "What aspects of security do I need to oversee?" In a traditional on-premises setting, roles are distinct: IT manages infrastructure, information and cybersecurity handles security, and application developers bear the responsibility for code integrity. However, the landscape is evolving, with many organizations embracing DevOps, where these responsibilities are often shared, and the lines between development and operations blur or vanish.</p>
<p>Regardless of organizational structure, the majority of security obligations reside within your company's domain when you use an on-prem environment. Transitioning from an on-premises environment to a cloud environment presents one of the most intricate challenges—a more intricate shared responsibility model for security.</p>
<p>In the context of cloud security, two paramount concerns need close attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is the risk of misconfiguration. In a cloud environment, misconfigurations can inadvertently expose sensitive data and vulnerabilities, underscoring the critical importance of ensuring that cloud services and resources are set up correctly to mitigate such risks.</p>
<p>The second concern is insider attacks. Cloud users often lack influence over the staff of cloud service providers, making it essential to consider the possibility of insider threats. While cloud service providers typically promise robust security measures in place, it's crucial for organizations to implement their own layers of security to safeguard against insider attacks and unauthorized access, fortifying the shared responsibility model in the cloud.</p>
<p>In my presentation, I will delve into these intricacies, providing valuable insights and real-world examples of what your cloud service provider can do, irrespective of your specific needs and/or preferences.</p>

  <p>Fraud is a major cost to businesses worldwide. Banking, finance, payment services, and retail are some of the most frequent targets of fraudsters. However, insurance, gaming, telecommunications, health care, cryptocurrency exchanges, government assistance agencies, travel and hospitality, and real estate are increasingly targeted as cybercriminals have realized that most online services trade in monetary equivalents. After years of being the focus of cybercriminals, banking and financial institutions are more likely to be better secured than other industries, meaning that fraudsters are increasingly likely to attack any potentially lucrative target if given the opportunity. Fraud perpetrators are continually diversifying and innovating their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).</p>
<p>The most prevalent types of fraud businesses, non-profit organizations, and government agencies experience today are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Takeover (ATO) Fraud - occurs when fraudsters use breached passwords, phishing, social engineering and credential stuffing attacks to execute unauthorized transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Opening (AO) Fraud – also called New Account Fraud or Synthetic Fraud, often happens as a result of using stolen identities or assemblages of personal information to create synthetic digital IDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session we will provide an overview of Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms and show the highlights of our latest research in this area.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/technology-powers-fraud-prevention-cre23"></a>

  <p>Paul Fisher delves into the multifaceted approach required to foster trustworthiness within complex software supply chains. This discussion begins by delineating the critical components of software supply chains and the potential risks associated with each link—from development and deployment to maintenance and decommissioning.</p>
<p>Key to establishing a chain of confidence is the adoption of transparent processes and tools that provide verifiable evidence of security at each step. The audience will be introduced to Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), cryptographic signing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines fortified with automated security checks.</p>
<p>The talk will also consider the human aspect, emphasizing the need for cultivating a culture of security awareness and collaboration among stakeholders. This includes not only developers and security professionals but also suppliers, distributors, and end-users.<br>Finally, the talk will provide actionable insights and strategies for organizations to audit, monitor, and continuously improve their software supply chains.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/chain-of-confidence-cre23"></a>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>A couple of years ago, I published a blog post <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/11/aes-turns-20/">AES Turns 20</a>, celebrating the 20th year since the trusted symmetric algorithm was approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In the article, I dug into post-quantum and how Lov Grover’s quadratic speed-up algorithm might be applied to brute force attacks on symmetric algorithms. NIST’s position on this remains unchanged; symmetric algorithms such as AES 192 and AES 256 bit are good for the next couple of decades. The general recommendation persists: Anything with less than 112 bits of classical security should not be used. If there are any doubts, consider doubling the key length if you are using shorter bit lengths.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about the post-quantum threats being discussed and the Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attack frequently mentioned on technology websites and cited by some of my colleagues. I decided a blog post was in order to investigate a bit further. My colleague Dave Butcher, Technical Sales Consultant, is as passionate about PQ as I am, and I enlisted him to discuss the topic in more detail and exchange ideas.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap on what is meant by Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. The attack assumes that classical encryption techniques applied to data today, to make it unreadable and unusable, will in the future be vulnerable to attack from post-quantum computers. They will be able to crack the hard math problems that today’s computers would take in some cases hundreds and even thousands of years to solve. So, the idea is bad actors and nation-states will intercept and steal (harvest) data. They’ll then store it and wait until quantum computers are capable of crunching the numbers and decrypting the data to make it readable.</p>
 Data In Motion With TLS 
<p>Some of you might be thinking that most data at rest is encrypted using symmetric algorithms like AES, so surely we are in decent shape and this isn’t a real threat? I initially jumped to the same conclusion and then realized it is a bit more nuanced. Data at rest is typically encrypted using symmetric algorithms like AES and should be resilient to Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attacks. However, data is typically transported to a location before it comes to rest using network switches, routers, load balancers, etc. And this is where is gets a bit more nuanced. As data is moved around on the internet, a range of communication protocols are in play. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the de facto protocol in use on the Internet securing HTTPS web pages, email, WhatsApp, and a myriad of other applications. To establish a secure connection between a client and server the TLS handshake is invoked:</p>
 
 The client sends a Hello message detailing the TLS version being used and available cipher suite. 
 The server responds back with their Hello message confirming TLS version and cipher suite followed by the server’s certificate, which includes the public key of the server’s asymmetric key pair. 
 This is then used in a key exchange where a symmetric-based session key is encrypted and sent to the server using the server’s public key. 
 
<p>The server now has the same symmetric encryption key as the client – this is a pre-requisite for symmetric encryption. A secure bi-direction channel is now established between client and server and data can be efficiently encrypted, transported, and stored at its final destination.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The main takeaway here is the session key is based on a symmetric algorithm, which is the most efficient way to encrypt bulk data – asymmetric algorithms are not efficient at<br>
encrypting bulk data. Based on current NIST recommendations, as long as the symmetric key is a decent length of bits it’ll be resistant to a PQ attack. However, the asymmetric public/private keys used in the key exchange step are most likely using RSA- or elliptic-curve-based cryptography. These are the classical asymmetric algorithms that Peter Shor identified in the late 1990s as being vulnerable to being compromised by a quantum computer. It is unlikely that state-sponsored actors will be targeting data stored at rest; instead they’ll be targeting data in transit armed with the knowledge that asymmetric keys are used in the key exchange process. If they can intercept that transaction and store it away while biding their time, then in the future they’ll be able to use a quantum computer to factorize the asymmetric key pair, allowing them to expose the symmetric key and thus decrypt the data. Voila!</p>
 Actionable Steps to Mitigate Against Harvest Now, Decrypt Later 
<p>So, Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is a valid concern for organizations who store long-term encrypted data. What steps should you be taking to mitigate such attacks?</p>
 
 Start using longer symmetric key lengths. This is likely an easy change as AES with a 256-bit key has been part of the AES standard from the beginning. Most TLS services rely on standard TLS implementations that include configurable cipher suites. Changing to a longer key length is likely as easy as updating a configuration file and restarting a service. Many other tools you are using may also have this option. 
 Consider adding protection to communication paths that move high-value data to prevent Harvest Now, Decrypt Later later attacks. For example, there are VPN implementations (e.g. Open Quantum Safe’s OpenVPN project) that have been built using newer quantum-resistant cryptography. These are not fully standardized, but when you control both ends of a communication path (for example, between a branch location and headquarters) utilizing a non-standard protocol is not an issue. 
 Think about using pre-shared keys for certain interactions where you share symmetric encryption keys out of band, such as by exchanging physical media. This eliminates the asymmetric key exchange that is vulnerable to quantum computers. 
 Understand if there are already quantum-resistant versions of the protocol that you are using that you could migrate to today. For example, the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/#introduction">Signal messaging protocol</a> has been updated to be quantum-resistant. Consider becoming a first adopter. 
 Prioritize crypto-agility within your organization. Planning and building crypto-agility are going to be key to adopting quantum-safe cryptography. While this does not fix the problem today, it puts your organization in the best position to quickly adopt post-quantum cryptography as it becomes available and minimize the vulnerability window for Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. 
 
<p>One of the tools that can help you plan is Mosca’s Theorem. Understanding how long your data needs to be secure is key to prioritizing projects to mitigate Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. Data that has fleeting value is probably not at high risk for Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. Data whose value remains high even as time begins to approach the advent of cryptographically relevant quantum computers needs to be a priority for secondary protection. Mosca’s Theorem is discussed in more detail in an earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/07/a-bridge-to-post-quantum-cryptography/">A Bridge to Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>.</p>
 The PQC Elephant in the Room 
<p>The elephant in the room when post-quantum cryptography is being discussed is “when”? When is this going to happen? The answer is of course we don’t really know. It could be five years away. It could also be 10 or 20+ years away. However, to play devil’s advocate, what if nation-state actors already have quantum computers with sufficient processing capability running in their labs? It’s not quite apples to apples, but there are some precedents. Public key cryptography was first postulated by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 and its implementation as RSA announced in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman. At least that is what was understood to be the case until in 1997 some UK secrets held by Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) became declassified, revealing that British mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Cocks">Clifford Cocks</a>, working for the&nbsp;intelligence agency, described an equivalent public/private key system in an internal document in 1973. Whether it was ever used is pure speculation, but it does illustrate the art of the possible. With that we will leave you to ponder, but at least you should now be clear that Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is real.</p>

<p>In late October, Ocean Protocol sponsored a General &amp; DeFi theme hackathon at ETHMiami. Participants could select a technology stack to build upon in teams, creating a tool, business case, proof of concept, or other applications using the chosen technology stack.</p><p>Approximately 17% of the teams at the hackathon opted into taking the Ocean Protocol track. The top 3 projects, as scored by the protocol and hackathon organizers, received prizes for their execution, creativity, and technology implementation.</p><p>Three distinctive projects applied blockchain and Ocean technologies to niche mini-product and platform offerings, which led to increased use and flexibility of the Ocean Protocol. Their product abstracts and information were as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st — xTRUST — Decentralized Trust&nbsp;Fund <p>The team behind xTRUST aimed to build a service with privacy-preserving data sharing through smart contracts. This allowed a guarantor to fund a contract, designate a beneficiary, set a time interval, and define the conditions for the transfer of ownership. Beneficiaries could redeem and allow access through the Ocean Protocol’s access control mechanisms within the limits set by the guarantor. xTRUST targeted a traditional financial wealth and data ownership management gap, offering a digital asset transfer solution. The team was inspired by Ocean Protocol’s initiatives in safe AI, finance, and data sharing, focusing on democratizing access to opportunities. They demonstrated their application using the Ocean <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">Smart Contract</a> libraries for various functions and hosted the dApp on&nbsp;AWS.</p><p>This niche financial mini-product targets a demand in traditional financial wealth management and data ownership management does not equate to support: Digital Assets and ownership transfers.</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s mission statement and value proposition inspired the team to ensure safe AI, Finance, and data sharing globally while preserving privacy.</p><p>View xTrust <a href="https://github.com/Jacob8765/eth-miami-hackathon">Github Repository</a>.</p><p>In this short concept and idea definition, the repository above shows the team’s basic attempt to launch a full-stack DeFi dApp for initiating trust funds and enabling a beneficiary to redeem them. In the hackathon, they were able&nbsp;to:</p><p>- Develop a minimum solidity&nbsp;contract</p><p>- Sketch out the UI in&nbsp;Figma</p><p>- Begin implementation of the front-end UX/UI</p><p>- Set up AWS infrastructure to host the&nbsp;dApp</p> 2nd — Data Sea — Data Access &amp; Ownership <p>Data Sea was on a mission to revolutionize data access and ownership. They addressed the problem of accessing niche and consistent datasets, which is incredibly challenging in the real estate, finance, and healthcare sectors. Data Sea’s solution included features like encrypted data streaming, consumer data ownership, dynamic NFTs, ERC-20 access tokens for secure data transfer, and robust data storage using Ocean’s technology. They also provided an automated AI integration for property data and a mechanism for data reselling. Data Sea outlined simple steps for uploading data, controlling access with tokens, reselling data, and integrating AI.</p><p>DataSea took a mission statement to ‘Revolutionizing Data Access &amp; Ownership’</p><p>This team diagnosed features used to offer solutions to the problem statement above:</p>  Encrypted Data Streaming: DataSea allows providers to stream waves of encrypted datasets and AI models to buyers, ensuring security and authenticity.  Consumer Data Ownership: Empower users with the ability to securely sell their data, fostering a new age of data sovereignty.  Dynamic NFTs: Utilization of Ocean Protocol to create dynamic NFTs that store encrypted user data, combining data innovation with blockchain integrity.  ERC20 Access Tokens: Facilitating the secure access and transfer of data ownership.  ERC 725 Data Storage: Leveraging Ocean’s key-value pairing, DataSea provides a robust data storage mechanism, ensuring consistency and reliability.  Reselling Mechanism: Owners can monetize their data by reselling the ownership and tokenized data through the dispensary.  Automated AI Integration: Streamlining property data to seamlessly integrate into AI or predictive models, paving the way for cutting-edge analytics.  <p>Knowing the relevant features above, we can showcase Ocean Protocol tools to execute full capability interactions with smart contracts for both NFT and access token creation.</p><p>Further, this concept proves an alternative use of various core Ocean Technologies including <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge">Barge</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius">Aquarius</a>, &amp; <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider">Provider</a>: Here, these tools are responsible for storing and encrypting data tied to&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Data Sea <a href="https://github.com/imatomster/DataSea">Github Repository</a>.</p><p>Congratulations to the team for an excellent hackathon sprint!</p> 3rd — FINZA — Crypto-backed Mortgages <p>FINZA aimed to connect dream homes with crypto-backed mortgages. They tackled issues such as high down payments, complex mortgage approvals, and traditional barriers to entry. Before the hackathon, FINZA had already partnered with <a href="https://propy.com/home/">PROPY</a> to leverage blockchain technology for real estate transactions. They developed a Smart Contract-Based DeFi Mortgage Platform that allowed crypto assets to be used as collateral and offered opportunities for liquidity provision.</p>A simple hand-drawn sketch acts as a title slide for the FINZA startup&nbsp;vision<p>The startup is actively exploring technology to implement in its journey. For this hackathon track, Ocean Protocol access control, signature, and data sharing capabilities were put to exploration.</p><p>FINZA has already developed a pioneering, Smart Contract based, DeFi Mortgage Platform that not only lets you use your crypto assets as collateral but also offers a chance for others to earn by providing liquidity to our decentralized pool.</p><p>A brief <a href="https://photos.onedrive.com/share/8E5666391FA96D03!160770?cid=8E5666391FA96D03&amp;resId=8E5666391FA96D03!160770&amp;authkey=!ALLEYOQyLlv7P_U&amp;ithint=video&amp;e=wsnW9V">Demonstration Video</a> details the service’s function and user&nbsp;journey.</p><p>View Finza <a href="https://github.com/Jacob8765/eth-miami-hackathon">Github Repository</a>.</p> Summary <p>Ocean Protocol was able to form a strategic partnership with the organizers of ETH Miami for recurring participation of Ocean Technology up for grabs at the annual hackathon. For the development of Ocean, a Miami-based hackathon provided valuable insights on how everyday people were able to pick up and build on ocean technology, understand the tools, and apply them to business applications and software tools of their choosing. Hats off to all those who chose the Ocean Protocol track to compete in. Lastly, warm praise to the top 3 projects!</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable people to privately &amp; securely publish, exchange, and consume&nbsp;data.</p><p>Follow Ocean on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter</a> or<a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a> to keep up to date.

 Protect access to all applications and resources with Security Service Edge 
<p><br>Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution, <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">now in preview</a>, includes Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access, and secures access to any app or resource for users and devices connecting from anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integrations across Microsoft’s SSE solution and the Microsoft Entra portfolio make it possible to enforce unified Conditional Access policies that consider identity, device, application, and now network conditions before granting access to any application or website. This works no matter which identity provider the application uses—without requiring any changes to the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many of you are testing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access?rtc=1">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a>, our identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG), to secure access for Microsoft 365 traffic. We are expanding the public preview to include all internet apps and resources by the end of 2023 with new core capabilities:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Context-aware SWG with web content filtering to restrict end user access to unsafe and non-compliant content.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Universal Conditional Access to extend adaptive access controls to any network destination, such as an external website or a non-federated SaaS application.  &nbsp; 
 Compliant Network Check,&nbsp;an easy-to-manage construct within Conditional Access. With this control, you can protect Microsoft Entra integrated cloud applications against token theft and ensure users do not bypass network security policies specific to their tenant while accessing critical cloud services.&nbsp; 
 Source IP restoration in ID Protection and Conditional Access location policies that maintains each user’s original source IP to enable backward compatibility of trusted location checks and continuous access evaluation, identity risk detection, and logging.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> is our identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) for any private app or resource. New capabilities in private preview include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for more protocols in addition to TCP, including UDP and private DNS, so you’ll be able to transition from your traditional Virtual Private Network (VPN) to a modern ZTNA solution. 
 Conditional Access controls and modern authentication methods, such as multifactor authentication (MFA), to secure access to all private applications and resources for remote and on-premises users. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our SSE solution works with your existing security and network solutions through integrations across Microsoft’s security stack and open partner ecosystem. We’re partnering with other vendors in this space, starting with <a href="https://docs.netskope.com/en/netskope-help/integrations-439794/solution-guides/microsoft-security-and-netskope-integration-solution-guide/microsoft-and-netskope-sse-coexistence/">Netskope</a>, to demonstrate seamless side-by-side operation in the same environment. We’re committed to giving you the flexibility to choose the SSE solution that best fits the network traffic in your environment. For both Internet Access and Private Access, we’re also announcing cross-OS client support for Windows and Android in public preview, and for MacOS and iOS in private preview. Our SSE solution is now available globally (except in China and Russia) with SSE edge locations coming in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us at our upcoming <a href="https://aka.ms/AccelerateSecurity">Tech Accelerator Ask Microsoft Anything (AMA) session</a> to discuss with our product experts all your questions about Microsoft’s SSE solution!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies and more 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, we turned on security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/new-name">Azure Active Directory</a>) for almost seven million existing tenants, which cut the number of compromises in those tenants by 80 percent. Based on the positive customer feedback, we’re helping more Microsoft Entra ID customers protect themselves by automatically enrolling eligible tenants into Conditional Access policies based on customer risk signals, current usage, and licensing. Microsoft-managed conditional access policies&nbsp;will start with three policies that enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) in high-risk scenarios. You can learn more details in Alex Weinert’s recent blog post, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant with Microsoft managed Conditional Access policies. The policy details are shown in a context pane to the right, indicating that the selected policy requires certain administrator roles to perform multifactor authentication when accessing the Microsoft admin portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But not all MFA methods offer equal protection. The more effective MFA methods, such as FIDO2 Security keys, Windows Hello, Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA), and passkeys, use cryptographic techniques to make authentication phishing-resistant. The preview of Microsoft Entra CBA allows you to tailor authentication policies by certificate, resource type, and user group. All these phishing-resistant authentication methods make it possible to eliminate passwords altogether, so they can’t be guessed, intercepted, or phished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is committed to supporting passkeys across our ecosystem, starting with Windows 11. Once you create a passkey for a website, application, or service using Windows Hello, you can sign in from your device using your face, fingerprint, or device PIN. This gives enterprises and government customers an additional, phishing-resistant alternative to physical FIDO2 security keys. Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to sign in using passkeys managed from the Microsoft Authenticator app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Lastly <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-protection">Microsoft Entra ID Protection</a> now detects anomalies such as an unusual token lifetime or a token played from an unfamiliar location. When a trigger is alerted, Conditional Access can immediately expire the token and force reauthentication along with other measures, such as a password reset or step-up MFA, without requiring manual intervention. If a user makes a password change on-premises, Entra ID Protection can now <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/remediate-user-risks-in-microsoft-entra-id-protection-through-on/ba-p/3773129">automatically remediate their risk</a>. This makes it easier for hybrid organizations to take advantage of user risk policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Integrations for more robust Permissions Management 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management">Microsoft Entra Permissions Management</a> has two significant integrations that will give you insights on permission risks so you can improve your security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/PermissionsManagementDefenderForCloud">Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) integration</a> preview consolidates identity and access permission insights with other cloud security information in a single interface. This view will display actionable recommendations for addressing permissions risks, as well as the Permissions Creep Index, and make it easier to enforce least privilege access for cloud resources across Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Permissions Management integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC), which is now in public preview, provides and efficient way to consolidate insights into other cloud security posture information on a single interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/ServiceNowPoD">second integration</a>, now generally available, allows ServiceNow&nbsp;customers to request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) via the ServiceNow portal. This popular IT service management (ITSM) solution strengthens your Zero Trust posture by adding access permission requests to existing approval workflows in ServiceNow. Now when a user requests access approvals, the ServiceNow Plugin fetches the latest data from Permissions Management, then sends the requested user permissions, along with time-bound approval based on the requestor’s roles, back to ServiceNow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Evolving secure identity and network access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adopting a single integrated solution with comprehensive capabilities with Microsoft Entra will simplify access security for your admins and give your end users a better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra portfolio works together to help you secure identities, devices, networks, and workloads. It extends to any user type, including customers, partners, and digital workloads. And now, with our SSE solution, Microsoft Entra is converging identity and network access controls into a single policy engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the latest innovations in Microsoft Entra will make it easier for you to secure access to everything for everyone.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland – November 15, 2023 – <a href="https://appruvr.co.uk/?ref=blog.dock.io">Appruvr</a>, a platform that automates the qualification verification process for employers and candidates, announced the integration of <a href="http://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a>’s Verifiable Credential technology. Using Verifiable Credentials, Appruvr makes it easy for organizations to verify credentials instantly without contacting the issuing party or checking physical documents while enabling individuals to control their own data.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credential</a> is a fraud-proof digital document that proves something about an individual or entity, such as someone’s identity or qualification. Verifiable Credentials are instantly verifiable and enable users to present information in a privacy-preserving way.&nbsp; </p> Problems: Credential Fraud and Unnecessarily Long Verification Processes  <p>Delaney Millward, Founder of Apprurvr, started the company because he had first-hand experience of seeing how many job applicants embellished their credentials. He relied on websites including LinkedIn and recruitment agencies but found many people didn’t fit what they were looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with the traditional recruitment processes is that the information relies solely on what candidates claim they are qualified for. This experience started his journey to find a solution where an organization could quickly and efficiently verify the credentials. At the time, the solution didn’t exist.</p><p>Credential fraud is a huge global problem:&nbsp;</p>  83% of employers believe their hires have lied about qualifications  1 in 5 employers admit to not verifying graduate qualifications  47% of job applicants admit to inflating grades  Fake diplomas and degrees make 7 billion dollars a year worldwide  Credential fraud costs UK businesses £23 billion pounds every year  <p>Credential fraud has financial consequences and affects public safety, particularly when fraudsters work in high-stakes jobs like surgeons, nurses, or construction workers. Many people around the world have died or been injured by unqualified people working in jobs that they got as a result of fake credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>Credential verification is still generally slow, complex and expensive. To illustrate, even the fastest verification times are approximately 3.8 days, which is cumbersome when we consider the speed of the job market in many sectors. Employers don’t have the capacity to verify all of these credentials, particularly when they need to hire many people in a short period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Appruvr is at the forefront of harnessing verifiable credential technology to solve credential fraud issues and give organizations the solutions to make credential verification easier and faster.</p> How Dock's Technology Enables Appruvr to Fast-Track the Credential Verification Process <p>When Appruvr was building their solution and researching Verifiable Credential providers, they felt that Dock could meet their technological needs and shared the same goals of empowering both organizations and individuals with tools to make the journey from education to employment more seamless and efficient.</p><p>These are some of the key benefits of Verifiable Credentials in the education and workforce sectors:&nbsp;</p>  Employers can hire candidates faster because they can check the authenticity of credentials instantly.&nbsp;  Organizations can verify credentials without storing that data because individuals hold and control the data on their mobile identity wallet app.  Graduates can conveniently and efficiently prove their credentials in a way that preserves their privacy without relying on a third party.  Job applicants can prove their credentials anywhere in the world at any time in an era where remote and gig work is growing.  <p>By integrating Dock’s <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credentials Platform</a>, Appruvr seamlessly transforms education and workforce credentials into fraud-proof and instantly Verifiable Credentials. Verifiable Credentials leverage cutting-edge cryptography, ensuring strong data integrity and protection against tampering.</p><p>“Dock’s partnership with Appruvr will lead the way in introducing new and innovative technology that will have significant benefits for the background screening industry, and support the drive towards true digital hiring whilst removing the pain felt by all who utilize current screening methods. We are very excited through this partnership to bring verifiable digital credentials to the mainstream, creating an ecosystem where individuals are back in control of their data and employers can verify a candidate's credentials in a matter of moments.” said Delaney Millward, Appruvr’s CEO.</p><p>"Our collaboration with Appruvr is more than just a technology partnership; it's a shared vision to transform how credentials are verified and combat pervasive credential fraud. We're uniting our strengths to make credential verification seamless and secure by providing organizations with the tools to verify credentials instantly while placing data control back into the hands of individuals," said Nick Lambert, Dock's CEO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> About Appruvr <p>Appruvr simplifies credential sharing between learning providers, candidates, and employers. Using blockchain technology, the verification is not only quick, the results are 100% reliable and secure. Appruvr's solution has been specifically designed to improve the recruitment journey for employers, institutions and candidates. Bringing qualification checks into the 21st century to stop recruitment fraud and the reliance on outdated and inefficient processes.</p> About Dock <p>Dock’s Verifiable Credential platform makes any data fraud-proof and instantly verifiable. It comprises the Certs API, the Certs no-code web app, an ID wallet and a dedicated blockchain. Using Dock, organizations reduce data verification costs while increasing the operational efficiency of verifying and issuing digital credentials. Individuals can fully control their data to access products and services more conveniently in a privacy-preserving way. Dock has been a leader in decentralized digital identity technology since 2017 and trusted by organizations in diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, and education.</p>

  <p>AI actors are poised to eclipse the number of human users on the internet. Many industry observers have decried such growth, pointing to the immense risks that such a brave new world poses. How can security systems even keep up with the rate of expansion in AI technologies? How can enterprises hope to compete with the vast amounts of money, time, and resources that AI companies use to train their models? Such questions presage a significant evolution in the way the tech industry envisions, develops, and deploys security systems.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a way forward, but it requires the cybersecurity market to shift toward a pattern that follows what AI vendors have done: make the science of biological systems the template for cybersecurity. Breakthroughs in social science, political science, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience demonstrate that our focus should be on establishing trustful relationships rather than a direct reliance on structural interventions such as identity management, attack surface management, and zero trust practices. The pathways that enable biological entities to come to trust and successfully collaborate with each other are known to science. In this presentation, Global Head of Research Mike Neuenschwander will delve into what changes are coming to the security market in order to achieve such levels of trust online.&nbsp; The presentation will provide a market roadmap for vendors, enterprises, governments, and standards organizations alike to create a security model that is highly collaborative and ultimately highly trustworthy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-future-of-security-is-collaborative-cre23"></a>

  <p>The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which entered into force on 16 January 2023 and will apply from 17 January 2025, aims to enhance the digital operational resilience of entities across the EU financial sector and to further harmonise key digital operational resilience requirements for all EU financial entities. DORA sets out uniform requirements for the security of network and information systems of companies and organisations operating in the financial sector as well as critical third parties which provide ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) services to them, such as cloud computing or data analytics services. DORA creates a regulatory framework on digital operational resilience, whereby all financial entities need to make sure they can withstand, respond to, and recover from all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats. These requirements are homogenous across the EU, with the core aim to prevent and mitigate cyber threats. DORA is complemented with several “regulatory technical standards (‘RTS’)” which give more details on requirements for cyber security.</p>
<p>As the whole DORA legislation cannot be presented in a short timeframe, I will focus on the part that is most important to ensure cybersecurity and the part that is the most interesting one for the audience, the RTS on ICT Risk Management Framework. I will give a quick overview and highlight the topics, which will bring the most workload to the industry. The biggest challenges will be in the areas of Asset Management, Operations Security, Network Security and Encryption.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/what-are-the-main-challenges-cre23"></a>

  <p>How can I effectively address cybersecurity vulnerabilities within my organization? Also, what are the implications of the Cyberresilience Act for this? EDITH, the European Digital Innovation Hub for Hesse, has extended an invitation to Dr. Steven Arzt, a cybersecurity expert from the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT, for a #DigiTalk session discussing best practices for Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure.</p>
<p>Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) is the process with which ethical hackers report vulnerabilities in software and systems to manufacturers and system operators. Researchers commonly often assess the security status of a system or product independently, i.e., without a formal invitation, contract or integration into a company’s strategy. While these unasked-for vulnerability reports are still considered an insult by some companies, others openly embrace their value for strengthening the company’s IT security by interacting with the hacking and research communities. In his talk, Dr. Arzt shows how a proper CVD process can greatly benefit companies and the wider IT security community at the same time. It is shown how CVD can not only help identify and fix vulnerabilities, but also send a strong positive message about a company’s attitude towards IT security.</p>

  <p>Vulnerability Management is more then ever an important building block when it comes to early detection of issues to allow a proactive counter measure. This is only possible if various organizational areas work hand in hand starting from the information security strategy, over architecture, engineering, operations and the business side. This needs to be embedded in an according information security framework that defines the rules and requirements based on which the vulnerability management service is operated. However, this approach is only complete with an according target operating model that defines the various building blocks that contribute to a successful end-to-end service.</p>

Using the same tools for asset discovery, risk assessment and automatic checks for compliance of the customers environment.</p>
<p>So the solution should not just stop the attack, but before check automatically how an attacker possibly could come in and have a full overview of the environment including automatic risk factors for assets and overview combined with integrations with other solutions.</p>
<p>Additionally the task of risk management is stated in the new NIS2 directive and should be clearly a topic for all companies that are affected.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/risk-assessment-the-attacker-way-cre23"></a>

CISO’s tell us they are flying blind and hope for the best. You shouldn't have to simply trust your app teams or run periodic third-party assessments to stay on top of how your SaaS is configured.

  <p>Automated Threats to web applications are according to the Open Web Applications Project (OWASP) a misuse of their inherent valid functionality by applying automated means. Usually, those automations are referred to as `bots´. The attackers usually reverse engineer the web application, e.g. an e-commerce platform, and based on their discovery, craft bots to exploit vulnerabilities or gaps that allow them to pursue their goal on the platform in an undesirable way. A famous example are sneaker bots, whose goal is to obtain a competitive advantage over human clients in purchasing hyped articles like sneakers. Addressing automated threats is a company-wide effort and requires to tackle the problem from many angles reaching from DevSecOps, architectural changes, raising awareness, establishing transparency in the business, implementing preventive controls, to detective controls. In the first phase of our research, we tackled the problem in a big e-commerce company on this entire spectrum of challenges and are now at the position to enhance our approach in a second phase. In the second phase, we aim for an approach to harden a web-application platform with existing detective and reactive controls using aspects of generative approaches and adversarial attacks while also considering explainability.</p>
<p>In the talk, we are going to explain and motivate the problem space, explain the insights from the first phase and outline the goals of the second phase of our research.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enhancing-web-application-security-cre23"></a>

  <p>Comprehensive protection of networks, system infrastructures, hardware and software, applications and data is part of every cyber security strategy. But what does this actually mean for identity and access management?&nbsp;Unloved for many years and repeatedly declared dead: passwords. Large IT companies have been promising us a password-free future for a long time. Is it really that easy to finally turn your back on passwords? The fact is that we have to deal with a large number of passwords every day in order to complete our professional and private tasks. Every password should be unique, highly complex and as long as possible. But what does the frightening everyday life with passwords look like today, what will it hopefully look like in the future and why it is essential to deal with the topic right now, explains&nbsp;Daniel&nbsp;Holzinger in his lecture.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/is-the-future-really-password-free-cre23"></a>

				  What sets one digital wallet apart from another and what are the key features you should look for before starting to store your personal data? Here, we discuss the three that we find the most important and explain why.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Between Apple Pay, Cash App, Google Pay and others, the number of digital wallets has exploded in recent years, with Capital One reporting there were <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/digital-wallet-statistics/#:~:text=Digital%20Wallet%20User%20Statistics&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20there%20were%203.4%20billion%20digital%20wallet%20users%20in,60%25%20of%20the%20global%20population.">roughly 3.4 billion users</a> worldwide in 2022. As more consumers familiarize themselves with wallet apps, using them for moving money or purchasing goods or services has become commonplace.</p>
<p>If identity verification is to emulate the convenience of digital payments, the wallets we use need to offer more functionality than just the ability to accept, hold, and present a verifiable credential, they need to have the tools to fully manage your digital identity and data sharing.</p>
<p>The first additional feature to look for in a digital identity wallet is process management. Sometimes the process for being issued with a verifiable credential is simple: you fill out a few forms from the issuing party, which are confirmed by the issuing party, and then you are issued with a credential. For example, when applying for a mobile driver’s license there are several attribute fields to fill out, such as name, height, weight, eye color, etc. These allow the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to confirm that you are the correct person to issue the license to.</p>
<p>But what if the DMV decides it needs more information? Does the wallet notify you? Does the DMV have a procedure in place to notify you? Often services like this simply don’t have the time or processes in place to inform you of the need for more information, and the onus is on you to follow up. By having process management built into the wallet it would be able to easily notify you that the process is stalled and explain why.</p>
<p>The second feature to look for is the ability to act as a verifier and be able to read credentials. Every identity wallet by default is designed to hold credentials and create presentations of the information they contain; this allows you to share your mobile driver’s license or a proof of your age. But before you share this information, it would be ideal to be able to verify for yourself who you’re sharing this information with. For example, if you were pulled over by someone dressed as a police officer, this functionality could confirm that they actually are a police officer, and even provide you with important information such as their jurisdiction, name, and badge number. Similarly, this function would also allow two people to simply verify each other, for example when meeting someone for the first time: if a person comes to your door claiming to be from the gas company you could verify their credentials before letting them in to your house, and they could verify that you are the correct customer they are supposed to be helping, providing an additional layer of security and confidence.</p>
<p>The third feature we recommend is the ability to offer mutually authenticated two-way messaging. This allows you to cryptographically validate the identity of who you are interacting with (and they, you), and is a powerful way to deter fraud. (To learn more about how this works, <a href="https://indicio.tech/secure-two-way-communication-is-decentralized-identitys-secret-sauce-to-stopping-financial-scams/">read our recent article.</a>)</p>
<p>But besides stopping fraud, this feature also changes the way businesses and individuals can interact: instead of getting a letter or email from your bank, it can ping you to ask questions or start a conversation. Unlike email, this is a direct, encrypted communication that you know is coming from your bank. You can also easily sever this connection, and while you probably don’t want to do this with your bank, you may want to remove the ability for other parties to contact you.</p>
<p>In sum, we see identity wallets as building the foundation for digital relationships and these features provide powerful ways to build trusted digital relationships that are more richly interactive.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Indicio offers a free-to-use wallet, <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a>, which you can download right now to see some of these features in action, such as secure, mutually authenticated communication. Future versions of Holdr+ will have all the functionality outlined above.</p>

<p>Passwords, while integral to security measures, can pose significant threats due to their inherent vulnerabilities. Weak or reused passwords, susceptibility to phishing and brute-force attacks, and potential insider threats all make passwords a weak link in your security posture.</p>
<p>Although ubiquitous and seemingly secure, passwords can pose a significant threat to organizations for various reasons. Common issues include the use of weak or easily guessable passwords and password reuse across multiple accounts, making it easier for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, the prevalence of phishing scams and brute-force attacks means that even the most careful users can become victims. Lastly, the risk of insider threats, where employees with compromised credentials can exploit their access, is an ever-present concern.</p>
<p>To effectively counter these risks, organizations need to look beyond passwords and embrace robust security measures such as multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implementing MFA introduces an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional authentication factors. It not only validates user identities using their passwords but also involves a second form of verification like a one-time code sent to the user’s mobile device. However, while MFA provides additional security over passwords, it is still susceptible to MFA bypass attacks such as SIM swap, MFA prompt bombing, and more.</p>
<p>For these reasons, organizations must explore comprehensive security solutions beyond just passwords and traditional MFA and look to phishing-resistant MFA such as certificate-based authentication.</p>
 The Entrust Solution 
<p>Entrust Desktop Credential Provider for Microsoft Windows, which provides robust passwordless and multi-factor authentication for Windows desktop login, is one such solution. It integrates with Entrust Identity Enterprise (IdE) and Identity as a Service (IDaaS), allowing comprehensive user authentication and management. Entrust Desktop responds to various use cases like workstation login, password change, and unlock, thereby enhancing security and providing better access controls.</p>
<p>Using MFA with Entrust Desktop Credential Provider increases organizational security, provides better control over system access, offers various choices to meet specific security needs, and helps meet regulatory requirements.</p>
 MFA Methods Supported by Entrust Desktop: 
 
 Passwordless Authentication: This method eliminates the need for users to remember and input a password for subsequent logins after their initial setup. Instead of the traditional password-based approach, it relies solely on Entrust’s second-factor authentication mechanisms. This not only simplifies the user’s experience but also offers a secure way to verify their identity, given the robustness of the second-factor authentication techniques involved. 
 OTP (One-Time Password) Authentication: A unique, time-sensitive password is dispatched to the user’s registered contact details – either their email address or phone number. Since the PIN is valid for only a short duration and can’t be used more than once, it reduces the chances of unauthorized access. 
 Token Authentication: Here, users authenticate themselves using secure tokens, which can be either hardware devices or software-based. These tokens can originate from Entrust or other reputable vendors in the cybersecurity realm. Entrust provides support for two main types of tokens:
 
 Response-Only Tokens: Provide authentication through a simple response mechanism 
 Challenge-response Tokens: Engage users in an interactive authentication process, where the system sends a challenge and awaits a correct response 
 
 
 
 
 Mobile Soft Token Authentication: In this approach, users receive an out-of-band authentication challenge directly on their mobile devices. These challenges can range from simple prompts to more interactive mechanisms, making the process both user-friendly and secure. 
 Grid Authentication: A unique method that presents users with a grid filled with an assortment of characters organized in rows and columns. During the login process, users are asked to provide specific characters from predetermined coordinates on the grid. Given its unconventional nature, this method offers an extra layer of security against automated bot attacks. 
 Knowledge-Based Q&amp;A Authentication: Here, users respond to a set of personalized questions either online or offline. These questions are typically formulated during the user’s initial setup and are based on information only the user is likely to know. The Q&amp;A mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into the Entrust Identity Enterprise platform, specifically via the Entrust Identity Enterprise Self-Service Server (or the Entrust Identity Enterprise Self-Service Module) or the Identity as a Service platform. This method combines the security of knowledge-based tests with the convenience of user-defined answers. 
 Mobile Smart Credentials Authentication (Certificate-based authentication): This is an advanced out-of-band authentication strategy. Users receive a challenge on their mobile devices, which is then signed by the Entrust Mobile app upon verification of the user through biometrics or a unique PIN. Once signed, the challenge is verified by the Entrust Identity Enterprise or the Identity as a Service platforms. 
 
<p>Entrust supports multiple MFA authentication mechanisms and we highly recommend using phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms.</p>

   A new study shows that organizations can enjoy a range of benefits by migrating — if they can overcome internal challenges 

<p>In the early days of cloud adoption, organizations were understandably apprehensive. Many of the early adopters were particularly concerned about security, and tested the waters with non-essential apps that were easy to migrate and presented minimal risk. In the years since, with most organizations well into their cloud journeys, cloud migration has proven its value in material ways, enabling greater productivity, better customer engagement, lower costs, and improved efficiency. And it's strengthened security by moving visibility and control to anywhere users and data happen to be.</p>

<p>Most would agree that identity and access management (IAM) is a critical component of a robust security ecosystem. So, it only makes sense that organizations would look to move IAM to the cloud as part of their overall digital transformation initiatives. Yet, many organizations remain hesitant to jump in and begin the process of migrating IAM systems to the cloud, despite its potential benefits.</p>

<p>We set out to find out why with the help of Forrester.</p>

<p>The result of this work is a custom study by Forrester Consulting in November 2023, commissioned by ForgeRock and Ping Identity and titled, "<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/cloud-migration-optimizes-identity-and-access-management">Cloud Migration Optimizes Identity and Access Management</a>."</p>

<p>The study's purpose was to investigate the challenges that are holding organizations back from migrating IAM to the cloud. The survey also explored the benefits and opportunities awaiting those that embrace cloud IAM.</p>

 About the study 

<p>The commissioned study queried organizations around the world with at least 5,000 employees to explore their concerns about migrating IAM systems and solutions to the cloud. It also sought to understand the perceptions of IAM administrators and security leaders about cloud migration, the potential benefits of embracing a move to the cloud, and how cloud migration impacts their success. Ultimately, it looked to help guide organizations considering a move to the cloud to create a plan for IAM cloud migration.</p>

 Cloud IAM can help organizations achieve their objectives, so why aren't more adopting it? 

<p>Organizations in all sectors face challenges related to demands for stronger security and better experiences for customers and employees. They're fielding requests for multi-factor authentication (MFA), including passwordless authentication, while navigating a complex web of regulations that vary by region.</p>

<p>For most, the answer may be cloud IAM. According to the survey, 86% of respondents indicate that fully migrating IAM to the cloud is important to their success. That number jumps to ninety-two percent for organizations using both workforce IAM and customer IAM (CIAM).</p>

<p>But despite broad interest in its benefits, organizations have been slow to make the move. According to Forrester, only 12% of organizations are fully embracing identity in the cloud.<a>1</a></p>

 For many organizations, the culprit is internal 

<p>The survey showed that organizations are having trouble overcoming the challenges with cloud migration, primarily in two areas: organizational barriers and complexity.</p>

<p>One of the great advantages of cloud IAM technology is that it enables enterprises to transition from an on-premises IAM system to the cloud to deliver the agility, reliability, and scalability commonly associated with cloud technologies and services. But the complexity of legacy IAM ecosystems creates barriers to success.</p>

<p>Assessing and managing existing infrastructure, including highly distributed identities, identifying integrations and incompatibilities between apps and cloud solutions, and realigning internal technologies to facilitate a move to the cloud represent arduous but critical tasks. Add to that organizational silos, including siloed IAM, and a lack of leadership support at the highest levels, and it's no wonder that the journey to the cloud for many organizations is an uphill battle.</p>

 What benefits await? 

<p>Although the challenges can be intimidating, the journey to the cloud offers a bounty of rewards that make the endeavor worthwhile. More than 60% of survey respondents indicate that successful migration can enhance security, including improving password security and enforcing Zero Trust security.</p>

<p>Cloud IAM also helps businesses deliver the kind of frictionless user experiences that attract, engage, and retain customers, and enhance employee engagement and productivity. Equally significant are the operational improvements offered by cloud migration, including reduced complexity in governance and management, improved agility to comply with regulations, and the freeing of resources normally burdened with these tasks — many of the manual — to focus on other activities that deliver greater business value.</p>

 How can you move forward?

<p>Driver’s licenses serve more use cases for us than simply proving our capability to operate a vehicle–many people use their driver’s license as their primary form of identification. As we shift to a digital-first world, people will need credentials to represent all facets of their identity digitally in a secure way. Whether it be proving identity to apply for a loan or purchasing a controlled substance online, it’s becoming increasingly important and necessary for entities to offer people the option to present a digitally issued ID document remotely.</p><p>This means that it is critical to build mobile driver’s license (mDL) solutions using standardized data formats, so verifiers across different geographies and industries can use a consistent framework to confirm a person’s identity. To ensure the secure and interoperable use of these digital credentials, international standards are being developed and tested. The August 2023 ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event, organized by SpruceID, was a significant milestone in this ongoing journey.</p><p>We’re delighted to have hosted a successful, fully-remote, and asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations. Read on to learn more about ISO/IEC 18013-7, a recap of the interoperability event, and how the results and findings are being used to drive the digital identity industry forward.</p> A Brief Introduction to ISO/IEC 18013-7 <p>ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 is the working group that defines standards for motor vehicle driver’s licenses and related documents, to provide a common technical framework and promote the safe and secure use of this technology. The 18013-5 standard specified by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 defines requirements for the security, data elements, and information exchange of mobile driving licenses (mDL) between the mobile device and authorized parties while upholding user data protection and safeguarding driver privacy.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 focuses on attended in-person use cases where parties are in close proximity during the presentation of a digitally issued ID document. After introducing the ISO/IEC 18013-5 standard, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC17 took another step forward by publishing a Committee Draft consultation of ISO/IEC 18013-7, a draft technical specification that focuses on unattended or fully online use cases of mDL where parties are remotely connected at the time of presentation.</p><p>The objective of our interoperability event was to provide a collaboration forum for implementers of ISO/IEC 18013-7 to come together and test their respective solutions to drive forward cross-industry interoperability and adoption while accelerating feedback and clarity for implementations of the standards.</p> Joining Forces for Testing <p>The Interoperability Event was hosted remotely, with an asynchronous testing window spanning three weeks. This allowed participants enough time to actively test and collaborate iteratively with other implementers to optimize their own implementations and use cases.</p><p>The event was open for all implementers of 18013-7 to participate without any restrictions regarding organization size or any particular working group membership. Participants came from a variety of backgrounds, including both public and private sectors, across multiple geographies. Any observers interested in understanding the maturity and adoption of the draft standard were also welcome to join and listen in.</p><p>The participating mDL reader implementers included: Bundesdruckerei GmbH, Credence ID, Google, HID Global, ImproveID, MyNextID, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Okta, OneProof, Panasonic, Ping Identity, Samsung, Scytales, SpruceID, and Thales.</p><p>The participating mDL implementers included: Bundesdruckerei GmbH, Google, HID Global, ImproveID, MyNextID, NEC, OneProof, Panasonic, Samsung, Scytales, SpruceID (jointly with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles), and Thales.</p><p>Testing participants were encouraged to test both Rest API and OpenID4VP implementations to inform recommendations for refining the clarity of the technical specification related to both protocols.</p> Results and Reflections <p>There were many takeaways and learnings from the test event that will ultimately help to inform both the standard and interoperability moving forward. Notably, the draft specifications were found to have no major issues necessitating normative changes. Most interoperability challenges were largely a result of updates to the draft documents in advance of the interoperability event, which some participants did not have sufficient time or resources to address. However, the successful resolution of these issues demonstrated a shared commitment to fostering interoperability and will help improve this documentation in the future.</p><p>Feedback from the event, along with preliminary aggregate, anonymized test results, and troubleshooting, was presented to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 WG10 in Singapore. The findings and resolutions were documented as N2349 in the ISO Global Directory. So far, these insights have been incorporated into the latest version of ISO/IEC 18013-7, submitted as N2356. N2356 is the first draft of a Technical Specification, which includes all the improvements and insights we've gathered during our test event to enhance the specification for better interoperability.</p><p>If you’re interested in taking a deeper dive into these findings, a comprehensive event results publication can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M4ufcKqmj8gycNovslOSWzFB2nB1o1eu/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=114730549750609434292&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">be found here</a>. </p> Onwards and Upwards for 18013-7 <p>We look forward to continuing to play a role in advancing the 18013-7 standard and other digital identity standards. The August 2023 ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event was a testament to the collective effort to advance standards for mobile driver's licenses, and how much progress we can make together to eventually bring this standard to life for public use. The successful interoperability demonstrations of mobile driver’s licenses that can be presented and verified remotely over the internet will introduce a new class of use cases for verifiable digital identity and evolve the way we use mobile driver’s licenses today.</p><p>At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across all digital interactions. As digital identity technologies, such as mobile driver's licenses, become more pervasive and usable for online user experiences, it is important to be mindful of introducing privacy-preserving capabilities from their inception. To that end, we think carefully about technology mitigations for privacy risks and concerns raised by civil liberties organizations, such as "phoning home," in the mDL implementations that SpruceID works on. You can learn more in our <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/existing-critiques?ref=blog.spruceid.com">knowledge base</a>.</p><p>We’d like to thank all implementers for taking the time to participate in the test event. This event marked a crucial step towards creating a digital identification landscape that is secure, interoperable, and universally accessible. As we continue our journey towards fully realizing the potential of mDLs, collaborative, open events like these play a vital role in shaping the future of digital identification.</p>  📄  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M4ufcKqmj8gycNovslOSWzFB2nB1o1eu/edit?rtpof=true&amp;sd=true&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">Read the Event Results Publication</a>   <p>About SpruceID: At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across all digital interactions. </p>

 The Brazilian gambling industry is about to become regulated. IDnow investigates how the grey market currently works, and some of the dangers of using unregulated gambling platforms. 



 



<p>Brazil effectively banned gambling in 1946; a more-or-less all-encompassing restriction that remained largely in place until 2018, when sports betting was legalized. However, as virtually no regulation was ever implemented, Brazilian players and international gambling platforms have been operating in a somewhat grey area ever since. This is all due to change once Brazilian online gambling regulation is formally approved in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The limbo appears to work, at least on the face of it. And at least for international operators. Surprisingly, despite the lack of clear regulation, Brazil still manages to generate over<a href="https://denmark.net/top-countries-online-gambling-traffic/?expand_article=1"> 20% of all global online gambling</a> traffic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is for this reason that the Brazilian authorities have introduced new regulations to help the Brazilian gambling market capture what is viewed as lost revenue (<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">a projected $1.5 billion in 2023</a>) and bring it back within the fold of the Brazilian economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the projected numbers are likely to be even larger when regulation finally passes, as there are vast swathes of the Brazilian would-be gambling community that are not currently gambling, despite wanting to.</p>



 To gamble or not to gamble? That is the Brazilian question. 



<p>In 2021, a survey on Brazilian attitudes toward gambling discovered that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/o-desafio-da-preven%C3%A7%C3%A3o-%C3%A0-lavagem-de-dinheiro-nos-jogos-odilon-dutra/?originalSubdomain=pt">39% of Brazilian participants said they didn’t gamble</a> because they felt uncertain of the safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just over half of all potential players said they would feel more confident playing online if they had more information about the companies. This is understandable as many gambling operators are not very clear about who their owners are, or even the location of their headquarters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same survey, 51% of participants said they would like to see more player protection mechanisms put in place. Read more opinions from the Brazilian betting community in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-players-regulation-gambling/">blog, ‘How does the Brazilian betting community really feel about upcoming regulations.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite operating in the grey, international gambling operators have achieved considerable visibility through advertising on television and the internet, and through sponsorship of Brazilian football clubs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the wave of publicity and ensuing popularity <a href="https://mundorubronegro.com/apostas-brasil/casas-apostas-ilegais">has raised concerns</a> about the impact of gambling addiction, the growth of scams, and the threat of money laundering.</p>



 Wait, so is online gambling legal or illegal in Brazil? 



<p>The most obvious question that many have when they see adverts for online gambling platforms but find out online gambling is essentially illegal, is well, how does that work? The answer lies in <a href="https://seudireito.proteste.org.br/site-de-apostas-e-ilegal/">Law 13.756,</a> which allows operators to offer their services in Brazil if their headquarters are outside of Brazil and there are no physical points of sale. In practice, this law enables bookmakers to use websites, on the condition they are hosted internationally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As these websites operate according to the rules of the countries in which they are based, such as Curaçao, the UK or Malta, they are not required to obey Brazilian laws, such as the Consumer Defence Code. This is all set to change when Brazilian regulations are formally passed and implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has meant that from 2018 until whenever the regulations finally come into force, international bookmakers have operated with a sort of impunity and without needing to implement fair gaming rules or player protection measures.</p>



 What do Brazilian players think about using unregulated gambling platforms? 



<p>The Brazilian gaming community is waking up to the realities of dealing with unregulated gambling operators. Common complaints made on social media and forums include users making deposits but being unable to withdraw them, and even stories of players who have had their accounts blocked following a good streak in sports betting or on online casinos. However, there is a growing awareness among the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-players-regulation-gambling/">Brazilian betting community</a> that these kinds of scams are not representative of the entire gambling industry, but rather just unreliable websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An upside to the online proliferation of so many negative stories has led to <a href="https://www.extraclasse.org.br/geral/2023/03/bicheiros-e-contraventores-investem-em-cassinos-on-line-e-apostas-esportivas/">increasing numbers of Brazilian gamblers</a> actively seeking information about the risk of less reliable, unregulated online gambling sites.</p>



 Arguments for and against KYC processes in Brazil. 



<p>While the vast majority of the Brazilian betting community seem to accept the value of undergoing a KYC process, there are <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/betano/casa-de-aposta-nao-quer-pagar-meu-saque-e-fica-pedindo-fotos-de-todos-o-tip_DSBUzJ1HW0713vYD/">some who have expressed privacy concerns</a> over some operators’ requirements for players to take and send photographs of themselves holding identity documents. Many also fear that when dealing with an international operator, if there was a problem associated with sending documents, for example a data breach, then they would not be able to rely on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farialimabets/comments/11txan7/%C3%A9_seguro_enviar_meus_documentos_para_uma_casa_de/">national legal protection measures</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A common complaint among international gambling operators is on the difficulty of performing the Brazilian KYC process due to the wide variety and disparity of identity documents in Brazil. For example, each state in Brazil offers slightly different ID cards, which have dates and document numbers in different places, for example. Difficulties <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/bc-game/verificacao-kyc_OcihHkmZ_wp6BSrb/">surrounding the KYC process</a> have affected some players’ ability to <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/188bet-apostas-esportivas-online/verificacao-de-identidade-kyc-prejuizo-de-u-75_Gp8gh8oJt_YPqbvA/">transact and make withdrawals</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This makes the integration with the Cadastro de Pessoas Fiscias (CPF), a tax number that every Brazilian is issued with, all the more important for identity verification and KYC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brazilian industry insiders say that the implementation of KYC measures to obtain a licence (Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">‘Unpacking the complexities of the Brazilian gambling license structure’ here</a>) means more than just following a legal requirement, it will also <a href="https://g-mnews.com/pt/compliance-kyc-transparencia-que-gera-confiabilidade/">help operators prevent fraud</a>.</p>
