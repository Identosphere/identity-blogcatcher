<p>Online scams have seen a huge surge in the past year, with a reported number of identity thefts and digital fraud rising by 25.07% in 2021, compared to 2020, according to TransUnion.</p>



<p></p>



<p>As our community may be aware, we have recently been targeted by scammers impersonating us, and offering ShareToken in exchange for your seed phrases, and personal security information. Although not an uncommon circumstance within our industry, we would like to take this opportunity to remind our users about their digital safety, and what triggers to look for when identifying a potential scammer.</p>



<p>Imposter scams will mimic anything that entices you to engage with them. This could be the likeness of a company, such as ShareRing, to the impersonation of social media challenges such as that on Instagram, where participants are asked to share their personal information in response to a question on their stories.</p>



<p></p>



<p>A key characteristic of a scam is usually associated with unusual payment requests such as making a direct bank transfer, often with urgency. This is one of the most prevalent methods used. Scams tend to manipulate emotion by also impersonating authority from government officials to family members. To keep your privacy safe, here are three tips you should always keep in mind:</p>



  Never disclose passwords and seed phrases  



<p>Be alert while sharing your personal information. Do not save your credit/ debit card or personal details on a website. It is suggested to secure your privacy by using a code on every app &amp; never provide any seed phrase, code or passcode to anyone.&nbsp;</p>



  &nbsp;Be careful of fake websites.  



<p>Always head to the official websites or accounts. Many accounts mirror the official websites and may disguise themselves with very similar URLs (G00gle.com) or redirect people to unofficial payment links. Always check the domain name to see whether there is an “s” in the URL, E. g. “https://”, or a lock on the address bar.&nbsp;</p>



  &nbsp;Avoid unknown caller or text messages.&nbsp;  



<p>Do not respond to text messages or missed calls from unknown numbers. Never provide any personal details, security numbers, passwords and any personal identification to suspicious callers. If you receive emails with links and attachments, do not click on them to avoid phishing scams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This series of blogs is prompted by the UK Government’s proposed reforms of data protection law contained in its consultation paper Data: A New Direction. The stated intention of these proposals is to unleash a new ‘golden age’ of innovation and growth. But the real effect of these reforms would be&nbsp;to:</p>  Under the banner of tackling ‘consent fatigue’, abolish citizens’ right to consent to the collection and use of their data: achieved by expanding the definition of organisations’ ‘legitimate interests’ (where they don’t have to seek consent) to cover almost every activity they would wish to undertake, thereby rendering consent irrelevant.  Under the banner of helping organisations access more data for the purposes of research and innovation, abolish the core principle upon which data protection regulations have been built: that personal data should only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. The Government’s proposals would do this by making ‘further processing’ of citizens’ data legal in so many additional circumstances (‘legitimate interests’, use in ‘research’, for AI, to improve ‘data sharing’, etc) that the core principle is rendered irrelevant.  <p>These proposals represent the biggest attack on citizen rights seen in this country for generations. They would <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/the-uk-governments-plan-to-reform-data-protection-laws-are-terrifying/">make new Cambridge Analyticas legal</a>, and would put UK citizens’ data up for sale in global markets — the stated goal being to “secure the UK’s status as a global hub for the free and responsible flow of personal data” (where ‘responsible’ is never defined in over 50,000 words of argumentation, but where the door is opened to ‘irresponsible’ uses of data many times&nbsp;over).</p><p>This blog series explores the many mistaken assumptions that lie behind this disastrous initiative. The innovation and growth that Government promises its reforms will bring are a fantasy. They will not unleash a new ‘golden age’ they are based on deep misunderstandings of what makes data valuable in the first place and how to unleash this value. This, first, blog in the series looks at why data is valuable.</p> Where data’s value comes&nbsp;from <p>Given all the fuss that’s made about data, you’d think everyone would have an immediate answer to this question. But when you ask it strange things&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Some people immediately go off on a tangent, talking about how much money is being made out of data. But this begs the question: why are people prepared to pay so much for it? Others repeat catchphrases such as ‘data is the new oil’. Very soon people are embroiled in arguments about whether data is, or is not, ‘like oil’ — while the original question gets forgotten.</p><p>But the answer to this question matters, because it will inform all the policies and strategies that follow. If you get it wrong (as the UK Government is currently doing with their proposals to ‘reform’ data protection regulations ) you risk wasting huge amounts of time, money and effort chasing rainbows, while missing the opportunities that really&nbsp;matter.</p> Reliability and&nbsp;Surprise <p>So why is data valuable? Because of two things. Reliability and Surprise.</p><p>Reliability If we know a fact to be true, we can act on it without incurring the risks (and costs) of making a mistake. If the data you are working with is unreliable — if you don’t know if it is true or not — any decisions or actions you take on the basis of it risks being wrong. One of three things then&nbsp;happens.</p>  You don’t dare making the decision or taking the action, in which case lots of things that could happen&nbsp;don’t.  You make a wrong decision or take a wrong action and then have to incur the costs of cleaning up the&nbsp;mess.  You invest significant amounts of time, money and effort trying to improve the reliability of your data (often paying external agencies exorbitant fees to confirm basic facts), so that you avoid the costs and lost opportunities of the first&nbsp;two.  <p>Across the economy today, individuals’ and service providers’ inability to access and use the right, reliable data when and where they need it is a major cause of unnecessary cost and waste, fraud and of missed opportunities.</p><p>This lack of access to the right reliable data has deep structural causes. Usually somebody, somewhere has generated or checked that a piece of information is correct — that is indeed reliable. But because our data economy is currently organisation-centric (that is, organised around hundreds of different, isolated, separate data silos run by different, separate organisations), this data remains inaccessible.</p><p>What’s needed is a new personal data logistics infrastructure which enables individuals to get hold of certified data about themselves (verified attributes) and to share this data, under their control, as and when they need to. If such infrastructure were put in place, everyone would have access to reliable data when they need it, and everyone would be able to eliminate the friction, effort, risk and cost that pile up when it’s not available.</p><p>We estimate that over 95% of all data processing activities undertaken by British services providers in the private, public and third sectors (e.g. banking, insurance, retail, utilities, media and communication, local and central Government public administration, education, health, transportation, leisure, charities, etc) relate to the collection and use of data for the purposes of service provision: primarily administrative activities that depend on the availability of reliable&nbsp;data.</p><p>Yet nowhere in the 50,000-plus words of of the UK Government’s Data: A New Direction consultation does it even come close to recognising this fact. Which means its entire ‘data strategy’ is already missing the most fundamental point.</p> Surprise <p>The second reason why data can be valuable is the opposite of the first: it can surprise you by telling you something you didn’t know. It’s data as ‘surprise’ that helps people and organisations keep abreast of a fast changing&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data as ‘surprise’ is what fuels research and those innovations that are driven by insight into peoples’ behaviours. It’s a great thing. But we have to keep it in perspective. By definition, innovations are exceptions to the rule — the rule being the administration of existing services. And once an innovative product or service has been created to realise its value, it needs to be delivered to people, which requires the reliable data that drives these processes. In this situation, data’s two aspects of reliability and surprise work together, with ‘reliability’ still ensuring the actual delivery of value. For the ‘surprise’ side of data to generate value, the ‘reliability’ aspect is essential.</p><p>That’s why we say that at least 95% of data’s value comes from reliability. But unfortunately, as we’ve noted above, the UK Government’s proposed data protection reforms focus entirely on research and innovation: the 5%. A classic case of the tail wagging the&nbsp;dog.</p> Mixtures of reliability and&nbsp;surprise <p>Even though they are like chalk and cheese, often the biggest value is generated by mixing reliability and surprise. For surprises to be valuable they need to be reliable: fake news can be a very dangerous thing, Some things can be surprisingly reliable as we’ll see when we discuss artificial intelligence in a later&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other things are ‘reliably surprising’: by which we are confronted by new information that changes what we do, but where the sorts of new information and the sorts of changes that result are part of a routine&nbsp;process.</p><p>Take your daily commute to work. You know exactly where you are going, what the route is, how long it should take, and so on. And yet, every journey you make is full of little surprises — little bits of new information that you need to respond to. A traffic light turns red. A child looks like they might run out into the road. A car suddenly turns right in front of you. In each case, you know how to deal with the situation. It’s happened many times before. But on each occasion, you still have to deal with the ‘surprise’.</p><p>In modern economies, a huge range of important value-adding activities fall into this category of managing ‘reliable surprises’. Take the health service which is largely organised around the management of ‘reliable surprises’: common ailments with well known symptoms and treatments but where, on each occasion, a diagnosis is still needed and a resulting set of actions planned and implemented.</p><p>Likewise financial services when deciding whether or not to give someone a loan or assessing an insurance risk, or public administrators deciding whether an individual is entitled to a benefit or service. And so on. A huge amount of the data that’s collected and used in our society today is devoted to the efficient management of such ‘reliable surprises’.</p> Implications <p>Talking about reliability and surprise as we’ve done here may seem simple and obvious. In a sense it is. But its implications are profound.</p><p>Practically speaking, for the full potential of data to be realised, individuals and service providers need to be able to access and use the right reliable data at the right time, on a mass scale. For this, we need new infrastructure. Just as the industrial age needed a national electricity grid to unleash electricity’s potential, so we need a new data ‘grid’ — a data logistics infrastructure that gets the right reliable data to (and from) the right people and places at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>That’s what we at Mydex are working on — personal data logistics infrastructure that puts citizens at the heart of the process, including them in the workings of society and economy. The Scottish Government has begun to realise this with its decision to create its <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a>. SAPS enables organisations to share verified (reliable data about their citizens) with the citizen so citizens, in turn, can share this data when and where they need to gain access to other services and eradicate things like form filling, delays and improve access, inclusion and outcomes.</p><p>Some of the work the UK Government is doing around personal data — its Identity and Attribute Trust Framework for example — has truly positive potential. But this Consultation and these proposals? Oh dear! They misunderstand where the real value of data lies and rely instead on a mythological narrative promoted mainly by Silicon Valley lobbyists. The next post in this series turns to this narrative.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is data valuable?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.westjet.com/en-ca">WestJet</a> has successfully trialed a new biometric boarding system at Calgary International Airport. The trial took place on November 24, when passengers on WestJet flight 8901 were screened with a new facial recognition as they boarded their plane at Gate 88.</p>



  



<p>The system is the result of a collaboration between WestJet and <a href="https://www.telus.com/en/">TELUS</a>. Embross made the biometric hardware used to screen passengers, while one37 and Oaro helped TELUS build the identity platform that was used for the trial. In that regard, one37 was primarily responsible for developing the actual app, while Oaro supplied the group with document recognition tech.</p>



<p>The completed Trusted Boarding program is essentially a digital identity wallet. Passengers are first asked to download the TELUS application, and then upload an identity document before getting to the airport. The app will confirm that the document is authentic, and store it in a digital wallet on that user’s smartphone.</p>



<p>Each user can then choose whether or not to share the document stored in the wallet with other parties. Those who share with the airport will be allowed to board a plane with only a facial recognition scan that compares a new photo of the passenger to the document stored in the wallet. In doing so, the app enables a contactless and streamlined passenger experience.</p>



<p>WestJet is hoping to work with the government of Canada to expand the program. The app is available for iOS and Android devices, and gives users full control of their personal information, insofar as they can choose when to share and can revoke the other party’s access privileges once their business is complete. The solution is compliant with the PIPEDA privacy regulations.</p>



<p>“The travel experience is evolving to include many touchless processes and WestJet is innovating to ensure our guests’ travel journey improves to become more seamless and efficient, while prioritizing safety above all,” said&nbsp;WestJet EVP and CIO Stuart McDonald.</p>



<p>The news reflects the growing interest in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/frost-sullivan-reports-growing-demand-contactless-airport-management-solutions-022303/">contactless airport screening technology</a>. US Customs and Border Protection has deployed its face-based <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbp-brings-simplified-arrival-preclearance-airports-canada-021807/">Simplified Arrival system</a> at pre-clearance airports throughout Canada, while <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/air-canada-introduces-biometric-boarding-flights-us-canada-120907/">Air Canada started offering biometric boardin</a>g on select flights to the US in December of 2020.</p>

<p><a href="https://shuftipro.com/">Shufti Pro</a> continues to make inroads in the crypto space. The company has revealed that it will be providing secure onboarding and authentication services for 99Starz, a start-up that is attempting to build one of the world’s top NFT yield ecosystems.</p>



  



<p>99Starz is currently searching for investors to help fuel those ambitions. That’s where Shufti Pro’s technology comes into play. 99Starz will use the Shufti Pro platform to register the identities of new users remotely, while still remaining compliant with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other international Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations.</p>



<p>The Shufti Pro solution uses document recognition to verify the authenticity of an ID, and then uses facial recognition to match the image on that ID to a selfie of the user. The technology enables a more streamlined onboarding experience for 99Starz investors, and allows the company minimize the threat of fraud as it grows its backer community.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to be assisting 99Starz in their goal of delivering an intuitive digital experience for its investors,” said Shufti Pro CEO Victor Fredung. “Through this partnership, 99Starz will seamlessly onboard and authenticate the identity of their investors, fulfill KYC requirements, scale the speed and accuracy of investors’ screening while avoiding identity scams.”</p>



<p>“Shufti Pro allows 99Starz to onboard investors in a timely and seamless manner,” added 99Starz’ CEO Luca Lamberti. “In a fast-paced industry like crypto, speed and trust are paramount to success.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shufti Pro recently formed a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/shufti-pro-helps-verify-identities-morpho-labs-crypto-backers-110409/">similar partnership with Morpho Labs</a>, a blockchain developer that is using digital onboarding tech to screen anyone who wants to support the company with cryptocurrency. The <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/shufti-pro-delivers-onboarding-tech-vengo-ride-hailing-platform-7112104/">Vengo ride-hailing app</a> and the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/shufti-pro-provides-remote-onboarding-russian-sim-card-service-112305/">Birka SIM card service</a> are some of the other clients that have signed on with Shufti Pro in the past month alone. The company also added a <a>new NFC verification tool to its platform</a> back in April.</p>

Peers in the network can dial other peers in the network to exchange messages using various transports, like QUIC, TCP, WebSocket, and Bluetooth. Modular design of the <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> framework enables it to build drivers for other transports. Peers can run on any device, as a cloud service, mobile application or in the browser and talk to each other as long as they are connected through the same <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>&nbsp;network.</p><p>Peers are identified through their peer IDs which change over time, specifically when keys are rotated. Since key rotation or revocation events can be communicated only to online peers, peer IDs are insufficient for building a stable fully-decentralized messaging framework. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, on the other hand, were designed to support key rotation while keeping a stable identifier. Hence, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> should be used as the more permanent public identifier for peers in the network, which would hold information about the peer IDs, <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network and supported protocols. Peers would still use their peer ID for <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> routing and authentication. Alice and Bob would exchange their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> out of band and will be able to find their counterparty’s peer ID via their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. In this way, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> acts as an indirection layer for the peer ID, thus allowing Alice and Bob to change their peer ID for practical reasons without the need to notify each&nbsp;other.</p><p><a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> is a modular system of protocols and specifications for building P2P applications. It can be also used to build P2P messaging applications. although messaging through <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> has limitations. Peers in the network are usually not always online, especially if Bob is travelling a lot, lives in an area with limited connectivity, is actually an intelligent car, or has a monthly limit with his mobile data plan. When Alice wants to send Bob a message and Bob is not online, then the likelihood of Bob eventually receiving the message reduces dramatically. DIF <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> solves this problem by defining mediator nodes that can run in high-availability mode. Those mediators can act as Alice and Bob’s mailboxes where both use DID authentication to receive the latest messages from their mediators. Instead of associating Bob’s peer ID with his <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>, Bob would associate his mediator’s peer ID with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>, so Alice would dial-up Bob’s mailbox through the <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network and first forward the message to the mediator. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> ensures that only Bob can decrypt the message and that Bob can verify Alice authenticated the message through authenticated encryption (authcrypt). Additional trust, security and access management can be added through <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> that counteract spam and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>This article explains how two parties, Alice and Bob, can securely communicate using <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> through a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network, where discovery, security and trust are rooted in Decentralized Identity technologies. First, we present how Alice and Bob prepare and exchange information about their peers, next we describe how peers establish secure P2P connections, and last we present DIDComm message exchange via the channels. We assume you are familiar with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VCs</a>. If you are not, check out <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">DIF FAQ</a> for a great&nbsp;intro.</p> Exchanging information <p>To start messaging, Alice and Bob must exchange information about their peers and mediators. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> help to establish a trusted Decentralized Identity layer for the peers, where peers can always find the latest information about the active mediators, peer IDs, authentication, and encryption keys. This enables mutual peer authentication and end-to-end stream encryption. We use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> service property to manage and share peer information as presented below.</p>DIDComm Messaging service section using libp2p transport<p>Thus Alice and Bob need to exchange their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> out-of-band and clients will be able to discover, authenticate and connect. The design is applicable to almost all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>&nbsp;methods.</p> Establishing secure&nbsp;streams <p>Now that Alice and Bob exchanged information about their peers, the peers establish authenticated and end-to-end encrypted P2P streams. If at least one of the peers has public endpoints or supports NAT transversal, peers can connect directly. Since most services are behind firewalls or don’t have public endpoints, P2P connection can be established only via relay or proxy nodes. These nodes either help with the NAT traversal or simply relay all the traffic. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> has full support for relay nodes that can be hosted by anyone, i.e. self-hosted or hosted by a 3rd party provider. Furthermore, every client can select which relay node(s) can be used to establish a connection with it and every new connection can be established via different nodes. Such an open design enables us to build a fully decentralized mesh of relay&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>After discovery, peers mutually authenticate. Authentication can be performed using peer IDs or any other <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> authentication key(s). <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> ensure that keys are valid (not revoked) and are linked to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>. Modular design enables plug in various mutual authentication protocols, like mutual TLS. After a successful mutual authentication, the streams are end-to-end encrypted either using TLSv1.3 or Noise Protocol, both supporting perfect forward secrecy. Note that other encryption protocols or frameworks can be plugged in. Only allow-listed peers, i.e., <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> of Alice or Bob registered with their clients, are allowed to open a stream. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) can be used to define more granular identity and access management policies.</p><p><a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> supports establishing a connection on the network levels, like QUIC, TCP/UDP, WebSocket, client authentication and traffic encryption. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> is introduced on top of <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> to fill-in the missing messaging capabilities.</p> Messaging <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> (aka DIDComm V2) provides a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Version 1 of DIDComm was specified in the HyperLedger (HL) Aries project as a set of HL Aries RFCs. With governance and further development moved to DIF, the goal was to specify one core specification for <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging </a>that addresses previously defined gaps and achieve better development experience. In particular V2 relies on better formalized methods, simpler message structures, has no requirement for DID exchange, treats ephemeral and full mode in the same way and has explicit support for all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> methods. Another goal was to address requirements beyond the HL Aries community.</p><p>In <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> trust is rooted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Atop <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> defines a set of methodologies to send messages between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> or more specifically their agents. Messages can be extended through specific <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocols. At a glance, <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> entails the following:</p>  Defines a data model for a common plaintext messages structure i.e. headers,&nbsp;body.  JOSE-based authn and encryption between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> with repudiation by&nbsp;default.  Defines a methodology for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> rotation.  Defines a methodology for (onion-)routing for various network architectures.  Defines core protocols such as invitations and feature discovery.  Defines core transport protocols for HTTP(S) and WebSockets.  Defines an extensibility model for adding new sub-protocols (e.g., VC Exchange) and new transports (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>).  <p>The following diagram shows the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> mental&nbsp;model.</p>DIDComm Messaging Mental&nbsp;Model<p>Typically, if Alice wants to send a message to Bob, Bob sends Alice an explicit invitation or Bob gives her his public <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> (implicit invitation through Bob’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Document</a>). Alice would then extract the service endpoint and recipient/routing keys from the invitation and can start sending messages to Bob. The first message could already contain a <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol message, since Alice can encrypt the message to Bob. After Bob receives the message, Bob can create a new <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> for Alice and indicate the change through <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> rotation.</p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> is transport-agnostic and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Documents</a> can be extended to support various transport mechanisms. The community developed approaches for HTTP(S) and WebSockets primarily, other transports such as Bluetooth are also under development.</p> Putting all&nbsp;together <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> running on top of a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network enables us to build a next generation decentralized messaging framework. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> enables establishing secure connections between peers regardless of their transport and IP properties (public, local, static, dynamic). Once peers establish secure connections with the help of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, they can authenticate (DID Authentication) and exchange <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol messages. Using a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network doesn’t require any changes to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol as <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> clients can support multiple messaging protocols and multiple different <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> networks (private or public) — it can work via existing public IPFS network, private <a href="https://www.aceblock.com/">AceBlock</a> network, and others. Layered architecture and clear separation of the P2P network from the messaging protocols, in our case <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>, enables us to design and develop the P2P network and <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> independently. Namely, the libP2P network doesn’t need to know anything about the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> and vice versa. Using such a setup, anyone can build edge agents and mediator nodes. Maintenance of such a P2P network is inexpensive. It is built using open source components.</p><p>The proposed solution&nbsp;supports</p>  direct communication (both clients have public&nbsp;IPs)  indirect communication (communication is relayed via <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> relay nodes; messages can be relayed via random relay nodes or pre-defined ones)  synchronous message exchange (if both clients are&nbsp;online)  asynchronous message exchange via mediator nodes (if one of the clients is&nbsp;offline)  Sending Messages through DIDComm Messaging and&nbsp;libp2p Conclusion and&nbsp;outlook <p>We outlined the next generation decentralized messaging solution built on top of <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VCs</a> and a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network.

<p>Clearview AI’s controversial facial recognition platform continues to perform well in independent testing. The company was the top-rated US solution in NIST one-to-one Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/despite-legal-troubles-clearview-does-well-nist-evaluation-110304/">results that were released in October</a>, and has now achieved the same feat in the NIST’s most recent one-to-many evaluation.</p>



  



<p>In both tests, Clearview’s facial recognition solution was the most accurate US solution in every evaluation category. It also made it into the top 10 internationally in each category in the one-to-many test, and the top five in the one-to-one.</p>



<p>The one-to-many test measures an algorithm’s ability to find a match for a new facial image in a database that includes millions of individual faces. In that regard, Clearview’s platform was 99.85 percent accurate when matching mugshots, and 99.86 percent accurate with VISA border photos. The mugshot database includes 12 million photos, while the VISA border database has roughly 1.6 million. Clearview was the second most accurate algorithm in the world in the VISA kiosk test.</p>



<p>Of course, those results do not address the ethical and legal concerns that have followed Clearview for the past two years. The company built its system with a database that includes more than 10 billion images scraped from various social media platforms, and has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-claims-legal-injunction-would-violate-first-amendment-rights-081905/">openly flaunted the fact</a> that those images were gathered without any form of consent. Clearview was hit with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-google-youtube-send-cease-desist-letter-clearview-ai-020601/">several cease and desist orders</a> when its database only had 3 billion images, and multiple countries have now determined that the company’s practices violate their privacy laws. A group of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/commissioners-rule-clearviews-data-collection-practices-violate-canadian-privacy-laws-020410/">Canadian privacy commissioners</a> made their ruling in February, while the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/australian-information-commissioner-finds-clearview-violated-privacy-act-110901/">Australian Information Commissioner</a> made the call in November, shortly after Clearview’s first NIST test.</p>



<p>Clearview is still facing <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/california-activists-sue-clearview-violating-local-facial-recognition-bans-031503/">additional lawsuits in the US</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-privacy-watchdogs-file-multiple-gdpr-complaints-against-clearview-ai-060103/">abroad</a>. It has also drawn <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-applauds-australian-information-commissioners-clearview-ruling-711118/">criticism from other facial recognition providers,</a> who view the company’s practices as unethical. The company has primarily <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-doubles-down-on-law-enforcement-with-new-advisory-board-081906/">targeted the law enforcement sector</a>, though some <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nypd-gets-caught-lying-about-rampant-use-clearview-ai-041411/">police forces have tried to deceive the public</a> about their use of the technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://vsblty.net/">VSBLTY</a> and <a href="https://inform.911inform.com/">911inform</a> have teamed up to create a new situational awareness platform for first responders. The two companies’ Total Security Platform combines VSBLTY’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-partners-ability-enterprise-smart-camera-solution-021107/">Vector computer vision software</a> with 911inform’s emergency response portfolio.</p>



  



<p>In practice, the Total Security Platform essentially gives first responders access to a venue’s security camera footage. Companies can integrate the solution into their existing surveillance setup, and Vector will <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/survey-shows-mexico-city-residents-feel-safer-with-vsblty-surveillance-tech-110105/">analyze those video feeds</a> to watch for threats and items of interest. Vector has facial recognition, license plate recognition, and weapon detection capabilities, and can also monitor idling cars and other objects that seem out of place.</p>



<p>When it spots something suspicious, the system can notify security personnel, who can in turn pass the information on to law enforcement, medical professionals, and other first responders, depending on the situation. In doing so, it gives those first responders a better sense of what is happening onsite, and gives them the ability to respond in a more effective fashion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>911inform, meanwhile, allows an organization to automate some of its response procedures. For example, the system can be configured to lock doors or activate strobe lights if it sees a potential threat, or to give the police temporary access to a building’s security feed. The system can also be used to share a floor plan of an entire facility, or to share critical medical records of individuals who have given their consent.</p>



<p>“This joint effort will provide people with an added layer of safety and security while reducing the overall response time to emergencies,” said 911inform Founder and CEO Ivo Allen. “We are united in a commitment to empower safer, stronger communities with intelligent, data-driven response virtually anywhere.”</p>



<p>911inform and VSBLTY have already tested and deployed the Total Security Platform for several US clients, though they believe that the solution will find an audience in other jurisdictions. VSBLTY has also formed a similar <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-provides-rapidsos-users-with-more-insight-into-emergency-incidents-062503/">emergency awareness partnership with RapidSOS</a>. The company itself was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-joins-otcqb-venture-market-081701/">listed on the OTCQB Venture Market</a> in August of 2021.</p>

				  Accelerate your decentralized identity skills with two free Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries workshops  
			  
				
				
				 <p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> are two of the popular open source repositories that can help propel development of decentralised identity products and services. Aries is a toolbox of several blockchain-agnostic repositories that allow for trusted online peer-to-peer interactions based on decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. The project grew out of work that was happening in Indy to create technologies for managing decentralized identity. Aries was moved to graduated status by the TSC in February 2021. Indy graduated in 2019 and provides a specific blockchain purpose-built for identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing the growth in interest for these two projects, Hyperledger Foundation has partnered with member company <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and its team of deeply experienced developers and architects to develop this free, multi-course curriculum to help developers and architects gain a deeper understanding of decentralized identity, with a deep dive into Aries and Indy. Registration and preparation information can be found on this <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops">Workshops page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two four-hour, beginning level, hands-on workshops provide opportunities to install and run the Indy and Aries components just like you would if you were making a real Indy-based network or Aries-based application. They introduce the necessary Git repos as well as how to use the Indy Command Line Interface (Indy CLI), run the Aries toolbox and create and issue a verifiable credential. They also introduce some current projects using Aries and Indy to help you accelerate your understanding of decentralized identity and build the skills necessary to successfully make changes to the underlying code with hands-on guidance to develop your own projects.</p>

 Introduction to libindy, indycli etc 
 Indy VDR (replacement for Indy-SDK) 
 Making changes to Indy node code 
 Build and IndyTest the changes locally 
 How to get involved in the community further with chats, helplines, and meetings 
 
<p>Both courses do have several must-have prerequisites, including the installation of docker, installation of Indy-CLI, installation of rust, and the download of important repositories. This can be done independently, or you will have the opportunity to connect with instructors during pre-course office hours on a dedicated helpline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new courses are the first community workshops offered by the Hyperledger Foundation for free in an effort to expand the use, contributions, and maintainer community of Hyperledger Indy and Aries. Recordings of the courses will be made available at the conclusion of the instructor-led events.</p>
<p>Registration for the free course is limited to 100.

<p>One of the biggest annual conferences in the identity and security industry is about to get underway, and <a href="https://www.biorugged.com/">BioRugged</a> has announced that it will be on hand to showcase new biometric devices to attendees.</p>



<p>While TRUSTECH has a strong focus on the payments sector with respect to identification and security solutions, it attracts representatives from a range of industries, offering BioRugged an opportunity to show its ruggedized products to individuals from areas like border control and law enforcement. Those are the sectors that will probably show the greatest interest in the latest version of the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/suprema-provides-fingerprint-modules-for-new-biorugged-handhelds/">BioWolf 8R device</a>, which now features an MRZ and ePassport reader. In a statement, BioRugged CEO Arnd Langguth said the upgraded device is “a milestone in our expansion into that field.”</p>



<p>BioRugged will also be taking the opportunity to tout the BioWolf 8R’s MIL-STD-810G certification at TRUSTECH 2021. MIL-STD-810G is a United States Military Standard concerning the testing of equipment through the simulation of various environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures, low pressure, humidity, fog, and so on. The certification therefore attests to the BioWolf 8R’s ruggedness and capability to operate in a range of environments.</p>



<p>Beyond showing off the BioWolf 8R at TRUSTECH, BioRugged says it will also showcase a new device called the Marquee 5.1, which can be connected to a computer to enable multimodal biometric enrollment. Maintaining its strong focus on the areas of border control and law enforcement, BioRugged is offering a “Border Control” version of the Marquee 5.1 that, like the upgraded BioWolf 8R, features an MRZ and ePassport reader.</p>



<p>As the company’s strong focus on border control would suggest, Ireland-based BioRugged has global ambitions, illustrated earlier this year through a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biorugged-targets-southeast-asian-market-with-vezion-partnership-031708/">partnership with Vezion Group</a> aimed at extending BioRugged’s reach in Malaysia and Southeast Asia. TRUSTECH 2021, with its internationally diverse roster of attendees, could therefore prove to be a significant opportunity for BioRugged to reach new customers from around the world.</p>



<p>TRUSTECH 2021 will run from November 30 to December 2 in the Paris Expo venue at the Porte de Versailles, with BioRugged slated to showcase its solutions from booth 5.2 F064.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idenfy.com/">iDenfy</a> is trying to make it easier for clients to integrate its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idenfy-picks-up-new-customer-baltic-innovation-award-111805/">identity verification technology</a> into their own workflows. To that end, the company has launched a new “Magic Link” solution that allows clients to create a consistent authentication experience for everyone connected to their network.</p>



  



<p>The goal, according to iDenfy, is to help protect businesses that do not have the technical expertise needed to implement a more complicated cybersecurity system. In that regard, the company believes that there will not be nearly enough skilled professionals to meet the world’s IT demands in the next few years. The shortfall is expected to have a particularly large impact in the United States, where businesses could lose $400 billion in potential revenue simply because they do not have the people they need to capitalize on certain high-tech opportunities.</p>



<p>Those lost opportunity costs could climb into the trillions internationally, where the available pool of IT professionals could be as much as 85 million people shy of demand as <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/commercial-digital-identity-spend-reach-16-7b-i2026-report-76202104/">digital transformation accelerates</a>. The inability to implement modern software solutions could also expose many companies to more security risks, since they may not have the technology they need to protect their infrastructure and their workforce in a digital environment.</p>



<p>“The lack of IT professionals is a huge problem when integrating modern software solutions, and we believe we have found a way to solve the issue,” said iDenfy CEO Domantas Ciulde.</p>



<p>The Magic Link was designed to solve that problem, and to make iDenfy’s identity services as accessible as possible. The solution essentially generates a unique identity link for the entire organization. That link reroutes end users to iDenfy’s identity portal, where they will then be walked through the company’s traditional onboarding and authentication process.</p>



<p>The solution is useful because it can be implemented without any programming or internal development, and does not require the creation of a different link for each individual. The universal Magic Link can instead be sent to everyone associated with an organization.</p>



<p>The Magic Link is one of several recent additions to the iDenfy portfolio. The company unveiled a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/idenfys-proxy-detection-system-identifies-ip-addresses-fight-fraud-052008/">proxy detection system</a> in May, and followed that with the release of a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idenfy-adds-risk-screening-fraud-prevention-portfolio-112301/">new risk screening tool</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>As the world moves towards digitization, financial institutions are looking to adopt identity verification solutions that verify and validate in near real time the identity of the customer.</p>
<p>The UAE Central Bank along with the Securities and Commodities Authority, Dubai Financial Services Authority, and the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority recently issued guidelines for those financial institutions adopting such technologies. Within these guidelines, the UAE governing authorities have approved the usage of facial verification to identify banking customers at the time of onboarding.</p>
<p>This growing trend of regulatory approved biometric solutions that rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to onboard clients is spreading across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. And with the rise of cybercrime – cyber-attacks occurring every 11 seconds, regulators and authorities looking to solutions that are in compliant with the highest security standards.</p>
<p>IDnow, a leading expert for digital identities and identity verification welcomes these new guidelines. With extensive expertise serving Germany’s and Switzerland’s highly regulated markets, IDnow has always focused on striking a balance between security and user experience.</p>
<p>IDnow’s regulatory affairs team is part of several regulatory working groups like ETSI, FIDO Alliance, W3C, and Hyperledger and consults authorities worldwide that are working on digital identity verification and authentication standards.</p>
<p>Being an expert has allowed IDnow to develop financial regulatory compliant products, notably, BankIdent. This completely AML-compliant online identification solution utilizes the users’ current online bank account to create an easy and secure identity verification service that effortlessly combines technology with existing identity and banking data. All that is required of the user is a valid photo ID, an active online bank account, and valid login credentials.</p>
<p>In addition, IDnow is looking closely into the latest developments around digital identity wallets in Europe and, is supporting different expert- and working groups with their expertise. The new law will allow people to have their official documents, such as their drivers’ license or ID card in one central place on their smartphone with easy access to it and, the assurance that their information is securely stored.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, IDnow is expanding its global footprint. It recently opened two offices in the United Kingdom and one in the United Arab Emirates and is also looking to set up a call centre in the Middle East to comply with regional data residency laws.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.panini.com/en">Panini</a> is best known for its check capture solutions, an area of FinTech it pioneered and dominated for over half a century. As digital transformation spurred a state of rapid evolution in financial services, particularly in banks, the company made <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/with-biometric-tech-in-development-panini-joins-fido-alliance/">the move to digital identity solutions</a>, which have become central to the modern banking experience both online and at the branch. Solidifying its pivot to the financial identity sector, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/panini-brings-biometric-authentication-solution-to-trustech-2021-811251/">Panini has just announced its BioCred solution</a>: a fingerprint biometrics technology that enables next generation in-branch banking experiences, upgrading the security, convenience, and customer experience of in-person transactions.</p>



<p>In our latest executive interview, FindBiometrics Editor in Chief Peter Counter speaks with Panini CEO Richard Kane about BioCred, how it expands the company’s offerings, and what it means for the world of banking as it continues to change under the influence of identity-first digitization.</p>



 Read the full FindBiometrics interview with Richard Kane, CEO, Panini: 



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: Panini is the leader in check capture solutions, and the new BioCred solution marks your first foray into biometric identity and authentication. How does BioCred expand upon Panini’s offerings?</p>



<p>Richard Kane, CEO, Panini: It all builds on our intimacy with leading financial institutions and our understanding of their needs. Panini is known in the banking technology space for the high quality and unmatched reliability of its banking hardware – the use of which will increase efficiency and yield significant savings. By stepping into the secure identity space, we are proposing something entirely new for our brand, while at the same time confirming the promises we’ve already made. But we’re no longer doing it with a hardware-centric proposal. Actually, the BioCred reader, despite its innovativeness, is only a piece of a whole system centered around an immaterial component: the BioCred credential.</p>



<p>FindBiometrics: During this time of digital transformation in finance, user experience is of the utmost importance. Customers demand the highest level of convenience and expect trustworthy security. What is the customer experience enabled by BioCred?</p>



<p>Richard Kane, CEO, Panini: Biometrics, almost by definition, represents security coupled with convenience. Consumers are already used to scanning their fingers to unlock their devices. Nearly everyone has a smartphone in their pocket that they use dozens of times every day for a variety of functions. This habit opens unprecedented avenues for a technology which is not all that new – it’s simply undergone a change in the way it’s perceived. It has become something familiar and friendly, while formerly it was mostly associated with police investigations, or unlocking a security vault.</p>



<p>With BioCred, customers will feel safer in the branches designed to serve them, thanks to a gesture that is no longer considered too personal or even awkward.</p>



<p>FindBiometrics: While end users demand low-friction solutions, relying parties like banks are in a similar position, demanding easy implementation of new technologies. What is the deployment process for BioCred?</p>



<p>Richard Kane, CEO, Panini: Our latest frontier in our core offering is the emergence of intelligent scanners, which are capable of autonomous processing, easier to install and support than traditional peripherals, and allow a wider range of applications. We believe intelligent devices are the future, so we are extending this philosophy to BioCred. The reader is directly connected to the branch LAN, while the internal user interface is likely to be replaced by a bank-customized one. To make the most of the solution, it will need to be integrated to the bank’s onboarding (identity verification, KYC/AML) and teller softwares, but the HTTPS protocol will make this step much easier than it would be with a traditional API or SDK. Moreover, BioCred readers are capable of remote monitoring thanks to their direct network connectivity. Panini can offer a platform that allows users to remotely check readers’ status, keep their firmware up to date, and even collect diagnostics data.</p>



 



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/live-webinar-entering-the-new-era-of-biometric-fintech/"></a><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/live-webinar-entering-the-new-era-of-biometric-fintech/">Learn more about biometrics and finance in our upcoming live webinar.</a> 



 



<p>FindBometrics: With fraud on the rise, privacy and data security is paramount. How does BioCred handle user data?</p>



<p>Richard Kane, CEO, Panini: As I mentioned earlier, the BioCred credential is center-stage. Non-biometric customer data (such as name, account number, SSN, and more) and most importantly their personal fingerprint data are packaged together in a unique, encrypted and digitally signed data string. This data is given back to the customer in the form of a QR code on their phone and uploaded to an NFC “companion,” such as a keyring fob, as a second means of data security. Both means are under the customer’s full control. The bank stores no biometric data, which needs to be protected according to privacy law provisions. This creates peace of mind on both ends – bank and customer. And when an enrolled customer enters a branch, they will be able to authenticate offline, with no need for the data to travel over the internet to receive a green light from a database – the green light will come from the reader itself. This approach truly combines security and convenience in an unprecedented way, and we’re sure the market will understand the value of this outstanding proposition.</p>



<p>FindBiometrics: Much of the buzz around financial biometrics in recent years has come from the boom of digital onboarding solutions that allow for remote banking. But we are starting to see a growing demand for in-person biometrics banks. Why is it important to have biometrics in the physical bank branch?</p>



<p>Richard Kane, CEO, Panini: It’s indisputable that the majority of institutions have been focusing on reducing fraud risks on the growing digital channel. As a consequence, some of them may have been caught off-guard in their most traditional channel, their physical branches, which still represent the most suitable channel to attract high-value customers and establish meaningful and profitable relationships with them. Just imagine: an important customer continually receives updates about all the online security improvements their bank is implementing against cyberthreats, phishing, data breaches, etc., but then they fall victim to an impersonation fraud carried out in a branch because the bank didn’t catch an impostor requesting services with a fake ID. The resulting embarrassment would be far worse than any fraud-induced financial damage!</p>



<p>Today, we’re ready to explain how Panini technology can help shape a secure, modern, and user-friendly in-person experience which can more than justify its relevance and growing prominence in times when physical interaction is being challenged.</p>



<p>FindBiometrics: How do you expect this expansion into biometrics to affect Panini’s trajectory, and how do you expect the banking sector to evolve as strong authentication at the bank becomes increasingly important?</p>



<p>Richard Kane, CEO, Panini: As we expand beyond the financial market, Panini’s technology and people will both continue to evolve. The business world has always been complex and risky, but that’s truer today than ever. The ability to identify your interlocutor securely without the need to verify the proper confidence levels by jumping through hoops is starting to become the standard, not only for banks, but in many other industries as well, such as healthcare, travel, entertainment, and the public sector.</p>



<p>FindBiometrics: What can we expect to see next from Panini?</p>



<p>Richard Kane, CEO, Panini: We believe that financial institutions are either already looking for an innovative, low-friction, and cost-competitive biometric application, or they are ready for one and just haven’t realized it yet. If the technology is proposed and justified in a meaningful way, we are confident most customers will embrace it enthusiastically. So, while Panini will still be leading the way in the world of payments, you can expect to see our identity-related ventures continue to expand as well!</p>

<p>2021 saw a diverse range of events in which Jolocom could participate in. From debates about the future of seIf-sovereign identity (SSI) to the role of trust in the age of AI (Artificial Intelligence) – there were many important take-home messages and ways for us to contribute in discussions. A brief overview of the events we participated in in 2021 also offers a good insight into our goals, values, and projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>February 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom took part in a virtual meeting of the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) back in February. Also included: the position paper of the organization, which was published in 2020: “Decentralized Identity: What’s at Stake?”. One of the founding principles of Jolocom is the mission to promote the establishment and maintenance of standards in our industry. We were therefore very pleased that Kai led the discussion as an active board member of INATBA and as co-chair of the organization’s Identity Working Group. Together with four stakeholders, he discussed the current role of decentralized identities and how they should shape in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keryl Folwer from Transmute, Anil John, Director of the Silicon Valley Innovation Program, Dr. Loretta Anania, Research Associate at GD Connect of the European Commission, and Daniel Du Seuil, Belgian Project Leader for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) formed the discussion group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The position paper was drawn up by INATBA with the aim of defining the expectations of an open and innovative market in a decentralized identity. It analyzes the current status of SSI developments and opens discussions about the next steps, makes demands on the most important stakeholder groups and sets goals for the future of SSI. Kai asked about the first reactions of the participants to the content of the paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karyl highlighted the role and importance of interoperability. Interoperability is the ability to interact with different systems. If two systems are compatible with each other, they are also called interoperable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anil, in turn, spoke out against a “techno-utopianism of a self-sovereign identity”, but made it clear that he believes in personal freedom of choice and control. This is also supported by Jolocom and is one of our basic standards. Using a digital self-sovereign identity (SSI), we are always working on being able to manage the control and security of their own data independently for the individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loretta praised the European Commission’s plan to make the next decade a double transition, with green and digital going into everything. She argued that it is good and important to be there now, at the beginning, especially when the standards are being set. Founded in 2014, Jolocom is very committed to the development of SSI standards. We are always working on building more trust in a decentralized network and protecting the digital autonomy of our own data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Daniel saw SSI as the answer to the new demand for a European digital ID. If the European digital ID is about empowerment, data protection and new models of data sovereignty, it must be technology-neutral. In the end, says Daniël, the question is always the same: How can we empower citizens?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The discussion between the participants was very lively and underlined, despite different opinions and backgrounds, common values. There was agreement on the increasing importance of digital decentralization, which can be described as a global trend. Furthermore, everyone agreed that this is an interesting time. Both industry and the public sector are more interested in decentralized identities and what they can offer them. Jolocom agreed with the general opinion that working together can also create interoperability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>May 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2019, Jolocom has been a partner to three out of four winning teams in the German innovation competition for setting up Secure Digital Identites (SDI) projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the DWeb Meetup in May 2021, Jolocom was invited to explain its role at ONCE, ID-Ideal and SDIKA in more detail, which Kai Wagner did as our representative. His key message was: The challenges that lie ahead of us also offer great opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The four projects must be harmonized with EU directives, W3C and the global community in general; this requires coherent concepts and an interoperability infrastructure. SSI and decentralized identities are booming: that’s why it is important to keep pace with market dynamics. The DWeb community can benefit greatly from the projects; However, this requires a coherent infrastructure and uniform concepts. In this way, as many EU citizens as possible are reached, who then get the chance to manage their identity independently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kai also presented the background to the projects and their goal. The digital identity card is officially on the market, but it is only actively used by 0.5% of the population. Kai pointed out that Germany does not have a leading role in the field of digital identities. At the end of 2019, four projects were then selected to address these problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>October 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The topic of “digital identities” is also more up-to-date than ever, especially driven by the corona pandemic and the associated increasing digitization in almost all areas of life. The online event “Digital Identity” of the BFM (Business Research Center) also took place on October 20, 2021 under this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a lively discussion, the main topics were data security, dealing with skeptics and the costs of a wallet. The group of experts included Irene Adamski as a representative for Jolocom, as well as Fabiane Völter as a research assistant at the University of Bayreuth, Thomas Ruch as the person responsible for credit management at BAUR GmbH and Boris Lingl as Head of Blockchain at DATEV, who tried to answer questions from the audience .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Above all, Irene presented the idea of a wallet and presented SSI as a global trend, which is, however, still a developing market in Germany. Therefore, the questions about the costs of a wallet could not be answered specifically, but it could still be said with certainty: There are no costs for the end user. In addition, the use of a wallet should be voluntary. However, EU citizens must be able to have a wallet made available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore the term of a transition period came up, which can definitely be expected. Data security is always in the hands of the user. In the event of a request to identify something, they can select and deselect which information they want to share or even reject it completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your own data is encrypted on your own wallet. You only pull out the information that you want to share.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>November 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in dealing with the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Irene presented the role of SSI as a possible solution. The specialist conference “Trust in the Age of AI-Supported Bots and Fakes: Challenges and Possible Solutions‘ on November 4th included some keynote speeches on the topics of fake reviews, deep fakes, and possible solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exciting examples of the use of artificial intelligence in everyday life make it clear that this is a global trend. At this lively conference, the dark side of AI was also highlighted. Identity theft, manipulation of politics, dissemination of pornographic content … dangers that arise from AI cannot be ruled out and lead to growing distrust in the digital space. How is this to be dealt with?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where the role of SSI comes into play. It is one of Jolocom’s basic principles to maintain and protect the autonomy of citizens. Irene was happy to explain this in more detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The basic idea: control your own data. Broken down: selectively choose who has access to his and her data and reject who should not have access. This is well expressed when using a digital wallet: I can prove that I am over 18 years old without having to share my personal date of birth. This selective transfer of data also brings more trust in the digital space with it. A secure wallet provides the opportunity to retain and protect autonomy over your own data in the early days of AI and automated bots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>2021 once again underlined the importance of of SSI is and how it is widely discussed. The team behind Jolocom is very happy to have attended such interesting events and looks forward to many more exciting discussions and meetups in 2022. </p>

<p> Vielfältig waren die Events, Diskussionen und Meetups an denen Jolocom dieses Jahr teilnehmen durfte. Von Debatten über die Zukunft von Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) bis zur Rolle des Vertrauens im Zeitalter von KI (Künstlicher Intelligenz) – Jolocom konnte viel beitragen und viel mitnehmen. Ein kleiner Überblick über die Events, an denen wir 2021 teilnahmen, gibt auch einen guten Einblick in unsere Ziele, Werte und Projekte.&nbsp; </p>



<p></p>



<p>Februar 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bereits im Februar nahm Jolocom an einem virtuellen Meeting der International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) teil. Mit dabei: das Positionspapier der Organisation, das bereits 2020 veröffentlicht worden war:,,<a href="https://inatba.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-INATBA-Decentralised-Identity-001.pdf">Decentralised Identity: What’s at Stake?</a>‘’. Eines der Gründungsprinzipien von Jolocom ist die Mission, die Etablierung und Aufrechterhaltung von offenen Standards in unserer Branche voranzutreiben. Daher freuten wir uns sehr, dass Kai als aktives Vorstandsmitglied der INATBA sowie als Co-Vorsitzender der Identity Working Group der Organisation die Diskussion leitete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gemeinsam mit vier Interessensgruppen diskutierte er die aktuelle Rolle dezentraler Identitäten, und wie sich diese in Zukunft gestalten sollten. Keryl Folwer als DIF Steering Committee Member, Anil John, Direktor des Silicon Valley Innovation Programme, Dr. Loretta Anania, Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin bei der GD Connect der Europäischen Kommission, und Daniel Du Seuil, der belgische Projektleiter für selbstsouveräne Identität (SSI) bildeten die Diskussionsgruppe. Das Positionspapier wurde von INATBA mit dem Ziel erstellt, die Erwartungen an einen offenen und innovativen Markt in dezentraler Identität zu definieren. Es analysiert den aktuellen Stand der SSI-Entwicklungen und eröffnet Diskussionen über die nächsten Schritte, stellt Forderungen an die wichtigsten Anspruchsgruppen und setzt Ziele für die Zukunft von SSI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kai fragte nach den ersten Reaktionen der Teilnehmenden auf den Inhalt des Papieres. Karyl stellte die Rolle und Wichtigkeit von Interoperabilität heraus. Als Interoperabilität bezeichnet man die Fähigkeit zum Zusammenspiel verschiedener Systeme.&nbsp; Wenn zwei Systeme miteinander vereinbar sind, nennt man sie auch interoperabel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anil wiederum sprach sich gegen einen ,,Techno-Utopismus einer selbstsouveränen Identität’’ aus, verdeutlichte jedoch, dass er an persönliche Entscheidungsfreiheit und Kontrolle glaubt. Dies wird auch von Jolocom unterstützt und gehört zu unseren grundlegenden Standards. Anhand einer digitalen selbstsouveränen Identität (SSI) arbeiten wir stets daran, dem Individuum die Kontrolle und Sicherheit zu geben, die eigenen selbstbestimmt verwalten zu können.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loretta lobte den Plan der Europäischen Kommission, das nächste Jahrzehnt zu einem doppelten Übergang zu machen, bei dem Grün und Digital in alles integriert werden sollen. Sie argumentierte, dass es gut und wichtig ist, bereits jetzt, am Anfang, dabei zu sein, insbesondere wenn die Standards festgelegt werden. Gegründet 2014, ist Jolocom sehr engagiert in der Entwicklung von SSI Standards. Wir arbeiten stets daran, mehr Vertrauen in ein dezentrales Netzwerk auszubauen und die digitale Autonomie der eigenen Daten zu schützen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Daniel sah SSI als Antwort auf die neue Forderung nach einer europäischen digitalen ID. Wenn es bei der europäischen digitalen ID um Empowerment, Datenschutz und neue Modelle der Datenhoheit geht, muss sie technologieneutral sein. Am Ende, so Daniël, sei die Frage immer dieselbe: Wie können wir die Bürger stärken?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Diskussion zwischen den Teilnehmenden war sehr angeregt und zeigte, trotz verschiedener Meinungen und Hintergründe, auch gemeinsame Werte auf. Einigkeit herrschte über den steigenden Stellenwert von digitaler Dezentralisierung, die als globaler Trend bezeichnet werden kann.&nbsp; Weiterhin stimmten alle zu, dass dies eine interessante Zeit ist. Sowohl die Industrie als auch der öffentliche Sektor interessieren sich mehr für dezentrale Identitäten und was sie ihnen bieten können. Jolocom stimmte der allgemeinen Meinung zu, dass nur durch enge Zusammenarbeit die dringend erforderliche Interoperabilität entstehen kann.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mai 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seit 2019 gehört Jolocom zu drei von vier Gewinnerteams des deutschen Innovationswettbewerbs zum Aufbau von Sicheren Digitalen Identitäten (SDI)-Projekten. Beim DWeb-Meetup im Mai 2021 wurde Jolocom eingeladen, seine Rolle bei ONCE, ID-Ideal und SDIKA näher zu erläutern, was Kai Wagner gerne tat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seine Kernaussage war dabei: Die Herausforderungen, die vor uns liegen, bieten gleichzeitig große Chancen. Die vier Projekte müssen mit EU-Richtlinien, W3C und generell der weltweiten Gemeinschaft harmonisiert werden; dazu braucht es kohärente Konzepte und Interoperabilitätsinfrastruktur. SSI und dezentrale Identitäten sind am boomen: deswegen gilt es, mit der Marktdynamik Schritt zu halten. Die DWeb Gemeinschaft kann von den Projekten sehr profitieren; Voraussetzung hierfür sind jedoch eine kohärente Infrastruktur und einheitliche Konzepte. So werden auch möglichst viele EU Bürger:innen erreicht, die dann die Chance erhalten, ihre Identität selbstständig zu verwalten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Außerdem präsentierte Kai den Hintergrund zu den Projekten und ihrem Ziel. Offiziell ist der digitale Personalausweis auf dem Markt, wird aber nur von 0.5% der Bevölkerung aktiv genutzt. Deutschland hat, so stellte Kai heraus, keine führende Rolle im Bereich digitaler Identitäten. Ende 2019 wurden dann vier Projekte ausgewählt, die diese Probleme angehen wollen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oktober 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Auch das Thema ,,Digitale Identitäten’’ ist so aktuell wie nie zuvor, besonders vorangetrieben durch die Corona-Pandemie und die damit verbundene zunehmende Digitalisierung in nahezu allen Lebensbereichen. Unter diesem Thema fand auch die online Veranstaltung ,,Digitale Identität’’ des BFM (Betriebswirtschaftliches Forschungszentrum) am 20. Oktober 2021 statt. Während einer angeregten Diskussionsrunde stellten sich vor allem die Themen der Datensicherheit, Umgang mit Skeptiker:innen und Kosten für eine Wallet in den Mittelpunkt. Unter der Expertengruppe befanden sich Irene Adamski als Vertreterin für Jolocom, sowie Fabiane Völter als Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin der Uni Bayreuth, Thomas Ruch als Zuständiger für die Kreditsteuerung der BAUR GmbH und Boris Lingl als Head of Blockchain bei DATEV, welche die Fragen des Publikums zu beantworten suchten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dabei stellte Irene vor allem die Idee einer Wallet vor und präsentierte SSI als einen globalen Trend, der jedoch in Deutschland noch ein Markt im Werden ist. Daher waren die Fragen nach den Kosten einer Wallet nicht konkret zu beantworten, dennoch konnte sicher gesagt werden: Für die Endnutzer kommen keine Kosten auf. Außerdem soll das Nutzen einer Wallet freigestellt werden. EU Bürger:innen müssen aber die Möglichkeit haben, eine Wallet zur Verfügung gestellt bekommen zu haben. Daher kam der Begriff einer Übergangszeit auf, mit der definitiv zu rechnen sei. Die Datensicherheit liegt immer in den Händen der Nutzer:innen. Im Falle einer Anfrage, etwas auszuweisen, können diese selbst an- und abwählen, welche Informationen sie teilen, oder es sogar komplett ablehnen. Die eigenen Daten liegen dabei allesamt verschlüsselt auf der eigenen Wallet. Ähnlich wie bei einer Brieftasche zieht man nur jene Informationen heraus, die man auch teilen möchte.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>November 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ebenfalls im Umgang mit der Zukunft von Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) stellte Irene die Rolle von SSI als möglichen Lösungsweg vor. Die Fachkonferenz ,,Vertrauen im Zeitalter KI-gestützter Bots und Fakes: Herausforderungen und mögliche Lösungen‘‘ am 4. November beinhaltete einige Impulsvorträge über die Themenbereiche Fake Reviews, Deep Fakes, und Lösungsmöglichkeiten. Spannende Beispiele vom Einsatz künstlicher Intelligenz im Alltag verdeutlichten, dass es sich um einen globalen Trend handelt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bei dieser angeregten Fachkonferenz wurden auch die Schattenseiten von KI beleuchtet. Identitätsklau, Manipulation der Politik, Verbreitung pornografischer Inhalte…Gefahren, die durch KI entstehen, sind nicht auszuschließen und führen zu wachsendem Misstrauen in den digitalen Raum. Wie ist hiermit umzugehen? Just an dieser Stelle kommt die Rolle von SSI ins Spiel. Es gehört zu Jolocom’s Grundprinzipien, die Autonomie von Bürger:innen im Netz zu wahren und zu schützen. Irene freute sich, dies näher erläutern zu können.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der Grundgedanke: die eigenen Daten kontrollieren. Aufgeschlüsselt: selektiv auswählen, wer Zugang zu ihren und seinen Daten hat, und ablehnen, wer keinen Zugang bekommen soll. Beim Nutzen einer digitalen Wallet kommt dies gut zum Ausdruck: Ich kann ausweisen, dass ich über 18 Jahre alt bin, ohne mein persönliches Geburtsdatum teilen zu müssen. Diese selektive Weitergabe von Daten bringt auch wieder mehr Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum mit sich. So liefert eine sichere Wallet die Möglichkeit, im beginnenden Zeitalter von KI und automatisierter Bots die Autonomie über die eigenen Daten zu behalten und zu schützen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2021 zeigte erneut, wie aktuell das Thema SSI ist und wie es vielseitig diskutiert wird. Das Team hinter Jolocom freut sich sehr, bei so anregenden Events dabei gewesen zu sein und bedankt sich bei den Organisatoren und anderen Teilnehmenden. Auf das 2022 noch viel weiteren spannenden Austausch bieten wird. –&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a continued focus on decentralized identity and data solutions, Ontology has worked to bring better trust, privacy, and security to the new&nbsp;web</p><p>In a relatively new industry like blockchain, change is a constant state. When Ontology launched at the end of 2017, Bitcoin was putting crypto on the map through continuous price surges, before crashing at the end of 2018. Since this time, in an uncharted landscape that at times seemed dominated by speculation, Ontology strove to be a lighthouse in a sea of confusion, providing clear and reliable blockchain use cases that put users’ interests first.</p><p>As the industry has progressed and the world has increasingly embraced decentralized solutions, privacy and security issues associated with Web2 and Big Tech have been exposed. Looking to facilitate a more secure and private internet in Web3, Ontology has been working hard to build out its public chain infrastructure, decentralized identity, and data solutions to support the transition to the new&nbsp;web.</p><p>As well as a more private and secure internet, Web3 offers the potential for fascinating use cases as the web becomes more integrated. The metaverse, an all-encompassing digital landscape populated by virtual people, places and things, will eventually see separate virtual worlds interlink and overlap the real world. To get there, we need a public chain that puts users’ security and privacy front and center, whilst also allowing for an interoperable virtual world. Over the last four years, Ontology has been working to create an infrastructure for just that and we are delighted to now be facilitating this vision of a better internet.</p><p>As we look to the future, we are excited to onboard new partnerships and make technological advancements that contribute to our vision of Web3, as well as to the growth of our global community.</p> Year 1: Laying The Foundations <p>The launch of Ontology’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ontology-mainnet-ontology-1-0-has-officially-launched">MainNet</a> 1.0 served to position us as a high-performance public blockchain. In a significant move for the wider industry, Ontology 1.0 was the first public chain capable of executing smart contracts with identity, setting the stage for our vision for decentralized identity solutions. To lay the foundations for the open governance model which has become a key aspect of Ontology, we introduced a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-launches-vbft-a-next-generation-consensus-mechanism-becoming-one-of-the-first-vrf-based-91f782308db4">new consensus algorithm, VBFT</a>, for the Ontology framework and the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-introduces-the-triones-membership-system-5211294976bf">Triones Consensus System</a>.</p> Year 2: Building Out Our Infrastructure <p>Year 2 saw Ontology crystallize our vision and mark out our position within the broader blockchain ecosystem. Gaining traction, we were able to supplement our MainNet by building on it with further enterprise projects that were focused on decentralized identity and data privacy. Broadening the technical applications of our chain, we launched <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-v1-8-0-goes-live-with-wasm-fa34e9f7f930">Wasm TestNet in May</a>, as well as the first-ever cross-chain TestNet. We didn’t stop there; in fact, it was a Multi-VM launch that year, with the launch of our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-sharding-design-released-c900331f71fa">Sharding Design</a> launching in October, which provided linear stability and support for cross-shard transaction processing.</p> Year 3: Global Expansion <p>Having made our mark on the industry through technical prowess, the Ontology mission for our third year was to become a cross-chain, global network that would expand our vision of decentralized identity and data through a host of fascinating partnerships.</p><p>Throughout the year, we improved our infrastructure through the roll-out of the Ontology Layer 2.0. Additionally, ONT ID was upgraded, which served to combine users’ decentralized identity with their ONTO Wallet with one single login, while providing a framework that helps users control their identity and data. This was a huge step towards interoperability and provided an interlinked suite of products to our&nbsp;users.</p><p>We introduced a new governance and staking model in July, affecting both our ONT and ONG tokens, complete with a <a href="https://node.ont.io/calculator/node">node and yield calculator</a> allowing users to easily estimate how much they could potentially earn from staking via ONTO. Excitingly, ONG also launched on Uniswap at the end of the summer, bringing Ontology’s token to a whole new user base. As the year developed, we deployed our cross-chain decentralized identity solution on Ethereum, Near, Neo, TRON, Klaytn, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot. We also partnered with Patract Labs in November to accelerate smart contract ecosystem development. Finally, we joined forces with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/daimler-mobility-partners-with-ontology-to-leverage-high-performance-technologies-and-transform-b469aa46e671">Daimler Mobility</a> AG’s Blockchain Factory to develop MoveX, a first-of-its-kind blockchain-based mobility platform for the automotive and mobility industry.</p><p>Towards the end of the year, our focus turned to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). In September 2020, we launched <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing.Finance</a>, a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi lending platform. Since then Wing has seen significant growth, with increased engagement in its DAO, and has also incorporated credit-based lending through Ontology’s unique OScore credit scoring solution. The Wing Inclusive Pool, a first mover in the industry, also allows users to under-collateralize assets and lower their interest&nbsp;rates.</p> Year 4: Web3 and Interoperability <p>This year, Ontology has honed our existing products to match our wider vision of Web3 and position ourselves as the public chain capable of moving towards a better, decentralized, interoperable internet that places user privacy and data security at the heart of its priorities.</p><p>To facilitate this vision, our technical team began developing the Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) at the start of 2021. Now on TestNet, our EVM will help us establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform, offering an inclusive experience to developers and users. This development will also help to cement Ontology’s position as a cross-chain interoperable blockchain, adding to its existing virtual machines; NeoVM, Native (Ontology) VM, and&nbsp;WasmVM.</p><p>Reflecting a major endorsement for decentralized identity, ONT ID surpassed 1.5 million users in September. Companies across the globe have also embraced the application this year, most notably through a social good <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/microworkers-integrates-ontologys-onto-wallet-to-facilitate-additional-payment-options-for-workers-1163291af76c">partnership</a> announced in March with global freelancing marketplace leader, MicroWorkers, where it is being used to assist workers to receive rewards and gain greater access to capital. To facilitate its ever-expanding user base, ONT ID underwent an upgrade that will improve user experience, while also making it easier for developers to build sophisticated applications and real-world use cases through ONT ID. The Ontology products now integrated with ONT ID&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, a new feature that makes trustless universal authentication for websites and applications possible, allowing users to log into multiple platforms without having to remember passwords.  <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, Ontology’s new decentralized solution for online identity verification, which helps applications access users’ verifiable credentials, such as KYC verification, whilst also allowing users to protect their privacy by authorizing information independently.  <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a>, a DeFi credit score, used to measure creditworthiness, which is calculated using different types of on-chain transaction data.  <p>Other partnerships have also contributed to Ontology’s arsenal. Most recently, we partnered with <a href="https://bloxmove.com/">bloXmove</a>, a business-to-business mobility blockchain platform designed to simplify travel across multiple forms of transportation, to bring decentralized identity to urban transport apps. In May, we partnered with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483">ROCKI</a>, a next-generation music streaming service and NFT platform. ROCKI will use Ontology’s decentralized identity solutions to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and peddling inauthentic NFTs. In June, we also <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-zaico-to-empower-its-inventory-management-system-increasing-traceability-29a604bf6123">announced</a> a partnership with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-zaico-to-empower-its-inventory-management-system-increasing-traceability-29a604bf6123">ZAICO</a>, a real-time cloud storage inventory management application based in Japan. We also partnered with AP.LLC, a private Japanese IT consultancy firm and hired a <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1391937705206972419">new</a> Japanese advisor, Matsuyama Kitao Takayuki.</p><p>Ontology’s growth in the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-growing-presence-in-japan-a31d3aaa0eb7">Japanese</a> market has accelerated following a string of announcements, including the news that ONT would be listed on the Japanese registered crypto exchange, <a href="https://www.decurret.com/">Decurret</a>. This marked the first listing of ONT in Japan, a huge milestone for Ontology and our growing Japanese community. The ONT/JPY trading pair went live in July, with over 40,000 ONT trading volume taking place. In August, ONT was listed on <a href="https://www.huobi.co.jp/">Huobi Japan</a>, another FSA-licensed Japanese exchange.</p><p>In January, we were delighted to announce the launch of a <a href="https://medium.com/onto/the-first-cross-chain-web-wallet-onto-web-is-coming-soon-8a9e89ff0e0">web-based ONTO wallet</a> to bring additional accessibility to millions of users through their web browser. Incredibly, this was the first-ever web wallet to support cross-chain assets and dApps while also addressing the growing demand for decentralized identity and data amongst users. We also ​​launched <a href="https://anydrop.ont.io/">ONTO Anydrop</a>, a decentralized airdrop distribution tool, that allows assets to be sent to up to 100 addresses in one transaction in a fast and secure manner across multiple mainstream blockchains. These significant achievements have led to a massive increase in users and community members of ONTO Wallet. The <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">ONTO</a> Wallet Twitter channel now has over 100K followers.</p><p>Wing, Ontology’s DeFi lending platform, also turned one this year. Over the past year, Wing has lived up to its title of a cross-chain platform through launching on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKt9oJxLPs">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/wingfinance/wing-ontologys-cross-chain-defi-lending-platform-now-live-on-okexchain-7c622d78f4ee">OKExChain</a> and most recently, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/wing-ontologys-cross-chain-defi-lending-platform-is-now-live-on-binance-smart-chain">Binance Smart Chain</a>. It also <a href="https://medium.com/wingfinance/wing-finance-launches-any-pool-a-decentralized-lending-pool-for-any-asset-b6eadbf9c4e8">launched</a> a new DeFi product, “Any Pool,” which allows for the contractualization and lending of any&nbsp;asset.</p> Looking Ahead <p>As we have seen, the last four years have been full of incredible achievements. Undoubtedly, our community is the support system that drives this success at Ontology. As we step forward into the next era of our future, we are proud to be a well-established blockchain that has stood the test of time. Moving into Web3, we believe we are the chain that can facilitate the needs of the new web. Not only do we expect our protocols and products to continue to facilitate this shift, but we also look forward to welcoming more people to the decentralized identity and data revolution.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>Supercharge your staking with Ontology’s Limited Edition NFT: Multiply your yield by&nbsp;9000X!</p><p>To celebrate Ontology’s 4th anniversary, we have made 10,000 limited edition NFT’s available for minting. Not only do they look great, but they will also be used to establish a special NFT Ontology Node where NFT holders benefit from the staking&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Minting takes place between November 27th 0:00 UTC and December 7th 0:00 UTC. However, minting will close when all 10,000 NFTs have been minted. Each NFT will cost 10 ONT to mint, with a unique ONT address able to mint a maximum of 10&nbsp;NFTs.</p> Stake NFTs and Earn&nbsp;ONG <p>When you mint your first NFT, you have helped to establish special NFT node owners. Congratulations!</p><p>NFT staking has significantly reduced the barrier of entry to establishing a node, by allowing you to do it together with your NFTs. A node owner requires a minimum of 10,000 ONT and pays fees of 500 ONG to establish the node. The special NFT node is established with the ONT used during the minting event and Ontology is covering the 500 ONG in fees as a part of the 4th anniversary celebrations.</p><p>90% of the ONG rewards earned by the node will be distributed between the NFT owners, with the remaining 10% being used, in the first instance, as a fund for those who choose to burn their NFTs (see below). When the NFT burning fund is full, the remaining 10% will be used to fund future Ontology&nbsp;events.</p> Redeem ONT <p>Should an NFT owner wish to do so, they can burn their NFT and redeem 10&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>Burning NFTs does not reduce the size of the stake in the node. Great news for those that don’t burn their NFTs, as their share of ONG rewards increases for every NFT&nbsp;burned.</p><p>Burning NFTs can increase rewards up to 9000 times for the remaining holder. Should all NFTs be burned, the ONG generated by the node will be used by Ontology for future community development.</p> More <p>NFTs feature additional use cases — stay tuned for more&nbsp;details!</p> Guide  1. Download the <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a> and Create an ONT ID&nbsp;Wallet <p>Click on the <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/app-basics/how-to-register-an-account-on-onto-wallet">link</a> to view the relevant&nbsp;guide.</p><p>Skip this step if you already have an ONT ID&nbsp;wallet.</p> 2. Prepare ONT and&nbsp;ONG <p>The minting fee of each NFT is 10 ONT, and all transactions on the Ontology blockchain require a small amount of ONG as fees. If ONG balance is insufficient, navigate to ONTO’s Assets page and click the ONT details page. Here, you can click on the upper right button to swap ONT for&nbsp;ONG.</p> 3. Mint&nbsp;NFT <p>Navigate to ONTO’s Discover page, search “Cyberspace 4 Philosophers” and open&nbsp;it.</p><p>Tap on the “Mint” button at the bottom left of the homepage to open the “Mint” page, then tap on the “Mint” button at the bottom. In the pop-up window, enter the mint number, then tap on the “Mint” button to finish the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Minted NFTs can be viewed and sent on the ONTO Assets — Collectibles page.</p> 4. Stake NFT and Claim ONG&nbsp;Reward <p>To earn ONG rewards, NFTs must be staked. The staking feature will be available after the minting is complete and the node has been established, which is 12/7 0:00 UTC or when all 10,000 NFTs have been&nbsp;minted.</p><p>Tap on the “Stake/Redeem” button at the bottom right of the homepage to open the “Stake/Redeem” page, then tap on the “Stake” button to stake ONT or the “Unstake” button to unstake&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>ONG rewards are distributed at the end of each consensus round. Tap on the “Claim” button to claim the ONG&nbsp;reward.</p> 5. Burn NFTs and Redeem&nbsp;ONT <p>Only unstaked NFTs can be burned. On the “Stake/Redeem” page, tap on the “Burn” button at the bottom left to burn NFTs. Then wait until the current consensus round ends, and then tap on the “Redeem” button at the bottom right to redeem&nbsp;ONT.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p><a href="https://www.fingerprints.com/">Fingerprint Cards</a> (FPC) is arguing that biometric payment cards can help mitigate some of the anxieties that consumers feel when making contactless payments. The company specifically <a href="https://www.fingerprints.com/2021/11/23/a-right-royal-contactless-card-supporting-uk-consumers-with-biometrics/">looked at the UK</a>, where the contactless payment cap jumped from £45 to £100 in October.</p>



  



<p>A higher payment cap should ostensibly deliver a better customer experience, since it allows people to make more purchases without needing to enter a pin. In practice, however, it can be a source of stress for merchants and consumers alike. Consumers are worried that fraudsters will be able to get away with more money if their card gets lost or stolen. Merchants, meanwhile, are worried about walk-off fraud, which occurs when someone taps to pay and does not realize that a PIN was required for that transaction (the new UK law still requires PIN verification if the cardholder exceeds £300 in consecutive transactions).</p>



<p>With that in mind, some British retailers have indicated that they will not implement the new contactless cap, and will instead stick to the safer £45. That is likely to create more confusion amongst the public, since people will not know whether or not the need to enter a PIN when they take out their card in different stores.</p>



<p>As it stands, 53 percent of the British public were worried about contactless fraud before the limit increase, while 26 percent were worried about confusion at checkout. Some banks are allowing customers to deactivate contactless payments or set their own personal contactless limits to assuage those fears, and to mitigate their own potential losses. Contactless fraud rates are currently low (around 2p for £100), but that number could increase with a higher limit, and banks and card issuers are obligated to refund the victims.</p>



<p>Biometric payment cards offer a potential solution to that problem. The use of fingerprint recognition adds a layer of biometric authentication to each transaction, and it does so while delivering the same level of contactless convenience. That helps guarantee that contactless transactions remain secure, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-cards-can-enable-higher-contactless-payment-caps-fpc/">regardless of the payment cap</a>, and encourages merchants to adopt more consistent contactless payment policies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>FPC noted that contactless payments in the UK went up 90 percent over the course of 2019, and now account for 57 percent of all in-store transactions. There is also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-survey-results-show-strong-interest-biometric-payment-cards-012009/">strong interest in biometric cards</a>, with 62 percent of the British public indicating that they would switch banks to get their hands on a biometric payment card. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/natwest-biometric-card-trial-powered-by-fpc-gemalto-610104/">NatWest</a> and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/natwest-rbs-trials-biometric-payment-cards-804303/">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> have both conducted biometric card trials in the UK using fingerprint technology from FPC.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aratek.co/">Aratek</a> is bringing a slew of biometric solutions to <a href="https://www.trustech-event.com/">Trustech 2021</a>. Most notably, the company will be using the opportunity to unveil the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aratek-hits-road-portable-marshall-fingerprint-scanner/">latest version of its Marshall tablet</a>, and to bring its TruFace facial recognition platform to the European market.</p>



  



<p>“Trustech is one show that Aratek doesn’t want to miss because year after year, the organizers manage to draw the highest quality audience in the digital identify, security and payments industries,” said Aratek International Business Division VP Samuel Wu. “It gathers thousands of end-users who will benefit from seeing Aratek’s biometric identity solutions in action.”</p>



<p>In that regard, the Marshall 8 is a rugged, portable device that can be used for biometric registration and authentication. The device offers fingerprint, face, and iris recognition capabilities, and also supports barcode and NFC communications. The device will perform well in indoor and outdoor environments thanks to its IP-65 rating, with Aratek arguing that the device is well-suited to law enforcement, voter registration, attendance tracking, and border control, amongst other applications.</p>



<p>TruFace, on the other hand, first <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-aratek-expands-portfolio-truface-facial-recognition-terminal-100201/">debuted in October of 2019</a>, though the solution has yet to make a splash in Europe. For Trustech, the platform has been integrated into the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-aratek-show-truface-intersec-2020-010705/">TruFace BA8300 terminal</a>, which is geared primarily toward access control and retail applications. Aratek noted that TruFace is a contactless authentication solution, and can therefore help meet the growing demand for touchless tech during the pandemic. The terminal supports fingerprint, barcode, QR code, and RFID readings in addition to facial recognition.</p>



<p>The TruFace terminal features Aratek’s TrustFace live face detection algorithm, and identifies users with built-in dual HDR cameras. Aratek will also be showcasing its full portfolio of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aratek-a700-m-fingerprint-module-features-large-surface-area7070405/">fingerprint scanners</a>. The scanners are all FBI-certified, and range from a simple FAP 10 scanner to the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aratek-unveils-new-a900-ten-print-fingerprint-scanner-062907/">10-print A900 FAP 60 offering</a>.</p>



<p>Trustech 2021 will run from November 30 to December 2 at the Paris Expo de Versailles. Aratek will be setting up shop at booth&nbsp;5.2 D 051.</p>

 From open-sourcing our Veriscope travel rule solution to partnerships with industry players like Tether and Panther Protocol, our team has been busy building the future of trust and compliance in blockchain. <p>What a few months it’s been for Shyft Network! We want to extend a big thanks to our entire community and partners who’ve contributed to many of our recent partnerships, updates, and key announcements. We have many exciting things — from long-awaited partnerships to product upgrades, DAO, and community campaigns — that will wrap up the year and take us into the next chapter of our journey building trust and validation into blockchain data.</p><p>To mark the end of the quarter, we’re taking some time to recap what’s happened since the summer, plus a tease of what’s to come. Thanks for being&nbsp;here!</p> The Shyft Federation Deploys the Shyft Bridge — and Signed the Constitution! <p>The Shyft Node Federation, our collective of Shyft Network validator nodes, has been hard at work since its official deployment in July of 2021. In early September, we announced the Fed had officially deployed the Shyft Bridge, a secure and efficient cross-blockchain asset transfer mechanism. The collaboration between the Shyft Node Federation and Chainsafe offers users the ability to deploy the Shyft Bridge between the Shyft Network and Ethereum to support minimal cross-asset transmission and minimal cost cross-chain smart-contract operations. <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-federation-deploys-the-shyft-bridge-65f64afa3cad">Read more about the Shyft&nbsp;Bridge.</a></p><p>Earlier in the month, the Shyft Node Federation, including CoinShares, Maven11, Fabric, ClicketyClack, Connect Capital, AD Node, Staking Team, Merkle Trading, BlockUnity, Paycase Financial, DeFi Technologies, Mempool Partners, Nodebased, NP IR, and others, publicly signed off on voting guidelines and node rights and responsibilities. This document included many of the ground rules that would enable improvement protocols and a framework for new nodes to enter the&nbsp;Network.</p><p>We’d like to again recognize and thank the entire Node Federation member network for their commitment to the highest level of trust in blockchain, our Network, and community.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/read-it-now-the-shyft-node-federation-constitution-is-public-c6b8957492d7">Read more about the Node Federation Constitution.</a></p> Tether Is Testing and Integrating Veriscope — Now Open-Sourced and Free to&nbsp;Use!​​ <p>On November 18, we shared the incredibly exciting news that leading stablecoin Tether (owned by Bitfinex) had begun testing and integrating Versicope. Tether’s integration kicks off the first stage in their trial of Veriscope, which will allow them to offer their customers a privacy-focused experience while also solving global compliance requirements for all participants across the ecosystem. <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-federation-deploys-the-shyft-bridge-65f64afa3cad">Read more&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>Tether’s Veriscope testing follows our announcement (<a href="http://tether">and FATF’s latest regulatory guidance</a>) from earlier in November that Shyft Network has officially open-sourced the Versicope technology, making it free and simpler than ever for people to use. This update, which serves to democratize access to compliance technology for the entire blockchain community, came only two months after we shared the<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf?source=user_profile---------10-------------------------------"> latest list</a> of exchanges involved in the phased deployment of Veriscope on our Network. Participating exchanges included Binance, Tether, Deribit, Bitmex, and&nbsp;Huobi.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-core-team-open-sources-veriscope-makes-travel-rule-compliance-open-free-and-adb4a8b6945e">Read more about Veriscope Open Sourcing</a>.</p> Shyft Network Partners with Panther Protocol to Advance Privacy Tech and Data Protection. <p>Our team has been busy planning and deploying partnerships with some of the top names across crypto and DeFi this quarter, including Panther Protocol, the end-to-end blockchain solution developing the privacy layer for Web3 and DeFi. In early November, Yahoo News got the scoop about our strategic partnership with the Panther team to accelerate the development of privacy-enhancing technologies, data protection tooling, and mission-critical data attestation services.</p><p>On the Shyft Network side, we’ll provide value to Panther Protocol through enterprise and government compliance and data attestation services, resulting from deploying Panther to Shyft Network’s Layer 1. This update is a direct solution for ensuring that institutional dark pools remain compliant while also private — a significant win for addressing issues of front-running and algorithm obfuscation amidst mass adoption in DeFi. Through this partnership and integrations, Shyft Network and Panther will continuously work together to advance privacy tech and collectively raise the bar on the state of data protection tools.</p><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/panther-protocol-shyft-network-partner-155046978.html">Read the full Panther Announcement.</a></p><p>The Panther news followed August’s <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-partners-with-kylin-network-to-deploy-data-oracles-for-compliant-defi-infrastructure-fcc2c7c3a233">partnership announcement</a> with Kylin Network, who we’re working alongside to deploy data oracles for complaint DeFi Infrastructure for Financial Institutions. Our Network’s opt-in compliance infrastructure, including whitelist addresses and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) and GDPR compliant systems, will be further strengthened by Kylin Network’s data infrastructure and oracle&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Speaking of Compliant DeFi, we shared a deep-dive blog post on this subject in October, giving our followers a look into how we’re ensuring compliance without removing the “De” from&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-networks-guide-to-compliant-defi-7faf7c0c1872">Read the full Guide to Complaint DeFi</a>.</p> Compliant DeFi, Tokenomics, &amp; Solving the Internet’s Identity&nbsp;Problem <p>For those looking for more insight into our technology and our mission to build the most secure future for trust and identity in blockchain, be sure to check out our blog post on how we’re solving <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-solving-the-internets-identity-problem-dc8e2fe9f58">The Internet’s Identity&nbsp;Problem</a>.</p><p>Following our long-awaited mainnet launch, we shared Part 3 in a series on The Shyft Network Token ($SHFT), including a complete overview of our token distribution and economics. From insight into inflation and DAO-related asserts to a full economics breakdown — <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-network-token-distribution-and-economics-part-3-880d1e3ba5d3">read this blog post to get fully up to speed on our tokenomics.</a></p> What’s Next <p>As we move into the end of the year, Shyft Network looks forward to sharing news of a significant exchange announcing live testing of our Veriscope travel rule solution. Also, stay tuned for details on a major industry player joining our Node Federation to help push complaint DeFi products.</p><p>As crypto, DeFi, NFTs, and various digital assets experience increased growth, volatility, and regulation, there’s never been a more critical time to develop compliant solutions and build out robust communities that are engaged and aligned with our mission. Watch this space for more updates as we near the end of this monumental year.</p><p>— The Shyft Network&nbsp;Team</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner. Shift Network allows and gives incentives to individuals and enterprises to work together to add context to data, unlocking the ability to build authentic digital reputation, identity, and credibility frameworks.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network">Website</a> / <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">Medium</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">Discord</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/9hSlozOTEaY">Click here</a> to watch the recording of this&nbsp;webinar.</p><p>On November 25th, 2021 Affinidi’s Global Developer Ecosystem (GDE) hosted its second webinar titled “How digital credentials can help unlock safe travels beyond&nbsp;COVID?”</p><p>This one-hour session had Toby Berger, the Director of Travel Affinidi and Shankar Pillai, the Director of Engineering, Health/Travel Affinidi as speakers.</p><p>The host for this event was Kamal Laungani, the Global Developer Ecosystem Manager. He introduced the guests and talked briefly about the concepts of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, and the role of Affinidi in this&nbsp;space.</p> COVID Verification Solutions by Toby&nbsp;Berger <p>Toby Berger started by reminding us of the COVID pandemic in the early 2020s and how it impacted people and disrupted industries and businesses. He opined that this also pushed businesses to explore new horizons, especially those involved in the travel industry, as the complexity of operations increased with quarantines and vaccinations.</p><p>He explained that this situation also brought up the need for a verification solution that enabled verifiers like government and airport authorities to safely and securely check the vaccination status of travelers, so steps can be taken accordingly to prevent the spread of&nbsp;COVID.</p><p>After detailed discussions with governments and other stakeholder, Affinidi Travel identified a bunch of common considerations that included:</p>  Interoperability across global standards and&nbsp;formats.  A competitive and unified&nbsp;pricing  Ease of integration with existing solutions  A flexible rules engine that supports global safe travel regulations  A simple and intuitive UI  An underlying trust network that connects to a global support group of industry&nbsp;peers.  <p>Based on these inputs, the CommonCheck solution was built, and it offered the following benefits for&nbsp;users.</p><p>With these thoughts on how Affinidi’s verifiable solution is shaping the travel industry, Toby ended his&nbsp;session.</p> Affinidi Travel Demo — Shankar&nbsp;Pillai <p>Shankar started his interesting session by explaining the in-depth architecture of the system to give the audience an idea of how the common considerations mentioned by Toby earlier were integrated into the system to give all users the benefits of a verification solution.</p><p>Here’s a look at the architecture.</p><p>This explanation was followed by a demo of the live&nbsp;system.</p><p>The CommonCheck application of the Affinidi Travel Ecosystem comes with a simple UI that takes information from users and creates a VC that can be shared with anyone as a QR code. This VC is trusted as it is issued by a company that is authorized to test for COVID and also, it is tamper-proof, so the results can’t be changed by the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>Shankar showcased the simplicity and ingenuity of the application and ended his session by saying that this product can be used as an API as&nbsp;well.</p> Walkthrough of the Affinidi Tech Stack — Kamal&nbsp;Laungani <p>The last part of the webinar was handled by Kamal where he walked the attendees through the <a href="https://affinidi.com/api">Affinidi tech stack</a> and how it can be leveraged to build VC-based applications. He also did a demo of <a href="https://schema.affinidi.com/">Affinidi’s Schema Manager</a> and how it can be integrated with any application.</p><p>He even showed the audience how to issue a VC for attending the&nbsp;webinar!</p> Q&amp;A Session <p>The webinar ended with a Q&amp;A session that saw some interesting questions from the participants.</p><p>Some of the questions that were asked&nbsp;were,</p>  Does Affinidi support the Good Health Pass Collaborative standard?  How are you managing integration with Gvt systems for verification / entry /&nbsp;exit  Recently tried issuing a VC via YourEdge app. Aside from Email Addresses, are there any other means to write and deliver a VC to someone without knowing their email&nbsp;address?

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the 14th interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/a7izaidi">Polaris</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English</a> community.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I have been a Neo supporter, and from the Neo reddit group I found out about Ontology and the airdrop which was given to Neo holders. Unfortunately, I left it very late to sign up for the newsletter, so I missed the 1000 ONT airdrop and only got a small amount of ONT from holding my NEO’s. I was fascinated when I looked at Ontology’s whitepaper, and how they envision an extremely fast blockchain for businesses and identity as the main USP. I think after reading the whitepaper, I was convinced that the way Ontology envision the future is the right way, andthat drew me towards&nbsp;Ontology</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>The ever-evolving blockchain industry is still at an early stage where a combination of many variables make up the whole industry. We have managed to understand how a decentralized distributed ledger works, how to create smart contracts on that distributed ledger, and to create content and immortalize it on the blockchain. However, identity is not something which the industry is fully focused on, instead a more anarchical utopia is often created where no one has a connection to identity and these ideologies iterate that somehow the worlds economy will run fine with a rogue infrastructure. I think the fact that Ontology has focused on identity and decentralized trust from the very beginning gives me a clear indicator that the theme is to bring real use cases from the technology, and that’s what really excites me because real use cases of the blockchain will promote a smart economy, a fairer and more transparent economy, while not having to compromise our privacy. This eventually will translate to an economy which will run on centralized and decentralized platforms, and being part of that future is something I always wanted to do. The fact that my understanding of technology usage is aligned with Ontologies vision, makes me want to be a champion of the&nbsp;brand.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I love the word Harbinger, it means someone who initiates changes. Being given the freedom to bring ideas to the table, while receiving all the support I need, is something I cherish greatly. The key role, from my point of view, is to represent Ontology and bridge the gap between the community and the team. To establish deeper connections with the community. To be able to get the general sentiment from the community about the project and be able to relay that onto the team. To think of innovative idea to further drive user/community engagement. To think of innovative ideas to educate about the industry and the eco system in&nbsp;general.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Being part of any community is something we as humans have been deeply ingrained to do. We have always been very tribal towards our culture, geographical location, genetics etc. Now, we are beginning to realize that those things don’t matter and the only way forward is to be as one. We need to be more integrated towards how we do business and how we interact. Ontology’s vision and global community gives me that feeling of belonging, where my understanding of the future is the same as a lot of others. That is why this community is important for&nbsp;me.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Well, we all want a decentralized future but we all also want our assets to be pegged with real life identity so that there is some sort of legal connection with the asset. If the future will be using blockchain technology, then I cannot see that happening without identity and trust. Without these two factors, future adoption will be halted. I think a lot of members from the community agree on this. So having realistic expectation of the future is what makes this community stand out. They support decentralized identity and having full control of one’s&nbsp;data.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>Currently I am using real life interactions with business owners and corporations. I’m trying to make them understand the benefits of using blockchain, not just as a store of value but as a precursor towards a completely new, fairer industry. I also use telegram, discord, and twitter spaces for my socials. Absolutely I would like to see more educational videos on YouTube and all other platforms.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>I have had many memorable experiences being part of the eco system, I have been part of the community in all the ups and downs and to be honest it’s been a great journey so far. I remember not seeing my tokens on my wallet once and being supported by the community, it was a UI problem which eventually got sorted. Along the journey I have learnt so much from all the other admins/harbingers, and without their support I don’t think I would be a harbinger today. So my advice to all new community members/potential harbingers would be to not be afraid to ask and learn, we are here to support everyone and equip them with the correct knowledge and support so they can resonate on that with&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Global, Passionate, Loyal</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>I am quite happy with the way the current community engagement works. To improve it even further, we might need to think about more innovative ways. Things like a NFT marketplace, where artist and musicians mint their work using Ontology’s blockchain, or having a monthly roundup on twitter&nbsp;spaces.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>The completion of EVM would be a huge milestone for Ontology, and with that the eco system will attract a lot of developers and blockchain enthusiasts. The community needs to be ready to help and educate the new members about the benefits of DID, OSCORE, and cheap transaction costs, all while controlling their privacy. If all the Harbingers and members of the community keep the user engagement high, that will ensure that this technology can be widely accepted by the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>With advancing technology, many companies have switched from orthodox authentication methods to cutting-edge biometric authentication and its components. Fingerprint, facial, and palm recognition remain the most common types, biometric voice recognition has seen a rise.&nbsp;</p>



 What is Biometric Voice Recognition? 



<p>Biometric Voice Recognition is the use of the human voice to uniquely identify biological characteristics to authenticate an individual unlike passwords or tokens that require physical input.</p>



  



<p>Massive advances in neural network technology have led to the development of voice biometrics that are faster and more accurate than other methods. These biometric voice recognition systems have access to larger use cases and can identify an individual with less amount of speech samples.&nbsp;</p>



 Where is the Voice Biometric Market Heading? 



  
  The market size of biometric voice recognition is expected to grow from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/voice-biometrics-market-104503105.html">$1.1 billion USD</a> in 2020 to $3.9 billion USD by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 22.8% during the forecast period.&nbsp;  



  Due to insufficient security features, device interactions in the finance sector are limited. Fraud attacks against financial institutions have increased by <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/voice-biometrics-market">269%</a> over the previous four years, more than most other industries investigated.&nbsp;  



  Financial institutions are likely to employ voice recognition in combination with their speech-recognition applications in the future.  
  



 How Does Biometric Voice Recognition Work? 



<p>Voice biometric recognition works by inputting the the voice of the individual whose identity has to be stored in the system. This input is kept as a print for authentication. The input print is made with software that can split the voice statement into multiple frequencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://imageware.io/behavioral-biometrics/">Behavioral attributes</a> are identified at this stage that work mutually to make up the voice print. Voice recognition is much like iris or fingerprint recognition. Each one is unique to an individual and cannot be duplicated. These prints are stored in the database for further authentication.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a text independent system focuses and matches unfamiliar speech with previously stored voice information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two types of voice authentication:</p>



<p>Text-independent recognition: The system does not keep any pre-recorded audio to compare with the input in this case. It’s a voice authentication approach that doesn’t require any prior speech material to be entered into the biometric system. It is far more practical because it allows for free speech.</p>



<p>Text-dependent recognition: This necessitates the repetition of a previously delivered sentence that has been stored in the system, posing a speech content limitation.</p>



 Voice Biometrics Use-Cases 



<p>Voice biometric recognition has multiple use cases. Some of them are:</p>



 Contact Centre 



<p>The contact center industry is perhaps the most common application of speech biometrics. By avoiding the laborious security questions at the start of every customer service interaction, using voice to verify and authenticate callers saves time and effort for both the consumer and the agent.</p>



 Fraud Detection 



<p>Voice biometrics is a powerful fraud-detection tool. Multi-factor authentication is increasingly being used to prevent unauthorised access to client data or financial resources, since identity theft is on the rise. Voice biometrics offers a safe, spoof-resistant authentication mechanism.</p>



 Financial Services  



<p>In recent years, the global financial services market has seen significant changes. Customers’ lives have been made easier by mobile banking and other FinTech alternatives, but there has also been an increase in danger. Thousands of verifications a day, in many languages, are processed using voice biometrics.</p>



 Digital Signatures 



<p>Voice biometrics can be used to establish voice signatures, which are a legally binding means of underwriting documents like life insurance contracts. Financial transactions can also be authorised using voice signatures.</p>



 Workforce Management 



<p>The use of voice biometrics in workforce management apps is currently commonplace. Speech verification is a secure alternative to badging systems for organisations with a big, scattered workforce.</p>



 Advantages of Biometric Voice Recognition 



 1. Low Operational Costs 



<p>Call centres and even banks can save money by using voice authentication. It saves them millions of dollars by eliminating many of the steps necessary in traditional verification methods. It can recognise the customer’s voice during an end-to-end chat to authenticate their identity without the need for customary inquiries.</p>



 2.Enhanced User Experience 



<p>Another advantage of voice biometric systems that is often neglected is that they have the ability to greatly improve customer experiences. Callers no longer need to offer passcodes, PINs, or answer challenge questions to verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This makes speech biometrics perfect for omnichannel and multichannel deployments, as a customer’s voiceprint can be used across all of your company’s support channels once they’ve been enrolled.</p>



 3. Increased Accuracy 



<p>Voice authentication is more accurate and trustworthy than passwords, which are easy to forget, modify, or guess. It’s similar to fingerprints, which no one else can have. In other words, unlike passwords, you cannot forget or reproduce a voice. Despite the fact that the sound may be impacted by a variety of things, it is far more reliable and convenient.</p>



 4. Easy to Implement Technology 



<p>Many businesses value the simplicity of voice recognition biometrics in terms of use and implementation. Some biometric technology can be challenging to integrate into a business and to get started with. However, voice biometric systems can usually be implemented without additional equipment or systems because they require so little.</p>



<p>Because this technology is so simple to use, companies can often reassign personnel elsewhere in the organisation to boost performance and customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>Voice authentication is a great way to verify a user’s identification since it adds additional layers of protection that manual pass codes might not provide. Voice authentication is beneficial for both customers and the business as it removes frustration associated with cumbersome login processes.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/11/05/a-national-data-privacy-regulation-is-good-for-business/?sh=32473f1b3222">Forbes Technology Council</a>&nbsp;has said a national data privacy regulation could save companies time and money and help them focus on business success and customer satisfaction rather than get lost in the maze of privacy regulation and compliance. 



<p></p>



<p>We completely agree.</p>



<p>Most commentators agree the US data privacy regulatory landscape is shambolic. Only&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-and-why-you-must-still-keep-control-of-your-personal-information/">California</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/07/colorado-passes-consumer-data-privacy-law/">Colorado</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1392">Virginia</a>&nbsp;have passed state laws, while a raft of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">other state regulations</a>&nbsp;are on the table but not yet passed. A national data privacy law was&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">looking promising</a>&nbsp;earlier this year but is now widely considered a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/">way off</a>.</p>



<p>But the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/11/05/a-national-data-privacy-regulation-is-good-for-business/?sh=32473f1b3222">Forbes Technology Council</a>&nbsp;points out the already heavy compliance burden (financial and operational) on businesses will only increase when these laws pass. Compliance with the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/report-finds-organizations-may-spend-55b-in-initial-ccpa-compliance-costs/">CCPA</a>and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cybersecurity-privacy-forensics/library/privacy-reset.html">GDPR</a>&nbsp;is proving hugely costly, according to PwC, since laws worldwide differ just enough to demand businesses stay aware of their obligations and implement the systems they think will be protective enough across all regulations or at least the most challenging one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forbes says the hardest hit will be the mid-market enterprises and non-profit organizations that don’t have the resources to keep up.</p>



<p>Forbes rightly asks: “How will businesses manage the nuanced differences among them, and how much time will this take? Will they face multiple fines for the same incident? What happens if the regulations have conflicting provisions? Does any company really want to restrict business activity while it wastes time in court defending how it struggled to resolve conflicts between different privacy regulations?”</p>



 Everything points to the solution being a unified, national data privacy law, to bring cohesion to an otherwise time-consuming and resource-intensive mess. 



<p></p>



<p>We are seeing some data privacy progress in the US, such as President Biden’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3638750/biden-s-cybersecurity-executive-order-progress-report.html">cybersecurity executive orders</a>&nbsp;and more&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/consumers-could-gain-from-ftcs-stronger-focus-on-data-protection/">privacy-oriented commissioners</a>&nbsp;appointed to the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>Forbes says businesses are suffering dreadful inertia and doing nothing or very little while they wait for a national law, which will hurt both the business and its customers in the long term, especially via major&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;which aren’t reducing in size or frequency. Data breaches not only put consumers at risk; they make consumers doubt companies and governments and increasingly reject the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">data surveillance business model</a>&nbsp;and data access&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers don’t like or trust</a>.</p>



<p>Forbes says businesses that do try to do the right thing pay for it in development costs and legal fees as they flounder around trying to work out which requirements are important to their business.</p>



<p>It’s a no-brainer then when Forbes concludes “… only a sensible national privacy regulation” can help businesses to see which technologies and processes they need to protect both their business and their customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, as we do here at Anonyome Labs, Forbes reminds companies it’s still up to them to stay vigilant and proactive in protecting their customers’ data privacy while the country waits for the national data privacy law saga to come to a successful end.</p>



<p>One of Forbes’ suggestions is for companies to “build a top-down, data-driven culture of privacy based on zero trust, data encryption and the ethical use of data.”</p>



 And that’s where&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;can help. Sudo Platform is the complete privacy and cybersafety toolkit for integrating next generation identity protection and privacy into your brand’s products and services.&nbsp;

<p>Digital Identity is moving to a new paradigm that will revolutionize the approach to digital identity management, ensured by the security of blockchain technologies.</p>



<p>In the self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework, digital identities will no longer be merely an element to support commercial transactions but become a new strategic asset around which financial institutions must leverage to create new value, develop new business models, and generate new revenue streams.</p>



<p>A new approach that will allow financial market players to capitalize on the large amount of data at their disposal in full compliance with regulations.</p>

 Highlights <p>The Ontology global community is constantly growing, with membership now close to 110,000. More and more Ontology contributors are working together for the long-term, healthy development of Ontology projects. This week, another Ontology member from the English community became an Ontology Harbinger. We currently have 14 enthusiastic Ontology Harbingers, who come from all over the world and work in different fields. They are active in different language communities of Ontology, including English, Filipino, Hindi, etc. They share their ideas, organize various community activities, and are committed to building a better Ontology ecosystem.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet and are 93% finished with testing. At the same time, a large number of community developers are actively participating in the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Security Vulnerabilities and Threat Intelligence Bounty Program</a>”, launched by Ontology and SlowMist.  We have finalized Ethereum RPC support and have fully completed internal testing. The TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 93% done with&nbsp;testing.  We have completed 100% of Ontology’s Ethereum account system development and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 94% done with&nbsp;testing.  The EVM/OEP-4 asset seamless transfer technical solution, which facilitates the efficient conversion between OEP-4 assets and EVM assets, is complete and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 95% done with&nbsp;testing.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the decimals of ONT and ONG and we are in the process of internal&nbsp;testing.  The ontology-go-sdk and ontology-java-sdk support ONT and ONG decimals&nbsp;updates.  We are 10% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.   Product Development   ONTO App v4.1.1 was released, adding support for the Harmony Chain, wallet switching function for dApps supporting multiple chains, and support for configuration of token&nbsp;unit.  ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://theontoteam.medium.com/60c8fb4fcc08">BabySwap</a>, the first 100 participants, and top 20 participants who stake the most will receive the highest tier of rewards. Voting for ONTO in BabySwap also has a chance to get extra rewards. The event is in progress, and will end at 07:59 (Singapore time) on November&nbsp;27th.    ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-x-mcdex-host-trading-campaign-over-6000-up-for-grabs-7785f0dbabec">MCDEX</a>, the first 300 participants will receive rich rewards. The event is in progress, and will end at 17:00 (Singapore time) on November&nbsp;26th.    ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-ocp-finance-team-up-for-staking-campaign-4500-up-for-grabs-4189a1662da5">OCP Finance</a>, the first 150 participants, and top 20 participants who stake the most will receive the highest tier of rewards. Participants who meet certain conditions will have the chance to enter a lottery. The event is in progress, and will end at 17:00 (Singapore time) on November&nbsp;24th.   On-Chain Activity   121 total dApps on MainNet as of November 22th,&nbsp;2021.  6,823,269 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 6,162 from last&nbsp;week.  16,733,530 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 26,331 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   1,295 new members joined our global community this week, and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1461272979376160769?s=20">Geoff Richards</a> from the English community officially became a Ontology Harbinger. This excellent community member will bring more new energy to our community, and also welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join&nbsp;us</a>.  Ontology published the next couple of interviews in its Harbinger Series. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-geoff-2cfe6bbc5f2">Geoff Richards</a> from our English community said that compared with other blockchain communities, members of the Ontology community are more willing to help people by sharing their own experiences. The community also attaches great importance to the voice of each member, and can listen to their problems, suggestions and various solutions in&nbsp;time.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1461416416788328448?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He focused on how decentralized identity empowers the metaverse; The metaverse requires the unity and integrity of our identities. Ontology’s decentralized identity solution can be seamlessly integrated into metaverse games to generate a unified identity based on the user’s behavior, which is convenient for users to use in various&nbsp;games.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1460190696451624960?s=20">Telegram weekly Community Call</a>, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about Ontology’s Staking strategy and upcoming 4th anniversary NFT event; Community members expressed their great anticipation for this extraordinary commemorative event.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Forbes — <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seansteinsmith/2021/11/08/crypto-is-the-key-to-the-metaverse/?sh=7ea96ad91e94&amp;utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=5893818776&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesCrypto">Crypto Is The Key To The Metaverse</a></p><blockquote>The promise of the metaverse is that it will provide users an augmented reality experience that — in many ways — might exceed physical reality in terms of the experiences and opportunities therein. What is oftentimes missing from the discussions around the potential of the metaverse is how all of this information will be secured and protected. Specifically, if an individual or group of individuals are going to be engaging with other people in a virtual environment there needs to be some form of assurance that these transactions are&nbsp;secure.</blockquote><blockquote>Hacks and data breaches occur on a frequent basis, but if people are going to be expected to engage in a wholly online and virtual environment, the underlying platform on which they are going to be using needs to be&nbsp;secure.</blockquote><p>After long-term practice, the Ontology Decentralized Identity (DID) solution has been proven to be able to achieve strong privacy protection, and can seamlessly integrate various applications and platforms. This means that applications in the field of Metaverse can make up for their own deficiencies in privacy protection by integrating Ontology DID solutions, and attract more users to join&nbsp;them.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Sphonic partners with identity verification platform to offer complete suite of regulatory technology for multi-jurisdicational compliance 
<p>London and Manchester, November 23, 2021: Leading Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, IDnow, has announced its first UK channel partner, Sphonic. The partnership will enable Sphonic to offer a suite of RegTech that meets different global compliance standards via a single API.</p>
<p>The partnership comes at a pivotal time for the industry; according to Gartner’s Market Guide for Identity Proofing and Affirmation, by 2023, 75% of organisations will be using a single vendor with strong identity orchestration capabilities and connections to many other third parties for identity proofing and affirmation, an increase from fewer than 15% currently.</p>
<p>“Given the importance placed on orchestration technology in the overall area of compliance, and the regulatory requirements that continue to drive the agenda when it comes to identity and fraud, it was vital we partnered with an identity verification provider that could vigorously meet the varying obligations that exist right across Europe,” explains Andy Lee, Founder of Sphonic.</p>
<p>“By partnering with IDnow, we are able to offer an ever-more integrated solution that brings all identity profiles into one place for more intelligent identity scoring. And when combined with its enviable relationships with European regulators, IDnow was the ideal choice as we continue to deliver great customer experiences to the highest standards of regulatory compliance.”</p>
<p>Known for its pioneering Know Your Customer (KYC) / Know Your Business (KYB) orchestration technology, Sphonic recently launched its real-time Transactional Monitoring System, which allows fintechs, banks and gaming operators to monitor fraud, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and affordability data in a single integrated platform. Its suite of RegTech, including KYC, KYB and Fraud and Risk Management also helps compliance teams to build a complete digital picture of each customer in order to fast-track customer onboarding.</p>
<p>James Hudson-Dale, Partnerships Manager at IDnow, adds: “Anti-impersonation and identity fraud is on a worrying upward trend, making it more important than ever for businesses to ensure they are compliant beyond simply box ticking. Our leading identity verification technology will provide Sphonic customers with the option of imposing additional verification methods to ensure the threshold is high quality and the person is who they say they are.</p>
<p>“As our first channel partner, we’re excited to be working with Sphonic to build a truly unique suite of products, that will bring together multiple data sources to ensure clients can accurately verify identities, combat fraud and meet European-wide regulatory requirements while maintaining flexibility of choice.”</p>
<p>IDnow launched into the UK in 2019 and recently announced eightfold year-on-year growth in the region, with demand for its services rising significantly as industries accelerated digitisation in response to the Covid pandemic. This growth is aligned with the global demand the firm is experiencing, with more and more companies around the world deciding to switch to fully digital application processes.</p>
<p>As part of its high-growth strategy, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become recognised as an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 900 customers worldwide, including Canopy, MyCDD, Entain and ICICI.</p>

Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-186-what-is-web3-155d493ac6c5">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-13-defi-and-identity-compliance-in-a-decentralized-world-5c590f8a484b">EPISODE 13 — DeFi and Identity: Compliance in a decentralized world</a></p><p>This week:</p>  What is a DAO and why does it&nbsp;matter?  Tweet of the week — web2&nbsp;edition  Regulating stablecoins  Stuff happens   1. What is a DAO and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>Last week,<a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-186-what-is-web3-155d493ac6c5"> we talked about web3</a> — what it is and how it’s different from web1 and web2 (with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezH_7qEk50">a little help from Chris&nbsp;Dixon</a>).</p><p>This week, we’re talking about DAOs and why they might be crucial to the development of web3. DAO stands for decentralized autonomous organization. Really, it’s just another framework for running and managing an organization — powered by tools for governance, collective wallets, and identity.</p><p>I remember people talking about the concept as early as 2013 (although the conversation probably started even before then). Mike Hearn was sort of the smart contracts guru back then and one of the leading voices on the subject — here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVyv4t0OKe4">a talk he gave at the Turing Festival that&nbsp;year</a>.</p>A DAO owning a copy of the U.S. Constitution? Why not. (Besides Ken Griffin.)<p>Fast forward 8 years and what was once a concept is now a reality. DAOs are a thing now — like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/17/constitutiondao-raises-27m-on-eve-of-sothebys-auction-people-could-be-the-reason/">this organization that recently made headlines for raising money and attempting to buy a copy of the American Constitution</a>.</p><p>One of the central features of web2 is corporation controlled, closed and proprietary networks — maybe not so different from the early days of the internet when you logged onto AOL or Compuserve.</p><p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with a public corporation that reports to shareholders. It’s been a wildly successful framework ever since it was developed by the Dutch, underpinning our modern financial system.</p><p>But there might be an inherent conflict when it comes to data and profit hungry corporations running our networks. Chris Dixon has been on a tear lately when it comes to talking about the next chapter of the internet so I’ll <a href="https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/lets-run-the-experiment-a-conversation">let him take it from&nbsp;here</a>:</p><blockquote>My conclusion after observing and participating in this over roughly 20 years is that it’s not a problem with the people but a problem with the model. The core issue is there is a fundamental misalignment between the needs of a corporation and the needs of a network. Corporate-owned networks follow a predictable life cycle. When they start out, they try to attract users and 3rd-party complements like software developers and creative people. As they grow in popularity and move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and 3rd parties steadily&nbsp;grows.</blockquote><blockquote>When they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. The easiest way to continue growing involves extracting money and data from users and complements. The most famous historical examples of this are Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga, and Twitter vs. its 3rd-party clients, but it happens at a smaller scale everyday, with almost every company that operates a network. (I wrote <a href="https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters">an essay</a> a few years ago that goes into more detail on the&nbsp;topic).</blockquote><blockquote>A company can try to resist this logic but it’s extremely difficult. The reality is that if your goal is to optimize revenue to the company, shutting down APIs, algorithmically manipulating users, harvesting personal information for better ad targeting, reducing revenue shares, and all the things people don’t like about internet companies is the optimal strategy. If you don’t behave this way, your competitors will, and they’ll make more money, the stock market will reward them with a higher market cap, they’ll attract the best talent, will reinvest more money back into the product and datacenters and marketing and so forth, and they’ll&nbsp;win.</blockquote><p>Which leads us to&nbsp;DAOs:</p><blockquote>The word DAO is probably overloaded at this point, but in short refers to a new kind of organization that uses blockchains in the way I alluded to above. In some loose sense open source software projects ranging from Linux to Ethereum are DAOs. They make decisions about software and network upgrades via roaming groups of users and developers on various websites discussing and arguing over things. It’s chaotic but mostly works. These systems use “off-chain” governance in which network participants “vote” by deciding whether and how to upgrade the software they are&nbsp;running.</blockquote><p>DeFi is a hot topic here at GlobaliD and Hard Yaka. It also happens that many DeFi projects are already formed as DAOs. Here’s Dixon&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>A few years ago, people started asking whether these governance systems could be improved by using “on-chain” governance, which basically means giving network participants a more formal way to vote using tokens. Probably the first and most important on-chain DAO is called MakerDAO. MakerDAO is a complex system for generating what are known as stablecoins (it’s a fascinating system — here’s <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper">the whitepaper</a> that describes it). I won’t go into the details but the key idea is the system has a governance token which lets the holders propose and vote on decisions including system upgrades. Maker has weekly community calls and a rotating group of core members who do the heavy lifting. It has generally worked quite well both as a product and as a community. Maker’s model has become the standard in an area known as decentralized finance (DeFi). Uniswap, Compound, and Aave are other examples of popular protocols that employ that DAO model. In my view this experiment has been a success so far, although it’s still very&nbsp;early.</blockquote><p>Dixon also discusses the domain name system (DNS) — an inspiration for the GlobaliD namespace — as another DAO opportunity. (Apparently, the company that manages dot org domains was almost bought out by a private equity&nbsp;firm.)</p><p>The central point here for Dixon is that DAOs address that central conflict between corporations and networks:</p><blockquote>The other appealing thing about DAOs — and what makes them superior to the web2 model I discussed above — is they remove the misalignment between the company and the network by eliminating the company altogether and shifting the economic and governance rights to the network. (For tax purposes there will likely need to be legal entities, at least in the US, but these will have a limited, administrative role). A properly constructed DAO does this by memorializing the rules around economics and governance from the very start, using smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum. As the networks grow, and move up the adoption S-curve, they might be drawn toward consolidating power but they’ll be prevented from doing so by the blockchain-enforced rules. We like to say instead of “don’t be evil” it’s “can’t be evil.” Instead of relying on human nature improving, we are baking the rules into the&nbsp;code.</blockquote><p>For Chris, “web3 generally and DAOs more specifically can help course correct the internet back to its original, idealistic vision: power and money pushed to the edges, networks growing and flourishing together, a level playing field for talent anywhere in the world, a thriving creative middle class, and a generally diverse and interesting place.”</p><p>That’s the next chapter and we’re right at the&nbsp;start.</p>  Check out <a href="https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/lets-run-the-experiment-a-conversation">the full conversation</a>.

Anyone who has ever <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">read anything about Tether</a> and how it operates probably understands why that might be necessary.</p><p>But again, crafting smart regulations is&nbsp;hard.</p><p>Matt Levine has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-15/moviepass-is-back-will-it-be-the-next-gamestop">a good overview of the current situation</a>:</p><blockquote>But here is <a href="https://www.davispolk.com/insights/client-update/us-regulators-speak-stablecoin-and-crypto-regulation">a memo from Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP</a> that points out something even stranger: Under the proposed rules, it would be impossible to do stablecoins the good simple way. If you wanted to set up a stablecoin under these proposed rules, you’d need to do it in a bank. So you set up Stablecoin Bank Corp. You issue $1 billion of stablecoins and invest the money in $1 billion of extremely safe stuff, Treasury bills expiring tomorrow or whatever. And then the banking regulators would come to you and say: No, this doesn’t work, if you have $1 billion of Treasuries <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/3.10">you need $40 million of equity</a>; that is a central rule of bank capital regulation, that you need equity alongside your deposits. And then as you issue more stablecoins you have to raise more equity, and it is hard to get a decent return on equity if you’re investing in only the very safest things. 7 So you are forced to reach for yield, to buy riskier things with higher yields in order to make a return on equity — you know, like banks&nbsp;do.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.davispolk.com/insights/client-update/us-regulators-speak-stablecoin-and-crypto-regulation">U.S. regulators speak on stablecoin and crypto regulation</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/let-crypto-regulate-itself">Let Crypto Regulate&nbsp;Itself</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/15/president-biden-signs-infrastructure-bill-containing-crypto-broker-reporting-requirement-into-law/">President Biden Signs Infrastructure Bill Containing Crypto Broker Reporting Requirement Into&nbsp;Law</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/17/india-to-ban-crypto-as-payment-method-but-regulate-as-asset-report/">India to Ban Crypto as Payment Method but Regulate as Asset:&nbsp;Report</a>  <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/the-sec-crackdown-on-defi-is-imminent">The SEC Crackdown on DeFi is&nbsp;Imminent</a>  <a href="https://future.a16z.com/stablecoins-stability-and-financial-inclusion/">Stablecoins, Stability, and Financial Inclusion — Future</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/currency-comptroller-nominee-omarova-hearing-d8679447-4c6d-4b9f-b2e0-9ee5bec162fd.html">Biden’s top bank regulator nomination at risk after tense&nbsp;hearing</a>  <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/china-catches-fraudsters-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc-for-money-laundering/">China catches fraudsters using central bank digital currency for money laundering — Ledger Insights — enterprise blockchain</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-khan-us-chamber-11637288699">WSJ News Exclusive | Business Group Challenges Lina Khan’s Agenda at Federal Trade Commission</a>   4.

 Ontology Partners with Decentralized Mobility Platform bloXmove To Bring Interoperable Decentralized Identity To Urban Transport Apps <p>bloXmove will integrate Ontology’s decentralized identity protocol to help make the urban transport app industry easier to use, more private, and more&nbsp;secure</p><p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the project bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions, has announced a partnership with <a href="https://bloxmove.com/">bloXmove</a>, a business-to-business mobility blockchain platform designed to simplify travel across multiple forms of transportation by connecting mobility apps and reducing the need for users to switch between&nbsp;them.</p><p>The rapid increase in the digitization of transport and emergence of digital mobility apps enabling individuals to avail of cars, scooters, bikes, flight and train tickets, and more has resulted in a fragmented infrastructure that requires users to sign-up to various applications over and over again. This has led to a proliferation of data exchange, as users are increasingly required to hand over sensitive data.</p><p>Addressing these problems, this partnership will see bloXmove integrate Ontology’s decentralized digital identity protocol (DID) into its platform, providing users with a decentralized identifier that will allow them to share their verifiable credentials, such as driving licenses, in a way that is totally private, secure and encrypted. It will also allow them to store a host of identifiers securely in one place, enabling reuse of the same identifier for multiple modes of transport, whilst remaining assured that their private information is&nbsp;safe.</p><p>Li Jun, Founder of Ontology said: “The fragmentation of the urban transport industry means there is a great need to fortify user security and data through decentralized technologies. bloXmove is doing amazing work to streamline the user journey and now, by integrating Ontology’s DID and data solutions, the whole ecosystem will be made easier to navigate, more private, and more secure. Following on from our previous partnership with bloXmove incubator and Mercedes parent Daimler Mobility to develop <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/welcome-home-is-now-approved-f8aada08a1bc">Welcome Home</a>, we are proud to be continuing to bring tangible use cases for blockchain and decentralized identity to the transport industry. We look forward to supporting bloXmove in creating the biggest global mobility alliance connecting bikes, scooters, car-sharing, trains and&nbsp;more.”</p><p>With bloXmove, settlements can be automated and secured via BLXM, the bloXmove token. Ontology will support token generation for bloXmove, whose access token smart contracts will be deployed on the Ontology chain. In addition, by leveraging Ontology’s blockchain technology, bloXmove will also achieve interoperability with other public blockchains while improving efficiency and lowering&nbsp;costs.</p><p>Dr. Harry Behrens, CTO and Co-Founder of bloXmove, said, “We are honored to partner with Ontology to combine bloXmove Mobility Blockchain Platform with their state-of-the-art DID Technology. Decentralized Identifiers (DID) are the crucial addition to Blockchain to create real-world business applications. This collaboration will bring us to the next level of mobility service roaming and decentralization. Easy access to mobility should not mean a compromise on privacy and data security for our users, which is why we have partnered with Ontology to strengthen our offering and provide our users with new, even more secure ways to share their information when using mobility&nbsp;apps.”</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 As Canadian and European governments prepare to issue digital identities to their citizens (e.g., passports, driver’s licences, health cards), ensuring ownership, control and interoperability of data is paramount. 
<p>Gatineau, Québec and Toronto, Ontario</p>
<p>In February 2021, Northern Block released a <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/features/">suite of self-sovereign identity products</a> (branded as NB Orbit) to facilitate the adoption of digital trust ecosystems. Knowing that government digital identity initiatives require the use of open source code, specifications and standards, Northern Block ensured its products were architected around them. They also continued contributing in the open source at the Trust over IP Foundation, the DIACC and in Hyperledger Aries.</p>
<p>Hyperledger Aries is a toolkit aimed to provide a shared, reusable, interoperable tool kit designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital credentials. It includes a shared cryptographic storage for blockchain clients as well as a communications protocol for allowing off-ledger interactions between those clients. In order to kickstart their decentralized identity initiatives, Canadian and European governments (<a href="https://northernblock.io/idunion-germany-bold-ssi-strategy/">example</a>) have selected Hyperledger Aries as their technology stack of choice.</p>
<p><br>
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2jTA2XAI4pqF53OEQNxpgO?si=XVTCzI2nSP-0sn31-qVoNg&amp;dl_branch=1">Check out this podcast episode to learn about Open Data and Tech Standards, and to better understand Why Governments Are Choosing Aries and Indy.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“Northern Block has committed itself to compliance with open source projects which lead to the interoperability of verifiable credentials. We are part of a vibrant digital identity ecosystem that knows that digital sovereignty can only be achieved through open sourced auditable systems. We’re proud to support and contribute to it,” says Mathieu Glaude, CEO of Northern Block.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://idlab.org/en/home/">Digital Identity Laboratory of Canada</a> (“IDLab”) evaluates conformance of wallet technology providers to the Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Profile. The IDLab is an independent Canadian non-profit entity dedicated to advancing digital trust by breaking down barriers to digital ID adoption. The IDLab team conducted the testing of the NB Orbit mobile wallet on both iOS and Android devices, running testing within the IDLab’s technology environment.</p>
<p>Pierre Roberge, general manager of the Digital Identity Laboratory of Canada:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The IDLab plays a critical role in scaling and facilitating interoperability of digital trust ecosystems. Acting as a neutral and trusted third party, the IDLab confirms conformity to technology and standards. Northern Block, an early user of the IDLab has successfully demonstrated the conformance of the NB Orbit mobile wallet with AiP v1, which many governments are asking for as a starting point.”</p></blockquote>
<p>With the mission to unlock digital trust for the public and private sector, Northern Block will continue to collaborate with industry partners such as the IDLab to further the maturity of critical frameworks.</p>

<p>Conversion rate is crucial for financial institutions. Having an onboarding process that maximizes this is increasingly important in a digitised world. Getting <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/customer-onboarding-banking-balance-security-ux/">the balance right between security and customer experience</a>, however, is essential.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">webinar</a> from IDnow looked at this concept. Having the right level of friction in your solutions is vital in achieving the best possible conversion rates while also keeping fraudsters at bay and avoiding fines from regulators.</p>



<p>IDnow’s products are designed with this in mind. The company offers a full set of solutions to efficiently onboard users and to combat fraud. These are delivered through a common platform, with a well-developed focus on the user experience.</p>



 The digital onboarding process in banking 



<p>Digital onboarding has become much more important in banking over the past years. The number of adults accessing finances online increased from 35% to 69% over the ten years to 2018. This has only increased further due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent study by consultancy McKinsey suggested that the pandemic has pushed us seven years ahead in digital transformation.</p>



<p>This increase brings challenges with it. Customers expect to be verified and accepted quickly, with a streamlined and bug-free onboarding process. At the same time, it is increasingly important to carry out security and identity checks to meet updated regulations and protect against rising levels of fraud and financial crime.</p>



<p>Many financial institutions in Europe and the UK are struggling with this. Onboarding and KYC processes are often old and inefficient, perhaps having evolved from previous manual processes. A refresh of these can offer better security as well as an improved customer experience.</p>



 IDnow’s identity verification solution is designed to prevent fraud 



<p>A well-designed and feature-rich solution is needed to meet this balance between security and user friction. IDnow’s AI-powered solution AutoIdent aims to offer just this.</p>



<p>AutoIdent developed from earlier methods of video-based identification (see IDnow VideoIdent) to offer an automated AI-based verification solution. This will carry out a series of automated checks on users’ identity documents and appearance via a biometric selfie. Differently from other vendors, our platform is a natively video-based solution and never relies on a static picture alone. We extract hundreds of frames on both document and biometric verification.</p>



<p>It also offers a hybrid approach with the backup of manual verification. If the AI is not confident on a particular case, or the user is waiting too long for results, it can fall back to a manual verification where an agent will decide if it`s a pass or fraud. The same checks can then be carried out this way, without further inconvenience to the user. These can be handled by IDnow specialists or routed to our clients` internal staff.</p>



<p>A combined approach like this ensures the highest security for identity verification and causes the least hassle for the user.</p>



<p>Identity verification is not enough on its own in many cases – including areas of financial services. IDnow’s single platform also has other anti-fraud solutions built in. This includes document hologram checking capabilities, NFC verification and video liveness detection.</p>



 Solutions comply with the latest regulations 



<p>KYC and AML are highly regulated areas. Such regulation has increased over the past decades to keep pace with the changes in financial crime and terrorism.</p>



<p>IDnow’s solutions are fully compliant with European and UK regulations. One single platform that complies with regulations in the UK and across Europe is increasingly valuable since Brexit. Solutions meet the latest 6AMLD regulations and fully conform with European eIDAS standards for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/qualified-electronic-signature-the-eidas-eu-regulation/">Qualified Electronic Signatures</a>. IDnow offers full <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML screening</a> (PEPs, Sanctions, Adverse Media checking, Watch-list, etc.) together with on-going monitoring for a compliant KYC process in multiple jurisdictions.</p>



 Verification with the most advanced technologies – and this continues to develop 



<p>AI-based verification makes the process straightforward and seamless for the user but with plenty of advanced methods in use.</p>



<p>IDnow’s AI and machine learning-based system runs various text and visual checks on documents. This includes automated hologram protection by checking reflections at different angles of the identity document. Video and biometric check ownership of identities. These are well-developed solutions able to combat known fraud techniques, such as lookalike images or the use of silicone masks.</p>



<p>NFC functionality has been added recently. This is currently used to read German identity cards, but the solution can be easily expanded as it fully meets the global ICAO 9303 standard.</p>



<p>These technologies meet top security regulations. Image and video likeness technologies, for example, meet the highest NIST standards for anti-spoofing.</p>



 Ensuring the best user experience 



<p>Security is vital, but to get top conversion rates, you need to focus as well on the customer experience. If onboarding takes too long or the experience is not a good one, you risk losing customers.</p>



<p>Reducing friction points and understanding exactly what users are prepared to deal with is a key part of this. Onboarding is possibly the users’ first experience of your brand, and it should feel seamless and straightforward.</p>



<p>There is more to the user experience than just speed and branding, though. Customers want to feel safe and have a verification process that completes accurately and automatically. IDnow’s products have been developed with extensive feedback collected from end-users incorporated into the processes to make them as intuitive as possible.</p>



<p>AutoIdent provides users with real-time feedback during the verification process. Users are guided through overcoming issues that are impacting verification. This could be things such as document position or lighting conditions.</p>



<p>Fallback methods also help the user experience and conversion rate. If the AI does not succeed, users can be verified via an agent. Companies that only offer an AI-based solution will struggle to retain customers when verification fails, or users need more support. Bear in mind that not all users are fully tech-savvy!</p>



 In Conclusion – get the balance between security and user experience right 



<p>Advanced security features and methods, regulation compliance, and a seamless customer experience come together in creating a great onboarding and identity verification solution. Getting the balance right is essential in achieving the best possible customer conversion rate.</p>



<p>I believe that IDnow has developed a solution that gets this balance between security and user friction right. In doing so, it helps businesses boost their conversion rate while also meeting regulations and protecting them from financial crime</p>



<p>You can find out more by viewing our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">full webinar</a>. This looks in more detail at the journey of identity verification to today’s solutions and the important balance achieved. It also shows the AutoIdent platform in action and discusses some examples of its implementation.</p>

				   The Perfect Signature Style is the Enemy of the One that Works Today 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Senior Architect Sam Curren talks about how BBS+ signature styles are not going to be ready for deployment anytime soon, but that shouldn’t stop you from building today in a way that allows you to add them later. He also touches on the pros and cons of waiting when it comes to the newest technologies, and why its usually better not to wait.</p>

				  BBS+ signature styles are not going to be ready for deployment anytime soon. This is precisely why you should build today and in a way that allows you to add them later.<br>
  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Sam Curren, Senior Architect<br><br>New technology is inevitable: some of it will be evolutionary, some of it will be revolutionary; some of it will eat your business, and some of it might change the world and make life better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you know when to wait and when to jump?</p>
<p>This is the dilemma for many people looking at decentralized identity right now. Is it ready to be implemented, are there “off-the-shelf” products I can use—or will it all be so much better next week or in a month or in a year?</p>
<p>The dilemma seems to divide the decentralized identity community. Standards groups and initiatives advocate for the best possible solution, in the hope that it will eventually exist, while companies building solutions—like Indicio—say “build now because what we have works and works well and can be added to later. The ‘better’ may never come but the good—especially if open source—will continually get better and be relatively easy to upgrade.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we believe our position is not just a matter of business logic: There’s a massive downside to letting failing technology—our current centralized and federated ways of managing identity—continue to fail businesses and consumers, citizens and governments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This downside is vastly greater than any of the differences between decentralized identity technologies that can be used today, those in development, and those hypothesized as being available sometime in the future.</p>
<p>Don’t turn BBS+ into a minus<br>This issue is not abstract. Right now, there is much discussion around JSON-LD <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+</a>&nbsp;being “the” standard for managing verifiable credential key signatures in decentralized identity systems. The Good Health Pass, for example, recommends BBS+ for Covid digital credentials.</p>
<p>BBS+ is good and Indicio is excited about adding it to its options for customers building decentralized solutions. But we can’t do so because BBS+&nbsp; is still under development and it’s unclear when the final version will be available. Meanwhile, we have JSON-ZKP-CL Signatures that provide the ingredient BBS+ is working to add: privacy preserving predicate (zero-knowledge)&nbsp; proofs and blinded identity binding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Predicate proofs mean that you are able to generate a proof of something—such as age—without having to disclose the actual information, and they are a boon to preserving privacy.</p>
<p>When thinking about BBS+, it is important to remember that credential format is just one part of a larger system that must be developed. Governance, Issuance and Verification agents, Holder apps, and more all need to be implemented; user experience must be developed; business relationships created: Decentralized identity is an ecosystem of infrastructure, software and governance working together as a product. All of these things can be deployed using existing production-ready credential formats. And the gains made now will translate into the future adoption of BBS+.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bigger point is this: Decentralized identity is at a breakthrough point. Governments in Canada and Germany have decided that verifiable credentials are the way forward; pilots and consumer products are being unveiled on a weekly basis. This is not the moment to say, “let’s wait;”&nbsp; this is the moment to say “let’s scale.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we’ve shown how to make decentralized ecosystems work to solve real problems for lots of customers. In building, we’ve advanced the tech. In advancing the tech, we’ve built more solutions. This is the virtuous cycle of innovation and scale that we’re creating. We will add BBS+ into our products when it is available. But until then, we’re going to build solutions that BBS+ can be added to—and we think you should too.</p>

             November 2021   
	 
		 
			 Are you ready to digitize yourself in the metaverse? 
<p>The metaverse has been a hot topic of late. As Facebook rebranded to Meta, a lot of attention has turned towards projects focused on this alternate reality. Decentraland’s MANA token reached a new all-time high, and companies such as Roblox saw big increases in share prices.</p>
<p>As is always the case with nascent technologies, the rise of metaverse platforms has brought some issues. Here are a few:</p>
 
 Unfiltered content&nbsp;– anyone can access any type of content, and considering a large amount of the user base are teenagers, this is concerning. 
 Accessibility problems&nbsp;– gaining access to metaverse platforms is a pain when you consider how many accounts you need for various web services. 
 Loss of virtual assets&nbsp;– anything purchased in the metaverse can simply be lost, and the tokens representing these assets can never be recovered. 
 Privacy concerns&nbsp;– users are increasingly concerned about privacy issues and protecting their data, with this not being helped by Facebook throwing their hat in the virtual ring. 
 
<p>The key to solving these issues is abundantly clear:&nbsp;<a href="https://onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xgmW5PSKnMPgtCeY35vwyzbuRJvRQSGOEv50dRNMZ0tCqXVh5v8F9kSg1LXQXUfQA0_2R">digital identities</a>. Here’s how:</p>
 
 Age restricted content&nbsp;– users log into the metaverse with identities, allowing platforms to appropriately filter certain content and environments. 
 Universal login&nbsp;– like Google authentication, onchain digital identities enable users to log in to different virtual venues in the metaverse via one click. 
 Asset recovery&nbsp;– onchain identities guarantees ownership of virtual assets because tokens can be linked to the identity and not to the wallet. 
 Privacy protected&nbsp;– service providers only need to see the proof of verified information, instead of the actual data, thus alleviating privacy concerns. 
 
<p>As the metaverse gets more and more popular, and with more virtual assets being viewed, bought and sold in this environment, identity will become a core component of this world. Users will need to know who they are dealing with, they will need easy recovery processes in the case of lost wallets. This will be key as the metaverse matures and its ties with digital assets continue to strengthen.</p>

<p>We are delighted to introduce two new additions to the KILT ecosystem: the Sporran browser extension — the wallet for KILT Coins and credentials — and Stakeboard, the staking platform for&nbsp;KILT.</p> Sporran <p>The <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a> wallet can be used to hold KILT Coins and provides a way for users to sign and submit KILT blockchain transactions. And in early December, users will also be able to use Sporran to store credentials and create a digital identity — similar to the real world when you add credentials like your driver’s license to your physical&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>You could also build several identities — for example, your work identity with all your qualifications, your gaming identity with your rankings, etc. Sporran provides a way to manage and sign transactions with these digital identities on the KILT blockchain. This is designed to restore your control over your own data when you are providing your information to online services.</p><p>Currently, Sporran is available for use as a browser extension on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sporran/djdnajgjcbjhhbdblkegbcgodlkkfhcl">Google Chrome</a> and<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sporran/"> Firefox</a>. See our guide to creating a Sporran identity&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/How-to-Set-Up-Sporran_22-Nov.pdf">here</a>.</p> Stakeboard <p><a href="https://stakeboard.kilt.io/">Stakeboard</a> is a web application that allows you to interact directly with the KILT blockchain to stake your KILT&nbsp;Coins.</p><p>To participate in staking on Stakeboard you need a KILT Identity (wallet address) with at least 1,001 KILT Coins (1,000 for staking; 1 to cover any transaction costs). Each Identity with this minimum can choose one collator to delegate their coins to. Collators hold the data of the KILT blockchain, collect transactions and build blocks. You can find the list of collators <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KILT_Initial-16-Collators_4-Oct.pdf">here</a> and on community sites like <a href="https://stakekilt.com/">StakeKILT.com</a>.</p><p>When the chosen collator successfully produces blocks, their delegator can receive a reward of up to 8% per annum in the first year after launch; 6% in the second year. See our “<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-7-key-things-you-need-to-know-to-use-Stakeboard_22-Nov.pdf">How to stake on KILT</a>” guide for more details on navigating Stakeboard.</p><p>Sporran and Stakeboard were developed by B.T.E.

<p>Bisherige Lösungen für das Managen von Identitäten sind gekennzeichnet von Datensilos, die einerseits jeder Diensteanbieter mit hohem Aufwand selbst betreibt — oder andererseits von globalen Identitätsanbietern, die den Diensteanbietern diesen Aufwand abnehmen können. Das Problem des isolierten Identitätsmanagements ist, dass der durchschnittliche Internetnutzer über 20 verschiedene Identitäten hat, die separat angelegt und gewartet werden müssen — mit entsprechendem Aufwand und daraus resultierend Inkonsistenzen zwischen den Datensilos. Globale Identitätsmanager wie Google helfen, diese Probleme mit Hilfe des Single-Sign-On unter Nutzung einer Google-ID zu überwinden. Für den Nutzer ist dies bequem und einfach. Jedoch wird die Hoheit über persönliche Daten und deren kommerzielle Verwertung aus der Hand&nbsp;gegeben.</p><p>Vor diesem Hintergrund streben Selbstsouveräne Identitäten (SSI) die Verknüpfung der Nutzerfreundlichkeit einer Google-ID mit einem hohen Grad an Nutzerkontrolle und Privatsphäre an.</p> Was genau ist&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI bilden die neueste Entwicklungsstufe digitaler Identitäten. Eine Identität meint alle Attribute einer Person, Organisation, oder Gegenstands, die dieses Subjekt definieren. Attribute beschreiben die Charakteristika eines Subjekts. Eine digitale Identität meint hier die digitale Repräsentation dieser Attribute. Je nach Verwendungskontext können verschiedene Teilidentitäten benötigt werden, die nur einen Teil der Attribute umfassen.</p><p>Ein Credential ist ein fälschungssicherer und überprüfbarer Nachweis von Attributen eines Subjekts. Credentials werden in einem persönlichen digitalen Wallet gehalten. Das Subjekt ist der Holder der Nachweise, nachdem es diese von einem Issuer beschafft hat. Ein Issuer stellt Credentials nach einem Schema aus, das eine übergreifende Verwendung und allgemeingültige Interpretation erlaubt. Ein Verifier fordert, z.B. für den Zugriff auf einen Dienst, einen Nachweis einer Berechtigung (ein Credential) von dem zugreifenden Subjekt. Über ein Verifiable Data Registry werden dazu Identifikatoren ausgetauscht, die auf Subjekte, deren Credentials und deren Issuer verweisen können. Das Verifiable Data Registry enthält keine subjektbezogenen Daten.</p>Rollen und Informationsflüsse beim Identitätsmanagement mit SSI (Quelle: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#roles)">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#roles)</a> Welchen Mehrwert bringt&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI überwindet das inkonsistente und — für Nutzer als auch Diensteanbieter — aufwändige Identitätsmanagement in isolierten Datensilos und gleichzeitig die Abhängigkeit von bisherigen Single-Sign-On-Identitätsmanagern wie Google und Twitter, die die Anmeldevorgänge der Nutzer kontrollieren, auswerten und verwerten. Mit SSI haben Subjekte wie Personen oder Maschinen eine einzige Identitätsverwaltung (zumindest für einen gewissen Namensraum). Die einer Identität zugeordneten Berechtigungsnachweise müssen nur einmal eingeholt werden und können dann nach Bedarf passgenau für beliebig viele Anmelde- und Nachweisprozesse eingesetzt werden. Analog zur Plastikkärtchen-Identität können die Nachweise geprüft werden, ohne den Herausgeber zu involvieren.</p>Heutiges Identitätsmanagement in Silos vs. Selbstsouveränes Identitätsmanagement (Adaptiert von: <a href="https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/2019/08/12/chancen-der-self-sovereign-identities-ssi-aus-sicht-von-unternehmen-fuer-das-identity-access-management-iam/">https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/2019/08/12/chancen-der-self-sovereign-identities-ssi-aus-sicht-von-unternehmen-fuer-das-identity-access-management-iam/</a>)<p>Für Diensteanbieter vereinfachen sich Onboardingprozesse, das sogenannte Know-your-Customer und die Compliance zu den damit verbundenen Regularien. Zudem sind die bereitgestellten Identitätsinformationen aktuell. Durch die Vereinfachung der Onboardingprozesse werden diese auch mit einer höheren Wahrscheinlichkeit als bislang von den Nutzern abgeschlossen.</p><p>Nutzer von Diensten (beliebige Subjekte, auch Maschinen) können ihre Identität in Plug-and-Play-Manier einsetzen und ihre Identität einfach zwischen verschiedenen Diensten portieren. Das Verwalten und Aktuellhalten von dutzenden Nutzerkonten und das Merken der zugehörigen Passwörter entfällt, da nur noch ein Zugang zum persönlichen Wallet erforderlich ist. Konsequenterweise reduzieren sich auch IT-Sicherheitsprobleme, die durch die Verwendung des gleichen Passworts für verschiedene Nutzerkonten entstehen.</p> Welche Herausforderungen gibt&nbsp;es? <p>Einschränkend kann vermerkt werden, dass die Vorzüge und Nutzbarkeit einer selbstsouveränen Identität sich zunächst auf diejenigen Dienstanbieter beziehen, die auf einer Verifiable Data Registry präsent sind — ähnlich den mobilen Anwendungen auf den App Stores. In Analogie dazu ist ein SSI-Netzwerk umso wertvoller für seine Nutzer, je mehr Dienste darüber nutzbar sind. Schließlich ist hier ein Wachstums- und Konsolidierungsprozess zu erwarten, der über die Durchsetzung von bestimmten Angeboten entscheidet.</p><p>Ein kritischer Gedanke ist, dass mit dem Verifiable Data Registry eine ähnliche Abhängigkeit der Identitäts-Subjekte wie bislang zu den Single-Sign-On-Anbietern aus den Sozialen Medien entstünde. Dieser Gedanke führt jedoch in die Irre, denn das Verifiable Data Registry kann mit Hilfe von Distributed Ledger-Technologie in einem Blockchain-basierten Netzwerk betrieben werden. Mehrere dezentrale Rechenknoten, die von unterschiedlichen Akteuren betrieben werden können, würden das Netzwerk bilden. Oftmals sind hier auch Non-Profit-Organisationen wie <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin </a>oder die <a href="https://energyweb.org/reports/the-energy-web-chain/">Energy Web Foundation</a> aktiv. Ein deutlicher Kontrast zu den bisherigen Single-Sign-On-Anbietern.</p><p>Ein ausschlaggebender Faktor für den Erfolg von SSI wird sein, dass die Issuer von Credentials das erforderliche Vertrauen herstellen können. Weiterhin wird, wie so oft, die Nutzererfahrung und die daraus resultierende Akzeptanz entscheidend sein. Lösungsanbieter wie Spherity nutzen eine Cloud, um ein <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/multi-party-computation-b4d2a7c3042">nutzerfreundliches Identitätswallet</a> bieten zu können, das auch Private Keys verwahrt und vor dem ungewollten Verlust der Identität schützt.</p> Wer treibt SSI&nbsp;voran? <p>Die Bundesregierung und die Europäische Union sind unter anderem Treiber von SSI. Sie fördern das Entwickeln der Konzepte, Technologie, Standards und Regulierungen bis hin zu Pilotierungen in verschiedensten Branchen und Bereichen.</p><p>Das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie fördert z.B. das <a href="https://digitale-identitaeten.de/">„Schaufenster sichere digitale Identitäten“</a>. Eines der Schaufensterprojekte ist IDunion. <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion </a>arbeitet an der Schaffung eines offenen Ökosystems für dezentrale, selbstsouveräne Identitäten. Dazu wird mit Blockchain-Technologie ein verteiltes Identitätsnetzwerk aufgebaut. Das Projekt wird von 47 namhaften Forschungs- und Industriepartnern vorangetrieben. 51nodes ist Partner von&nbsp;IDunion.</p>Schaufensterprojekte Digitale Identitäten (Quelle: <a href="https://digitale-identitaeten.de/schaufensterprojekte/">https://digitale-identitaeten.de/schaufensterprojekte/</a>)<p>Die Europäische Union finanziert z.B. das <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/">„European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework Lab“</a>. 20 Teilprojekte kümmern sich um die Schaffung und Erweiterung eines Open Source-Softwareframeworks für SSI. Weitere 42 Teilprojekte entwickeln kommerzielle Komponenten and Dienste unter Nutzung des SSI-Frameworks.</p> Anwendungsbeispiel: Wie kann SSI der Energiewirtschaft helfen? <p>Vor dem Hintergrund der Energiewende stehen die Betreiber von Übertragungs- und Verteilnetzen für elektrischen Strom vor großen Herausforderungen und neuen gesetzlichen Pflichten. Über eine Million (privater) dezentraler Stromerzeuger müssen effizient und effektiv in bestehende energiewirtschaftliche Prozesse (z.B. der <a href="https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/wissen/regelenergie">Regelleistung</a> und des <a href="https://www.transnetbw.de/de/strommarkt/systemdienstleistungen/redispatch-2-0">Engpassmanagements im Redispatch 2.0</a>) integriert werden.</p>Leistungen und Prozesse der Energiewirtschaft (Quelle: <a href="https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/wissen/systemdienstleistungen">https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/wissen/systemdienstleistungen</a>)<p>Aktuell sind energiewirtschaftliche Prozesse gekennzeichnet durch produktspezifische und teilweise aufwendige Registrierungsprozesse an verschiedenen Stellen. Beispielsweise kann man hier das <a href="https://www.marktstammdatenregister.de/MaStR">Marktstammdatenregister </a>der Bundesnetzagentur, die <a href="https://www.regelleistung.net/">Regelleistungsplattform</a> der Übertragungsnetzbetreiber und die Plattform <a href="https://netz-connectplus.de/home/projekt/">connect+</a> zur Kooperation und zum Datenaustausch der Netzbetreiber nennen. Hinzu kommt eine geringe Motivation der Betreiber von kleinen Energieerzeugungsanlagen und der Sicherung der Aktualität der Daten an den unterschiedlichen Registrierungsorten.</p><p>Die Frage von erforderlichen Nachweisen betrifft z.B. die Art der Stromerzeugung (z.B. EEG-Anlage) bzw. für welches energiewirtschaftliche Produkt die Anlage eingesetzt werden darf und kann. Die Identifikatoren (Energy Identification Code) für Anlagen werden zentral durch den <a href="https://www.energiecodes-services.de/bdew-codes.html">BDEW </a>vergeben. Weiterhin gibt es Vorgaben zur Marktkommunikation durch den Regulator, die mit Hilfe einer Zertifikatinfrastruktur für Signierung und Verschlüsselung erfolgt. D.h. die Zertifikate müssen bei allen genannten Stellen eingepflegt und aktuell gehalten werden. In einem “Internet of Energy”, wenn Millionen von Endkunden mit ihren dezentralen Flexibilitätsanlagen (z.B. Elektromobilität, Heimspeicher, Wärmepumpen, etc.) auf den Energiemarkt drängen, kommen diese Systeme zur Abwicklung der Massenprozesse für Registrierungs- und Veränderungsanforderungen in der notwendigen Geschwindigkeit an ihre&nbsp;Grenzen.</p><p>Der Ansatz von SSI verspricht demgegenüber die Vision der Integration von Millionen von dezentralen Anlagen in die Prozesse und IT-Systeme der Netzwirtschaft in unaufwändiger Plug-and-Play-Manier, ohne dass Mehrfachanmeldungen und parallele Konsistenzhaltung in redundanten isolierten Identitätsmanagementsystemen weiter erforderlich wären. Damit sollten Hürden für Anlagenbetreiber sinken und die Prozesse der Netzwirtschaft können schlanker und reibungsärmer aufgestellt werden. Schließlich würde ein wichtiger Beitrag für das Gelingen der Energiewende geleistet.</p><p>Aktuell arbeitet 51nodes gemeinsam mit dem Übertragungsnetzbetreiber <a href="https://www.transnetbw.de/de">TransnetBW</a> an der Erörterung von SSI im Kontext der Energiewirtschaft.

<p>🇺🇸 US Infrastructure Bill’s Cryptoasset Reporting Requirements Seen as Overreach</p> 
<p>On November 15th 2021, President Joe Biden signed a<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684"> bipartisan infrastructure bill</a>. The bill includes new taxation reporting requirements for cryptoasset brokers.<a href="https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408199"> Observers are concerned</a> with the open-languaged “broker” definition used in the bill which could be interpreted as including any blockchain network participant. Indeed, the “broker” definition of the Internal Revenue Code is supplemented by: ‘‘any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.’’</p> 
<p>In the infrastructure bill, any person or entity which falls under the definition above will have to comply with the following reporting requirements: “[A]ny broker, with respect to any transfer (which is not part of a sale or exchange executed by such broker) during a calendar year of a covered security which is a digital asset from an account maintained by such broker to an account which is not maintained by, or an address not associated with, a person that such broker knows or has reason to know is also a broker, shall make a return for such calendar year, in such form as determined by the Secretary, showing the information otherwise required to be furnished with respect to transfers subject to subsection (a).’’&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Industry participants were<a href="https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408199"> quick to react</a> accusing the government of regulatory overreach. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano,<a href="https://cryptonews.net/en/2733539/"> reacted to the bill stating that</a>:&nbsp; “we are in a slightly bad position today, because the Infrastructure Bill was passed. If it's left to its own devices, by 2023 when these mandates come into place...depending on how they are interpreted and what the IRS does with it, it can cause catastrophic damage.”</p> 
<p>House Representatives, including Patrick McHenry from the House Financial Services Committee,<a href="https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/mhh_026_xml__signed.pdf"> introduced a bipartisan bill titled “Keep Innovation in America Act”</a> to clarify the reporting requirements of “brokers” following the changes made to the Internal Revenue Code. The proposed legislation would amend the supplement to the “broker” definition cited above to: ‘‘any person who (for consideration) stands ready in the ordinary course of a trade or business to effect sales of digital assets at the direction of their customers.’’&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The reporting requirements cited above are also amended to include the following sentence at the end of the paragraph: “Information reported by brokers under this section shall be limited to customer information that is voluntarily provided by the customer and held by the broker for a legitimate business purpose.”</p> 
<p>The changes in the “Keep Innovation in America Act” ensure that the reporting requirements are limited to cryptoasset businesses rather than individuals interacting with the blockchain to validate transactions. The bill proposes to push back the date some of these new requirements come into force to 2026.</p>

<p>🇮🇳 India Continues Exploring Cryptoasset regulation</p> 
<p>Details<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/17/india-to-ban-crypto-as-payment-method-but-regulate-as-asset-report/"> have emerged</a> regarding a cryptoasset regulation bill which is due to be presented to the Indian parliament this winter. The bill will reportedly ban payments using cryptoassets but allow users to trade their assets. Authorities are expected to ban active solicitation, such as advertisements, from cryptoasset business. These reports follow India’s Standing Committee on Finance<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-parliament-committee-discusses-crypto-regulation-industry-experts/"> inaugural hearing</a> with industry stakeholders on “CryptoFinance: Opportunities and Challenges”' on November 15th 2021. These developments illustrate the government's willingness to move rapidly on cryptoasset regulation as<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-president-working-group-releases-report-on-stablecoins"> Elliptic covered</a> announcements by the Ministry of Finance earlier this month.</p>

<p>🇮🇱 Israel is Adopting New AML Laws for Cryptoassets</p> 
<p>The Israeli’s government<a href="https://www.justice.gov.il/Units/HalbantHon/News/Pages/AML_MSB_order-14112021.aspx"> new anti-money laundering (AML) order</a> for cryptoasset businesses took effect on November 14th 2021. The updated regulation includes a licensing requirement for cryptoasset businesses. According to<a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/anti-terror-banking-rules-now-apply-to-cryptocurrency-684971"> The Jerusalem Post</a>, the director of the Authority for Combating Terror Financing and Money Laundering, Shlomit Wagman, said this new framework will reduce criminal activity in the cryptoasset ecosystem while increasing the legitimacy of the industry. Members of the industry<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/16/israels-new-aml-rules-may-help-banks-onboard-crypto-clients/"> hoped</a> that these new rules will facilitate their relationship with local banks. As Israel ramps up its efforts to regulate the cryptoasset industry, the US Department of the Treasury<a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USTREAS/bulletins/2fc3308?reqfrom"> issued a press release</a> detailing a partnership with the Israeli Minister of Finance to combat ransomware on November 15th 2021.</p>

<p>🇰🇷 South Korea is Looking to Tighten Cryptoasset Regulation</p> 
<p>South Korean regulators were criticised by cryptoasset businesses<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-lawmakers-push-back-against-controversial-know-the-sender-rule"> following a hearing on new bills set to regulate the industry</a>. One of the bills would introduce a "know-the-sender" rule. As such, cryptoasset businesses would be obliged to gather information on the identity of the issuer of each transaction they receive. Stakeholders remarked that this rule would be impractical and severely limit the transactions which take place locally. These requirements are akin to the<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf"> Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule”</a> (Recommendation 16).</p>

<p>🇺🇸 US Department of Justice to Sell Cryptoassets Linked to Fraud</p> 
<p>The US Department of Justice is<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/56-million-seized-cryptocurrency-being-sold-first-step-compensate-victims-bitconnect-fraud"> set to liquidate $56 million in fraud proceeds</a> of a cryptoasset project named BitConnect. This is the largest seizure of cryptoassets by US authorities. BitConnect’s main promoter, Glenn Arcaro, was charged with conspiracy to defraud investors using a Ponzi scheme which gathered more than $2 billion.&nbsp; When ordered by the court, the government will start selling the seized cryptoassets to restitute these funds to the victims. The Department of Justice encourages victims of the fraud to<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/us-v-glenn-arcaro-21cr02542-twr?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"> reach out</a>.</p>

  <p>If you search for “Full Stack Java” on the internet, you’ll likely find a lot of recruiting, courses, and jobs. Being a full stack developer can be exciting because you can create the backend and frontend of an app all by yourself. There is business logic and algorithms as well as styling, making things look good, and securing everything. It also pays pretty well. Today, I’m going to show you how you can be a full stack Java developer with Spring Boot, React, and JHipster.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js 14+</a> 
   <a href="https://sdkman.io">Java 11+</a> 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</a> 
 

<p>If you’re on Windows, you may need to install the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> for some commands to work.</p>

<p>I recommend using SDKMAN to manage your OpenJDK installations. Just run <code>sdk install java 11.0.2-open</code> to install Java 11 and <code>sdk install java 17-open</code> for Java 17.</p>

<p>This tutorial won’t provide the nitty-gritty details on how to write code in Java, React, or Spring Boot. That’s because JHipster will write most of the code for you! However, if you’re brand new to programming with these technologies, I recommend the following resources:</p>

 
   <a href="https://dev.java/learn/">Oracle’s Learn Java Tutorials</a> 
   <a href="https://spring.io/guides">Spring Guides</a> 
   <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">Tutorial: Intro to React</a> 
 

<p>You can skip around between sections of this tutorial using the table of contents below.</p>

<p>You can also clone <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example">the completed example</a> and following along that way.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example
</code>   

 Full Stack Development with React and Spring Boot 

<p>One of the easiest ways to get started with React is by using <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> (CRA). You install it locally, then run <code>create-react-app &lt;project&gt;</code> to generate a React application with minimal dependencies. It uses webpack under-the-covers to build the project, launch a web server, and run its tests.</p>

<p>Spring Boot has a similar tool called <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>. Spring Initializer is a bit different than CRA because it’s a website (and API) that you can create applications with.</p>

<p>Today, I’ll show you how to build a Flickr clone with React and Spring Boot. However, I’m going to cheat. Rather than building everything using the aforementioned tools, I’m going to use JHipster. JHipster is an application generator that initially only supported Angular and Spring Boot. Now it supports Angular, React, and Vue for the frontend. JHipster also has support for <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/modules/official-blueprints/">Kotlin, Micronaut, Quarkus, .NET, and Node.js</a> on the backend.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we’ll use React since it seems to be <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=angular,react,vuejs">the most popular</a> frontend framework nowadays.</p>

 Get Started with JHipster 7 

<p>If you haven’t heard of <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a>, boy do I have a treat for you! JHipster started as a Yeoman application generator back in 2013 and has grown to become a development platform. It allows you to quickly generate, develop, and deploy modern web apps and microservice architectures. Today, I’ll show you how to build a Flickr clone with JHipster and lock it down with OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC).</p>

<p>To get started with JHipster, you’ll need a fast internet connection and Node.js installed. The project recommends you use the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version, which is 14.7.6 at the time of this writing. To run the app, you’ll need to have Java 11 installed. If you have Git installed, JHipster will auto-commit your project after creating it. This will allow you to upgrade between versions.</p>

<p>Run the following command to install JHipster:</p>

   <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@7
</code>   

<p>To create a full-stack app with JHipster, create a directory, and run <code>jhipster</code> in it:</p>

   <code>mkdir full-stack-java
cd full-stack-java
jhipster
</code>   

<p>JHipster will prompt you for the type of application to create and what technologies you’d like to include. For this tutorial, make the following choices:</p>

 Verify Everything Works with Cypress and Keycloak 

<p>When you choose OAuth 2.0 and OIDC for authentication, the users are stored outside of the application rather than in it. You need to configure an identity provider (IdP) to store your users and allow your app to retrieve information about them. By default, JHipster ships with a Keycloak file for Docker Compose. A default set of users and groups is imported at startup, and it has a client registered for your JHipster app.</p>

<p>Here’s what the <code>keycloak.yml</code> looks like in your app’s <code>src/main/docker</code> directory:</p>

   <code># This configuration is intended for development purpose, it's **your** responsibility
# to harden it for production
version: '3.8'
services:
  keycloak:
    image: jboss/keycloak:15.0.2
    command:
      [
          '-b',
          '0.0.0.0',
          '-Dkeycloak.migration.action=import',
          '-Dkeycloak.migration.provider=dir',
          '-Dkeycloak.migration.dir=/opt/jboss/keycloak/realm-config',
          '-Dkeycloak.migration.strategy=OVERWRITE_EXISTING',
          '-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1000',
          '-Dkeycloak.profile.feature.upload_scripts=enabled',
      ]
    volumes:
      - ./realm-config:/opt/jboss/keycloak/realm-config
    environment:
      - KEYCLOAK_USER=admin
      - KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin
      - DB_VENDOR=h2
    # If you want to expose these ports outside your dev PC,
    # remove the "127.0.0.1:" prefix
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:9080:9080
      - 127.0.0.1:9443:9443
      - 127.0.0.1:10990:10990
</code>   

<p>Start Keycloak with the following command in your project’s root directory.</p>

   <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
</code>   

<p>You can verify everything works by starting your app with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw
</code>   

<p>Open another terminal to run your new app’s Cypress tests:</p>

   <code>npm run e2e
</code>   

<p>You should see output like the following:</p>

   <code>  (Run Finished)

 Change Your Identity Provider to Auth0 

<p>JHipster uses Spring Security’s OAuth 2.0 and OIDC support to configure which IdP it uses. When using Spring Security with Spring Boot, you can configure most settings in a properties file. You can even override properties with environment variables.</p>

<p>To switch from Keycloak to Auth0, you only need to override the default properties (for Spring Security OAuth). You don’t even need to write any code!</p>

<p>To see how it works, create a <code>.auth0.env</code> file in the root of your project, and fill it with the code below to override the default OIDC settings:</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=&lt;your-client-id&gt;
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;your-client-secret&gt;
export JHIPSTER_SECURITY_OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/
</code>   

<p>WARNING: Modify your existing <code>.gitignore</code> file to have <code>*.env</code> so you don’t accidentally check in your secrets!</p>

<p>You’ll need to create a new web application in Auth0 and fill in the <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> placeholders before this works.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect App on Auth0 

<p>Log in to your Auth0 account (or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">sign up</a> if you don’t have an account). You should have a unique domain like <code>dev-xxx.eu.auth0.com</code>.</p>

<p>Press the Create Application button in <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications">Applications section</a>. Use a name like <code>JHipster Baby!</code>, select <code>Regular Web Applications</code>, and click Create.</p>

<p>Switch to the Settings tab and configure your application settings:</p>

 
   Allowed Callback URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
   Allowed Logout URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> 
 

<p>Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles">roles</a> section, create new roles named <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code>.</p>

<p>Create a new user account in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/users">users</a> section. Click on the Role tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.</p>

<p>Make sure your new user’s email is verified before attempting to log in!</p>

<p>Next, head to Auth Pipeline &gt; Rules &gt; Create. Select the <code>Empty rule</code> template. Provide a meaningful name like <code>Group claims</code> and replace the Script content with the following.</p>

   <code>function(user, context, callback) {
  user.preferred_username = user.email;
  const roles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

  function prepareCustomClaimKey(claim) {
    return `https://www.jhipster.tech/${claim}`;
  }

  const rolesClaim = prepareCustomClaimKey('roles');

  if (context.idToken) {
    context.idToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  if (context.accessToken) {
    context.accessToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}
</code>   

<p>This code is adding the user’s roles to a custom claim (prefixed with <code>https://www.jhipster.tech/roles</code>). This claim is mapped to Spring Security authorities in <code>SecurityUtils.java</code>.</p>

   <code>public static List&lt;GrantedAuthority&gt; extractAuthorityFromClaims(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; claims) {
    return mapRolesToGrantedAuthorities(getRolesFromClaims(claims));
}

@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
private static Collection&lt;String&gt; getRolesFromClaims(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; claims) {
    return (Collection&lt;String&gt;) claims.getOrDefault(
        "groups",
        claims.getOrDefault("roles", claims.getOrDefault(CLAIMS_NAMESPACE + "roles", new ArrayList&lt;&gt;()))
    );
}

private static List&lt;GrantedAuthority&gt; mapRolesToGrantedAuthorities(Collection&lt;String&gt; roles) {
    return roles.stream().filter(role -&gt; role.startsWith("ROLE_")).map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new).collect(Collectors.toList());
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> class has a bean that calls this method to configure a user’s roles from their OIDC data.</p>

   <code>@Bean
public GrantedAuthoritiesMapper userAuthoritiesMapper() {
    return authorities -&gt; {
        Set&lt;GrantedAuthority&gt; mappedAuthorities = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();

        authorities.forEach(authority -&gt; {
            // Check for OidcUserAuthority because Spring Security 5.2 returns
            // each scope as a GrantedAuthority, which we don't care about.
            if (authority instanceof OidcUserAuthority) {
                OidcUserAuthority oidcUserAuthority = (OidcUserAuthority) authority;
                mappedAuthorities.addAll(SecurityUtils.extractAuthorityFromClaims(oidcUserAuthority.getUserInfo().getClaims()));
            }
        });
        return mappedAuthorities;
    };
}

 Run Your JHipster App with Auth0 

<p>Stop your JHipster app using Ctrl+C, set your Auth0 properties in <code>.auth0.env</code>, and start your app again.</p>

   <code>source .auth0.env
./mvnw
</code>   

<p>Voilà - your full stack app is now using Auth0! Open your favorite browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should see your app’s homepage with a link to sign in. Click sign in and you’ll be redirected to Auth0 to log in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After entering your credentials, you’ll be redirected back to your app.</p>

<p></p>

 Test Your Full Stack Java App with Cypress 

<p>JHipster has Auth0 support built-in, so you can specify your credentials for Cypress tests and automate your UI testing!</p>

<p>To do this, open a new terminal window, specify the credentials for the Auth0 user you just created and run <code>npm run e2e</code>.</p>

   <code>export CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME=&lt;new-username&gt;
export CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD=&lt;new-password&gt;
npm run e2e
</code>   

<p>TIP: If you want to use a <code>.env</code> file for your environment variables, you can use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-dotenv">cypress-dotenv</a>. You can also put these values in <code>cypress.json</code>, but since this file will be in source control, it’s a bad practice to put your secrets in it.</p>

<p>Everything should pass in around a minute.</p>

<p>Shut down the process running your JHipster app - it’s time to create some data handling for your Flickr clone!</p>

 Create Entities to allow CRUD on Photos 

<p>I’ve talked a lot about how to secure your application, but we haven’t done anything with photos! JHipster has a JDL (JHipster Domain Language) feature that allows you to model the data in your app, and generate entities from it. You can use the <a href="https://start.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/">JDL Studio</a> to do this online and save it locally once you’ve finished.</p>

<p>My data model for this app has <code>Album</code>, <code>Photo</code>, and <code>Tag</code> entities and sets up relationships between them. Below is a screenshot of what it looks like in JDL Studio.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the JDL below and save it in a <code>flickr2.jdl</code> file in the root directory of your project.</p>

   <code>entity Album {
  title String required
  description TextBlob
  created Instant
}

entity Photo {
  title String required
  description TextBlob
  image ImageBlob required
  height Integer
  width Integer
  taken Instant
  uploaded Instant
}

entity Tag {
  name String required minlength(2)
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  Album{user(login)} to User
  Photo{album(title)} to Album
}

relationship ManyToMany {
  Photo{tag(name)} to Tag{photo}
}

paginate Album with pagination
paginate Photo, Tag with infinite-scroll
</code>   

<p>You can generate entities and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> code (Java for Spring Boot; TypeScript and JSX for React) by using the following command:</p>

   <code>jhipster jdl flickr2.jdl
</code>   

<p>When prompted, type <code>a</code> to allow overwriting of existing files.</p>

<p>This process will create Liquibase changelog files (to create your database tables), entities, repositories, Spring MVC controllers, and all the React code necessary to create, read, update, and delete your entities. It’ll even generate JUnit unit tests, Jest unit tests, and Cypress end-to-end tests!</p>

<p>After the process completes, you can restart your app, log in, and browse through the Entities menu. Try adding some data to confirm everything works.</p>

<p>By now, you can see that JHipster is pretty powerful. It recognized that you had an image property of <code>ImageBlob</code> type and created the logic necessary to upload and store images in your database! Booyah!</p>

 Add Image EXIF Processing in Your Spring Boot API 

<p>The <code>Photo</code> entity has a few properties that can be calculated by reading the uploaded photo’s <a href="https://yourphotoadvisor.com/understanding-exif-data-what-it-is-and-what-to-do-with-it/">EXIF</a> (Exchangeable Image File Format) data. You might ask, how do you do that in Java?</p>

<p>Thankfully, Drew Noakes created a <a href="https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor">metadata-extractor</a> library to do just that. Add a dependency on Drew’s library to your <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.drewnoakes&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;metadata-extractor&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.16.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Then modify the <code>PhotoResource#createPhoto()</code> method to set the metadata when an image is uploaded.</p>

   <code>import com.drew.imaging.ImageMetadataReader;
import com.drew.imaging.ImageProcessingException;
import com.drew.metadata.Metadata;
import com.drew.metadata.MetadataException;

import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

import java.time.Instant;
import java.util.Date;

public class PhotoResource {
    ...

    public ResponseEntity&lt;Photo&gt; createPhoto(@Valid @RequestBody Photo photo) throws Exception {
        log.debug("REST request to save Photo : {}", photo);
        if (photo.getId() != null) {
            throw new BadRequestAlertException("A new photo cannot already have an ID", ENTITY_NAME, "idexists");
        }

        try {
            photo = setMetadata(photo);
        } catch (ImageProcessingException ipe) {
            log.error(ipe.getMessage());
        }

        Photo result = photoRepository.save(photo);
        return ResponseEntity
            .created(new URI("/api/photos/" + result.getId()))
            .headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityCreationAlert(applicationName, true, ENTITY_NAME, result.getId().toString()))
            .body(result);
    }

    private Photo setMetadata(Photo photo) throws ImageProcessingException, IOException, MetadataException {
        String str = DatatypeConverter.printBase64Binary(photo.getImage());
        byte[] data2 = DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(str);
        InputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(data2);
        BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);
        Metadata metadata = ImageMetadataReader.readMetadata(bis);
        ExifSubIFDDirectory directory = metadata.getFirstDirectoryOfType(ExifSubIFDDirectory.class);

        if (directory != null) {
            Date date = directory.getDateDigitized();
            if (date != null) {
                photo.setTaken(date.toInstant());
            }
        }

        if (photo.getTaken() == null) {
            log.debug("Photo EXIF date digitized not available, setting taken on date to now...");
            photo.setTaken(Instant.now());
        }

        photo.setUploaded(Instant.now());

        JpegDirectory jpgDirectory = metadata.getFirstDirectoryOfType(JpegDirectory.class);
        if (jpgDirectory != null) {
            photo.setHeight(jpgDirectory.getImageHeight());
            photo.setWidth(jpgDirectory.getImageWidth());
        }

        return photo;
    }
    ...
}
</code>   

<p>Since you’re extracting the information, you can remove the fields from the UI and tests so the user cannot set these values.</p>

<p>In <code>src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo-update.tsx</code>, hide the metadata so users can’t edit it. Rather than displaying the <code>height</code>, <code>width</code>, <code>taken</code>, and <code>uploaded</code> values, hide them. You can do this by searching for <code>photo-height</code>, grabbing the elements (and its following three elements) and adding them to a <code>metadata</code> constant just after <code>defaultValues()</code> lambda function.</p>

   <code>const defaultValues = () =&gt;
  ...

const metadata = (
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;ValidatedField label={translate('flickr2App.photo.height')} id="photo-height" name="height" data-cy="height" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;ValidatedField label={translate('flickr2App.photo.width')} id="photo-width" name="width" data-cy="width" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;ValidatedField
      label={translate('flickr2App.photo.taken')}
      id="photo-taken"
      name="taken"
      data-cy="taken"
      type="datetime-local"
      placeholder="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"
    /&gt;
    &lt;ValidatedField
      label={translate('flickr2App.photo.uploaded')}
      id="photo-uploaded"
      name="uploaded"
      data-cy="uploaded"
      type="datetime-local"
      placeholder="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"
    /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
);
const metadataRows = isNew ? '' : metadata;

return ( ... );
</code>   

<p>Then, in the <code>return</code> block, remove the JSX between the <code>image</code> property and <code>album</code> property and replace it with <code>{metadataRows}</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;ValidatedBlobField
  label={translate('flickr2App.photo.image')}
  id="photo-image"
  name="image"
  data-cy="image"
  isImage
  accept="image/*"
  validate={{
    required: { value: true, message: translate('entity.validation.required') },
  }}
/&gt;
{metadataRows}
&lt;ValidatedField id="photo-album" name="albumId" data-cy="album" label={translate('flickr2App.photo.album')} type="select"&gt;
  &lt;option value="" key="0" /&gt;
  {albums
    ? albums.map(otherEntity =&gt; (
      &lt;option value={otherEntity.id} key={otherEntity.id}&gt;
        {otherEntity.title}
      &lt;/option&gt;
    ))
    : null}
&lt;/ValidatedField&gt;
</code>   

<p>In <code>src/test/javascript/cypress/integration/entity/photo.spec.ts</code>, remove the code that sets the data in these fields:</p>

   <code>cy.get(`[data-cy="height"]`).type('99459').should('have.value', '99459');
cy.get(`[data-cy="width"]`).type('61514').should('have.value', '61514');
cy.get(`[data-cy="taken"]`).type('2021-10-11T16:46').should('have.value', '2021-10-11T16:46');
cy.get(`[data-cy="uploaded"]`).type('2021-10-11T15:23').should('have.value', '2021-10-11T15:23'););
</code>   

<p>Stop your Maven process, run <code>source .auth0.env</code>, then <code>./mvwn</code> again. Open a new terminal window, set your Auth0 credentials, and run <code>npm run e2e</code> to make sure everything still works.</p>

   <code>export CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME=&lt;auth0-username&gt;
export CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD=&lt;auth0-password&gt;
npm run e2e
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you experience authentication errors in your Cypress tests, it’s likely because you’ve violated Auth0’s <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/support/policies/rate-limit-policy">Rate Limit Policy</a>. As a workaround, I recommend you use Keycloak for Cypress tests. You can do this by opening a new terminal window and starting your app there using <code>./mvnw</code>. Then, open a second terminal window and run <code>npm run e2e</code>.</p>

<p>If you upload an image you took with your smartphone, the height, width, and taken values should all be populated. If they’re not, chances are your image doesn’t have the data in it.</p>

 Add a React Photo Gallery 

<p>You’ve added metadata extraction to your backend, but your photos still display in a list rather than in a grid (like Flickr). To fix that, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/neptunian/react-photo-gallery">React Photo Gallery</a> component. Install it using npm:</p>

   <code>npm i react-photo-gallery@8
</code>   

<p>In <code>src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo.tsx</code>, add an import for <code>Gallery</code>:</p>

   <code>import Gallery from 'react-photo-gallery';
</code>   

<p>Then add the following just after <code>const { match } = props;</code>. This adds the photos to a set with source, height, and width information.</p>

   <code>const photoSet = photoList.map(photo =&gt; ({
  src: `data:${photo.imageContentType};base64,${photo.image}`,
  width: photo.height &gt; photo.width ? 3 : photo.height === photo.width ? 1 : 4,
  height: photo.height &gt; photo.width ? 4 : photo.height === photo.width ? 1 : 3
}));
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>&lt;Gallery&gt;</code> component right after the closing <code>&lt;/h2&gt;</code>.</p>

   <code>return (
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="photo-heading" data-cy="PhotoHeading"&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;Gallery photos={photoSet} /&gt;
    ...
);
</code>   

<p>Save all your changes and restart your app.</p>

   <code>source .auth0.env
./mvnw
</code>   

<p>Log in and navigate to Entities &gt; Photo in the top nav bar. You will see a plethora of photos loaded by <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/">Liquibase</a> and <a href="https://marak.github.io/faker.js/">faker.js</a>. To make a clean screenshot without this data, I modified <code>src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml</code> to remove the “faker” context for Liquibase.</p>

   <code>liquibase:
  # Append ', faker' to the line below if you want sample data to be loaded automatically
  contexts: dev
</code>   

<p>Stop your Spring Boot backend and run <code>rm -r target/h2db</code> to clear out your database (or just delete the <code>target/h2db</code> directory). Restart your backend.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to upload photos and see the results in a nice grid at the top of the list.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can also add a “lightbox” feature to the grid so you can click on photos and zoom in. The <a href="https://neptunian.github.io/react-photo-gallery/">React Photo Gallery docs</a> shows how to do this. I’ve integrated it into the example for this post, but I won’t show the code here for the sake of brevity. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example/blob/main/src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo.tsx">final <code>photo.tsx</code> with Lightbox added on GitHub</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example/commit/76dcf711816cb2f3455ba4b46264bf48002487f7">diff of the necessary changes</a>.</p>

 Make Your Full Stack Java App Into a PWA 

<p>Progressive Web Apps, aka PWAs, are the best way for developers to make their webapps load faster and more performant. In a nutshell, PWAs are websites that use recent web standards to allow for installation on a user’s computer or device, and deliver an app-like experience to those users. To make a web app into a PWA:</p>

 
   Your app must be served over HTTPS 
   Your app must register a service worker so it can cache requests and work offline 
   Your app must have a webapp manifest with installation information and icons 
 

<p>For HTTPS, you can <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/">set up a certificate for localhost</a> or (even better), deploy it to production! Cloud providers like Heroku will provide you with HTTPS out-of-the-box, but they won’t force HTTPS. To force HTTPS, open <code>src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/config/SecurityConfiguration.java</code> and add a rule to force a secure channel when an <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> header is sent.</p>

   <code>@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        ...
    .and()
        .frameOptions()
        .deny()
    .and()
        .requiresChannel()
        .requestMatchers(r -&gt; r.getHeader("X-Forwarded-Proto") != null)
        .requiresSecure()
    .and()
        .authorizeRequests()
        ...
}
</code>   

<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin">workbox-webpack-plugin</a> is configured already for generating a service worker, but it only works when running your app with a production profile. This is nice because it means your data isn’t cached in the browser when you’re developing.</p>

<p>To register a service worker, open <code>src/main/webapp/index.html</code> and uncomment the following block of code.</p>

   <code>&lt;script&gt;
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    window.addEventListener('load', function () {
      navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js').then(function () {
        console.log('Service Worker Registered');
      });
    });
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>The final feature — a webapp manifest — is included at <code>src/main/webapp/manifest.webapp</code>. It defines an app name, colors, and icons. You might want to adjust these to fit your app.</p>

 Deploy Your React + Spring Boot App to Heroku 

<p>To deploy your app to Heroku, you’ll first need to install the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli">Heroku CLI</a>. You can confirm it’s installed by running <code>heroku --version</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t have a Heroku account, go to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">heroku.com</a> and sign up. Don’t worry, it’s free, and chances are you’ll love the experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Run <code>heroku login</code> to log in to your account, then start the deployment process with JHipster:</p>

   <code>jhipster heroku
</code>   

<p>This will start the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/heroku/">Heroku sub-generator</a> that asks you a couple of questions about your app: what you want to name it and whether you want to deploy it to a US region or EU. Then it’ll prompt you to choose between building locally or with Git on Heroku’s servers. Choose Git, so you don’t have to upload a fat JAR. When prompted to use Okta for OIDC, select <code>No</code>. Then, the deployment process will begin.</p>

<p>You’ll be prompted to overwrite <code>pom.xml</code>. Type <code>a</code> to allow overwriting all files.</p>

<p>If you have a stable and fast internet connection, your app should be live on the internet in around six minutes!</p>

   <code>remote: -----&gt; Compressing...
remote:        Done: 120.9M
remote: -----&gt; Launching...
remote:        Released v7
remote:        https://flickr-2.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
remote:
remote: Verifying deploy... done.

To https://git.heroku.com/flickr-2.git
 * [new branch]      HEAD -&gt; main

Your app should now be live. To view it run
	heroku open
And you can view the logs with this command
	heroku logs --tail
After application modification, redeploy it with
	jhipster heroku
Congratulations, JHipster execution is complete!

Execution time: 6 min. 19 s.

 Configure for Auth0 and Analyze Your PWA Score with Lighthouse 

<p>To configure your app to work with Auth0 on Heroku, run the following command to set your Auth0 variables on Heroku.</p>

   <code>heroku config:set \
  SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/" \
  SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="&lt;your-client-id&gt;" \
  SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="&lt;your-client-secret&gt;" \
  JHIPSTER_SECURITY_OAUTH2_AUDIENCE="https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/"
</code>   

<p>Then, log in to your Auth0 account, navigate to your app, and add your Heroku URLs as valid redirect URIs:</p>

 
   Allowed Callback URLs: <code>https://flickr-2.herokuapp.com/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
   Allowed Logout URLs: <code>https://flickr-2.herokuapp.com</code> 
 

<p>After Heroku restarts your app, open it with <code>heroku open</code>, and log in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, test it with <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a> (using the Lighthouse tab in Chrome developer tools). Looks pretty good, eh?! 💯</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s pretty darn secure too, at least according to <a href="https://securityheaders.com">securityheaders.com</a>.</p>

<p>Filling holes in the web3 stack</p>
<p>This was a very fun and interesting conversation with Lauren Feld, Head of Growth at <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/">3Box Labs</a>, a company building the <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic Network</a>.</p>
<p>The Ceramic Network in my opinion is one the most exciting projects in the web3 space. Ceramic is a decentralized, open source platform for creating, hosting, and sharing streams of data.</p>
<p>This is interesting to consider in a decentralized identity context. As we all know, we leave massive traces of ourselves in the digital world. The products that have enabled user generated content in the web2 world have dramatically increased the volume of data we leave behind. If this data is valuable, which social media companies can attest is true, then how could this data be returned to the rightful generator/owner of it. How can it also be made portable across different applications?</p>
<p>On this podcast we often talk about Verifiable Credentials and recently a bit more about government issued digital IDs. I hope this conversation gives listeners some excitement about what’s now being made possible with some exciting bottom-up approaches and how turning the data layer of applications into a public utility is the logical evolution of the web.</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 What excites Lauren about web3 applications? 
 What is the pulse on DAOs to incorporate Decentralized ID into them? 
 The importance of Mutability 
 An overview of Decentralized Data Storage Ecosystems, in particular IPFS, one of first protocols in the web3 space 
 What makes Data Composability important for open data layers? 
 How to go about building Distributed Data Models? 
 Key considerations when Selling to Developers rather than to enterprises 
 How to think about Verifiable Credentials in a context of your online data 
 Some Exciting Use Cases happening using Ceramic (you can find more use cases here: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">https://blog.ceramic.network/)</a> 
 Can older business models use Ceramic to decentralize their data layer?

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the 13th interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/SGnode_ONT">Geoff Richards</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English</a> and <a href="https://t.me/WingDAO">Wing DAO</a> communities.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I was initially drawn to the staking opportunities provided by Ontology. I was reading about staking and right in front of me was this established project, with a clear vision for the future, and excellent rewards for people backing the&nbsp;vision.</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I never needed to ask, ‘Why Ontology?’. The team has identified a clear need for solutions around data and identity. The current and future requirement for decentralized, trustless solutions to data and identity security is without question. As more projects launch in the Web3 space, this need only becomes greater. So, for me, Ontology is an enabler; a solution that will make other projects better. It’s not about competing in the Web3 space, it’s about making the experience better and more secure for everyone involved.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I’m a huge fan of the community around Ontology. If you look back at previous Harbinger interviews, all these people have answered my questions, solved my confusions, and generally made me feel welcome in the space. I hope I do the same for&nbsp;others.</p><p>I like to be the first to receive information. And the opportunity to do what I like, which is helping people! Although, I began doing this long before I became Harbinger.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>At times, the crypto space can feel a little like the Wild West. There are bad actors and people looking to take advantage of new users. A strong community is our best solution to this&nbsp;problem.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>If you hang around the Telegram channel for any amount of time, you’ll see people helping by sharing their own experiences. We have regular calls to discuss the project, as well as the Web3 and blockchain space in general. I honestly don’t know of another community that engages with its members in such a way. If you have a question, a problem, an idea, or a solution, then there is always an opportunity to be&nbsp;heard.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>I mainly hang out in the Telegram rooms; I guess it’s become my natural environment. However, I’ve recently spent more time on Discord, where there are some excellent opportunities to share ideas. We even have dedicated channels to throw your ideas around in. Rather than seeing other channels, I’d really like to see the Discord community grow.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>Being a Harbinger means that you really believe in the aims and goals of the project. If you want to be a Harbinger, the first step is to be a positive force in the community. Understand what Ontology is about and share that understanding.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Altruistic, Thoughtful, Passionate.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>The answer to all these questions is the same. I’d like to see more opportunities to use ONT ID, and for the community to tell people that they are using&nbsp;it.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Ontology has a fantastic vision for the future. The technology is excellent, and the community is supportive. Next is the expansion of dApps on the ecosystem, and people using the opportunities Ontology provides to be creative. With the upcoming EVM launch, this feels more achievable than ever. Once that happens, the community can help by using the things that people build and telling everyone how cool they&nbsp;are.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>Gaming is Big (yes, with a capital B) business. In 2020, the videogame industry was worth almost $160bn. To put this figure into perspective, the music industry was worth just under $62bn in the same year, and the global film industry was an estimated $136bn in 2018.

   Okta Early Access Hackathon revisited 

<p>In August, Okta’s developer relations team invited intrepid developers to participate in <a>the virtual Okta Identity Engine Early Access Hackathon</a>, and challenged them to build a working app with our limited availability new customer identity and access management (CIAM) platform. A month or so after, judges convened, <a>winners were announced</a>, and thousands of dollars in prizes were distributed. Kudos to hundreds of participants, and props to all involved.</p>

<p>In October, we sat down with UK-based developer <a href="https://devpost.com/software/gooseclip">Matthew McKenzie, the creator of GooseClip</a>, our first prize winner.</p>

 

 

 Introducing peer-to-peer GooseClip 

<p><a href="https://gooseclip.com/#/">GooseClip</a> is an authenticated peer-to-peer communication platform, rooted in the Go programming language, and inspired by “a frustration at the lack of interoperability of our modern devices.” As Matt describes it, “GooseClip obscures the complexity of peer-to-peer networking by presenting a simple 2-route API, /attach and /connect.” This becomes the base upon which he builds various example mini-products, which demonstrate the versatility and simplicity of the underlying p2p platform.</p>

<p>Developer advocates <a href="https://twitter.com/quorralyne">Heather Downing</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/briandemers">Brian Demers</a> spoke with Matt about peer-to-peer technology, his vision for GooseClip, and his experience hacking Okta and building auth. Matt shared some insights about building leading edge applications and launching new tech products as an independent developer and technical founder.</p>

 Leading stablecoin commences active testing of the public utility and application stack for solving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel&nbsp;Rule. <p>British Virgin Islands, November 18, 2021, 12:00 PM BST — Tether Operations Limited (“Tether”), the company operating the blockchain-enabled platform<a href="http://tether.to/"> tether.to</a>, that powers the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, announced today that it has commenced operations with <a href="https://shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> starting with active testing of <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, its decentralized compliance framework and smart-contract solution to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Veriscope links user consent-permissioning with VASP-to-VASP data transmission and ensures VASPs can determine between honest transactions and data attacks. It was designed to act as a decentralized coordination and discovery system, open for any VASP or intermediary as a public utility for data attestation and routing. The platform provides a decentralized compliance framework and a smart contract platform for VASPs to enable Travel Rule compliance and aims to meet meets the growing demands of the rising regulatory efforts that have commanded attention and action across cryptocurrency, DeFi, NFTs, stablecoins, and many other elements of blockchain technology.</p><p>This integration marks the initial phases of Tethers’ trial of Veriscope which may allow Tether to offer its customers an experience that both promotes privacy while also solving global compliance requirements for all participants across the ecosystem. The goal of this trial is to create an experience for customers that maintains openness and ensures peer-to-peer transaction discovery that is compliant with the new FATF Travel Rule requirement.</p><blockquote>“We built Shyft to ensure that the ethos of digital asset networks was maintained regardless of the regulatory requirements that would come,” said Joseph W. of Shyft Network. “We are excited to see this public system be put to work by the largest players globally, and are proud to see leading stablecoins, like Tether, maintain decentralization while allowing the ecosystem to meet regulations. We see systems like Veriscope, and networks like Shyft, as critical infrastructure layers to the future of decentralized data coordination and transmission.”</blockquote><p>In August of this year, Shyft Network, in collaboration with Tether, Bitfinex and other exchanges, key industry players, and liquidity providers announced the global deployment of Veriscope, a public utility and application stack for solving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule. Just a few days ago, Shyft Core, the development team behind Veriscope, announced the open-source release of the infrastructure to enable developers and other VASPs to freely integrate with the platform, Tether will be one of the first to put this infrastructure to the&nbsp;test.</p><blockquote>“Veriscope’s opensource solution to discovering VASPs and transmitting customer information is an interesting use case that’s in line with the ethos of Bitcoin” said, Leonardo Real, CCO of Tether. We look forward to continuing to lead the&nbsp;charge”.</blockquote><p>To learn more about Tether, please visit,<a href="https://tether.to/"> https://tether.to/</a>.</p><p>About Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems.

			 Tony Malghem is Tech Lead at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hello! I am Tony, 29, TechLead for Tokeny. I graduated as a Software Engineer from Université de Technologie de Compiègne in France. After spending some time in Paris and discovering the start-up world, I followed my girlfriend to Luxembourg when she landed a more interesting job in one of the many banks here 🙂</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I absolutely loved the job I had in Paris in the startup. The pressure, the smaller team, the « family business » kind of feeling. When I moved to Luxembourg, I decided to try something different, but I was missing all of this too much. I lost myself working in banks and it got too much. One of the person I worked with told me about Tokeny, and I was very interested in this new challenge. So I wrote an email to our amazing HR Radka, and the rest is history 🙂&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It’s amazing! I know, you must be thinking to yourself: ”Of course he’s lobbying for his company”, but honestly, it’s one of the best companies I’ve ever worked with. The team is incredible, with people from so many different backgrounds and experiences, with great ideas, a big commitment and a strong team spirit. We all stick together in the ups and the downs, we lose together and we win together. I am proud to be a member of this company.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Too many things! I love learning new stuff, so I always end up finding a new passion and throwing myself in it. The latest one is baking! I started writing a few years ago, and created a writing community to make progress. We even self published a compilation of short stories last year 🙂 Anything I can share with my friends and family, really.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p></p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To make this planet a better place to live for my son. I would love to break this cycle of previous generations making the next one’s life more difficult, by fighting climate change for example.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could?

<p>After achieving many major milestones in 2021 including the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/the-dock-token-migration-is-now-complete/">Token migration</a>, the release of <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-leaps-into-the-future-with-docks-api/">Dock’s API</a>, and launching Ledger Wallet support, the Dock team is proud and excited to make some new additions to the roadmap that will take us into 2022. </p><p>We will continue to strive to build innovative solutions, drive adoption, and engage with our community. Below, you’ll find high-level descriptions of the upcoming milestones.</p><p>Anonymous Credentials (Q4 2021)</p><p>We’re working on launching anonymous credentials and BBS+ Signatures to further protect our users' right to privacy. Currently, if an individual wishes to share an accreditation, they must share the entire credential. Anonymous credentials are an enhancement to privacy meaning individuals can select certain parts of a credential to share as well as prove information contained in the credential without exposing any of the information.</p><p>As an example, a credential holder will be able to prove their educational qualifications without the verifier knowing the date they attended and graduated from university. The credential holder will have complete control over the specifics of what data they wish to share. </p><p>Self-Serve Issuer Console (Q1 2022)</p><p>Dock is working on a Self-Serve Issuer Console which will allow any organization to issue credentials without having to write a single line of code. The console will enable organizations to issue and verify credentials, enabling rapid prototyping and pilots to prove the benefits of verifiable credentials without having to hire developers. </p><p>Digital credentials remove any risk of fraudulent activity; credentials are issued by an educational or training body, and these can be optionally anchored to the Dock blockchain which serves as a timestamp for the credential. By simply signing up with an email address in their internet browser, organizations can design and issue their verifiable credentials to their users via email. </p><p>V2 Dock Mobile App (Q1 2022)</p><p>We understand the trouble and delay verifying a person’s credentials can cause, and the worry for the individual of not having ownership of their credentials. We plan to release an additional feature to our Mobile App in Q1 of 2022 giving users the ability to store and manage digital credentials. Credential holders can take back control of their data as they receive verifiable credentials from issuers and have control over who sees them. </p><p>Dock will embed a verifiable credentials wallet into the existing Dock Mobile App allowing users to receive, store and manage their data. Please note that the first version of this wallet will be published in the app stores in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>Wallet SDK (Q1 2022)</p><p>Many SMEs and large organizations want to offer storage and functionality of digital credentials in their applications but don’t have the resources to make this happen. For organizations that want to offer digital credentials, the holders of these credentials often have to download a third-party app to store and manage their data. This disconnect means the user is working across multiple apps and managing their own data can become troublesome. Dock’s Wallet SDK can significantly improve the user experience by allowing organizations to embed an identity wallet into their own, existing React Native apps and can be deployed rapidly. A credential holder will be in control over their data and who sees it.</p><p>Enabling digital credentials to be stored in a crypto wallet can take months of development, meaning more money and time being spent from the already scarce resources of a developer's time. Dock will provide support for other languages based on market demand in the near future.</p><p>Our team is looking forward to achieving these significant milestones, continuing to grow Dock, and engaging with the community. We will continue to keep everyone updated through our blog and <a href="https://linktr.ee/DockNetwork">social channels</a>, subscribe to our blog below.</p>

<p><br>We are excited to announce our partnership with <a href="https://www.teller.finance/">Teller Finance</a>! &nbsp;Hot off the release of Bloom’s innovative new DeFi-focused platform, <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a>, we are teaming up with Teller, assisting them as they bring their algorithmic credit risk profile to the DeFi space. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Teller is a perfect fit for Bloom, and we are excited about the potential this partnership represents. &nbsp;By utilizing Bloom’s verifiable credentials (VCs) that can be easily permissioned, Teller is able to confidently focus on their mission to enable the creation of decentralized lending markets that can offer loans without the need for collateral. Their cloud-based protocol was designed to function as a decentralized non-custodial liquidity pool where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Bloom’s VCs become part of a risk assessment algorithm which allows Teller’s protocol to interact with undercollateralized loans.<br></p><blockquote>“This partnership with Teller Finance represents an exciting venture for Bloom, as both companies share a common vision to expand undercollateralized lending within the DeFi arena. &nbsp;We feel that, together, the possibilities are limitless with Teller’s protocol easily integrating with Bloom’s solution.” - Ben DiScipio, Bloom CSO<br></blockquote><p>OnRamp is a key piece of infrastructure for DeFi companies, providing access to reusable VCs that were previously only available to the traditional finance sector. &nbsp;This means that enterprises now have an elegant solution within the undercollateralized market as we assist them with KYC, sanction screening, and other financial verifications. &nbsp;Beyond that, we see a real opportunity to dramatically increase participation in the DeFi space with Teller, as we work together to incorporate alternative signals to determine creditworthiness and enable risk assessment. &nbsp;We share the same passion for decentralized identity and believe that decentralized lending can be executed securely and efficiently. <br></p><blockquote>"We at Teller are thrilled to partner with Bloom to use their secure identity and credit scoring solutions on our decentralized lending platform. Bloom’s cost-efficiency and risk reduction when it comes to identity theft and fraud prevention perfectly aligns with our mission to provide users peace of mind when borrowing and lending." &nbsp;Ryan Berkun, Teller CEO<br></blockquote><p>At the heart of the Teller Protocol are the main contracts, including their ATM contracts. &nbsp;ATM, or Autonomous Teller Machine, is a decentralized money market smart contract that is connected to a Credit Risk Algorithm (CRA), through which users can request loans using personal consumer data that is computed by Teller's open-source CRA. By integrating Bloom’s innovative platform into their process, Teller is emphasizing the importance of enabling secure, reusable VCs while maintaining user privacy. &nbsp;Our hope is that the scope of our partnership will continue to expand and open doors to all of the verifications OnRamp can provide.<br></p><p>We are proud to partner with Teller and are thrilled to share with them all that OnRamp and the BloomID can offer within the DeFi sector. Learn more about <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a> and <a href="https://www.teller.finance/">Teller</a> and stay tuned for future integrations as we continue to unlock the full potential of DeFi.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

 A step-by-step guide on publishing your first dataset on Ocean&nbsp;Market <p>Have you ever wondered how to make money over the blockchain? If you have datasets to sell, you will be amazed at how simple the process is. The blockchain often sounds like a complex and abstract concept that requires a lot of technical knowledge. In reality, interacting and selling datasets over the blockchain is an incredibly straightforward process that only has a couple of unfamiliar steps.</p><p>In this article, we will walk you through the steps to publish and sell your datasets via Ocean Protocol, which is a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer.</p> Ocean puts you in&nbsp;control <p>We understand that many companies don’t feel comfortable sharing or selling data. This is because sharing data is perceived to be a risk — the risk of either losing your competitive advantage or violating strict data privacy regulations. This is why we have been driven to build you the tools so that sharing data means gaining control and preserving privacy.</p><p>Ocean Protocol gives you complete control of your data by removing any third parties from the process, selling data over the blockchain is completely decentralised. As we will demonstrate below, Ocean also gives you a super easy-to-use marketplace for selling your data. This reduces the barriers to entry and brings you customers for your data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>From the very beginning, Ocean has strived to put you in control of your data, we are on a mission to break the black-box data selling model of Facebook and others. We achieve this through the core concepts of access control, orchestration and decentralization. With access control and orchestration, any data or AI service can be shared under the conditions set by the owner of data. There is no central intermediary, which ensures no one can interfere with the transaction and both the publisher and user have transparency.</p> So much more than a typical data&nbsp;market <p>By leveraging the capabilities of blockchain, Ocean Protocol offers you so much more control than a typical data market. The gatekeeper to accessing your data is a smart contract, which is an immutable piece of code running on the blockchain that no one is able to change. You can have confidence that the terms and conditions to access your dataset can never be altered by an intermediary.</p><p>While Ocean Market is a great place for selling data, we also understand that some data is too sensitive to be shared — potentially due to GDPR or other reasons. For these types of datasets, we offer a unique service called compute-to-data. This enables you to monetise the dataset that sits behind a firewall without ever revealing the raw data to the consumer. Researchers and data scientists pay to run their algorithms on the data set and the computation is performed behind a firewall, all they receive is the results generated by the algorithm.</p> How to publish a dataset on Ocean&nbsp;Market  Tutorial Sections  1. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#b740">Introduction</a><br>2. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#b171">Setup Your Wallet</a><br>3. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#a296">Add Ether cryptocurrency to your wallet</a><br>4. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#9106">Publish your data asset on Ocean Market</a><br>    4.1 <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#a03f">Connect your account</a><br>    4.2 <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#52e1">Enter your dataset information into the publish form</a><br>    4.3 <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#679d">Sign the transactions &amp; publish your dataset</a> <br>5. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#affc">Decide on pricing type</a><br>    5.1 <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#4e3d">Fixed pricing</a><br>    5.2 <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#ec22">Dynamic pricing</a><br>6. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#0f66">Create fixed pricing for a data set</a><br>7. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#f94a">All done!</a>  1. Introduction <p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> provides a convenient and familiar interface for you to publish and sell your data. If you haven’t seen it before, now is a good time to have a look at the site. You’ll find it looks a lot like any other data marketplace — running the blockchain doesn’t compromise usability.</p><p>What you decide to sell via Ocean is entirely up to you. The dataset can comprise images, location information, audio, video, sales data, or combinations of them all. There is no exhaustive list of what type of data can be published, you can be as creative as you want. Just make sure that the data you’re selling is legal and not in breach of copyright or other regulations, our policies can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">here</a>.</p><p>There are only a few unfamiliar things you need to get used to when selling data over the blockchain:</p>  Every interaction with the blockchain costs money. There is no centralised company controlling the system that is going to pay for computation and server costs, so the user must pay. This is called the gas fee — it’s basically like putting gas into your car to make it&nbsp;run.  You need to have a wallet to store the cryptocurrency that you will be paying for these gas fees. This can easily be set up as a browser extension.  Each time you interact with the blockchain, you will be asked to “sign” a transaction. This is the process where you pay the gas fees and verify the origin of the transaction. It is equivalent to being asked to enter your pin when you pay with a credit&nbsp;card.  <p>If you’re familiar with the blockchain space, you may be wondering which blockchain Ocean Protocol uses. It was originally deployed on Ethereum but we have since deployed to four other chains, and there will be more to come in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>It is important to note that the gas cost associated with signing transactions on different blockchains varies significantly. For the purpose of this guide, we will be focusing on how to publish datasets on the Ethereum blockchain, as it is the most ubiquitous. However — it is also the most expensive. If you would like to explore a cheaper option, we would recommend reading our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-polygon-network-8abad19cbf47">blog post on using Polygon</a>. We also have instructions in our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge/">documentation</a> on how to transfer funds from Ethereum to Polygon (via a&nbsp;bridge).</p> 2. Setup Your&nbsp;Wallet <p>Let’s start with getting your wallet set up to interact with the blockchain. After this, the process of publishing a dataset is very familiar — it just requires filling out a&nbsp;form.</p>  Go to your browser’s web store for extensions and search for MetaMask.  <p>2. Install MetaMask. The wallet provides a friendly user interface that will help you through each step. MetaMask gives you two options: importing an existing wallet or creating a new one. Choose to Create a&nbsp;Wallet:</p><p>3. In the next step create a new password for your wallet. Read through and accept the terms and conditions.</p><p>4. Once your wallet is set up, MetaMask will show your Secret Backup Phrase. It is very important that you write this down (ideally more than once) on paper (don’t save it on your computer) and store it somewhere safe. If you forget your password or lose access to your computer, this is the only way to regain access to your cryptocurrency.</p><p>5. Continue forward. On the next page, MetaMask will ask you to confirm the backup phrase — this phase is very important so they’re checking you’ve actually written it down. Select the words in the correct sequence.</p><p>6. Voila! Your account setup is complete. You can access MetaMask via the browser extension in the top right corner of your&nbsp;browser.</p><p>7. You can now manage Ether and Ocean Tokens with this wallet. You can copy your account address to the clipboard from the options. When you want someone to send Ether or Ocean Tokens to you, you will have to give them that&nbsp;address.</p><p>If you feel you need some more help setting up your MetaMask wallet, you can also watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dn0wVs9kWolBCbtHaFxsi408cumOeth">tutorial video snippets</a> and <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/">view these instructions</a> on our documentation.</p> 3. Add Ether cryptocurrency to your&nbsp;wallet <p>There are many places where you can purchase cryptocurrency and you may have used some of them before. To keep things simple, we will purchase Ether from within MetaMask. It’s easy to buy cryptocurrency in MetaMask with your credit card or Apple/Android pay. Here are the&nbsp;steps:</p>  Open Metamask and click&nbsp;“Buy”  <p>2. MetaMask gives you a few different options, which you’ll see here. Wyre (the first option on the list) is fast and easy to use so let’s click “Continue with&nbsp;Wyre”</p><p>3. Now enter the amount of Ether that you would like to purchase and the currency that you will be paying in. At this point, you will also need to tick to accept the terms and conditions.</p><p>4. Now you need to enter your personal payment details — name, address, credit card number&nbsp;etc.</p><p>5. All you have to do is click “Accept” and Wyre will process the payment and send you your cryptocurrency.</p><p>Once the payment processing is complete you will now see that your balance in MetaMask is no longer&nbsp;zero.</p> 4. Publish your data asset on Ocean&nbsp;Market <p>Great — so you’ve got your wallet set up and you’ve bought some cryptocurrency. You are now ready to publish your dataset on Ocean Market. Head on over to the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">site</a> and let’s get&nbsp;going!</p> 4.1 Connect your&nbsp;account <p>The first step is to connect your wallet to the site. This is the equivalent of logging in on a traditional site. This lets Ocean Market know the public address that’s associated with your Ethereum&nbsp;account.</p><p>You’ll see that Ocean Market gives you a few different options for the type of wallet that you want to connect. In our case, we will click MetaMask as that is the wallet that we have set&nbsp;up.</p><p>MetaMask will now ask you to select the account that you would like to connect to Ocean Market — this is only relevant if you have more than&nbsp;one.</p><p>Now we need to click “Connect” to confirm that we want MetaMask to connect our account to Ocean Market. You can see here that MetaMask helpfully explains that this site is requesting to “View the addresses of your permitted accounts (required)”.</p><p>Now that your wallet is connected, you will see that your wallet address is shown in the top right-hand corner.</p><p>Click “Publish” from the top of the site and let’s start filling out the publish&nbsp;form.</p> 4.2 Enter your dataset information into the publish&nbsp;form <p>The publish form is nice and straightforward and most of the fields are obvious (title, description, author etc) — they also all have descriptions of what’s expected underneath in case they’re not&nbsp;clear.</p><p>The link to your dataset should be entered into the “file” field. You need to take responsibility for hosting your dataset — this can be on Google Drive, Dropbox, or AWS — anywhere that it can be downloaded from. For the access type, you need to decide if customers will be allowed to buy your raw dataset or if you only want them to run computations on it behind a firewall (Compute-to-Data). It’s also advisable to enter some tags — these are keywords that help customers discover your dataset, try to think of words that people will be searching for.</p><p>The only blockchain-specific field is the datatoken name and symbol. The datatoken is the token on the blockchain that grants access to your dataset — consumers have to purchase the datatoken to have access. The name of the datatoken doesn’t really matter, it’s just important it’s unique, so it’s fine to keep the default or click refresh a couple of times until you see something you&nbsp;like.</p><p>You can also decide how long you would like users to have access to the dataset after their initial purchase by choosing the timeout. If you’re constantly updating your dataset you may wish to have a shorter timeout so that customers come back to purchase the latest&nbsp;copy.</p> 4.3 Sign the transactions &amp; publish your&nbsp;dataset <p>When you finish filling out the form and click submit, you will see a series of pop-ups from Metamask. This is the process of signing the transactions and paying the gas fees that were mentioned above. There are two transactions that you need to&nbsp;sign.</p><p>In each of these pop-ups, MetaMask shows you an estimate of how much the gas fee is likely to be. It also gives an estimate of how long the transaction is likely to take. It also shows you the functions that the transaction is carrying out. The first one is “Create Token” and the second is “Contract Interaction”. Click “confirm” on each&nbsp;pop-up.</p><p>Awesome — your dataset is now published! Now you see that using the blockchain isn’t so difficult after&nbsp;all.</p> 5. Decide on pricing&nbsp;type <p>Once the dataset is published, you can think about how you want to set the pricing for your asset. The pricing can only be set from the Ethereum account that published the dataset. If you have multiple accounts, you need to ensure you’re still connected with the same one you used to do the publishing.</p><p>There are 2 options for setting the price of an asset on Ocean Marketplace. It is important to think carefully about which one is appropriate for your data asset. Once you set the pricing type you will not be able to change it, although you will still be able to change the&nbsp;price.</p> 5.1 Fixed&nbsp;pricing <p>Fixed pricing is fairly self-explanatory — you set the price and that’s what customers pay to access your data. You can change the price at any time and customers will always have to pay the amount that you&nbsp;set.</p> 5.2 Dynamic&nbsp;pricing <p>Dynamic pricing is a little more complicated as the price is determined by an automated version of an order book. This concept is called an Automated Market Marker (AMM). Under the hood, Ocean uses the Balancer&nbsp;AMM.</p><p>If you would like to create dynamic pricing you will need to purchase Ocean tokens so that you can provide liquidity to the AMM pool. The price that the customer pays is set by the ratio of Ocean tokens to datatokens within the pool. As more people purchase the datatokens, the ratio changes and the price increases. If you remove Ocean tokens from the pool the ratio changes in the other direction and the datatoken price goes&nbsp;down.</p><p>Anyone can add liquidity to the pool you have created — they are known as liquidity providers. Liquidity providers earn a share of the transaction fees when the datatoken is purchased.</p> 6. Create fixed pricing for a data&nbsp;set <p>To keep things simple, let’s use fixed pricing for the dataset that we have just published. From the publish success page that you are on, click “Go to Data&nbsp;set”</p><p>Now click on “Create pricing”. This takes you to the section where you can choose either dynamic or fixed&nbsp;pricing.</p><p>Click on the “Fixed Price” tab at the top. Now there is a simple form for you to enter the price of your data asset. The price that you set is in Ocean tokens — this is the cryptocurrency that your customers will use to purchase your&nbsp;asset.</p><p>Once you have entered the price and clicked “Create Pricing” you will, once again, be presented with a series of MetaMask pops. There are three pop-ups that you need to confirm in this case: Creating the pricing, minting the datatokens, and then allowing Ocean Market to spend them (i.e. selling them on your&nbsp;behalf).</p><p>Once you have confirmed each of these transactions you will see the success message explaining that fixed pricing has been&nbsp;set.</p><p>After reloading the page you will see that your dataset is now for sale at the fixed price which you&nbsp;set.</p> 7. All&nbsp;done! <p>Excellent — you’re all done! We have covered a lot in this article so well done for making it all the way to the end. You have set up your MetaMask wallet, bought Ether, published your first dataset, set the pricing and signed all of the transactions along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Hopefully, now you see that publishing and selling data on the blockchain doesn’t require any advanced technical knowledge. Once you have got your MetaMask wallet set up, it is a fairly straightforward process. You have to fill out a form and click confirm on a couple of pop-ups — that’s pretty much it. Now all you need to do is notify your potential customers and start earning money from the&nbsp;sales!</p><p>Let’s also not lose sight of why we’re doing this — Ocean Protocol is significantly better than any centralised data exchange. It is completely decentralized and puts you in complete control. It is completely unique in enabling you to sell access to sensitive data sets without exposing the raw data (Compute-to-Data).</p><p>We are always happy to answer any questions that you may have after reading this article, the best way to get in touch is <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/776848812534398986">discord</a>.

				  A ground-breaking development in decentralized fintech from Liquid Avatar Technologies, Dynamics Inc., and Indicio — and what it means for the future.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Liquid Avatar Technologies’<a href="https://www.thenewswire.com/press-releases/1k98Fpjr0-liquid-avatar-technologies-and-dynamics-inc-tap-payment-infrastructure-for-verification-of-digital-credentials.html"> PassmateTM</a> shows how decentralized identity will transform the world: by easily integrating into systems that already exist. The soon-to-be-launched Software as a Service — conceived by Liquid Avatar’s David Lucatch, enables verifiable credentials to run on existing payment rails.</p>
<p>It was the kind of insight that seems obvious after someone points it out: Businesses already have the infrastructure to handle debit and credit card payments and PassmateTM simply uses these to deploy verifiable credentials. They will be used, first, to deal with age verification for proof of purchases — a non-trivial risk for small businesses in Liquid Avatar’s home province of Ontario, Canada, where merchants can be hit with costly, livelihood-destroying fines if they fail to verify the age of their customers. But more importantly, it provides a simple and powerful deterrent to something far worse: the poor choices underage purchasers can make when they succeed in fooling retail clerks.</p>
<p>PassmateTM will enable a verifiable credential to be used at point-of-sale without the business having to add costly new infrastructure or requiring sales clerks to discern valid from fraudulent IDs — and the purchaser will be able to prove they are of legal age without having to divulge personal details like their exact date of birth or home address.</p>
<p>It doesn’t stop there. PassmateTM can handle all sorts of “proofs” without having to reveal their full content—such as Covid test status or any other qualification that might be necessary to access or purchase a product or service. It will be piloted in early 2022 in Ontario, then the rest of Canada, before an expected broader geographic rollout.</p>
<p>But it’s the ability to use verifiable credentials at point-of-sale card payment terminals and devices that sets up a paradigm change for identity in the marketplace. A financial institution, payment processor or card issuer can now think about adding a verifiable credential to manage proof of identity in a low-cost, frictionless way, and do so without a customer having to reveal unnecessary personally identifying information (PII). This has the potential to alleviate the pain of credit card fraud while avoiding complex data privacy compliance.</p>
<p>While the current pace of innovation in decentralized identity reveals its protean capacity to solve long-standing problems around authentication, compliance, and security, there is also the opportunity that the technology itself creates by doing things differently and enabling things that were not previously possible.</p>
<p>This is where we turn to <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">DIDComm</a>, one of the key technical elements of decentralized identity and one that makes PassmateTM possible. DIDComm is a decentralized communications protocol for peer-to-peer communication that can run over any existing transport but also function offline. DIDComm is where decentralized identity gets really exciting.</p>
<p>DIDComm is the next phase of Social<br>The ability to generate secure relationships and rich communication through DIDComm will have a profound effect on the way brands and businesses engage with consumers and consumers engage with brands and businesses.</p>
<p>As one marketing <a href="https://www.opinium.com/the-next-brand-consumer-dynamic-the-view-from-the-us/">report</a> into emergent behavior put it, “we’re entering a consumer-first landscape where relationships with brands are symbiotic, not top-down, and based on a system of shared ideals, values and mutually beneficial interactions.”</p>
<p>This is where DIDComm is a game-changer. By enabling rich “consumer-first” interaction in a privacy-preserving and secure way, DIDComm is the evolutionary path for social media. Instead of the one or the few speaking to the many and interaction mediated by an algorithm, it’s going to also be about the one-to-one. Instead of broadcasting for influence, it will also be about creating authentic relationships. Given current trends, this is going to be huge. Organizations and brands that master this technology are going to turn consumers into collaborators, stakeholders, and advocates.</p>
<p>And that’s not all…</p>
<p>The DIDComm of Things<br>With the proliferation of sensors and cameras, digital objects will be able to engage with non digital objects. This is the foundation of the <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-the-spatial-web-bb8127f9ac45">spatial web</a> and it will enable the creation of digital twins, smart factories, and smart cities. To work, all the connected “things” in the spatial web will need verifiable identities and to be able to communicate with each other offline in secure, peer-to-peer ways. Verifiable credentials and DIDComm make this possible.</p>
<p>Crash—crush?—the future<br>PassmateTM is a signpost for the near future. The ability to authenticate and trust data and relationships and communicate in new ways is going to change everything, slowly at first, then swiftly like a flood.</p>
<p>Indicio is incubating this future. We love working with visionary companies and organizations to make their visions of a better digital world come to life. You can contact us <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the ID-Ideal project, Jolocom brings sovereign identities and SSI into a single wallet.</p>



<p>To improve efficiency and interoperability in the digital space, Jolocom presents the ID-Ideal project. The starting point is the fact that every user has 70 digital identities online. Why not introduce one single secure digital ID solution to merge all of those identities? ID-Ideal is one way of many, offering an integrated solution or a middle way so that many identities can be supplemented by a single, secure digital ID solution.</p>



<p>The project is part of the competitive innovation program “Showcase Secure Digital Identities” (SSDI) funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and one of four projects that qualified for the implementation phase.</p>



<p>Jolocom is a partner in three of the four SDI implementation projects, to which it will lend its expertise in self-sovereign identity and years of experience in developing digital identity wallets. Other projects include “ONCE” and the “SDIKA” project. The SDI projects are special because they bring competitors around the table who are working together on one solution. In addition, they achieve interoperability, so that the use of digital identification no longer remains inefficient.</p>



<p>ID-Ideal’s implementation phase began in May 2021. Current developments relating to the European eIDAS regulation are also taken into account, with the clear aim of providing future-orientated solutions on the subject of digital identities. Citizens should be able to act from the comfort of their home – be it when changing their place of residence, applying for a care center or other notifications of changes. The solution should not be used regionally but across Germany and Europe.</p>



<p>Based on the so-called ID-Ideal Trust Framework, the technical, legal, and semantic interoperability of services and applications is regulated. The aim is to stimulate the creation of an ID ecosystem. If many ID services can coexist, the overarching exchange of digital evidence becomes possible. This is how we actively create trust between actors inside the digital space – one of the basic principles of Jolocom.</p>



<p>The idea behind ID-Ideal is to create a basis for existing and future identity services. To achieve this, interoperability between the individual ecosystems is necessary. For this reason, the project mainly focuses on key aspects:</p>



<p>A) Trust Framework: harmonize various ID services and create standards for secure digital identities</p>



<p>B) High relevance to everyday life and very good usability to increase the incentive</p>



<p>C) Establishing a TrustNest initiative: an open community that promotes certification, exchange, and further development</p>

Community Growth   1,843 new members joined our global community this week. The active community has attracted a large number of new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join&nbsp;us</a>.  Ontology published the next couple of interviews in its Harbinger Series. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-andrey-80675a5e6d85">Andrey Sher</a> from our Russian community said that Ontology has made progress in the Web3 field and created a unique decentralized identity solution. He hopes to help more community members learn about privacy protection through Ontology.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1458879704304283653?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He focused on “Let NFT return to the public.”; with the emergence of more and more DeFi+NFT projects, Ontology’s DID solution and OScore provide them with a solution for identity verification. Through on-chain and off-chain data, users will have accurate identity and reputation information to trade NFTs with each&nbsp;other.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/DeIDSummit/status/1458464473170251783?s=20">DeID Summit</a>: Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, invited Charles Wayn, co-founder of Project Galaxy, to discuss “NFTs as a service infrastructure”. Charles said: Project Galaxy is providing services related to on-chain certificates (NFTs) for communities and enterprises. These certificates (NFTs) contain a lot of user data and provide users with credibility in the&nbsp;network.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1457981281883627525?s=20">Telegram weekly Community Call</a>, led by Astro, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about Ontology’s upcoming 4th anniversary NFT event; community members provided many novel ideas for this&nbsp;program.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>VentureBeat — <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/06/decentralization-may-be-key-to-protecting-our-digital-identities/">Decentralization may be key to protecting our digital identities</a></p><blockquote>Researchers around the world are working to create alternatives to our existing digital identities through the decentralized web, or Web 3.0. These alternatives use new protocols that remove the need for intermediaries during transactions, while further democratizing the web and bringing value back to creators and participants. The goal is to enable internet users to verify their credentials without the dependence of intermediaries while managing their own identities. This will create a fair, secure, fast, and scalable new internet with a stronger focus on security and&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><p>With Ontology’s ONT ID and OScore technologies, users can manage decentralized digital identities and reputation scores. ONT ID is Ontology’s decentralized identity framework that enables users to control their data and decide whether a third-party can access a particular piece of information about them.

<p>Jolocom bringt im ID-Ideal Projekt hoheitliche Identitäten sowie SSI in eine Wallet.</p>



<p>Um Effizienz und Interoperabilität im digitalen Raum einzuführen, stellt Jolocom das Projekt ID-Ideal vor. Ausgangspunkt ist die Tatsache, dass jeder Nutzer und jede Nutzerin über 70 digitale Identitäten online verfügt.&nbsp;Wieso nicht viele Identitäten durch eine einzige, sichere digitale ID Lösung ergänzen?&nbsp;ID-Ideal ist ein Weg von vielen, eine ganzheitliche Lösung oder einen Mittelweg anzubieten, damit so viele Identitäten durch eine einzige, sichere digitale ID Lösung ergänzt werden können.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Projekt ist Teil des Innovationswettbewerbs „Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten” (SDI), gefördert durch das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi). Es ist eines von insgesamt vier Projekten, die es in die dreijährige Umsetzungsphase geschafft haben. Weitere Projekte sind u.a. ,,ONCE’’ und das Projekt ,,SDIKA’’. Die Jolocom GmbH bringt ihre Expertise aus der Entwicklung der selbst-souveränen Wallet in insgesamt drei Umsetzungsprojekte von sicheren Digitalen Identitäten ein. Die SDI Projekte sind besonders, weil sie Mitbewerber:innen an einen Tisch bringen, die gemeinsam an einer Lösung arbeiten. Außerdem bemühen sie sich um Interoperabilität, damit die Nutzung digitaler Nachweise eben nicht mehr ineffizient bleibt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Projekt ID-Ideal startete im Mai 2021 in die Umsetzungsphase. Dabei werden auch derzeitige Entwicklungen rund um die europäische eIDAS-Verordnung berücksichtigt, mit dem klaren Ziel, zukunftsfähige Lösungen zum Thema Digitale Identitäten bereitzustellen. Bürger:innen sollen bequem von zu Hause agieren können – sei es bei der Ummeldung des Wohnsitzes, dem Antrag auf einen Kita-Platz oder andere Veränderungsmitteilungen. Die zu erarbeitende Lösung soll nicht regional bleiben, sondern eine deutschland- und europaweite Anwendung finden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Basierend auf dem sogenannten ID-Ideal Trust Framework wird die technische, rechtliche und semantische Interoperabilität von Diensten und Anwendungen geregelt. Ziel ist es, die Entstehung eines ID-Ökosystems anzuregen. Wenn viele ID-Dienste koexistieren können, wird der übergreifende Austausch digitaler Nachweise möglich. So wiederum schaffen wir aktiv Vertrauen zwischen den Akteur:innen im digitalen Raum – eines der Grundprinzipien von Jolocom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Idee hinter ID-Ideal besteht darin, eine Basis für bestehende und zukünftige Identitätsdienste bereitzustellen. Um das zu erreichen, ist Interoperabilität zwischen den einzelnen Ökosystemen nötig. Aus diesem Grund fokussiert sich das Projekt vor allem auf drei zentrale Aspekte:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A) Trust Framework: verschiedene ID-Dienste harmonisieren und Standards für sicheren Austausch von Nachweisen schaffen&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>B) Hohe Alltagsrelevanz und sehr gute Nutzbarkeit, damit der Anreiz größer wird&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>C) Aufbau einer TrustNest Initiative: eine offene Community, die Zertifizierung, Austausch und Weiterentwicklung vorantreibt&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining for a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. As you may have heard before that Sweden is one of the countries that has one of the best electronic identifications in the world. And we are going to hear specifically one of these systems, which is Freja eID.</p>
<p>So our guest today is Kristofer von Beetzen. He is the Chief Product Officer at Freja eID. He joined the company in 2012 and was part of the transformation from a technology-centric IT security company to the cloud-based user-oriented identity service that is offered with Freja eID today. Kristofer was previously working with media production and advertising, and has studied marketing at the University of Vaxjo. His interest aside from bringing Freja to the world is writing, and he has published several books and columns – among them are a crime novel and a book on poker strategy.</p>
<p>Hello, Kristofer.</p>
<p>Kristofer von Beetzen: Hello. Thanks for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure, super interested in hearing about Freja eID, which a few years ago- Ubisecure started work more and more in Sweden, and then I start hearing this name Freja eID. So you will tell us for everybody how exactly this system works, this service. But please, first, we would like to hear from you a bit your personal side. Tell us about yourself, and how was your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yes. So, I started out in the industry, actually, as I said, I came from media production and advertising. I was working with this company, back then was called Verisec. And I was working with their communication and PR and so on. And they were working a lot with the traditional digital identity things like hardware tokens for banks, establishing trust on a pretty high level so that banks could migrate from bank offices to online banking. So this company was actually started already in 2002. And then they also started with some initial product development with an authentication server, and had some plans of going international with this product. So I actually went from being a consultant to the company to joining them in 2012, as a part of their expansion.</p>
<p>And along the way, we kind of figured out that the proprietary solutions, that was kind of the name of the game back then, where you had an authentication server placed in your server room, and then issuing identities from your own organisations to your customers. We saw that, particularly in Sweden, and in the Nordic countries, the use of these kind of communities, such as BankID and similar, were taking a lot of ground. And we didn’t really see this coming in other countries at the same pace and speed. So we thought that if this is the future of identity, that you have this kind of cloud service and Identity-as-a-Service, rather than having your own, each company having their own identity systems, then we can actually do something and create something in Sweden, and then take it to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So that was kind of how I came into this. And then somewhere around 2016, we started the work to focus on these Freja eID products. And then we actually transformed the whole company and change the name and so on from Verisec to Freja eID group. And now we’re totally focused on this service and sold off the legacy products that actually was in place when I started.</p>
<p>Oscar: So Verisec became Freja. And Verisec was always a Swedish company?</p>
<p>Kristofer: Oh, yes, yeah. And Verisec still exists, so the legacy part we sold is now in a new company called Verisec International. And they are still doing a lot of good things and working on those solutions that we developed back then. But we felt that we needed to focus, which is one of the hardest things when it comes, especially in this technology era where you can do almost anything and it’s tempting to do anything and everything. But we felt like we really need to focus on this Freja eID order to make it successful. Because we really felt that we had such a strong drive and we had such a strong support from users and from relying parties that this was needed. So we took the decision. And actually last year we changed the name to Freja eID Group and now we’re solely focused on the Freja eID product.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla And I guess you joined the company in a more advertising or marketing role and then you move to innovation.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yeah, I started out as the VP Marketing and was looking after the communications and all the things related to how we established ourselves as a brand and so on. And then when we came to doing this kind of consumer-oriented product which Freja eID is, we realised, OK, we need some product management here. We need to think totally different, because our main target group is the users, not the IT security director and such, which were the previous.</p>
<p>And I was fortunate enough to have a couple of colleagues that worked as product designers in the company. And they were actually much more knowledgeable and had ideas around product management in this new evolving tech era than any of us had in the company. So as it happened, they took me to a conference in London, which was called Leading Design. And that was for the purpose of inspiring me and the management to understand how to build the company as a product and user-oriented company rather than a technology-oriented company.</p>
<p>And that’s maybe the total opposite of how it’s normally done, I guess, when the management is trying to inspire employees, here it goes the other way around. So thanks to designers, we actually realised that we need to make a shift in how we organise development, how we organise ourselves within product design, and so on. And that turned out really well. So I’m grateful for that inspiration. And now we have a totally different organisation than before.</p>
<p>And actually, at that conference, there was an American product specialist, who had – the topic of his presentation was, “Is it product or marketing? Yes.” And I think that was kind of interesting. And when you have a product that is continuously developed, you have an interaction with your users, and the product becomes what the user needs, if you see what I mean, then the kind of limits between marketing and product disappears in a way. So we have organised ourselves now as a company without a marketing director in the traditional sense. The product organisation takes care of what we’re going to develop, and the sales process of it and the marketing. So it’s one big unit doing this in a very integrated and agile way. So it’s completely different from how it was organised before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very, very interesting. Please tell us how the product or service Freja ID was created.</p>
<p>Kristofer: So we had- and it’s no secret that we saw how it grew and grew with this BankID community here in Sweden to begin with. We saw that it was almost impossible for us to sell our authentication servers, which was very successful in Latin America, in Spain, in other countries, and they were serving banking customers in the volumes of I think it was as much as 50 million users for that product.</p>
<p>And when we tried to pitch this authentication service here in Sweden, it was more or less impossible, because everyone was in the next generation. They were looking at Identity-as-a-Service and with pre-established identities, which is something that’s pretty unique, I think, for the Nordic countries, which means that we as a company, we kind of vouch for the identities. We make sure that the users come into our ecosystem into our community, we check their identities, we make all the identity checks, and document checks with the issuer, and so on. So when you have registered with Freja, then you have an electronic identity that can be reused to many places, all the way from tax authority to gambling services, to healthcare, and so on.</p>
<p>So there was no competition in this area. It was BankID, and nothing else, basically. And in all the other business areas in the world, in history where one company has taken such a dominant position that it’s more or less a monopoly, then there is room for innovation and there’s room for improvement. And to be honest, in the beginning, the most common question we’d had the first couple of years was why do we need Freja? What is Freja good for when we have BankID? And then I always answered, “Well, did you remember back in the ‘70s when we had one TV channel?” Oh, and people just like, understand that competition is something good. And what we have built over these years is something that has been differentiated a lot from BankID.</p>
<p>So, I think there’s room for a couple or two or three identities on a national scale and on a European scale, I think we will see quite a few solutions. But it’s kind of like we tried to look at it from the user perspective. And the thing with identity, and that’s a discussion that’s becoming more and more relevant now when we have the discussion of self-sovereign identities and so on, is that everything becomes related to your identity as things become digital. In one way or the other, you need to identify yourself online and in all the services that are some way digitalised, right?</p>
<p>So, we wanted to give the user back the control of this. So we wanted to create something that was both kind of met all the compliance and regulatory measurements that we could test Freja against, but also something that really was user-centric in a way that you, as a user, can really control your identity. And that was kind of the starting point rather than having an identity that is controlled by the government or controlled by your bank or someone else, open it up for the user to call the shots I would say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so please tell us how Freja eID works for an individual.</p>
<p>Kristofer: So what you do is you start to register for the service. And you do that by downloading the app. And then you register on your own, so to say. So you take a selfie, and you register your ID document, and you register your email address, and set the pin and so on. And then we make all these checks, make sure that the face is the same on the selfie as on the ID document and check the validity of the documents. And up until now, that’s kind of similar to what you see on identity verification services that are offered everywhere.</p>
<p>So, the difference is that we then bring you in safely into our database and to our community. And you can then reuse Freja to a lot of services. So currently we have, and this is mostly in Sweden, because this is where the focus has been up until now. So you have around 350 plus services that we have agreements with. And then you can use Freja to access those services by logging in or making electronic signatures. And that’s kind of what’s expected from an electronic identity.</p>
<p>But we’ve taken this one step further. So since we have the face and the selfie of the user, we have created in the app a physical ID document. So you can use Freja instead of your physical ID document in many places in Sweden. For example, when you pick up a parcel at the post, or when you go to a pharmacy and things like that.</p>
<p>Oscar: People just show it or there’s a… it has to be scanned or just shown to the person?</p>
<p>Kristofer: Well, it’s both, either you can show it and then they have the information that is the same things that’s presented in your physical ID document. But there’s also a QR code so they can scan it, and they can get the information that way. Or they can make a transaction all the way to our backend, which means that if you have a transaction that is of high value, then you make an electronic signature in a physical context, which means that they are the same level of assurance as when you do an online transaction with an electronic signature. We offer the whole range of that.</p>
<p>So, that’s kind of the starting point of what we’re doing. But we also see that there is kind of interesting way forward here. So if you think about everything that is required, in terms of KYC, in terms of digital identification, in all sorts of areas, primarily, I mean, we’re talking about payments, we’re talking about gambling, we’re talking about other regulated industries. If you have control over the digital identity ecosystem as we have, I mean in Sweden, there are BankID, and there are Freja eID. So either one of these two needs to be – you need to be connected to one of these in order to make payments, for example.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing with one of these systems is controlled by the few large banks. And then you have all the FinTech companies that’s trying to challenge these big banks, right? But the interesting thing is what happens when these FinTech companies eventually challenge the big banks, to the extent that the big banks feel threatened. And the FinTech companies are dependent on the very infrastructure that the FinTech companies need, namely, the identities.</p>
<p>So I think if you construct and build an infrastructure of identities, which is, you know, in Sweden, we’re government approved. We have now been approved by EU in the pre-registration to eIDAS from the Swedish government. If you have such an infrastructure, then you can build upon that payment services, you can build everything that actually needs this regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>And I’m not saying that we’re going to do it, but we can offer this to all these FinTech companies who don’t want to be dependent on their competitors. And I think it’s the same wherever you go in different countries, a lot of the FinTech companies are dependent on ID methods issued by the banks. So we’re building kind of a parallel infrastructure here that is open for competition in a way that the bank-controlled identities are not.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. What type of services already, you mentioned around 300, right, already services that are using? Tell me the types, just to have an idea what type of services are already using today Freja eID.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yeah, we started out by trying to get a lot of these well-known and well-used public services such as the tax authority, the insurance authority, the unemployment agency, and healthcare services, digital healthcare services, because partly they have a big reach. Everyone in Sweden uses them at one point or another, and it’s also about credibility. So even if we’re governmentally approved, it’s so much more easy to say to the next customer, “The tax authority trusts us. Oh, so it’s pretty easy for you to trust us as well.”</p>
<p>So we have a large chunk of the public sector, its municipalities and government agencies. But now we’re kind of shifting focus towards the commercial side of things, e-commerce and payments, as I mentioned, gambling, and the whole kind of private sector. And the thing with the private sector, perhaps not the banks then but it has not been regulated. In Sweden, it became regulated with gambling that you need an eID in order to register an account and so on.</p>
<p>But for e-commerce and so on, it’s not like they have regulatory demands to have a Level of Assurance 3 identity to onboard a user. So they have been using things like Facebook and Google and things like that. But I think we’re seeing a shift now towards the benefits of having a better interaction with your users with a proper eID rather than these solutions that I mentioned.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, I would rather if – prefer my customer of an e-commerce site to use something like Freja eID as the identification definitely.</p>
<p>Kristofer: And one more thing that I mean, to comment on the e-commerce, what is happening there? I mean, if you think about if I may make an analogy of how Google was perceived in the media industry. So you had all of these big media houses all the way from New York Times to every other media outlet in the world, they were like, “OK, should we accept Google as the advertising engine, or we lose out on a big chunk of advertising money? So should we let them into our house and have them as kind of the advertising agency for our own media outlets?” And they were like “Yeah, what could possibly go wrong?” And as we’ve seen, Google has taken a huge chunk of that advertising revenue.</p>
<p>So basically, it’s Google, rather than New York Times, to take one example, that’s controlling the flow of the advertising money for their own media outlet, OK? And this is nothing new, you know about the story. But the same thing is actually happening with all these checkout companies. You have in e-commerce, you have these payment checkout companies that’s taking a big chunk, and that they’re providing a lovely and brilliant service, makes it easier for you as a customer to check out when you pay for your goods and so on. But what happens is that most users have a relation with the checkout company, not with the e-commerce operator.</p>
<p>So what happens then is that it’s the checkout company that owns the customer relation, not the e-commerce company that’s actually selling the goods. So we’re having the same thing over again, as Google had with the media outlets. It’s now happening with the checkout companies and e-commerce companies. And here, we’re saying to them, “Why would you give away your core assets, which is the relation to your users? You could offer your users to identify to your service rather than the users identifying to the checkout service.” And that’s where Freja comes in. And slowly, I think this is starting to dawn on them that if they do the same mistakes as the media outlets were doing with Google, then they might not have a long-term profitability, at least on that side.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it makes sense. Just to clarify also, can Freja eID be used outside Sweden in some way or another?</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yeah, that’s the whole concept of what we’re trying to build here. We’re focusing on Freja to build a strong position here. And we actually have already released Freja for other countries, so Finland, Norway, Denmark, and the UK. But we’re not kind of focusing there to bring in relying parties as it is today. But we have some Swedish customers who have users in these countries. So they can onboard users from different countries. And if we have some customers saying, “Ah, we actually need you to open up Poland, Germany, and France and whatever” then we can do that. And that’s just a matter of adding international ID documents and doing some testing.</p>
<p>So then when we have built this service and become stronger in Sweden, then we can take the next step. And our goal is to make this a European eID, and we very much look forward to the EU identity wallet development, because we think Freja is basically a blueprint of what they’ve been discussing, or rather, their kind of presentation of the wallet is a blueprint of Freja, I don’t know. But we’ve been around for a while. And we have this whole wallet concept. And we think it’s something that we can scale up on a European level. We’re not there yet. But I think we have a good position to do that.</p>
<p>Oscar: So the authentication/identification is the main service that Freja eID offers. You also mentioned signatures, you also mentioned compliance with eIDAS so tell me if there is something else that Freja eID offers right now.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yeah, and one thing that’s very interesting, and I was actually looking at when you, in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/customer-iam/iam-vs-ciam/" title="Ubisecure on your webpage">Ubisecure on your webpage</a>, you describe customer identity management, and then the traditional identity management for employees as two different categories. And that’s, I totally agree on that description. And what we have done with Freja is that we have made it possible to add your own organisation eID in Freja. So if you’re an organisation and you want to issue employee identification to these employees, you can do that in the Freja ecosystem and you have the whole lifecycle management within Freja and you onboard and offboard users and so on. And you pass along whatever attributes that you as an organisation need to have in order for your employees to login to this cloud service or open doors with Freja or whatever.</p>
<p>So we’re both this consumer-oriented identity, but also this organisation identity. And that’s also really growing fast here in Sweden. Because it’s been – traditionally, it’s been a lot of either you have some kind of proprietary system for employee authentication, or you ask your users to utilise your private eID to log in to your workplace. That’s not a good idea. But it’s been the way it’s been done here because it’s easy, it’s simple for the organisation to just ask employees, “Hey, use your private eID.” And then we don’t have to worry about it.</p>
<p>So, we kind of combined these worlds. So we issue the identity. We make sure that this person, who is your employee, we have the fundamental identity verification of the individual. And on top of that you can manage your own identity lifecycle, and connect to all the services that’s in your organisation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please tell us what are your plans for the future of Freja eID?</p>
<p>Kristofer: The next big thing I would say that we’re planning, and we did some test pilots around this, and that is to expand the concept of what is possible, what kind of value we can provide for our users. So if you think about an electronic identity, it’s probably one of the most used apps on your phone, at least if you have a system like we have in Sweden, where you use eID to everything. So you use your eID many times a day perhaps or at least many times a week. So then you have a trusted relation with your electronic identity. And we try to utilise that.</p>
<p>So we have a section in Freja eID, in the app, that’s called Explore. And here we present interesting services and new services that’s suitable for this particular user. And then in that way, we can offer our relying parties to connect with our users. So it becomes more of a relation where if you are searching for something and you want to have a trusted connection to that company, we can offer… well, I wouldn’t say that we would offer a search engine, but in the same way, as Google can add value by connecting an end user with a service, we can do the same thing here. And on top of that, we can actually add the KYC process and everything.</p>
<p>So let’s say you’re applying for a loan, you find within Freja that, oh, here’s the different financial companies that’s connected to Freja. And they have an offer that suits you, you can click on that. And then you can pass along your regulatory KYC, or a lot of the KYC and identity data and become a customer in a click. And that’s something that Google cannot do. And that’s something that Facebook and others cannot do either. So we kind of shortcut this user acquisition, user journey by adding KYC and having users explore and discover services via Freja eID rather than from other sources.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, and that sounds definitely very powerful. Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Kristofer: So that’s kind of what we’re developing in this moment right now. And then, when the time comes, and when we have built the strongholds here in Sweden, we’re looking to take this outside of Sweden. We were, as I mentioned, you know, pre-approved in the EU a couple of weeks ago, we’re looking at what’s happening in the UK with their certification process for electronic identities. So Europe is – it’s a big market, and that’s the next step. And we’re not really looking outside of that for now. But who knows what happens in the future?</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. So Freja eID is coming to the rest of Europe, at least for now.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yes, that’s our plan at some point. And I think it’s also a timing aspect of it. I mean, if you think about- I mean, here in Sweden, our challenge is to convince people that that OK, so there’s a new kid in town. They have BankID. But with Freja, you can have this and this and this and this, so… but you have an incumbent that you’re trying to challenge. So that’s a challenge of its own.</p>
<p>If you go to a country like the UK, where identity is something that’s perhaps a bit you know, they don’t have identity cards in the same way, they don’t have a personal identifier as we have in the Nordic countries. So, a totally different challenge to convince someone from England to start using an electronic identity everywhere and trust that. It’s totally different challenges. I think the analogy with streaming music a lot. Spotify was obviously also a Swedish company. And it took a while for them to convince the world that streaming music was better than alternatives. And there are still people don’t think, they’d find the records on CD or pay by song or whatever is a better solution. But I think streaming music, and that’s pretty obvious maybe. But a few years ago, it wasn’t that obvious that streaming music would be the answer to that particular industry challenge.</p>
<p>And I think it’s also pretty obvious to see, at least if you look in the Nordic countries, an electronic identity of the sort that we have here in the Nordics, I think that would be the norm in the rest of the world. But that will take time. It will take time before this spreads and you have to fit all the – before even countries have frameworks that you can get compliance against, it will take time. So I don’t really feel the stress in that regard. I think time is on our side in this case.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, but I’m sure that you will come definitely. Kristofer, to finalise, could you leave us with one idea for all business leaders who are listening to this conversation, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yeah. And that would be to see identity as a core asset. And if you leave that asset in the hands of the banks, or if you leave that asset in the hands of checkout companies, or anyone else that controls your main relation to your users, I think you will have a brutal wake up down the line. And there are not many providers of this open solution that Freja is, but I think that is the future because users do want to control their identities. And they can do it in a direct relation with your company. And I think you will benefit from that on the long-term, even if it’s perhaps easier in the short-term to take the solutions available today. But then you lock yourself into something that will be very difficult to get out of in the long run.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Kristofer, could you tell us for the ones who like to follow the conversation with you, what are the best way to find you on the net?</p>
<p>Kristofer: First of all, if you have any direct questions, you can write to info@frejaeid.com and I’ll respond to that email address. And you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/kvonbeetzen">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristofervonbeetzen/">LinkedIn</a>, search my name Kristofer von Beetzen and hopefully I’ll pop up in that search and just connect and I’ll be happy to continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Thanks a lot. Again, it was a pleasure talking with you, Kristofer. And all the best.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Thank you so much.</p>

<p>“A Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with One Step” — Lao Tzu, a renowned Chinese philosopher.</p><p>Every long journey begins with the first step, and we at Affinidi, welcome you to take this first step in the journey towards becoming an accomplished <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign identity (SSI)</a> developer.</p><p>While every individual’s journey is unique, we have put together a series of steps that can make your journey fulfilling.</p> Learn the Concepts and Benefits of&nbsp;SSI <p>The first step is to understand the concepts of SSI and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, so you can know their benefits, where they can be most effective, and how they can impact the future of digital identity.</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/">Browse</a> through our 101 articles and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">FAQs</a> to get a good grasp of the concepts.</p> Identify Use-cases <p>Once you understand the concepts, you can identify the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">business use-cases</a> that are most conducive for <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a> and work on developing them.</p><p>The good news is VCs can be used for developing a wide range of use-cases. In fact, any application that requires a digital identity and authentication is a good fit for SSI. Here are some <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">PoCs</a> that our Hackathon participants developed using our tech&nbsp;stack.</p> Compute the Cost of Development <p>The next step is to estimate the overall cost of development.</p><p>To do this, you must come up with a high-level technical architecture of your solution, so you can determine the resources you’ll need for its development, and also estimate the duration by which it will be ready. Based on these estimates, determine the overall cost of development.</p><p>Armed with the technical architecture and budget, you can convince the stakeholders to buy into your use&nbsp;case.</p> Expand your Architecture Diagram <p>Once you have the buy-in, it’s time to work towards developing a pilot solution.</p><p>Start with your architecture and build on it. Break it down into small modules and create architecture diagrams for each&nbsp;module.</p><p>Also, design the business flow for your system, so there’s high-level visibility into your system’s architecture and functionality.</p> Build a VC&nbsp;Schema <p>Next, come up with the different types of VC schemas your application would&nbsp;need.</p><p>Browse through our <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-vc-generator-app-and-how-to-leverage-it-4fa5a54844f2">VC-Generator app</a> to get an idea of what schemas you’ll need for your application and make a list accordingly.</p><p>Once you have the list, it’s time to build the different VC schemas using our <a href="https://ui.schema.affinidi.com/schemas">Schema Manager</a>. You can use the Schema Manager to build new schemas or to reuse the existing&nbsp;ones.</p> Seed Verifiable Data <p>With the schemas in place, it’s time to start seeding the schemas with verifiable data.</p><p>You can seed the digital identity of the issuers and verifiers to anchor them and give control of their respective <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. Next, generate the metadata of both the parties of the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a> and establish the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public key</a> of the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Build the Issuance&nbsp;Tool <p>Now, it’s time to build the issuance tool based on the type of issuances in your proposed application.</p><p>The type of issuance will depend to a large extent on whether you are building a generic portal, an on-prem app, API, or a plugin for an existing&nbsp;tool.</p> Build or Integrate the Edge Agent and&nbsp;Storage <p>Your next step is to build or integrate both the edge agent and the&nbsp;storage.</p><p>The edge agent can be a white-label web or mobile wallet that your end customer already uses. For new users, consider/recommend Affinidi’s web and mobile wallet as it can be easily integrated with the rest of your application.</p><p>You can use the Affinidi vault for&nbsp;storage.</p> Create the Verification Tool <p>With the credentials ready, you need a way to verify&nbsp;them.</p><p>For this, build a verification tool using a generic portal, a gateway API, or an SDK, as required.</p> Build the UI for Presentation and&nbsp;Exchange <p>Next, create a visually appealing and intuitive UI for information exchange.</p><p>If you’re using an API for verification, you may want to create an API for this presentation exchange.</p><p>In both cases, you may want to create a protocol for verifiers to request a verifiable presentation or a partial VC (in the case of selective disclosure) from the&nbsp;holder.</p> Create the Issuer/Verifier Registry <p>Finally, build a verifier or issuer registry along with tools to edit&nbsp;them.</p><p>As a part of this tool, you must generate an entity VC, which is a VC that authorizes an issuer to issue certain types of VCs. You can also work on publishing the metadata in this&nbsp;stage.</p><p>With this, you have built a pilot solution for your SSI application.</p> Do a Test&nbsp;Run <p>It’s now time to do a test run of your application. Make sure your application issues VCs and stores them in the holder’s wallet. It should also enable the holder to create a verifiable presentation and share it with a verifier when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Collect and analyze the report of your test runs and present them to the stakeholders involved.</p><p>Based on the reports and test runs, make the necessary changes to your application to ensure that it meets your business goals. Test the application iteratively to ensure that it works the way you&nbsp;want.</p> Deploy in Production <p>After making the necessary changes, deploy it in production. Add <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">VC revocation</a> capabilities if you have not done it&nbsp;already.</p> Maintain and&nbsp;Scale <p>Lastly, stay on top of the usage analytics and create a commercial model that will generate revenue for you. Continuously monitor user behavior and make the necessary updates to your&nbsp;product.</p><p>Once you have scaled the application, think about opening the ecosystem and creating a marketplace around&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thus, this is the journey of an SSI developer using Affinidi’s <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api">tech&nbsp;stack</a>.</p> Example Use&nbsp;Case <p>To understand this journey, let’s take our <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">driving license</a>&nbsp;example.</p><p>To build an app that issues, stores, and verifies the driving license verifiable credential, you&nbsp;must,</p>  Know the concepts of VCs and the advantages of building a VC-based application.  Identify a use-case. For example, you can integrate this driver’s license VC with an auto insurance app to determine the yearly premium of the&nbsp;holder.  Calculate the cost of development including the time and resources required.  Create an architecture diagram of the implementation and include its integration with the wider use-case, which in this example, can be the premium computation app.  <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">This article</a> contains the technical implementation using Affinidi’s tech&nbsp;stack.  Next, build the UI for presentation, create a registry, and do a test&nbsp;run.  Based on the test results, make changes if needed, and deploy it in production.  <p>We hope this use-case gives you an idea of the developer journey and where you are in it, and we look forward to seeing your SSI apps built using our tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Please reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> if you have any questions, <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>.</p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

<p>I am saddened today to learn that MX co-founder and CTO Brandon Dewitt passed away after a five-year battle with cancer. I’ve always enjoyed competing in the marketplace, but I’ve enjoyed the people much more. At Finicity, we have known Brandon for a long time. We enjoyed talking with him about his unique entrepreneurial ideas and passion for helping others through financial inclusion.</p>
<p>His role as a member of the Silicon Slopes community and his impact, not only on MX but on emerging founders and startups, truly shows how much he cared about others. He was well-known for his love of the MX team and their goals and dreams. Brandon clearly demonstrated a desire to help people easily understand and manage their finances so they could meet their goals and focus on the important things in life. We also now see that he modeled perseverance, determination and an example of helping others all while he was in his own major battle.</p>
<p>As he said,<a href="https://www.utahbusiness.com/how-brandon-dewitt-co-founded-mx/"> “I feel it’s crucial that those in a position of experience and success turn around and pay it forward to those who are just starting out―just like we all once were.”</a></p>
<p>We are genuinely sorry for the loss. Our heartfelt condolences and prayers go out to his family, friends and everyone at MX in this time of grief.</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, MX has asked that people donate to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. For donations made in Brandon’s name, MX will be matching all donations dollar-for-dollar. To donate, visit<a href="https://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR;jsessionid=00000000.app20127b?px=7297493&amp;fr_id=39300&amp;pg=personal&amp;NONCE_TOKEN=33A7691BF3F8EE14B4F182CA33902E90"> Gift Funds: Brandon Dewitt – Gift Funds for St. Jude</a>.</p>

				  Indicio CTO regarded for vision and leadership in developing interoperable blockchain-based Trusted Data Ecosystems  
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE — November 16, 2021 — Indicio, the world’s leading provider of decentralized identity and hosting solutions is pleased to announce that company Chief Technology Officer Ken Ebert has been named winner in the Blockchain Leadership Award category in the Enterprise Blockchain Awards (EBAs) presented by the Blockchain Research Institute. Ebert was recognized for his long-lasting vision for open-source identity technology anchored on a blockchain network to solve some of our most pressing online problems — verification, privacy, security, and user experience.<br></p>
<p>Ebert is one of the co-founders of Indicio.tech and a pivotal force in nurturing the company from its launch at the start of the COVID pandemic to its position today as the <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-are-coming-to-card-payment-rails/">global leader</a> in developing decentralized identity infrastructure and software for building Trusted Data Ecosystems. He built a virtual team of highly-skilled developers that is diverse in gender and nationality, and he developed an intern and mentoring program to create the needed skills in new recruits as the company took on more and more customers’ projects.</p>
<p>With Ebert’s team-focused leadership, Indicio was able to <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/island-of-aruba-trials-open-source-sita-covid-health-credential-solution/">successfully create and deploy</a> a complete decentralized identity based data ecosystem, weaving together health agencies, global technology suppliers in the travel industry, and national governments. The company’s continuing success reflects on Ebert’s extraordinary ability to bring parties together and drive ideas and projects forward into workable technology that solves real-world problems. And, as a passionate advocate for interoperability in the open-source identity communities, Ebert isn’t just driving Indicio’s success, he’s helping to drive the adoption and evolution of blockchain technologies that promise transformative change and opportunity for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Indicio’s success and its position as a global leader in the development of Trusted Data Ecosystems is a testimony to Ken’s seemingly boundless skill and wisdom. It’s not just his ability to analyze and clarify problems and guide our own team, it’s his tireless capacity to do so for all the companies who support the Indicio Network as well as our customers,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “That’s what makes him an outstanding leader. Part of that comes from character; part from experience; but a part of it is also a philosophy of ‘build now, build more, build better.’&nbsp; When you think about the problems we’re trying to solve, they’re huge. Ken is always the one to remind us — and our collaborators and customers—that we build solutions step by step. Let’s solve this bit first. And when you do this, and do it relentlessly, you’ll feel like you’re running, and you can achieve anything.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I want to thank BRI for its dedication to helping enterprise leaders understand and implement blockchain within their industries. This is a technology that has enormous potential to rewrite the way we do so many things in business and society,” said Ebert. “It’s exciting to be the CTO of a company that is driving that transformation through the Indicio Network—a distributed blockchain for identity—and through designing solutions that give people the ability to prove identity and share data in a way that preserves their privacy, in a way that improves their security, and, above all, in a way that can be trusted. All this would be impossible without blockchain. I’m honored to be a finalist for this award; but I’m more excited by what we—Indicio, our clients, the identity community—can do for the world with this technology. That’s the excitement that greets me every day — and I want to share it with everyone.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Blockchain Leadership awards honor people who have shown exceptional leadership in a blockchain collaboration or implementation within an enterprise, an industry, a government, or a multi stakeholder organization. The nominees are those that have gone above and beyond the job description to spearhead blockchain initiatives within an enterprise or ecosystem.</p>

 GiD Report#186 — What is&nbsp;web3? <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/market-stuff-185-what-the-future-of-identity-looks-like-c96c62550db3">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  What is&nbsp;web3?  This week in&nbsp;web2  The problem with inflation  Stuff happens   1. What is&nbsp;web3? <p>You’ve likely seen the term web3 or Web 3.0 bandied about lately. There’s plenty of chatter about the next chapter of the internet, but what exactly is&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezH_7qEk50">Chris Dixon on&nbsp;web1</a>:</p><blockquote>The internet, I think, has kind of had four important, distinct phases. There was web1 — this explosion of stuff in the nineties — and the key feature there was that it was governed by open protocols, and because they were open protocols, Sergei and Larry and other entrepreneurs — all the main names, Pierre Omidyar’s eBay, Google, Amazon — they could build internet services that they would truly own and control that no one could rug pull them the way you get rug pulled on a platform like the iPhone or on Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>That first wave, those applications were what I call skeuomorphic. They took things that were from the offline world, like magazines, and put them on the internet. It’s a lot of websites where we were just reading&nbsp;stuff.</blockquote><p>Then came&nbsp;web2:</p><blockquote>Then there was this next period of the 2000s, where a new wave of entrepreneurs came along and they said, wait a second. No, these are computers. You can read and write and put code and do all sorts of other things. During this early phase, you had — you probably never heard of them — things like Flickr and Delicious and the whole six degrees early social networking — people were building the early primitives and the early ideas. Then you had Mark Zuckerburg and Ev Williams and Jack Dorsey and other people take those and package them up really beautifully. And boom, that was web2. Then web2 got accelerated by mobile, which was another layer of interesting stuff that happened on&nbsp;top.</blockquote><p>Web2 peaking and consolidating — and transitioning to&nbsp;web3:</p>Web2 is like TV in the 70s according to Chris Dixon. Photo:&nbsp;asbe<blockquote>Then we had a period of incumbent domination between 2012 and 2020 with Apple and Google, etc. These companies get bigger and bigger, and the internet is now at a precarious point where it could turn into TV where you have four channels like CBS and NBC — like TV in the&nbsp;70s.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s the great cause that we’re all fighting for here — to keep the internet open and interesting and not like that. But then you had this counter-trend that began to develop, obviously originally with Satishi, and then very importantly with Vitalik and Ethereum. That’s led to this explosion of innovation.</blockquote><blockquote>“These companies get bigger and bigger, and the internet is now at a precarious point where it could turn into TV where you have four channels like CBS and NBC — like TV in the&nbsp;70s.”</blockquote><p>The beginning of&nbsp;web3:</p><blockquote>I think we could be in that moment, that golden period moment that I remember very much in mobile. I was there — we knew mobile was a big deal, but it’s very hard to know when you’re in the process. Is it linear, exponential? Because you’re sitting on one point, and you don’t really know how fast it’s&nbsp;going.</blockquote><blockquote>A big part is having credibly neutral platforms upon which to build. If you build an application on top of Ethereum — whether it be a game or an NFT experience or a DeFi protocol — you do not have to worry about the protocol deciding to kick you off later or charge you 30% of your take rate or whatever. So you can invest and spend your life as an entrepreneur betting on that platform and building around it in the same way as in web1 — you knew that you could do that around HTTP and&nbsp;SMTP.</blockquote><blockquote>The inherent problems of&nbsp;web2:</blockquote><blockquote>A very formative moment in my experience — I don’t know if you were both in tech then — was the Facebook/Twitter API massacre. Essentially, there was this huge wave of people that built startups on Facebook and Twitter and they were all just summarily shut off. I had a lot of friends who had startups that were built on the Twitter API. Twitter was an ecosystem. It was a developer platform for many years. Yes, it had users using it directly, but it actually didn’t even have an app for a long time. It was all third-party apps, and those were all companies, and there were people who’d spent their lives on it. I don’t blame Twitter. I’m friends with a lot of these people at these web2 companies. I don’t think they have ill intent. I think the problem is the&nbsp;model.</blockquote><blockquote>Like I like to say, in web3, it’s “can’t be evil.” In web2, it’s “don’t be evil.” So with web2, you’re depending on the good intentions of the founders and part of its architecture. You don’t have a blockchain; you don’t have code that locks them into it. If you build on Ethereum, the code is locking you into certain commitments. If you build a smart contract, it’s there — it’s immutable like everything else. Maybe if you’re an ultra-founder, Jack Dorsey or something, you can resist this, but for almost everybody else, you ultimately report to shareholders and those shareholders want you to maximize profits. That, I believe, is fundamentally inconsistent with maximizing the health of the networks built on&nbsp;top.</blockquote><blockquote>I think that corporations and networks are fundamentally misaligned. A corporation is going to want to grab more and more of the money and close off the network when what the people in the network want is openness and low take rates and open permissionless access. Those two things are fundamentally misaligned in the last 10 years. We’ve seen how that misalignment playsout. A lot of the reason people are unhappy on these networks is that they feel this viscerally.</blockquote><blockquote>A lot of these creators who were early to build YouTube up are now at the whims of the algorithm, at the whims of the company. The company gets to monetize, get the take rates changed, and the creators feel that viscerally. They were part of this network creation, and they should have been part of the governance and economics of the&nbsp;network.</blockquote><blockquote>But they&nbsp;aren’t.</blockquote><p>Check out Dixon’s full chat — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezH_7qEk50">5 Mental Models for Web&nbsp;3.0</a>.</p><p>Or an edited, truncated version (16 min.) from GEOPOP — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DYjN6nZFU0">What is Web&nbsp;3.0?</a></p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezH_7qEk50&amp;amp;t=0s">90–5 Mental Models for Web3 | Chris&nbsp;Dixon</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DYjN6nZFU0">What is Web 3.0? | Chris&nbsp;Dixon</a>  <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/11/how-nfts-create-value">How NFTs Create&nbsp;Value</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/microsofts-blockchain-director-major-brands-embracing-nfts-will-drive-mainstream-adoption/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Microsoft’s Blockchain Director: Major Brands Embracing NFTs Will Drive Mainstream Adoption — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/microsoft-and-the-metaverse/">Microsoft and the Metaverse</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/reddit-co-founder-solana-ventures-launch-50m-fund-for-web3-social-media/">Reddit Co-Founder, Solana Ventures Launch $100M Initiative for Web 3 Social&nbsp;Media</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/the-world-s-largest-record-company-is-creating-an-nft-super-group">The World’s Largest Record Company Is Creating an NFT Super&nbsp;Group</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a> — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/123572/coinbase-launches-its-wallet-as-a-standalone-browser-extension">Coinbase launches its wallet as a standalone browser extension</a>   2.

The problem with inflation <p>The other topic that’s getting plenty of chatter is inflation. Is it transitory, having shocked out supply chains after the pandemic shut down the economy? Or is it our comeuppance for printing so much money since&nbsp;2008?</p><p>We’ve seen asset values — from real estate to equities to crypto — explode in price in a period of extremely easy money. Rising inflation will put a quick end to that story. With the Fed planning beginning to taper its buying program and looking to raise rates multiple times next year, the pendulum is starting to swing the other&nbsp;way.</p><p>(And just how much DeFi-fueled leverage is in the crypto space when a big correction comes?)</p><p>Anyway, we’re not here to make predictions. Instead, we have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inflation-wealth-ray-dalio/">Ray Dalio break down the fundamentals inflation, wealth, and power</a> (in the context of big&nbsp;cycles):</p><blockquote>Yesterday’s inflation report showed inflation raging so you are now seeing inflation erode your wealth. That is no surprise. At this time 1) the government is printing a lot more money, 2) people are getting a lot more money, and 3) that is producing a lot more buying that is producing a lot more inflation. Some people make the mistake of thinking that they are getting richer because they are seeing their assets go up in price without seeing how their buying power is being eroded. The ones most hurt are those who have their money in&nbsp;cash.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Here are the key principles to keep in&nbsp;mind:</blockquote><blockquote>Wealth = Buying&nbsp;Power</blockquote><blockquote>Wealth ≠ Financial Wealth</blockquote><blockquote>Making Wealth = Being Productive</blockquote><blockquote>Wealth Decline = Power&nbsp;Decline</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The United States now is spending a lot more money than it’s earning and paying for it by printing money that is being devalued. To improve we have to raise productivity and cooperation. Right now we are on the wrong&nbsp;path.</blockquote><p>Check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inflation-wealth-ray-dalio/">his full post&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/dollar-climbs-us-inflation-surge-fuels-rate-hike-speculation-2021-11-10/">Dollar climbs as U.S. inflation surge fuels rate hike speculation</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/the-first-fed-rate-hike-is-now-expected-as-early-as-july-following-the-hot-cpi-data.html">The first Fed rate hike is now expected as early as July following the hot CPI&nbsp;data</a>  Ray Dalio: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inflation-wealth-ray-dalio/">On Inflation and&nbsp;Wealth</a>  An extra surreal Money Stuff: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-09/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-doing-fraud-on-securities-fraud">Doing Fraud on Securities Fraud</a>  <a href="https://civicscience.com/crypto-is-creating-newfound-wealth-and-job-freedom-for-many-americans/">Crypto is Creating Newfound Wealth — and Job Freedom — for Many Americans — CivicScience</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/11/miami-to-give-bitcoin-yield-from-miamicoin-to-its-citizens/">Miami to Give ‘Bitcoin Yield’ From MiamiCoin to Its&nbsp;Citizens</a>  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-mayor-elect-wants-kids-to-learn-crypto-in-school-2021-11">New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams says schools should teach about cryptocurrency</a>   4.

Choosing the best workforce SSO solution depends on your IT environment and user base. Some SSO solutions control authentication for users accessing resources from desktops in a single security domain. Others provide universal SSO across complex hybrid environments that include legacy on-premises, cloud-based and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. There are also SSO solutions capable of acting as an authentication authority across multiple identity types and broad use cases from cloud to on-premises. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

 Shyft Network Core Team Open Sources Veriscope, prepares to enable cross solution discovery to Make Travel Rule Compliance Open, Free, and Simpler than&nbsp;Ever  Following the FATF’s latest regulatory guidance, we’re making our decentralized compliance framework including dashboards, admin tooling, and Shyft Attestation architecture completely free and available for anyone to&nbsp;use. <p>In August, <a href="https://shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> announced <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, the first public utility and application stack for solving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) travel rule. <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf">In collaboration with some of the world’s top cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Deribit, Bitfinex, BitMEX, Tether, and Huobi</a>, Veriscope provides a decentralized compliance web framework and a smart contract platform for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to enable travel rule compliance. Veriscope meets the growing demands of the rising regulatory efforts that have commanded attention and action across cryptocurrency, DeFi, NFTs, stablecoins, and many other elements of blockchain.</p><p>Now, two months later, following exchanges collectively initiating the phased deployment of Veriscope on the Shyft Network, we’re proud to share that we will be open-sourcing Veriscope. This deployment makes Veriscope available for free, so that any project can connect to the Veriscope Network and the Shyft Attestation architecture.</p><blockquote>See Open Source Repo equipped with dashboard’s and setup guides here: <a href="https://github.com/shyftnetwork/veriscope">https://github.com/shyftnetwork/veriscope</a></blockquote><blockquote>Screenshot demo’s for the Front end web framework can be found here: <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/vasp-demo/">https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/vasp-demo/</a></blockquote><p>As early adopters of crypto, we at Shyft Core believe that it’s essential that the sector maintains openness. We also believe that compliance should not have to force the ecosystem to rebuild the existing financial system &amp; risk user safety. To maintain decentralization, we need to promote open-source software to solve new regulatory challenges. Veriscope is that solution — and it’s ready for the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Shyft Network acts as layer 0 to travel rule aggregators, protocols, and data transmission services &amp; the Veriscope framework provides an open system for anyone to leverage to enhance security guarantees, universalize the discovery and coordination processes required for cross entity data transmission, and dashboards to manage all travel rule&nbsp;data.</p><p>We built this system to ensure that any entity can maintain the highest level of data security, while also enabling automated discovery across any crypto transactions.</p> FATF: Explained <p>In February of 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released guidance designed to mitigate risks around virtual assets. In section 7B of the guidance, the FATF recommends the application of the Travel Rule to virtual assets. This rule requires Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), such as cryptocurrency exchanges, custodial wallets, and OTC desks to share sender and receiver information ahead of processing inter-VASP transactions on behalf of&nbsp;users.</p><p>FATF helps address Anti-Money Laundering (AML), a set of policies and guidelines laid out in every country’s framework to fight black money and counter terrorist financing.</p><p>As a result, it promotes KYC (Know Your Customer), a tool that acts as the first line of defense to support AML. In its most general sense, KYC is a questionnaire wherein the customer is asked certain questions and required to share personal data which is used for identification and verification purposes. Data commonly shared includes: name, address, and employment details,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Suppose you’re a business, crypto exchange, governmental body, or consumer who engages with crypto or the exchange of virtual assets. In that case, it’s critical you know and understand the FATF Travel Rule — and the nuances of compliance, so that KYC can be upheld. Recent FATF guidance from back in March requires those who shepherd the transfer of assets, including cryptocurrency, to share data from senders and receivers. FATF deems these exchanges as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). Shyft Network is the first platform to create technology (Veriscope) that enables VASPs to seamlessly comply with FATF rules, partnering with ten of the top crypto exchanges to implement an industry-wide solution using our database bridging and data attestation infrastructure.</p> Why Is an Open Source Veriscope So Important? <p>Following <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html">FATF’s guidance in March of 2021</a>, the Versicope governance team participated in a consultation where we <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-day-the-veriscope-secretariat-responded-to-the-fatf-ab37957746b3">provided comments</a> to their proposed guidance, a decision we made because we understand the value and opportunity we have to act as a bridge between governing bodies like FATF and crypto at large. FATF released their <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/28/fatf-crypto-guidance-looks-to-bring-industry-in-line-with-banks/">latest guidance</a> on October 28, 2021, an eagerly-awaited moment that we shared feedback on in <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1453743155505991686">a Twitter thread</a> and will create regulatory situations that open-sourcing Veriscope will help&nbsp;solve.</p><p>From the definition of stablecoins to whether NFTs are VA (Virtual Assets) and therefore subject to regulation, FATF’s guidance will inevitably impact how users of the blockchain ecosystem will function moving forward, especially when considering the nuances of how we define different sectors and their function. Veriscope gives businesses and users the infrastructure to keep up with changes and optimize their actions, regardless of the size of their operation.</p><p>Open source Veriscope allows VASPs large and small to utilize its infrastructure to onboard, write, send and receive regulatory data sets over Shyft Network. This update allows for unlimited extensions, such as third-party tools and apps, into the system, including monitoring and analytical tools with aggregation to be embedded and utilizable. Veriscope’s infrastructure can also be repurposed and extended by any other teams who would like to use it for their internal dashboarding requirements — and they will be able to do this quickly; admin tools and setup scripts make implementation possible in less than a&nbsp;day.</p><p>Taking an open-source approach to building a solution for FATF is essential if we’re to ensure that we don’t gate keep systems that should remain inherently open for everyone. Shyft Network took the dated approach of many closed source companies and flipped the script (and code) to provide front ends and web frameworks for free to anyone who wants to use them. This architecture allows people to specifically implement aggregation services for the Travel Rule and enable entirely new systems to be built using the Shyft Core attestation architecture and discovery layer.</p><p>This is only the beginning of a much larger set of products and services that will span other verticals across the industry utilizing this open source infrastructure and framework.</p><p>By open sourcing Versicope, Shyft Network is democratizing Travel Rule compliance for a varied set of businesses, exchanges, technologies, and their communities. We know that together crypto is stronger and that if mainstream adoption of blockchain is to become reality, we must evolve so that institutions, exchanges, and individuals can function together and comply with any incoming regulation.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner. Shift Network allows and gives incentives to individuals and enterprises to work together to add context to data, unlocking the ability to build authentic digital reputation, identity, and credibility frameworks.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">Medium</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">Discord</a></p>

<p>A softer, gentler DAO that gives more space and freedom for experimentation</p> 1. Overview <p>OceanDAO’s social layer is getting developed further, as part of a broader shift to embrace and leverage the growing number of participants inside the Ocean Ecosystem. Specifically: we are introducing OceanDAO Working Groups (WGs)&nbsp;[1].</p><p>Each WG has stewards (who’s accountable to run the group), and members (people who participate). This organizational and coordination structure is inspired <a href="https://tecommons.org/">by the Token Engineering Commons&nbsp;(TEC)</a>.</p><p>Here are the initial WGs, and their initial stewards.</p>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CGqLJgWKwzDlZFgA7FPmkyRaZHmorutMv-GaSroMSPw/edit?usp=sharing">Parameters &amp; Roadmap WG</a> — [Roberto, Trent]  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kw4UwJHZaCf5PKvU3ONoN5nSj-r5zZAX2KJCqzJFT7M/edit?usp=sharing">Project-Guiding WG</a> — [Razvan,&nbsp;AlexN]  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ouW4oxKEgyaBeiZew4bd9HFwbNUiwReK0A2Ww7jmAik/edit?usp=sharing">Core Tech WG</a> — [Trent,&nbsp;AlexC]  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lV3XPqFlReB89c0cvPfbXENE2NE_-8ppQnSQxSy0ITk/edit?usp=sharing">OceanDAO Engineering WG</a> — [Roberto]  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oVtu31GcqzEWx3teHOfXIYDZN0tjuciyhtvUWzq91Xk/edit?usp=sharing">Data Consume Volume WG</a> — [Sheridan, Razvan]  <p>The Parameters &amp; Roadmap WG focuses on immediate and macro level discussions that may cover all other WGs. Most stewards should be in attendance of this WG, and we welcome everyone to&nbsp;join.</p><p>Basic WG organization:</p>  Every WG will discuss and meet openly <a href="https://discord.gg/bYEEwsnC">inside of our&nbsp;Discord</a>.  Each WG has 2 public Discord sub-channels: WG Channel, WG Voice Channel (and&nbsp;video)  Each group has its own onboarding process. It’s up to the WG to&nbsp;decide.  Each group has a 30 or 60 min call, typically weekly.  Meetings will be recorded and shared&nbsp;async.  <p>We expect more WGs to emerge over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Details on each WG can be found&nbsp;below.</p> 2. “Value Add” Rather than “ROI &gt;&nbsp;1” <p>OceanDAO’s emphasis on ROI &gt; 1 was a useful construct from a purely mechanical perspective. But in practice it focused too much on a stark, objective ROI number that could be very hard to measure. How do you measure ROI for improving documentation? Yet there is value being created. Projects shouldn’t need a business orientation.</p><p>So we have shifted OceanDAO focus away from “ROI &gt; 1”, and towards “value add” with a larger emphasis on community. It’s a softer, gentler DAO that gives more space and freedom for experimentation.</p><p>To reflect this shift, here is an updated criteria for projects around “value add” and community.</p><p>Project Criteria</p><p>Ways that a team might add&nbsp;value:</p>  Usage of Ocean — how well might the project drive usage of&nbsp;Ocean?  Viability — what is the chance of success of the&nbsp;project?  Community active-ness — how active is the team in the community?  Adding value to the overall community — how well does the outcome of the project add value to the Ocean community / ecosystem?  <p>This is a short list, on purpose. It balances tech &amp; viability, with community.</p> 3. Details on Each&nbsp;WG  3.1 Parameters &amp; Roadmap&nbsp;WG <p>Mission: Decide each funding round’s parameters (short term), and update <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18CL5YTJ2-WLQPwq755omqw1AF9ekW1DP_RHyf3V3IHw/edit#slide=id.ge7dbc14a25_0_0">roadmap</a> (med term). Overall, to improve the funding process for projects getting funding from OceanDAO.</p><p>Criteria include “feeling of safety” for teams, promoting community, and more. (Details&nbsp;below)</p><p>Stewards: Roberto Alcantara, Trent McConaghy</p><p>Meetings: Tuesdays 10.00 ET, 16.00 CET, 17.00 EET (60&nbsp;min)</p><p>Criteria on this WG’s Decision-Making</p>  Promote “feeling of safety” for&nbsp;teams  Promote community  Increase # voters, and quality of voter decision-making  Increase # projects, and value-add of projects (ref project criteria)  Increase OceanDAO (including WGs) transparency, visibility, openness  Identify ways for OceanDAO to scale&nbsp;further   3.2 Project-Guiding WG <p>Mission: To help guide OceanDAO grant proposers and recipients to add value via: discussions, project assessments, ways to leverage the network, and candid feedback. In turn, we hope that a decentralized review and guidance process may lead to many teams that are more effective, as a key part of growing the Ocean ecosystem. The project-guiding WG should help promote a “feeling of safety” for teams. Not gatekeepers.</p><p>Stewards: Razvan Olteanu, Alex&nbsp;Napheys</p><p>Meetings: Mondays 10.00 ET, 16.00 CET, 17.00&nbsp;EET</p><p>(plus meetings with individual teams by members of&nbsp;WG)</p> 3.3 Core Tech&nbsp;WG <p>Mission: Steward community initiatives towards high-impact technical outcomes. Near-term mandate: for each grants round, provide 3–10 target tech projects for “earmarks”.</p><p>Stewards: Trent McConaghy, Alex&nbsp;Coseru</p><p>Meetings: Tuesdays 15.30 CET, 16.30&nbsp;EET</p><p>Responsibilities of Group: Document tech opportunities to improve Ocean product ecosystem, which can be readily done outside OPF core team. These can be improvements to core tech, integrations, or potentially apps on top. Turn top-ranking ones into earmarks and&nbsp;more.</p> 3.4 OceanDAO Engineering WG <p>Mission: To align internal and external contributors, and improve overall technical output towards OceanDAO Engineering roadmap deliverables. To help identify opportunities and solutions that deliver an efficient DAO-stack across all verticals (grants execution, funding, voting, delegation, UX, treasury management, working groups,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>Stewards: Roberto Alcantara</p><p>Meetings</p>  Every Mon, Wed, Thurs 15:45 CET, 16:45 EET (15&nbsp;min)  Every Tue 17.00 CET, 18.00 EET (60&nbsp;min)   3.5 Data Consume Volume&nbsp;WG <p>Mission: To define best practices, build processes, and increase alignment across all participants within the Ocean Ecosystem towards Data Set supply, liquidity, and most importantly Data Consume&nbsp;Volume.</p><p>Stewards: Razvan Olteanu, Sheridan&nbsp;Johns</p><p>Meetings: Every 2nd Mon 11.00 ET, 17.00 CET, 18.00 EET. First mtg is Nov 22,&nbsp;2021.</p> 4. Town&nbsp;Halls <p>We are updating our Town Hall agenda to improve the UX of every participant, and coordination around every engagement inside OceanDAO.</p><p>We will be covering: Grants Program, WGs, Deep Dives, and Dockside.</p>  The Grants Program section will talk about where we are in the funding process, provide visibility into the program, and celebrate each step of the&nbsp;way.  The WG section will have each steward present 1–3 slides that cover what each WG is up&nbsp;to.  Deep Dive will be presented by both Core &amp; DAO contributors, taking us further into their journeys and providing deep insights into their progress.  Dockside will be a period where we invite all Core &amp; DAO participants to share updates, talk about their projects, their proposals, and general updates behind their progress.  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UEpeOi4LHk_hEbm7yrAWC0q9wWohFbKU2rCGwj54pLk/edit#slide=id.gfa4c73f874_0_53">Here is the outline</a> for our <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/play/WUlTDtriFqNn3alnfNbDqpraJiDWUvUlm7V3SUKSFkwe08hjT3-w7i0CwPSBRWqg45xtBv5ZsAtb56L_.fFxbyj6qLm6ybmwn?startTime=1636559892000&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=fdkNA-6SQ5CYCVo8eKmBxw.1636993387014.e7a71f4cbba1c802e26211c688a6deb5&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=610">Nov 10, 2021 Town Hall zoom session</a> which we’ll be using into the future.

Looking&nbsp;Ahead <p>Our goal is to continue expanding DAO-first initiatives that facilitate coordination and outcomes towards key organizational pillars. Every WG is aligned with a pivotal mission that will help realize the goals of Ocean Protocol.</p><p>Working Groups have been developed around evergreen initiatives that will forever benefit from contributions. There are more WGs that are currently being considered, such as those that involve Outreach:</p>  Awareness &amp; Community  Grant Proposal &amp;&nbsp;Referral  Business Development  <p>We will continue to reflect on key organizational initiatives and how we can all benefit from increased transparency, coordination, and decentralization.</p> 6. Conclusion <p>This article introduces OceanDAO Working Groups (WGs). They are a development of OceanDAO’s social layer, as part of a broader shift to embrace and leverage the growing number of participants inside the Ocean Ecosystem.</p><p>We have shifted OceanDAO focus away from “ROI &gt; 1”, and towards “value add” with a larger emphasis on community. It’s a softer, gentler DAO that gives more space and freedom for experimentation.</p><p>There are WGs for guiding projects, parameters &amp; roadmap, engineering, and more. We invite you to join us on Discord, attend our meetings, and become a WG&nbsp;member!</p> 7.

Use Vault to lock funds for security, vesting, trusts, inheritance, and&nbsp;more.  ⏰ VerusID (NFT) Marketplace and Verus Vault activate on block 1,796,400 (expected on Monday, 29 November 2021). <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Update your wallets to v0.9.0</a> before the activation blockheight to ensure smooth staking, mining, and general operation.  🏆 Use VerusID (NFT) Marketplace to exchange VerusIDs publicly and privately.  🔒 Use Verus Vault to lock funds for security, vesting, trusts, inheritance, and&nbsp;more.  🏆 A Marketplace for&nbsp;Anything <p>VerusIDs are much more than a typical digital identity. And once you own one on the Verus blockchain or a compatible PBaaS blockchain, it’s yours forever, rent-free, fully under your control. Until the moment you decide to pass it&nbsp;on.</p><p>VerusIDs can be anything you want. They can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to you, or other VerusIDs they have authority or ownership of. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the VerusID&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Each VerusID on the Verus blockchain can even be used with Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS — currently on testnet) to launch a token or DeFi currency, and even an interoperable blockchain. These blockchains inherit all features as they are on the Verus blockchain.</p><p>VerusIDs can hold funds. They can be personal <a href="https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike">profiles</a>, corporate websites, or government portals. VerusIDs are much more than identities or today’s NFTs. They are owned assets of all kinds on the Verus blockchain. And now those assets can be exchanged easily.</p><p>With the VerusID Marketplace protocol, anyone is able to buy and sell VerusIDs. You can look for offers on any VerusID (buy or sell offers). If you like the best offer on your VerusID, or if someone likes an offer you made on theirs, the deal is made 100% peer-to-peer, decentralized on the blockchain, without any middleman or contract controller.</p><p>For total payment privacy, you can even pay or receive payment using private addresses and zero knowledge transactions based on the Zcash Sapling protocol.</p> Exchanging in&nbsp;Private <p>In addition to advertising worldwide on the blockchain to buy or sell VerusIDs, you can also make an exchange with the Marketplace without ever posting the offer on the blockchain until it is agreed and signed by all parties. Combine that with zero knowledge transactions, and it’s a great way to transact worldwide, escrow-free in&nbsp;private.</p><p>A powerful use case example: A business sells subscriptions for exclusive content. They make VerusIDs with contracts that give access to the exclusive content. They now create a transaction that would pay for the VerusID. They give the transaction to the buyer who then executes it. The buyer now owns the VerusID that gives access to the exclusive content.</p><p>Now imagine how you can do this for a VerusID that can be any kind of asset. A new way for everyone to engage in peer-to-peer, escrow-free commerce has&nbsp;arrived.</p> Five New&nbsp;APIs <p>VerusID Marketplace introduces five new RPC APIs and CLI commands for this major upgrade: makeoffer, takeoffer, getoffers, closeoffers and listopenoffers.</p>  makeoffer: define what you offer and for what. What you offer can be funds, VerusIDs, or when PBaaS goes live even other currencies. What you want in return can also be funds, VerusIDs or currencies. In exchange for what you offer, you also define what VerusID or how much you want for it and in what currency.  takeoffer: take a specific offer in exchange for its&nbsp;request.  getoffers: specify which VerusID or currency you want to see offers for or on offer, and it returns all offers (buy and sell) in all currencies, sorted by highest to lowest&nbsp;price.  closeoffers: close expired or unexpired offers which you opened with makeoffer.  listopenoffers: list all offers that you have opened with makeoffer.   🔒 Protect Your Funds with Verus&nbsp;Vault <p>The new mainnet upgrade enables a completely new level of security and safety for all your funds. Verus Vault allows you to lock any VerusID under your control, while still using its funds to actively stake and earn on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>When you lock a VerusID, its funds can not be spent anymore. All locking and unlocking are visible on the blockchain.</p> Two Lock Mechanisms <p>You can lock a VerusID in two different ways that cannot be circumvented by anyone, except the revocation and recovery authorities together.</p>  Locked and unlocked until number of blocks passed: funds can not be spent until a predetermined number of blocks have&nbsp;passed.  Locked and unlocked with a delay: funds can not be spent until an unlock has been requested + a predetermined number of blocks have&nbsp;passed   Powerful Use&nbsp;Cases   Safe staking: put funds to stake with on a VerusID. Use Vault to lock the identity with a delay of 10,080 blocks ( ~1 week). Now whenever someone gains access to the private keys of the locked VerusID, they have to unlock the identity in order to spend the funds. When someone makes an unlock request that isn’t you, you are warned. The intruder has to wait 10,080 blocks before he can spend the funds. If you have set up revocation and recovery authorities, you now have one week to safeguard your funds away from prying hands, back into your&nbsp;control.  Trusts: setting up a trust fund for your children. Give your child a time locked VerusID with funds on them. When he or she turns 18, the VerusID unlocks and the funds can be spent. Keep revocation and recovery authorities with yourself or a&nbsp;trustee.  Vesting period: when doing a currency or chain launch, development funds can be diverted to a locked VerusID. After two years the VerusID unlocks and the funds can only be spent with signatures of other developers. You can also spread the funds across multiple identities with different unlock&nbsp;periods.  <p>These are just a few examples on how the powerful Verus Vault can be used. VerusID can store any asset on the Verus network, including those bridged from other blockchains. When PBaaS is on mainnet, the first bridged asset is Ethereum.</p> ⏰ VerusID (NFT) Marketplace and Verus Vault activate on block 1,796,400 (expected on Monday, 29 November 2021). <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Update your wallets to v0.9.0</a> before the activation blockheight to ensure smooth staking, mining, and general operation.  🏆 Use VerusID (NFT) Marketplace to exchange VerusIDs publicly and privately.  🔒 Use Verus Vault to lock funds for security, vesting, trusts, inheritance, and&nbsp;more.  🔥 Visit <a href="https://verus.io">verus.io</a> for more information on&nbsp;Verus  <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-vault-verusid-nft-marketplace-mainnet-upgrade-7abb5092c81b">Verus Vault &amp; VerusID (NFT) Marketplace Mainnet Upgrade</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 &nbsp; SEC Shares Views on DeFi Risks, Regulation and Opportunities  
<p>On November 9th 2021, Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-defi-20211109"> offered views on the status of decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) regulation in an article published in The International Journal of Blockchain Law. While DeFi has the potential to optimise transaction speed, cost, and customization, the Commissioner argues that it mimics traditional financial services offerings and products. As such, DeFi is analogous to offerings and services already under the SEC’s jurisdiction. Therefore Crenshaw expects the ecosystem to face comparable challenges to traditional financial markets. According to Crenshaw:</p> 
  
  “Unless required, there will be projects that do not invest in compliance or adequate internal controls;  
  when the potential financial rewards are great enough, some individuals will victimize others, and the likelihood of this occurring tends to increase as the likelihood of getting caught and severity of potential sanctions decrease; and  
  absent mandatory disclosure requirements, information asymmetries will likely advantage rich investors and insiders at the expense of the smallest investors and those with the least access to information.”  
  
<p>The Commissioner remarks that DeFI projects lack standards on risk disclosure and provide too little information for investors to appropriately assess risk, and she cites this as a cause for reduced investor confidence and investor participation. In the long run, the Commissioner argues that regulatory frameworks facilitate flourishing markets. Those responsible for regulating these markets are the same authorities encountered in traditional finance including the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury and the SEC. At the time of the Commissioner's statement, however, no DeFi participants have registered with the SEC. The Commission aims to increase engagement with market participants and reminds that development teams can liaise with the<a href="https://www.sec.gov/finhub"> Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology</a> to clarify their regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Commissioner Crenshaw offered a stern warning: non-compliant projects face enforcement actions. For example, in 2021,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2021/33-10961.pd"> DeFi Money Market received a cease-and-desist order</a> as it offered and sold more than $30 million of securities in an unregistered offering while misleading investors on the project. Nonetheless, the SEC encourages innovators to reach out to discuss regulatory changes that can allow for DeFi innovations. As it stands, the Commissioner identified two problems that need to be addressed by the DeFi ecosystem to ensure markets are fair for all investors:</p> 
  
  Lack of transparency regarding the operational arrangements of DeFi projects: projects are often launched by professional investors which may influence the governance of the project. The statement claims that these are rarely disclosed in plain English and put retail investors at a disadvantage. More to the point, the Commissioner declared: “It is not reasonable to build a financial system that demands investors also be sophisticated interpreters of complex code.”  
  Like other blockchain-based projects, DeFi transactions are pseudonymous: although transactions are public and immutable, not knowing who is behind an address or transaction raises concerns of market manipulation. Indeed, trading volumes can be inflated by one entity transacting with itself. This hinders the ability of investors to obtain reliable information before making a decision. The Commission highlights that in traditional financial markets investors have agreed to give up some degree of privacy to benefit from regulated markets with less manipulation and fraud. The SEC expects that DeFI projects which overcome the pseudonymity hurdle are more likely to succeed.  
  
<p>The statement concludes that some DeFi projects already fit in the SEC’s jurisdiction. When this is the case, developers should comply with existing regulations. Furthermore, the SEC expects collaboration from the ecosystem to find solutions that are suited to this new technology.&nbsp; Beyond “profitability, speed of development and innovation”, the Commissioner presses developers to contribute to a financial system in which “investors have access to actionable, material data, and it should be a system that reduces the potential for manipulative conduct.”&nbsp;</p>

 &nbsp; OFAC Adds Sanctioned Entities  
<p>On November 8th 2021, the US Department of the Treasury<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0471"> announced new sanctions</a> against a cryptoasset business that was used to launder the proceeds of ransomware attacks. The Treasury estimated that ransomware payments reached $590 million during the first half of 2021. It underscored that non-compliant exchanges were increasingly targeted by cybercriminals to launder the proceeds of their crimes. To counter this threat, the Treasury sanctioned<a href="https://chatex.com/"> Chatex</a>, a Latvian cryptoasset exchange used to launder ransomware proceeds, as well as three of its partners. A further two Ukrainian individuals were added to the list as they took part in ransomware attacks which generated more than $200 million in cryptoassets. The Treasury reiterated that “financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action.” Read our coverage of last week's sanctions <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/crypto-addresses-holding-nfts-worth-532k-are-among-latest-sanctioned-by-ofac">here</a> and learn more about how Elliptic can screen your cryptoasset transactions in real-time to<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/crypto-transaction-monitoring"> limit your exposure to sanctioned entities</a>.</p>

 &nbsp; Sweden Considers Restricting Proof of Work Mining Citing Environmental Concerns  
<p>The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA) and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)<a href="https://www.fi.se/en/published/presentations/2021/crypto-assets-are-a-threat-to-the-climate-transition--energy-intensive-mining-should-be-banned/"> have concluded</a> that cryptoassets based on proof of work (POW) protocols such as Bitcoin threaten Sweden’s ability to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change. Because of the rise in the price of cryptoassets in recent weeks, blockchain encryption puzzles have become increasingly complex requiring more computing power. As a consequence, electricity demand has surged. The SFSA and SEPA mention that cryptoasset miners are increasingly relocating to the Nordic region thanks to the availability of renewable energy. However, authorities claim that this clean energy is being diverted from “essential services.” They suggest that legislators (including the European Commission) consider a tax on energy-intensive production of Bitcoin, a ban on POW mining and disclosure requirements for businesses who trade or invest in cryptoassets using this protocol. Nonetheless, the SFSA and SEPA recognise that there is a risk of encouraging relocation of businesses to less restrictive jurisdictions.</p> 
<p>As with recent regulatory announcements on the<a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/investments/2021/10/22/hmrc-to-send-nudge-letters-to-crypto-asset-investors/#:~:text=HMRC%20is%20preparing%20to%20send,from%20their%20crypto%20asset%20holdings"> tax treatment</a> and<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2021/october/jon-cunliffe-swifts-sibos-2021"> macroprudential regulation</a> of cryptoassets, this development shows that authorities are closing in on all facets of the ecosystem.</p> 
 &nbsp;  
 &nbsp; Singapore Clarifies Approach to Cryptoassets, DeFi and Central Bank Digital Currencies  
<p>On November 9th 2021, Ravi Menon, the Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) made a<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/the-future-of-money-finance-and-the-internet"> statement on cryptoassets, DeFi and Central Bank Digital Currencies</a> at the Singapore Fintech Festival. In his speech, he stated that MAS did not view cryptoassets as money and reminded the industry that cryptoasset businesses are subject to licensing and supervision requirements due to ML/FT risks. Nonetheless, Menon recognized the potential benefit that blockchain technology could bring to an economy and he highlighted a particular interest for cryptoassets which are backed by reserves.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His statement also addressed Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), stating that MAS sees benefits in issuing a wholesale digital currency targeted at banks to improve reserve management and transform cross-border payments. Turning to a retail CBDC (a digital Singapore Dollar available to all), he said that MAS does not see the development of a CBDC as urgent. He argued that cash would still be relevant in the foreseeable future, Singapore’s payment system is sufficiently efficient and inclusive, and substitution from the Singapore Dollar to foreign CBDCs is not presently seen as a threat. Nonetheless, Menon announced the launch of Project Orchid to work on the technical requirements needed to issue a CBDC if MAS decides to launch a retail CBDC. He also reminded participants at the meeting of a number of MAS’s initiatives including<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2021/mas-and-financial-industry-to-use-new-digital-platform-to-fight-money-laundering"> COSMIC</a>, a platform for financial institutions to share data relating to high risk and illicit activity using their own systems.</p> 
 &nbsp;  
 &nbsp; UK Statement on CBDCs  
<p>On November 9th 2021, Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) and the Bank of England (BoE) announced the next steps in the exploration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This follows the creation of a joint<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2021/april/bank-of-england-statement-on-central-bank-digital-currency"> CBDC Taskforce</a> by HMT and BoE in April 2021. In 2022, both agencies will launch a public consultation to assess the merits and implications of a CBDC as well as starting high level design planning. HMT and BoE note that no decision has been made on the introduction of a CBDC in the UK. If regulators chose to develop a CBDC following their 2022 consultation, the announcement suggests that it would launch during the second half of the decade at the earliest. Spokespersons from HMT and the BoE stated they were looking forward to an open discussion on this topic with all stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication">Private Key JWT flow</a> is one of the more complicated OIDC flows to set up. At Okta, it’s commonly used to get OAuth4Okta access tokens which enable you to perform managementr tasks on your org. If you already know HOW it works and just want to get to the code, <a>click here</a> to skip ahead. If you’re looking to gain a better understanding of how it works, here’s a high level explanation:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you’ve obtained the access token from this flow, you can throw it into the Authorization header of requests to your Okta APIs:</p>

<p></p>

<p>But let’s break it down a bit more:</p>

 Step 1: Generate keypair 

<p>Typically, one may think of JWTs as strictly being in the realm of the identity provider (IdP) - and in most cases that’s correct. When an IdP grants tokens to a service provider (SP), it is signing those tokens with a private/secret key. Part of the responsibility of the SP when validating tokens is to use a public key provided by the IdP to verify the signature.</p>

<p>The Private Key JWT flow flips this on its head - at least at the start. It’s now the SP’s turn to generate a public/private keypair, share the public key with the IdP (more on that in Step 2), create a JWT, and sign it with their private key (more on that in Step 3).</p>

<p>But I digress…Step 1 is really just about generating the keypair. (In this case, RSA keys with a 2048-bit key size).</p>

 Step 2: Register public key 

<p>The next step is registering your public key with the IdP. With Okta, that’s done through our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oauth-clients/#register-new-client">clients</a> API. With this step, Okta will create an application integration and generate a unique client ID - this value will be important when it comes time to create the Private Key JWT. It will be this client ID as well as the working public key decryption that validates your request.</p>

<p>In other flows like the popular <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcode/main">Authorization Code</a> flow, the identity provider generates a secret value called the client secret. In the Private Key JWT flow, the burden is on the service provider to generate a secret value for the same purpose - albeit by different means.</p>

 Step 3: Get access token 

<p>There are two components to this step (creating the private key JWT and then submitting it to the IdP to obtain an access token), but the Python command <code>get_access_token.py</code> performs both at once so we can treat this as a single operation.</p>

<p>Using the private key created in step 1, you sign a JWT with the following <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/create-sign-jwt/">claims</a>:</p>

   <code>'iss': {client ID generated in step 2},
'sub': {client ID generated in step 2},
'aud': {okta_url}/oauth2/v1/token,
"exp": {epoch expiration at future time}
</code>   

<p>This token is sent to the /token endpoint of the IdP:</p>

   <code>  POST /token HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  grant_type=client_credentials&amp;
    scope={scopes}&amp;
    client_id={client ID generated in step 2}&amp;
    client_assertion_type=
    urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer&amp;
    client_assertion={private key JWT}
</code>   

<p>Assuming everything is set up correctly, the IdP should respond with an access token that you can use to access scoped resources.</p>

<p>For an even deeper look at this flow, you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/overview/">check out our walkthrough</a>. For now, it’s time to set this up with Python!</p>

 Python private key JWT setup 

 
   Clone the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-private-key-jwt-python-example">OktaDev Private Key repo</a>, open terminal, and <code>cd</code> into the project root. 
   Create a new <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">virtualenv</a> in the root folder with <code>virtualenv env</code>. 
   Run the virtual environment with <code>source env/bin/activate</code>. 
   Install necessary Python packages with <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. 
   In the root folder, create a new <code>.env</code> file and paste the following values into it: 
 

   <code>PRIVATE_KEY=
PUBLIC_KEY=
MODULUS=
CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_URL=
API_KEY=
SCOPES=
</code>   

<p>Scripts will generate values for the first 4 vars once you’ve run the first two commands. You will need to fill out the other values. Note: the API key is needed for creating the OAuth client in Okta, so make sure the token you use has permissions to create applications.</p>

 
   OKTA_URL=https://{your_okta_domain} 
   API_KEY={okta_api_key} 
   SCOPES=’okta.users.read okta.users.manage’ 
 

<p>The SCOPES var is an string of scopes (seperated by spaces) granted to your eventual access token that you will be using for management tasks. I put in a couple common ones as a placeholder. In your Okta application, it would look like this:</p>

<p></p>

 Running the scripts 

<p>To run these scripts, make sure you are still in the root folder of the cloned repository.</p>

 Step 1: Generate keypair 

<p>Run the following command in terminal:</p>

   <code>python generate_keys.py
</code>   

<p>You should see confirmation printed to the terminal:</p>

   <code>///////////////// Keys generated and added to .env file.
</code>   

<p>Sure enough, you can pop over to the .env file to see the <code>PRIVATE_KEY</code>, <code>PUBLIC_KEY</code> and <code>MODULUS</code> values populated there.</p>

 Step 2: Create OAuth service app in Okta 

<p>Now that you have the keypair, you can create the OAuth app in Okta with the public key. The scopes you defined in the .env file will also be granted in the application. Type the following into the terminal:</p>

   <code>python create_okta_service_app.py
</code>   

<p>You will get confirmation in the terminal of the created app, that the client ID of the app was updated in your .env file, as well as scopes granted.</p>

   <code>///////////////// Okta Service app created: 

{application object}

///////////////// Setting CLIENT_ID in .env:

{client ID of newly created app}

///////////////// Scopes granted: 

{scopes granted to the application}
</code>   

<p>If you navigate to your applications in Okta, you will see this newly created app under the name Private Key JWT Service App.</p>

 Step 3: Create PKJ and get access token 

<p>The two scripts above should only need to run once for setup. From hereon out, you can run the following command to get an access token from Okta:</p>

   <code>python get_access_token.py
</code>   

<p>You should see the access token printed to terminal:</p>

   <code>///////////////// Access Token:

{access_token}
</code>   

<p>You can now use this token to perform management tasks on your Okta org based on your defined scopes by passing it in the Authorization header as Bearer {access_token}.</p>

 In conclusion: Keep it secret, keep it safe 

<p>The Private Key JWT flow is complicated to set up, but once the pieces are in place it should be pretty automated. As always, the private key is the key to the castle. So…</p>

<p>The past few Holochain releases have focused on both increasing resilience and adding features for developers.</p><p>One task is particularly important, even though you’ll probably never see or experience it — and in fact, its invisibility will be the proof of its success. Right now, the core dev team is doing extensive sharding tests, tuning parameters, adjusting the algorithm, and testing again. Currently, they’re investigating how peers respond to dramatic changes in their neighbourhood, such as many neighbours leaving at once or adjusting their <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">arcs</a> of responsibility.</p><p>What they’re seeing is that nodes respond very quickly to changes in their neighbourhood — which is great in principle, but such rapid responses are causing ‘oscillations’ that take a while to calm down. It’s a bit like when you meet someone coming toward you in a hallway, then you both try to make way for each other but end up moving in the same direction. So you readjust, get in each other’s way again, and repeat a few more times before you figure it out. That’s what’s happening at the DHT level, and the dev team is working on strategies to dampen those oscillations and allow nodes to reach stability after disruptions.</p><p>As regular readers know, <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/#how-rrdht-makes-things-fast-and-robust">sharding</a> is Holochain’s long-term plan for building scalable peer-to-peer networks. Sharding is already built into Holochain, but it’s currently disabled by default. This testing and improvement work is getting it ready for real-world use.</p><p>Now let’s dig into what’s happened in the last three Holochain releases.</p> Holochain 0.0.113: Small release <p>This version of Holochain, released three weeks ago, was a small one. It contained two changes:</p>  Your <code>post_commit</code> callbacks should now be ‘infallible’, which means that they don’t return a <code>Result</code>. In fact, the host doesn’t even expect or check for a return value. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1049">#1049</a>)  Breaking: <code>HeaderHashes</code> and <code>HeaderHashedVec</code> no longer exist. They were previously only used in <code>post_commit</code>, which is fairly new. Note that I mistakenly reported this for 0.0.112. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1049">#1049</a>)  <p>View the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20211027100746">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.114: Introspection, network simulations, and more <p>There are quite a lot of changes in last week’s release. Developers will note that zome functions can get more info about their context, while under the hood, we worked on DHT resilience improvements and got prepared to write sharding tests.</p>  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/info/fn.zome_info.html"><code>zome_info</code></a> now includes <code>entry_defs</code>, a vector of <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/prelude/struct.EntryDefs.html">entry definitions</a> from the same zome. No code changes needed, but zomes will need to be recompiled. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1055">#1055</a>)  Breaking: <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/info/fn.dna_info.html">dna_info</a></code> now includes <code>zome_names</code>, a vector of strings containing the names of the zomes as defined by the DNA manifest. As with the above, only recompilation is necessary. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1055">#1055</a>)  Breaking: <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/info/fn.call_info.html">call_info</a></code> now includes the name of the function being called. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1078">#1078</a>)  Breaking: Within a hApp manifest, both ‘<a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.10/holochain_types/app/type.CellNick.html">nick</a>’ (deprecated) and ‘slot’ for a DNA have been collapsed into one new property called ‘role’. It does the same thing as ‘slot’ — gives the DNA an identifier that other components of the hApp (UI and other DNAs) can use to easily address cells created with that DNA, regardless of the DNA hash. This role identifier is internal to the hApp, and the role can also be filled by DNAs and cells that are external to the hApp, such as a DNA that implements DPKI. The only change you need to make is to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1045/files#diff-664227a03af324bf24e56578368216ab0a83cf7d90f0315a3a54b2ae638c5d5eL7-L8">replace <code>slots</code> with <code>roles</code></a> in your hApp manifest. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1045">#1045</a>)  Breaking: A source chain <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/chain/fn.query.html">query</a></code> now guarantees ordered results: elements will be returned in header sequence ascending (oldest to newest). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1004">#1004</a>)  New: the admin API now has a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/0.0.114/holochain/conductor/api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.DumpFullState"><code>DumpFullState</code></a> endpoint, which lets developers inspect individual cell states during testing. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1065">#1065</a>)  <code>remote_signal</code> now uses a more efficient method of sending notifications to peers, which can take advantage of a multicast approach. It will also now fail silently if it can’t contact the peer — which is a good reminder that signal delivery is <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/#when-not-to-use-signals">not guaranteed</a> and shouldn’t be relied on for important exchanges. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1075">#1075</a>)  Breaking: Remote nodes will now return a <code>Busy</code> message if they’re overloaded with incoming gossip. This continues work in fixing consistency bottlenecks, allowing peers to process DHT data at a sustainable pace. This breaks the network protocol, which means that cells running on conductor 0.0.114 won’t be able to communicate with cells running on earlier conductors. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1076">#1076</a>)  Sweetest tests can now create simulated networks, which is already being used in sharding tests. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1036">#1036</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1037">#1037</a>)  <p>View the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20211103094627">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.115: Network reliability, more introspection <p>This week’s release is a quiet one, mainly bringing improvements to the database and networking code. Once again, the <code>*_info</code> host functions, which lets a zome function call introspect its context, have gotten some additions which will require no code changes but will require recompilation of your zomes’ WASM.</p>  Breaking: <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.115/hdk/info/fn.zome_info.html">zome_info</a></code> now includes <code>externs</code>, a list of zome functions that comprise the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/#zome">zome’s public API</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1081">#1081</a>)  Breaking: <code>zome_info</code> now includes <code>properties</code>, similar to the <code>dna_info</code>’s <code>properties</code> but specific to the zome. Note that this is just a placeholder and isn’t populated with any data, as it’s waiting for future changes to the DNA manifest spec. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1080">#1080</a>)  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.115/hdk/info/fn.agent_info.html"><code>agent_info</code></a> now includes the agent’s current chain state, as at the time <code>agent_info</code> was called. (This includes any elements written to the scratch space and waiting to be committed in the current zome call.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1079">#1079</a>)  Bugfix/breaking: Support for the the newest Lair keystore manager has been added, bringing more reliable connection management. If you decide to use it, you’ll need to rebuild your keystore, as the encryption passphrase is now hashed before being used as a key. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1094">#1094</a>)  Bugfix: Data from private source chain elements are now no longer processed by the local DHT shard, preventing errors when trying to commit them. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1104">#1104</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1110">#1110</a>)  Bugfix: ‘Delete’ DHT ops are now formed properly, preventing cells from shutting down. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1105">#1105</a>)  Bugfix: Nodes will try to silently reconnect to peers if a connection is dropped. This improves network reliability. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1083">#1083</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1111">#1111</a>)  Bugfix: Cells hosted on a HoloPort no longer error when trying to retrieve data from their DHT shard. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1098">#1098</a>)  Bugfix: All database transactions are asynchronous; this fixes various database connection issues. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1097">#1097</a>)  <p>View the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20211110083530">changelog</a>.</p> And two more releases  holochain-conductor-api 0.2.4 <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api">holochain-conductor-api</a>, the JavaScript client library for talking to local Holochain conductors, has been updated and a new version has been released. Here are the changes:</p>  Update: Call zome functions using the new app API endpoint name. This fixes an issue where attempts to call a zone function used a previously deprecated and removed endpoint name and were returning an error. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/pull/91">#91</a>)  Update: Update app installation endpoint calls and data types to replace ‘slots’ and ‘nicks’ with Holochain 0.0.114’s ‘roles’, along with other hApp bundle format changes. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/pull/90">#90</a>)  <p>You can find it in all the usual places — you can get it via NPM as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/conductor-api"><code>@holochain/conductor-api</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/releases/tag/v0.2.4">download it from GitHub</a>.</p> Tryorama 0.4.6 <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a>, the JavaScript-based testing framework for hApps, has also seen a new release. As with holochain-conductor-api, this brings it in line with the changes in Holochain 0.0.114. Get it via NPM as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama"><code>@holochain/tryorama</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases/tag/v0.4.6">download it from GitHub</a>.</p><p>There’s a lot more going on in developer land, but as you may know, we’re preparing for the first public test of Elemental Chat. Right now, I’m busy writing educational materials for all the people who will be trying a hApp for the first time!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@motoki?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Motoki Tonn</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/kintsugi?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

  You can test our API in the sandbox testnet by simply switching the toggle to test mode. To get started; create a free account, log into your dashboard and acquire your API key.

<p>At Dock, we’re focused on providing the best possible developer tools to ensure our products are easy to use while providing the best possible experience for technical teams. So today, we’re delighted to announce that we’ve incorporated a sandbox environment for users of our API. &nbsp;</p><p>For the uninitiated, Dock’s API enables businesses and developers to easily and instantly issue, verify, manage, and revoke verifiable credentials and decentralized identities on the Dock Blockchain. Dock integrates industry-leading World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) VCDM standards, allowing interoperability with other open source technologies. We provide a range of open-source software on <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork">GitHub</a> that can be used alongside the API.</p><p>You can test our API in the sandbox testnet by simply switching the toggle to test mode.</p><p>Primary features of Dock’s API include:</p>  Issuing, verifying, managing, and revoking/unrevoking verifiable credentials  Creating and managing decentralized identities  Anchoring credentials on-chain to enable timestamping  Creating and assigning schemas to credentials for compliance  <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#primary-features">And more</a>  <p>All of which you can test out in the sandbox environment! </p><p>To get started; create a free account, log into your <a href="https://console.api.dock.io/">dashboard</a> and acquire your API key. </p><p>By default, API keys are created for production. You can switch the toggle to test mode and utilize the API in this endpoint. Any transactions made in test mode will not carry through on production. Note; your API keys for production and testnet are different. </p><p>All about DIDs</p><p>Decentralized Identities (DIDs) are globally unique identifiers that allow their owner to prove cryptographic control over them. DIDs on Dock are created by choosing a 32-byte unique (on Dock chain) identifier along with a public key. </p><p>Get accustomed to Dock’s API before utilizing your 50 free transactions on production;</p><p>Using the sandbox environment, create a new DID, public key, and controller by using an auto-generated keypair. It is important to have a public key of one of its three supported types. </p><p>Dock supports 3 types of public keys: sr25519, ed25519, and secp256k1. These public keys are supported by 3 classes: PublicKeySr25519, PublicKeyEd25519, and PublicKeySecp256k1.</p><p>You can update your public key or the controller of an on-chain DID by preparing a signed key update. You can even rotate the key of an existing DID following the instructions on our <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#update-did">API documentation here</a>.</p><p>A DID can be deleted from the testnet blockchain by sending the corresponding message signed with the current key. However, further attempts to resolve this DID will fail, just as it would in production mode. </p><p>Issuing Credentials</p><p>Simple to verify and almost impossible to fake or modify, recording credentials on the blockchain will increase security and prevent fraud. Though the VCDM spec does not mandate it, an issuer in Dock must have a DID on a chain. </p><p>You can use the sandbox environment to issue credentials just as you would on production; ensure your public key is accessible to the holder and verifier to verify the signature (in proof) in the credential. The DID can be found in the issuer field of the credential.</p><p>Updating or deleting Registries</p><p>Utilize the sandbox environment whenever you need it, simply switch the toggle in the top right corner to test mode and get to work.</p><p>There can be multiple registries on the chain, and each registry has a unique ID. A registry can be created, updated, revoked/unrevoked, and even deleted in a few simple steps. View our <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#registries">API documentation here</a> and get started in the sandbox environment. </p><p>Verify Credentials</p><p>In production, upon receiving a verifiable credential or presentation, a verifier verifies the validity of the credentials. </p><p>The verify method can be used to check the authenticity of the issuer and the issuer’s signature, revocation status if the credential is revocable, and if the holder has signed the presentation.</p><p>Verify a credential or presentation in our <a href="https://console.api.dock.io/">sandbox testnet here</a>.</p><p>Give it a try</p><p>Dock’s API allows you to easily issue, verify, manage, and revoke verifiable credentials and decentralized identities on the Dock Blockchain. It’s easy to set up and implement, and requires no sign-up fee! Get started in our sandbox environment and your 50 free transactions will be in production when you switch over.</p>

<p>In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we spoke to the Co-founders of Unit — <a href="https://www.mihealy.com/">Michael Healy</a> and <a href="https://www.yipworx.com/">Thy-Diep (“Yip”)&nbsp;Ta</a>.</p><p><a href="https://docs.unit.foundation/">Unit.Network</a> is a parachain built on Substrate and linked to the <a href="https://polkadot.network/about/">PolkaDot network</a> that (1) provides tools to build and grow a token, (2) enables decentral (free-market) banking, and (3) is fundamentally designed to catalyze the token economy — widespread adoption of tokens for use (not just investment) throughout the global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>We spoke about how tokens could help distribute value in the world, the future of a token economy, the role of cryptocurrency treasuries, and more during our conversation.</p><p>Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;<a href="https://anchor.fm/dataeconomy/episodes/Michael-Healy--Thy-Diep-Yip-Ta--How-token-economy-could-contribute-to-distributing-value-e1a3p90">podcast</a>.</p><p>What is a token economy, and how can it solve the problem of inequity in&nbsp;society?</p><p>Imagine an economy driven by tokens. The concept of tokens is super new. At the moment, when people think about coins or tokens — they think about Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p><blockquote>“How we view tokens is that they’re just a way for value to flow around the economy more efficiently and freely, and a way to share and distribute value in a more equitable way. Currently, the way the world works is that the people who benefit from business organizations doing well are just the founders and the investors. However, organizations would be nothing without the customer base and employees. They won’t be able to thrive or survive without them. When a project like Uber reaches worth $80 billion on the stock exchange, none of it goes to the 2 million drivers that are a huge support system for Uber. The inspiring vision of the token economy is where everything in the world has a token- whether it’s your local restaurant or your friend who’s an artist. You have an idea for a project, and you create tokens,” says&nbsp;Michael.</blockquote><blockquote>“Token is the container that enables the flow of economic transactions in a world where every stakeholder who helps contribute value can have a fair share in it,” added&nbsp;Yip.</blockquote><p>Many people who know about cryptocurrencies also consider a range of operational questions like what to build on or how to make a token. According to Michael, blockchain technology is going to become commoditized. People are comparing which blockchain is better and does more transactions per second or is more decentralized.</p><blockquote>“It’s not going to matter which chain you issue your token on. It’s not going to matter which platform you’re using to put data on. It is just going to be about how to monetize, and the best thing about the blockchain is that it’s decentralized. Even with us being cofounders, we just can’t decide to take everything down tomorrow,” says&nbsp;Michael.</blockquote><p>However, a decentralized token economy can only be enabled with the help of a seamless treasury system. <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/zhangb2/treasury.pdf">A treasury system</a> is a community-controlled and decentralized collaborative decision-making mechanism for sustainable funding of blockchain development and maintenance. During each treasury period, project proposals are submitted, discussed, and voted for; top-ranked projects are funded from the treasury. More specifically, the treasury system supports liquid democracy/delegative voting for better collaborative intelligence. Namely, the stakeholders can either vote directly on the proposed projects or delegate their votes to experts. Its core component is a distributed universally composable secure end-to-end verifiable voting protocol. The integrity of the treasury voting decisions is guaranteed even when all the voting committee members are corrupted. Michael comments on the concept of a treasury that Unit is building:</p><blockquote>“It sounds very simple- put funds into a treasury, and the treasury is providing this fundamental book value. This is super cool to address and understand how to value different tokens. For example, you can currently look at different coins and tokens on two popular sites- CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. But there’s no parameter for assessing the underlying value that’s being created or generated backing up the token. The Unit Treasury really solves&nbsp;that.”</blockquote><p>The future of Token&nbsp;Economy</p><p>How big is the token economy? If you look at tokens, it’s about 8000 tokens. The crypto market cap of the token market cap is between $2 to $3 trillion. It sounds like a lot of money, but the biggest company globally is Apple which is about $2 to $3 trillion; Tesla just crossed over, being worth $1 trillion. That’s just one&nbsp;company.</p><blockquote>“There are about 8 billion people in the world. We think each person is going to have a token. We think more than having a personal token; they will own a token for a community or different businesses and projects. We are at a stage with just 8000 tokens. If this was a party, the music hasn’t turned yet and nobody is here. Most people in the world, most companies, most leaders don’t see the potential and possibility of tokens yet. So I guess our responsibility, vision, mission, and purpose behind Unit to bring the future and the value of tokens to the entire world,” says&nbsp;Michael.</blockquote><p>Use cases of token&nbsp;economy</p><p>Everything in the non-internet and non-mobile world eventually moved to the internet. Newspaper, shopping, education, travel — everything went online. It’s the same with a token and blockchain. There is an opportunity if there isn’t a decentralized app or a token for a particular industry or a particular business. For example, if there’s a supermarket, which is centrally owned and centrally runs, there’s an opportunity for you to create a supermarket, which has decentralized ownership and decentralized operations.</p><p>Yip mentions that other use cases will be everything related to helping the gaming and the metaverse economy come to&nbsp;life:</p><blockquote>“ People will spend more and more time in Virtual Reality and mixed reality environments, and all this needs creators. A lot of people can already start to earn a living, producing content like this. It’s not about consuming gaming but being able to consume it and produce at the same time. You can become a creator in that new economy and already play and earn, but also create and earn. This will reduce a lot of inequities in the&nbsp;market.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>2: 15 to 5.36: What does data ownership mean to&nbsp;you?</p><p>5.36 to 11.40: What is a token economy, and what problems can it solve? How is UNIT helping in building&nbsp;tokens?</p><p>11.40 to 13.40: Why Polkadot?</p><p>13.40 to 16.40: What is the size of the token economy?

  <p>When you hear SSO (Single Sign-On), you probably immediately think of web apps, and how you only need to sign into one web app first, then all other web apps give you seamless access. Unfortunately, for desktop and mobile applications (often referred to as “native apps”), the seamless web SSO experience (also referred to as native SSO) has not caught on. This is partly due to the lack of an industry standard or best practice on how to accomplish native SSO.</p>

<p>Although there is no standard yet, there’s been growing demand for a solution, due to the continued expansion of native apps, both desktop and mobile. In 2020, a report from RiskIQ counted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/02/28/there-are-now-89-million-mobile-apps-and-china-is-40-of-mobile-app-spending/?sh=33b7e96721dd">8.9 million mobile apps</a>. There are also a large number of internal native apps available to employees within an enterprise.</p>

<p>In comparison with desktop or web apps, it’s even more critical to enable SSO for mobile apps, due to the smaller keyboard and screen on a mobile device, which makes password input more painful. To date, complex proprietary solutions have not proven interoperable with the variety of native applications an enterprise installs on employee devices. Thus, there is still a dire need for an industry-standard solution.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this problem is widely recognized, and an OIDC draft spec <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html">Native SSO for Mobile Apps</a> has been released to address the issue using a token-exchange approach. Okta recently added support for this draft spec. In this article, we describe the solution and compare it to an existing approach. We also share an example app to demonstrate how you can use the token-exchange solution to build SSO for your apps, not only within the same device, but also across devices. Specifically, the example demonstrates how you can single-sign-on with Okta to a mobile app on one device (such as your iPhone), then have access to all your apps on another desktop device (such as your Mac).</p>

 Sharing web sessions with native apps 

<p>Before we describe the token-exchange solution, let’s explore how to build a native SSO solution based on web SSO. If we could share web login sessions with native apps, we could leverage the advance in browser SSO technology. Web session sharing has become more restrictive due to the continued increase in privacy restrictions on mobile devices. Apple leads the charge on adding more privacy restrictions, but Android is quickly following suit.</p>

<p>Apple introduced <code>SFSafariViewController</code> in iOS 9, which enables an embedded web browser experience inside a mobile app. But Apple quickly changed its behavior. In iOS 11, <code>SFSafariViewController</code> no longer shares any browser cookies with the standalone Safari browser on the same device, making it impossible to share SSO sessions between a mobile app and a web app.</p>

<p>Apple introduced <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> in iOS 12 to add the ability to share browser cookies, but it is restrictive:
It can only be used in an OIDC-style login flow, and only shares persistent cookies, not session cookies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/shared-sso-android-ios/ios/overview/">Okta developer guide on web session sharing</a> illustrates how two mobile apps on the same device can share a web login session. At a high level, it involves these steps:</p>

 
   Enable persistent cookies. Okta login session is stored in a session cookie by default, but only persistent cookies can be shared in iOS. 
   Login App 1 through the embedded browser. The login session is saved in a persistent cookie. 
   Login App 2 through the embedded browser. Since the login session is still in the persistent cookie, the user is not prompted for login. 
 

 Native SSO based on token exchange 

<p>Okta’s native SSO solution is based on token exchange, and it builds on an OIDC draft spec <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html">Native SSO for Mobile Apps</a>. The following diagrams, taken from the spec, illustrate the flow to enable native SSO.</p>

<p>Sign-in to the first application is similar to a normal OIDC sign in, using a system browser. The only difference is that we request the <code>device_sso</code> scope, and in return, we receive a <code>device_secret</code> along with the returned tokens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When Native App 2 requests login, it can simply take the ID token and device secret returned for App 1, and call the token endpoint to exchange for tokens for App 2. The returned tokens for App 2 have their own refresh lifecycle.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Native SSO Guide</a> goes into more detail on how to enable native SSO, and demonstrates the interaction through curl commands.</p>

 How is it different 

<p>The token-exchange-based native SSO solution is simpler and better than sharing web SSO in at least several regards:</p>
 
   Out-of-the-box config: Sharing web SSO requires you to use an API to configure all users to use a persistent cookie for session management. (The default is to use a session cookie.) A login session will persist even after you close the browser, which may be a surprise for some users. In contrast, native SSO is one of the supported grant types that can be easily enabled in the Okta admin console. 
   Single LogOut: It is not possible to single logout all applications with the web SSO sharing solution. If you want to log out from all apps, you have to log out from each app one by one. In contrast, in native SSO, one can simply revoke <code>device_secret</code>, then all apps automatically sign out. 
   Multiple devices: Sharing web SSO can only work on the same device. In contrast, native SSO can work across devices, as long as <code>device_secret</code> can be safely shared. In fact, the remaining portion of this blog demonstrates how to implement native SSO across multiple Apple devices. 
 

 Single sign-on across multiple Apple devices 

<p>Many of us own multiple devices such as iPhone, MacBook, iPad. It would be great to single sign-on to apps across all the devices we own. In this section, we demonstrate how to sign into a mobile app on an iOS device and a desktop app on a MacBook by leveraging iCloud keychain.
Note that this demo generalizes the <code>device_secret</code> concept described in the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html">draft spec</a> to beyond a single device. While it allows you to single sign-on across multiple devices, you do lose the ability to revoke access on an individual device. (You can only revoke all devices.) Also, you lose the assurance that the <code>device_secret</code> can identify a single device.</p>

<p>We first need to create two OIDC apps in your Okta admin console, one for the iOS mobile app, another for the Mac desktop app. See our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Native SSO Guide</a> for full instruction.</p>

<p>Next, let us start an Xcode project, and add two targets: one for an iOS app (<code>nativesso</code>), another for a Mac app (<code>nativessomac</code>). The full source code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-ios-native-sso-example">Native SSO sample app repo</a>.</p>

 Store device secret in iCloud Keychain 

<p>The key to enabling native SSO is to be able to securely share <code>device_secret</code> across multiple devices. We can use iCloud Keychain. We will show how to use Apple’s keychain interface functions to save and restore the device secret.</p>

<p>By default, a keychain item is only stored per app. No other apps can access the keychain items your app saves. However, the keychain has a concept called the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/keychain_items/sharing_access_to_keychain_items_among_a_collection_of_apps">keychain access group</a>. You can enable multiple apps to share the same keychain access group, then all of these apps can read and write from the same Keychain Access Group. A Keychain Access Group is tied to a developer account, so only your apps (if enabled) can access the group. No other apps from other developers can access your group, so it is secure.</p>

<p>First, let us add the keychain access group. Click the target, select Signing &amp; Capabilities, click + to add a Keychain Sharing capability. Then input a unique group name, such as <code>com.atko.group</code>, in the box. This will update the entitlement file. Repeat this step for other targets or apps that you want to share the device secret with.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To save a device secret and ID token in the keychain, we invoke the following function:</p>

   <code>static func addDeviceSecret(idToken: String, deviceSecret: String) {
    let attributes: [String: Any] = [
        (kSecClass as String): kSecClassGenericPassword,     // only Password items can use iCloud keychain
        (kSecAttrSynchronizable as String): kCFBooleanTrue!, // allow iCloud
        (kSecAttrLabel as String): keychainTag,              // tag to make it easy to search
        (kSecAttrAccessGroup as String): keychainGroup,      // multiple apps can share through this group
        (kSecAttrAccount as String): idToken,
        (kSecValueData as String): deviceSecret.data(using: .utf8)!
    ]
    // Let's add the item to the Keychain! 😄
    let status = SecItemAdd(attributes as CFDictionary, nil)
}
</code>   

<p>We first set the <code>attributes</code>:</p>

 
   <code>kSecClass</code> is set to <code>kSecClassGenericPassword</code> because iCloud keychain only supports password items, not certificates. 
   <code>kSecAttrSynchronizable</code> flag indicates that we want to use iCloud keychain. 
   We add a <code>kSecAttrLabel</code> to facilitate a later query to find this key. 
   <code>kSecAttrAccessGroup</code> is set to the same keychain access group enabled in the entitlement, for example <code>com.atko.group</code>. 
   We reuse fields designed for saving passwords: save ID token in <code>kSecAttrAccount</code> field, and device secret in <code>kSecValueData</code>. 
 

<p>After the attributes are set, it is a simple call to Apple’s API <code>SecItemAdd</code> to save the credentials.</p>

<p>We can find the previously saved device secret through a query to the iCloud keychain through the following function.</p>

   <code>static func queryForDeviceSecret() -&gt; (idToken: String?, deviceSecret: String?) {
    let query: [String: Any] = [
        (kSecClass as String): kSecClassGenericPassword,     // only Password items can use iCloud keychain
        (kSecAttrSynchronizable as String): kCFBooleanTrue!, // allow iCloud
        (kSecAttrLabel as String): keychainTag,              // tag to make it easy to search
        (kSecAttrAccessGroup as String): keychainGroup,      // multiple apps can share through this group
        (kSecMatchLimit as String): kSecMatchLimitOne,       // should only have one key
        (kSecReturnAttributes as String): true,
        (kSecReturnData as String): true]
    var item: CFTypeRef?

    // should succeed
    let status = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &amp;item)
    
    if let existingItem = item as? [String: Any],
        let idToken = existingItem[kSecAttrAccount as String] as? String,
        let deviceSecretData = existingItem[kSecValueData as String] as? Data {
        let deviceSecret = String(data: deviceSecretData, encoding: .utf8)
        return (idToken, deviceSecret)
    }
    return (nil, nil)
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>query</code> is set using the same set of parameters as used in the <code>SecItemAdd</code> call, then it is a simple call to the Apple’s API <code>SecItemCopyMatching</code>.</p>

 Exchange device secret for new tokens 

<p><a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-ios">Okta OIDC iOS library</a> is a wrapper around the <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS">AppAuth library</a>. For token exchange, we will use AppAuth’s built-in functions.</p>

<p>We first have to construct a configuration for AppAuth.</p>

   <code>let configuration = OIDServiceConfiguration.init(
    authorizationEndpoint: URL(string: authorizeUrl)!,
    tokenEndpoint: URL(string: tokenUrl)!
)
</code>   

<p>The <code>authorizeUrl</code> should be set to your AS (Authorization Server)’s “authorize” URL, for instance: <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code>. The <code>tokenEndpoint</code> should be the token url, like this: <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token</code>.</p>

<p>Then we construct a token exchange request. Note that we specify the new grant type <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange</code>, and also add in the special parameters in the <code>additionalParameters</code> field. Specifically, <code>actor_token</code> should be set to the device token, and <code>subject_token</code> should be set to the ID token you obtained earlier when a different app signed in.</p>

   <code>let request = OIDTokenRequest(
                configuration: configuration,
                grantType: "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange",
                authorizationCode: nil,
                redirectURL: nil,
                clientID: oktaOidc.configuration.clientId,
                clientSecret: nil,
                scope: "openid offline_access",
                refreshToken: nil,
                codeVerifier: nil,
                additionalParameters: [
                   "actor_token" : deviceSecret!,
                   "actor_token_type" : "urn:x-oath:params:oauth:token-type:device-secret",
                   "subject_token" : idToken!,
                   "subject_token_type" : "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token",
                   "audience" : "api://default"])
</code>   

<p>Lastly, we perform token exchange to get a new accessToken, refreshToken for the new app.</p>

   <code>// perform token exchange
OIDAuthorizationService.perform(request) { tokenResponse, error in
    if error != nil {
        // handle errors
    }
// Signed in, persist tokens, 
}
</code>   

 End-to-end login flow 

<p>Now that we have the building blocks of save-and-query device secret, and token exchange, let’s tie them together to enable login on a device. Essentially, it follows these steps:</p>

 
   Look up <code>deviceSecret</code> from iCloud keychain.
       <code>  let (idToken, deviceSecret) = queryForDeviceSecret()
</code>       
   
   If <code>deviceSecret</code> exists, attempts token exchange, as outlined in the previous section. 
   If the token exchange succeeds, the user is already logged in. We then save login state locally so that the app does not need to do a login check on the next startup. This is leveraging Okta OIDC library’s built-in capability to persist login state locally.
       <code>  stateManager!.writeToSecureStorage()
</code>       
   
   If no <code>deviceSecret</code>, or token exchange fails, invoke the OIDC login flow.
First construct a configuration for Okta’s OIDC library:
       <code>  let configuration = try OktaOidcConfig(with: [
   "issuer": "https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default",
   "clientId": "0oa826j5pHmPRt2n00w6",
   "scopes": "device_sso openid offline_access",
   "redirectUri": "nativesso:/callback",
   "logoutRedirectUri": "nativesso:/logout"
  ])
</code>       
    <p>Then invoke the OIDC flow. On an iOS device:</p>
       <code>  oktaOidc.signInWithBrowser(from: self, callback: SignInHelper.oktaOidcCallback)
</code>       
    <p>On a Mac:</p>
       <code>  oktaOidc.signInWithBrowser(redirectServerConfiguration: nil, callback: SignInHelper.oktaOidcCallback)
</code>       
   
   If the sign-in is successful, we save the login state locally, the same as in step three. In addition, we save the device secret in the iCloud keychain, so that other apps can perform native SSO login.
       <code>  removeDeviceSecret()
  addDeviceSecret(idToken: stateManager!.idToken!, 
               deviceSecret: stateManager!.authState.lastTokenResponse!.additionalParameters!["device_secret"]! as! String)
</code>       
   
 

<p>Note that the Okta SDK currently does not understand the device secret field, so we are parsing for the field directly from the last token request response.</p>

<p>By now, you should be able to launch both the iPhone app and the Mac app. The first one will prompt you for login, but the second one will be able to log you in without any prompt.</p>

 Okta’s Native SSO is available now 

<p>Okta’s native SSO feature is now in GA (general availability). You can turn it on in your org, and start experimenting. Beyond the demo use case we showed above, we envision it will open up many more scenarios. Give it a try, and drop a comment below to directly reach the development team. We would love to hear your feedback and feature requests.</p>

<p>We’ve already told many folks what we are advising <a href="https://www.cheqd.io">cheqd</a>&nbsp;and participating in the cheqd network as a node operator – but we wanted to provide more information for the community (clear disclosure – that means we will, or do – depending on when you are reading this article – hold cheqd tokens).</p>
<p>This article aims to explain areas where we are aligned with cheqd as well as a few areas we will be pushing them towards.</p>
 1. OUR CLIENTS 
<p>We serve a range of client types (government, military, financial institutions, NGOs, not-for-profits, startups). I’ll deal with them in two distinct groups here as the first group is unique while the others fall into the same broad bucket.</p>
 1.1 GOVERNMENT 
<p>We advise several government agencies and they, right now, aren’t overly interested in token-enabled networks for operational use. However, they do need to understand what things will mean when permissionless ledgers and tokens are “normal” and citizens insist on their use.</p>
 1.2 OTHER CLIENTS (Corporations, Financial Institutions, Startups, Investors, Crypto Projects, and Not for Profits/NGOs) 
<p>We are advising multiple organizations about the state of decentralization/crypto/web3 space and about the key developments in the space. Many of these organizations are either actively interested in understanding what impact permissionless ledgers and tokens will have on them immediately or over the longer term. Their interest ranges from rabid to tepid to allergic. Some may be partial competitors to cheqd but they are also potential collaborators. It’s an interesting mix.</p>
<p>The reason we advise them is that it is our job at Continuum Loop to keep them apprised about where things are headed (here comes an obligatory Canadian hockey quote from a non-sports fan):</p>
<blockquote><p>“I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”</p>
<p>– Wayne Gretzky</p></blockquote>
 2. COMPLIANCE 
<p>For many of our clients, compliance is a big issue. While many of the #decentralizeTheWorld types would like to think that there is no need for this, the world we live in needs it. So part of our efforts with cheqd is in understanding and advising on how the cheqd network fits with various compliance and audit needs.</p>
<p>Payments aren’t simple. Sure, in crypto it is easy to send funds from one address to another on the same chain. Once you start exchanging between different coins/tokens you add quite a bit of complexity. Adding the KYC/AML needs that you will, as a citizen of a country, require and things get hairy quickly.</p>
 3. INTEROP/STANDARDS 
<p>We have been talking more and more about what we call “premature interoperability” and “premature standardization”. The gist of these discussions is that there are only a few areas right now where interoperability and standardization make any sense – and neither have definitive good answers. We’ll be supporting cheqd to align with the key initiatives that we see are making a difference, particularly with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, Hyperledger with the <a href="https://aries-interop.info/aries-interop-intro.html">Aries Interoperability project</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a>&nbsp;with its interoperability profile efforts. These leading groups are bringing the industry together and I’ll be helping cheqd play a role there.</p>
 4. GOVERNANCE 
<p>As a founder (and funder) of the Trust Over IP Foundation, the consideration of governance of any ecosystem is critical. We’ve looked at how cheqd could fit into various different ecosystems that we are helping with and are pleased that it fits nicely. It is focused on the creation of a permissionless network. They are working to ensure that no single party holds too much control. In this case, control could easily kill an ecosystem so that is critical. One of my most important operating principles is pinned on my Twitter profile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control only what you must. Influence the rest.</p>
<p>— Darrell O'Donnell 🇨🇦🆔 (@darrello) <a href="https://twitter.com/darrello/status/792496888444575744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>A governance-related area that I will be pushing cheqd and others in the SSI/decentralized identity realm relates to where developers fit into the governance structure. To date, the ecosystems we are working with don’t incentivize developers well, or at all. That’s a deep flaw in my view. We have created back-of-napkin incentive concepts that show our team internally what is feasible with cheqd in the longer term, and from the Continuum Loop side, we’re satisfied that we’re off to a good start.</p>
 5. COMMERCIAL MODEL 
<p>The use of Verifiable Credentials is part of what we help our clients understand. One big problem is that to date they really only get uptake where they are radically reducing costs, which is a bottom-line impact for companies.</p>
<p>The more interesting use cases from a business perspective are top-line revenue related – how does a business drive massive value for its customers using verifiable credentials? Any business that drives value deserves a portion of that value (while rent-seekers take oversized percentages of value while adding little or nothing, and should rightly be removed from the system).</p>
<p>The problem has been answering the following range of questions:</p>
 
 How does a Verifier pay an Issuer; 
 How does a Holder pay an Issuer; 
 How does a Verifier pay a Holder; 
 or any variant of those pairings (or more than 2 parties)? 
 
<p>This is indeed a hard problem, especially when you consider how privacy, security, and compliance are impacted when you introduce payment.</p>
<p>Many of our clients feel there is a way to add value and drive revenue with decentralized identity, but we haven’t had any good answers to date. We believe we are getting much closer to that with cheqd and other projects we are working on.</p>
 6. FIAT versus TOKEN 
<p>One of the first questions I asked the cheqd team when we started getting into discussions was how they would make life easy for users that want to use, or just stick with, fiat currency for transactions. They will need to provide details for you but I am satisfied that they are taking a good approach to make fiat payments work – especially when it comes to network fee stability.</p>
<p>On the tokenomics side, we aren’t going to get into the science (magic/mythology/voodoo – pick your term) of tokenomics as that is not our area of deep expertise. However, it is worth mentioning a few things that are important to our clients and our team. Governance is an obvious one. Another is ensuring that the non-token world can be abstracted away from the token when required. Another is how cheqd’s approach may enable commercial models that, to date, have been holding back the use of decentralized identity. The team at cheqd has a coherent explanation of how <a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/cheqds-tokenomics-for-ssi-explained-f13f680cf00d">cheqd is handling the tokenomics here</a>.</p>
 7. SOVRIN 
<p>I have fielded a lot of “but what about Sovrin?” questions. These ones baffle me somewhat, but I get it. I want to be clear, we (Continuum Loop and I) fully support the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> and its mission. I am an ex officio member of the Sovrin Board of Trustees, by virtue of co-chairing the <a href="https://sovrin.org/i4a/">Identity For All Council</a>, which is hosted at the Sovrin Foundation. I volunteer a lot of time with Sovrin and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Similar to Continuum Loop’s work with governments that are working on deploying, or have deployed, Hyperledger Indy networks of their own, Sovrin plays a critical role. We don’t believe that there will be one single SSI network but Sovrin is important both as a network, as well as its facilitator/leader role in a network-of-networks. The cheqd network adds to the diversity in the network-of-networks and I imagine that the two groups will work together nicely.</p>
<p>Sovrin is also the progenitor of much of the leading thinking that is in the space – Trust Over IP Foundation; Sovrin Governance; Hyperledger Indy; and more.</p>
 8. CONCLUSION 
<p>We’re looking forward to learning how our relationship with cheqd shakes out. We’re going to be learning alongside them and our clients. I am sure we will make progress and I am sure we will stumble at times. That’s what we do at Continuum Loop.</p>
<p>Our clients are the ones that face an uncut jungle and do one of two things – grab a machete to cut trail (Innovators*) or look for the narrow trails that other adventurous souls have already started to cut (Early Adopters*). Our clients are not looking for paved roads through well-known paths (majority and laggards). By the time those roads are in place the rest of the world is already using them.</p>
<p>* If the Innovator/Early Adopter terms are unfamiliar check the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle">Technology Adoption Life Cycle</a>. Keep in mind that most folks that talk about the adoption life cycle usually start with “we need the Early Adopters”, when they likely mean they need the Innovators.</p>

<p>Identity platform grew eightfold in the UK compared to previous year, continues to see increasing demand for its solutions.</p>
<p>London and Manchester, November 11th, 2021: IDnow, a leading Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification from Germany, with offices in Manchester and London, has grown eightfold year-over-year in the UK market.</p>
<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow, comments: “We’re seeing a significant rise in demand for our services from the UK market this year. The pandemic pushed many industries into accelerating their digitisation, and as part of that, consumers now expect a much quicker and fully digital onboarding process. The knock-on effect of that has been an increase in cybercrime making security more important than ever and meaning businesses have a heightened focus on delivering a safe and secure process for customers.”</p>
<p>IDnow’s UK growth is aligned with the global demand for its solutions. The firm sees substantial interest across the world, with more and more companies deciding to switch to fully digital application processes.</p>
<p>To meet the rising demand, IDnow acquired two companies in 2021: French identity technology provider, ARIADNEXT and German IdentityTM. The merged companies able to offer one of the broadest sets of identity verification solutions to the European market.</p>
<p>IDnow’s Director UK&amp;I, Roger Tyrzyk, adds: “Since we launched into the UK in 2019, we’ve seen consistent growth, as businesses look to deploy most secure digital onboarding processes possible. As digitisation continues at pace, we are expecting this demand to continue to grow and as a result, will be looking to further invest in our UK presence, with plans to create more jobs over the next 12 months. As digital identity experts, our expansion will come at a critical time, as the UK Government moves forward with its Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework, a national approach for digital identity solutions which will enable people to prove who they are quickly and safely.”</p>
<p>As part of its high-growth strategy, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become recognised as an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 900 customers worldwide, including Canopy, MyCDD, Entain and ICICI.</p>

<p>“Web 3.0 enables a future where distributed users and machines are able to interact with data, value and other counterparties via a substrate of peer-to-peer networks without the need for third parties. The result:&nbsp;a composable human-centric and privacy preserving computing fabric for the next wave of the web.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This quote from venture capitalists Max Mersch and Richard Muirhead writing in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">The Medium</a>&nbsp;is a pretty good answer to the question, as is this from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=745d290558df">Forbes Technology Council</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The rise of technologies such as distributed ledgers and storage on blockchain will allow for data decentralization and create a transparent and secure environment, overtaking Web 2.0’s centralization, surveillance and exploitative advertising. Decentralized infrastructure and application platforms will displace centralized tech giants, and individuals will be able to rightfully own their data.”</p>



<p>Clearly Web 3.0 will shake up data privacy and change the data economy as we know it. Indeed, as the <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-a-decentralized-web-3-0-the-answer-to-our-privacy-concerns/">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>&nbsp;(IAPP) suggested in 2018, Web 3.0 might just be the answer to our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data privacy woes</a>.</p>



 What is Web 3.0? 



<p></p>



<p>Web 3.0 is the latest iteration of the internet that’s arriving even as Web 2.0 still consumes us. Web 3.0 goes by several different monikers: the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=5044b1a858df">decentralized internet</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">spatial web</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">semantic web</a>. A brief history of the internet’s evolution puts Web 3.0 in context:</p>



  Web 1.0 was&nbsp;static desktop web pages.  Web 2.0 is interactive content on desktop, mobile and social media, and constant connection via devices.  Web 3.0 will be&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">marked</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;open source software&nbsp;and trustless&nbsp;(users interact publicly or privately without a trusted third party)&nbsp;and&nbsp;permissionless&nbsp;(no governing body)&nbsp;networks. It will be&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">built</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;edge computing,&nbsp;decentralised data networks&nbsp;and&nbsp;artificial intelligence.  



<p><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte</a>&nbsp;says Web 3.0 or the spatial web will combine machine learning from the semantic web with distributed ledger technologies like blockchain to authenticate and decentralize information resulting in “interaction with information away from screens and into physical space.”</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a>



<p>And this shows how Deloitte sees the spatial web continuing to emerge from now:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a><br>



<p>Clearly, the hallmarks of Web 3.0 will be decentralization and greater user interaction and control over data. Data will be dispersed across an array of computing resources, including phones, appliances, sensors and vehicles,&nbsp;rather than held exclusively in central data stores&nbsp;and, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a>&nbsp;says, it&nbsp;“will eventually eliminate the boundary between digital content and physical objects that we know today” and “improve efficiency, communication and entertainment in ways we are only beginning to imagine today.”</p>



<p>The enabling technologies of Web 3.0 are the innovations we’re already seeing, such as&nbsp;augmented and virtual reality, advanced networking (e.g. 5G), geolocation, Internet of Things devices and sensors, distributed ledger technology (e.g. blockchain), and artificial intelligence and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are one example of Web 3.0 innovation, but as Mersch and Murihead say in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">The Medium</a>, Web 3.0 goes way beyond cryptocurrencies to crypto-connections of people, corporates and machines … “leading to a “return to the global village” — daily immersion in the human-centric and highly personalised interactions from which we used to benefit, yet now delivered at the global scale of the internet and supporting an ever-increasing myriad of human and machine skills specialisations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=5044b1a858df">Forbes Technology Council</a>&nbsp;sees Web 3.0 as promoting “true sovereignty” where users own and control&nbsp;who profits from an individual’s time and information … “and eclipsing an exploitative and unjust web, where giant, centralized repositories are the only ones that own and profit from it.”</p>



 What does Web 3.0 mean for privacy? 



<p></p>



<p>For privacy, this brave new world will mean humans, enterprises and machines can share more data with far greater privacy and security. We will no longer rely on (or will at least interact on our own terms with) Big Tech platforms with all their inherent risks, and users will own their own data and digital footprint via&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-a-decentralized-web-3-0-the-answer-to-our-privacy-concerns/">IAPP</a>&nbsp;laid out exactly what Web 3.0 could mean for privacy and was highly optimistic:&nbsp;</p>



  We’ll use cryptographically secured digital identities to trustlessly complete transactions that currently require us to give up our highly sensitive and highly valuable&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. We will no longer be the product and return to being the customer.  The Googles of the world will no longer control our data and bad actors will be less able to attack it. What’s more, governments won’t control our data either. Instead, all apps, users and connected devices will interact directly and data will be stored in secure decentralized ways. This will mean we’ll see fewer data breaches that affect large numbers of users, and rightfully return control of data to individual users.  The “middleman” of centralized identity management on the web will be obsolete and users will instead interact directly using&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/08/self-sovereign-identities/">self-sovereign identities</a>.&nbsp;  



 Obviously, this is all sounds like a data privacy nirvana, but the IAPP has two warnings:&nbsp; 



<p></p>



  Privacy regulations might be stumbling blocks and regulators will need to unravel issues including:  Who is the controller/processor for decentralized personal data  Where would the decentralized data be stored – location and jurisdiction&nbsp;  How to respond to subject access requests, and which entities are required to respond to such requests  How to delete or change personal information on and off the blockchain.<br>  Easy to use and convenient decentralized applications will be paramount for the average user.&nbsp;  



<p>And that’s where Anonyome Labs is helping to realize the vision of Web 3.0. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">applications and platforms</a> are already allowing users and enterprise partners to create and manage multiple digital identities via our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, with each Sudo providing a range of privacy protecting capabilities. You can see these capabilities in our exemplar app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;which currently provides for private, secure and compartmentalized&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">communication</a>. Learn more about how we’re promoting self-sovereign identities&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/08/self-sovereign-identities/">here</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll obviously stay abreast of the emergence of Web 3.0 and we’ll keep talking about the innovations and issues in coming months and years.</p>

<p>The time has finally arrived! As of November 10 at 4:14 pm CET, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a fully decentralized blockchain network. This means that BOTLabs GmbH, the company behind the initial development of KILT Protocol, has handed over decision-making to the community. From now on, KILT will be run via a sophisticated system of governance in which any KILT Coin holder can propose changes to the network that can be voted on by the community. This level of decentralization is what makes Web3, the next generation of the internet, truly fair and exciting.</p> Decentralization Day <p>Until now, the Sudo (super user) key allowed the development team to make any necessary changes to the blockchain on behalf of the network without the vote of the KILT community. Now that the network has been audited and these functionalities are running as planned, the time has come for the community to take&nbsp;control.</p><p>Today KILT reached the final step of decentralization. The Sudo key was removed and governance of the KILT blockchain transitioned into the hands of its community.</p> Governance at&nbsp;work <p>The first proposal in front of KILT community governance is to allow tokens to be transferred (TTE) and to distribute the “thank you” KILT Coins to supporters of the crowdloan. With sufficient backing, this proposal will go to referendum at the end of this week (by 12 November) for KILT Coin holders to vote on over the following 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>Following a successful referendum, proposals are automatically carried out on KILT on-chain by the system, after an enactment period of one day. So it can be expected that the KILT Coins will be distributed to crowdloan supporters in around two weeks’ time. Follow the process on-chain <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.kilt.io%2F#/democracy">here</a> to see blockchain democracy in&nbsp;action!</p> The Path to Decentralization <p>Over three years of planning and development have gone into bringing KILT Protocol to this point. First conceived in 2018, KILT was developed by <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/about-us/">BOTLabs under the direction of Ingo Rübe</a>. From the beginning, KILT was designed to evolve into a decentralized blockchain network that aims to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy and dignity to the individual as well as enabling innovative, industry-agnostic business models around identity.</p><p>Thanks to support from its community, <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-wins-kusama-parachain-auction-slot-6-launches-mainnet-a48aed4ed5e0">KILT</a> secured a parachain slot on the <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a> network and launched as a live blockchain on September 8th of this year. KILT was designed as a limited delegated proof of stake (<a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48">LDPoS</a>) system, with delegators who support a network of collators that hold and secure the data of the KILT blockchain and create blocks. Following this design, <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-first-cohort-of-kilts-initial-collators-programme-4e4b65159246">an initial cohort</a> of 16 active collators were onboarded at launch. This number is expected to increase to 75 in the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>Since launch, the development team of KILT Protocol added functions such as staking, governance, and a Treasury, which will fund projects that support the KILT ecosystem, approved by community vote. <a href="https://www.kilt.io/how-it-works/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials</a> were also added to provide developers with tools to create businesses around identity and credentials.</p> In the Hands of the Community <p>As part of handing over the network to the ecosystem, BOTLabs GmbH, the company that developed KILT, will publish a series of how-to guides and blogs over the next few weeks to help the community to take control of their network. These will include guidance on how to become an active participant in the ecosystem including how to vote and how to stake on&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>Keep an eye on KILT’s <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> to follow these exciting developments and to learn how to become an active member of the KILT community!</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy. KILT Protocol was initially developed by BOTLabs GmbH in Berlin and is the technology on which SocialKYC, a decentralized identity verification service, is&nbsp;built.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-transitions-to-a-fully-decentralized-network-8edc5f66ed9f">KILT Transitions to a Fully Decentralized Network</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 10.11.2021 Die Zukunft gehört digitalen Identitäten  <p>Der Fachartikel “Elektronische Gesundheitskarte auf dem Prüfstand: Die Zukunft gehörte digitalen Identitäten” ist als Titelstory in der aktuellen Ausgabe der E-HEALTH-COM, dem unabhängigen Fachmagazin für Gesundheitstelematik, vernetzte Medizintechnik, Telemedizin und Health-IT für Deutschland, Österreich und die Schweiz erschienen. In dem Beitrag von Christian Hälker, Michael Hartmann und Dominik Deimel geht es um die Lösung des sicheren Zugriffs auf die Gesundheitsdatenautobahn ohne elektronische Gesundheitskarte.</p><p>„Ohne eGK in die TI“: Mit dieser Herausforderung startete Ende 2020 der Verband der Privaten Krankenversicherung (PKV Verband) ein Innovationsprojekt zu digitalen Identitäten. Es findet mittlerweile große Aufmerksamkeit und könnte die Zukunft der deutschen Telematikinfrastruktur entscheidend mitprägen.</p><p>In einer Marktrecherche im zweiten Halbjahr 2020 hat sich der PKV-Verband mit unterschiedlichen Ansätzen bei der Realisierung digitaler Identitäten in der Branche beschäftigt und sich für eine Innovationspartnerschaft mit den Firmen msg systems ag und comuny entschieden.</p><p>Seit Februar 2021 arbeiten diese beiden Unternehmen zusammen mit den privaten Krankenversicherungen Allianz, Debeka, Signal Iduna und mit Beteiligung der gematik unter der Koordination des PKV-Verbands an der technischen Realisierung der Lösung zum Zugang zur TI ohne eGK. Im August hat sich diesem Projekt auch die BARMER als erste gesetzliche Krankenversicherung angeschlossen und im September dann die ERGO/DKV als weitere PKV, um den Einsatz des Lösungsansatzes für ihre Versicherten zu eruieren.</p><p>Ziel ist, Identitäten auf dem Mobilgerät komfortabel zu erzeugen und zu nutzen. Der Anspruch der PKV an digitale Identitäten ist hoch, sie müssen sicher sein und dem Konzept der gematik zum föderierten Identitätsmanagement entsprechen. Danach sollen mit einem Zugang viele digitale Lösungen in der TI erreichbar sein.</p><p>Die Ende September abgeschlossene Konzeptions- und technische Umsetzungsphase konnte allen Beteiligten die Machbarkeit und die Vorteile eines IDP-Lösungsansatzes mit Datenhaltung und Prozesssteuerung auf dem Mobilgerät aufzeigen. Das Innovationsprojekt konnte aufzeigen, dass die Einführung von physischen eGK-Diensten wie E-Rezept und ePA für private Krankenversicherer nicht zwangsläufig notwendig sein wird. Jeder Versicherer stellt zukünftig einen Identitätsprovider bereit, lässt diesen hierfür bei der gematik zu und betreibt ihn anschließend entkoppelt von eigenen Fachanwendungen wie zum Beispiel der ePA […].</p><p><a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/EHC_Sonderdruck_Digitale-Identitaeten_PKV-Verband_Online.pdf">Weiterlesen?

<p><br>Another day, another data breach! &nbsp;It's the reason why Bloom was founded and why we feel so passionately about what we build. &nbsp;These breaches will just continue to happen until we shift the paradigm from centrally stored personal data to models built around decentralized identity. &nbsp;Let’s take a look at the facts of this latest breach.<br></p><p>Robinhood Data Breach Compromises Names and Email Addresses of Millions of Customers<br></p><p>On November 3, <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/">Robinhood</a> released a statement that an unauthorized intruder gained access to the personal information of millions of its customers. &nbsp;The data breach compromised the email addresses of approximately five million people, and separately, the full names of around two million people. &nbsp;Further evidence shows that a smaller number of customers may have had additional personal information exposed.<br></p><p>Based on the on-going investigation, it appears social security numbers and bank account data were not breached, and that there has been no financial loss to any customers. &nbsp;The incident is still under investigation and Robinhood has enlisted the help of law enforcement, as well as Mandiant, a cybersecurity company. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Unfortunately, Robinhood’s data breach is just the latest attack in a year that has seen a record number of breaches. &nbsp;Despite the knowledge that a cybersecurity-related incident was likely, an intruder was able to easily bypass Robinhood’s security system, compromising the information of millions of customers who had put their trust in the company.<br></p><p>Why does this keep happening? &nbsp;When are users going to start to demand that every company they deal with not store their personal information centrally? &nbsp;Decentralization is the future - not just for transactions, but for personal data storage and interactions. &nbsp;Download the Bloom App if you haven't already done so and see why over a million other users believe that their personal information should be theirs. &nbsp;And if you're a business, sign up for an <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp Demo</a> and see what it could mean for your business. &nbsp;It’s time to be proactive about our digital identity.<br></p><p>Data Breaches Reach an All-time High in 2021<br></p><p>As we approach the holiday season, the days are getting shorter, shopping receipts are getting longer, and cybersecurity threats are at an all time high. &nbsp;In fact, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), the number of data breaches so far this year has already <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/identity-theft-resource-center-to-share-latest-data-breach-analysis-with-u-s-senate-commerce-committee-number-of-data-breaches-in-2021-surpasses-all-of-2020/">surpassed the total for 2020</a>. &nbsp;This is extremely alarming news and worrisome as we approach the time of the year when online shopping is at its peak, and more of our personal information is available on the web.<br></p><p>As of now, there have been over 1,290 data breaches - up by 17% since last year. &nbsp;With the exponential growth in the connectivity of cyber devices, and the vulnerability of a centralized intermediary, cybersecurity is more important than ever. &nbsp;Phishing and ransomware attacks continue to be the most prevalent weapons for hackers, and the firm Cybersecurity Ventures estimate that a new ransomware attack will occur every 2 seconds. &nbsp;Ransomware is a criminal extortion tool in which key files are encrypted by hackers, rendering them inaccessible to the victim until a ransom has been paid. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Although ransomware is not a new tactic, the expanded attack surfaces and interconnectivity of digital commerce have made the cybersecurity threat as dangerous as ever. &nbsp;Hackers, constantly seeking new avenues to exploit, are now demanding payments in the form of cryptocurrency. &nbsp;The US Treasury Department has tied approximately $5.2 billion in BitCoin transactions to ransomware payments. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Awareness and Transparency<br></p><p>Cybersecurity is all about risk management. &nbsp;As the number of threats increases, more and more Americans are expressing concern that their personal information, or that of the centralized financial institutions to which they are associated, is at risk. &nbsp;The problem, though, is this: awareness does not necessarily lead to action. &nbsp;Too often, people assume that cybercrime is someone else’s responsibility, and believe that a hack will never affect them personally. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Furthermore, some organizations and governments have purposefully been withholding important data breach notices. &nbsp;In 2017, a ransomware attack called WannaCry, disrupted hospitals, schools, and government organizations in over 100 countries, demonstrating the vulnerability of globally-connected networks and devices. &nbsp;Although the WannaCry attack (and others, including CryptoLocker, WhiteRose, and Petya) was seen by some as a wake-up call, organizations and governments did not fortify against future attacks. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Significant Attacks in 2021<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at some of the more significant attacks that have occurred just this year.<br></p>  Bonobos: In January, Bonobos, a men’s clothing retailer, was victim of a massive breach, in which personally identifiable information (PII) of over 7 million shoppers was leaked in a forum for hackers. &nbsp;The PII included address, phone numbers, account information, and partial credit card numbers.  Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn: Due to an unsecured database, the PII of 214 million social media users was leaked, exposing full names, subscriber data, location, and other contact information.  CNA Insurance: Hackers in March attacked CNA, one of the largest insurance firms in the US, compromising the data of around 75,000 employees, and leading to the halt of trading for a short period of time. &nbsp;CNA Insurance agreed to pay the hackers $40 million to regain access to their ransomed network.  National Basketball Association: This year, the NBA was targeted by a ransomware attack, with the group responsible claiming that they had stolen 500gb of confidential data.  Buffalo Public Schools: Unfortunately, cyberattacks within the education sector are also becoming more prevalent, and in March the Buffalo Public Schools suffered a ransomware attack that targeted highly sensitive information for the 34,000 students within the school district.<br>  <p>As if the pandemic wasn’t hard enough for people, hospitals and healthcare facilities have also become increasingly prone to cyber attacks. &nbsp;Often these critical facilities are forced to comply for fear of shutting down their medical operations. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Securing our digital identities is a universal problem. &nbsp;The interconnectivity of the world we live in means that cyberthreats will continue to impact our lives, and although awareness is increasing, so too is the complexity of the targeted attacks. &nbsp;Information shared with a centralized entity is vulnerable to a breach, as the user loses control of precisely who has their personal data. So, what can be done to mitigate the risk?<br></p><p>The Bloom Solution<br></p><p>Taking proactive measures is a good place to start. &nbsp;Staying hyper-vigilant to cyber trends and utilizing new and emerging tools to help with compliance and risk will certainly help to avoid an attack. &nbsp;Bloom offers a solution for digital identity, user privacy, and risk assessment. &nbsp;In fact, Bloom was founded in response to the 2017 Equifax scandal, in which hackers gained access to the private information of 147 million US citizens. &nbsp;By developing the BloomID, Bloom gave its users the ability to create and control their own digital identities. &nbsp;More recently, with the release of OnRamp, our latest DeFi-focused product, we are securely connecting enterprises to users by offering reusable, verifiable credentials to help enable compliance and risk assessment. &nbsp;This means that your personal information and financial data, used in determining creditworthiness, are available to use on a decentralized platform without sacrificing your privacy. &nbsp;<br></p> Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all with one simple app. No more centralized data storage. No more selling off your data to the highest bidder. Bloom enables you to <a href="https://bloom.co/identity?utm_source=twidb&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=bloomid">own, control, and protect your data</a> using the latest advancements in blockchain technology.It’s time to take back control of your data and unlock the power of a secure identity today. <a href="https://bloom.co/download?utm_source=twidb&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=download">Download the Bloom mobile app</a> to build a digital identity, monitor your credit, and get free data breach alerts with Radar!</p>

<p>,,Auf meinem Bildschirm sehen Sie sechs Menschen‘‘, sagte Frank Puscher. ,,Einige mögen Ihnen sympathischer sein, andere weniger. Was beachtenswert ist: keiner dieser Menschen existiert in echt.‘‘ Unter diesem Eindruck begann die Vortragsreihe zum Thema: ,,Vertrauen im Zeitalter KI-gestützter Bots und Fakes: Herausforderungen und mögliche Lösungen‘‘. Am 4. November 2021 luden das BMWi, BMJ und VDE ein, um über exakt dieses Thema virtuell zu diskutieren, Lösungen zu präsentieren, und auf die Fragen der 103 Teilnehmenden einzugehen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der erste Teil der Fachkonferenz begann mit einer Einführung in die Problemstellung: Es ging zum einen um Fake Reviews im Internet, zum anderen um eine Einführung in das Thema Deep Fakes – eine Mischung von Deep Learning und Fakes. Anschließend gab es Impulsvorträge zu der Kernfrage: Wie schützen wir den politischen Diskurs in Zeiten der Aufmerksamkeitsökonomie? Hier wurden die Herausforderungen bei der Regulierung von Deep Fakes herausgestellt und Beispiele aus der Gegenwart. Im zweiten Teil der Konferenz ging es konkret um die Frage: Wie gelingt eine nachhaltige Lösung? Impulsvorträge griffen diese Frage von verschiedenen Ansätzen auf und zeigten Ideen für den möglichen Umgang und Regulierungen von Deep Fakes. &nbsp;</p>



 Teil 1: Wie sieht die Problemstellung aus? KI als globaler Trend.&nbsp; 



<blockquote><p>Ab wann ist es schädlich, wenn computergenerierte Inhalte auf uns treffen?</p></blockquote>



<p>Künstliche Intelligenz nimmt mehr Raum in Diskursen ein. Ob in der Altenbetreuung, beim Auftritt in Lernvideos oder Beantworten von Kundenfragen, KI Klone werden uns wohl immer häufiger in der nahen Zukunft begegnen. Dabei handelt es sich durchaus nicht um etwas Exotisches: Eingebettet in unsere Gesellschaft handelt es sich um eine Software, die bereits jeder nutzen kann. Ein anschauliches Beispiel verdeutlicht, dass virtuelle KI Klone sogar CO2 sparen könnten. Wenn Prominente ein Double von sich erstellen, könnten sie zur selben Zeit an verschiedenen Orten sein und müssten nicht selbst reisen. Das führt zwangsläufig zu der Kernfrage: Ist das schlimm? Wann ist es schädlich, wenn computergenerierte Inhalte auf uns treffen?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Betrachtet man die Rolle von KI in Deutschland fällt zunächst auf: so weit verbreitet wie in anderen Ländern ist es hier nicht. Bereits 2018 benannte eine Studie des Roland-Koch Instituts die USA als führende Nation im Bereich KI. Vom Amazon Go Supermarket, in welchem man ohne Angestellte, Kasse, und Barcode-Scanner einkaufen kann, bis hin zu KI Klonen, die Termine beim Friseur ausmachen: die USA zeigen Ausschnitte einer Welt, die hier noch nicht Realität, aber definitiv Zukunft sein kann (<a href="https://www.gtai.de/gtai-de/trade/specials/special/usa/entwicklung-kuenstlicher-intelligenz-ist-in-den-usa-bereits-22718">https://www.gtai.de/gtai-de/trade/specials/special/usa/entwicklung-kuenstlicher-intelligenz-ist-in-den-usa-bereits-22718</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doch noch ist es hierzulande weniger verbreitet. Auswirkungen von KI gestützter Fakes auf den politischen Diskurs sind überschaubar, dafür im Handel jedoch mehr ausgeprägt. So lässt sich ein Problemfeld von Fake Reviews im Internet deutlich erkennen: Die negativen Folgen von durch Bots kreierter Fake Reviews kreieren die Gefahr, seriöse Anbieter:innen nicht mehr zu erkennen, ein allgemeines Zurückgehen von Vielfalt, und das Abhängen neuerer Plattformen. Wie eine Studie herausstellte, haben 85% aller befragten Händler:innen bereits negative Auswirkungen auf ihre Verkaufszahlen erlebt – durch Fake Reviews. Problematisch hierbei sind vor allem das Fehlen eines Unrechtsbewusstseins und eine effektivere Rechtsdurchsetzung.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Man sieht: die Grenzen zwischen Realität und Künstlicher Intelligenz vermischen. Ebenfalls ist zu erkennen, dass es sich um ein zukünftiges Problem handelt, welches definitiv Auswirkungen annehmen wird. Freilich bringt das Vorteile mit sich, aber jede Münze hat zwei Seiten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So fokussierte man sich in der Fachkonferenz auf das mögliche Ausmaß von KI, wenn keine Regulierungen vorliegen. Auch wenn es sich noch um Zukunftsszenarien handelt, sind negative Folgen bereits absehbar. Diese ziehen sich von der individuellen Ebene (Verletzung von Menschenrechten, Psychologischen Folgen), über die Wirtschaftliche Ebene (Versicherungs- oder Steuerbetrug) bis hin zur ganzen Gesellschaft (Verletzung demokratischer Werte). Kompliziert wird es weiterhin, wenn man die Anonymität der Täter:innen bedenkt oder die rechtlichen Herausforderungen. Das Paradox liegt hierbei zwischen Rechten wie Kunstfreiheit und staatlichen Pflichten, nämlich dem Schutz von Persönlichkeitsrechten. Selbstverständlich ist auch das Erkennen von KI Klonen oder automatisierter Bots nicht immer einfach. Als Bot gilt ein Account, der mehr als 50 Tweets pro Tag twittert. In einer vorgestellten Studie wurde ein Twitter Account eines kanadischen Ingenieurs untersucht, der im Durchschnitt über 300 Tweets pro Tag twitterte. Wie allerdings festgestellt wurde, handelte es sich hierbei allerdings nicht um einen automatisierten Account, sondern um einen echten Menschen. Alles sind Herausforderungen, denen die Regierung sich definitiv wird stellen müssen. KI ist ein globaler Trend, der sich weiterentwickelt.&nbsp;</p>



 Teil 2: Wie gelingt eine nachhaltige Lösung? Die Rolle von SSI.&nbsp; 



<blockquote><p>,,Wir stehen hier – wie in vielen anderen Bereichen – Infrastrukturfragen gegenüber. Individuelle Pflichten sind da ein winziger Anteil; der Löwenanteil liegt bei systemischen Veränderungen.‘‘ </p>Irene Adamski</blockquote>



<p>Wie herausgestellt, stellt KI aktuell keine Gefahr da. Diese besteht vorwiegend im Bereich von Fake Reviews im Internet und der Verbreitung gefälschter Inhalte durch KI-Klone. Wie ist hiermit umzugehen?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In der Mitte von Schwierigkeiten liegen die Lösungen. Derlei gibt es einige, und auch Jolocom hat am Donnerstag den von uns verfolgten Ansatz vorstellen dürfen: Selbst-Souveräne Identitäten (SSI) im digitalen Raum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der Grundgedanke: die eigenen Daten kontrollieren. Aufgeschlüsselt: selektiv auswählen, wer Zugang zu seinen und ihren Daten hat, und ablehnen, wer keinen Zugang bekommen soll. Beim Nutzen einer digitalen Wallet kommt dies gut zum Ausdruck: Ich kann ausweisen, dass ich über 18 Jahre alt bin, ohne mein persönliches Geburtsdatum teilen zu müssen. Diese selektive Weitergabe von Daten bringt auch wieder mehr Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum mit sich. So liefert eine sichere Wallet die Möglichkeit, im beginnenden Zeitalter von KI und automatisierter Bots die Autonomie über die eigenen Daten zu behalten und zu schützen. Globale Entwicklungen zeigen den Vorwärts-Trend von KI-Anwendungen. Auch auf EU-Ebene gibt es Ambitionen, digitale Identifikationsnachweise auszugeben. Die eIDAS Verordnung strebt eine digitale Identität an, die von jedem Mitgliedsstaat herausgegeben und von den anderen Mitgliedsstaaten anerkannt werden müssen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es ist wichtig, an der Wurzel des Problems anzusetzen und Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum auszubauen. Dieses Vertrauen kann vor allem durch SSI hergestellt werden.  &nbsp;</p>

Ontology’s Chief of Global Ecosystem Partnerships, Gloria Wu, shared her opinion in the article “<a href="https://beincrypto.com/women-and-web-3-0-experts-weigh-in-on-community-and-financial-freedom/">Women and Web 3.0 — Experts Weigh-In On Community and Financial Freedom</a>”, published in BeInCrypto. She said decentralized finance offers more opportunities for authentic creativity and boundary-breaking, and women’s role in the redefinition of what finance is, is&nbsp;key.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>CoinDesk — <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/22/why-us-policymakers-should-embrace-web-3/">Why US Policymakers Should Embrace Web&nbsp;3</a></p><blockquote>Big tech has been embroiled in an unending series of controversies over the past decade, ranging from poor stewardship of consumer data and privacy breaches to disinformation and algorithmic bias. But these platforms are now being disrupted and disintermediated by Web3. For instance, decentralization has opened up the possibility of a world in which people can own their data and grant applications permission to use it on a limited basis, rather than having that data littered across hundreds of centralized databases.</blockquote><p>When people talk about Web3, it is often difficult to circumvent a puzzle: how to protect their own identity and privacy data while also being connected with the real world? In order to solve this confusion and to prepare people for the Web3 explosion, Ontology proposed the decentralized digital identity (DID) solution, ONT ID. ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the W3C commendations for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, using blockchain and cryptographic technology, that can quickly identify and connect people, data, and services. It is decentralized, self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, and easy to use, enabling users to fully control their own data and identities.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 So long, View Engine! 

<p>With v13, View Engine is no longer available, replaced by Ivy. Ivy is the future of Angular applications, and the benefits are tremendous. After initially landing in v12, Ivy paves the way for new feature updates, simplifies existing capabilities, and increases rendering performance.</p>

<p>The way you can now create components dynamically is an example of how this release simplifies existing capabilities. Dynamic components are components loaded at runtime. You might use this when you need to tailor visible components based on responses from a server call. Previously, to dynamically create components, you had to use the <code>ComponentFactoryResolver</code>. Now the API takes the Component type directly. Let’s look at how this works.</p>

 Set up the Authorization Server 

<p>In my example, I am authenticating using OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect through Okta. In my Okta Authorization Server, I added a custom claim named <code>pet_preference</code> to my identity token. Does this sound only vaguely familiar? Refresh your understanding of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect by reading “<a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/10/29/things-to-keep-in-mind-about-auth">The Things to Keep in Mind about Auth</a>”.</p>

<p>With this custom claim, I want to display dynamic components specific to the value. The app uses the claim value to rotate through images of pets that match their preference.</p>

 Prepare the components 

<p>To write something like this, you’ll first create components for the customized views of different pets that all implement the same interface, such as one named <code>PreferenceComponentInterface</code>. The interface has a property named <code>data</code> so you can pass in customized information. You’ll also need to get the <code>pet_preference</code> custom claim value and retrieve content specifically for it. Once you have the data for the preferred pet, you can add the code to create dynamic components.</p>

 Implement the dynamic component creation 

<p>Create a <code>Directive</code> to house the view.</p>

   <code>import { Directive, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appPreference]'
})

export class PreferenceDirective {
  constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) { }
}
</code>   

<p>And a container component that handles the dynamic creation of the component. I simplified the code snipped to focus on the v13 change. In an upcoming post, I’ll do a complete walkthrough of creating this application.</p>

   <code>class PreferenceItem {
  component: Type&lt;PreferenceComponentInterface&gt;;
  info: any;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-secret-preference',
  template: `&lt;ng-template appPreference&gt;&lt;/ng-template&gt;`
 })

export class SecretPreferenceComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild(PreferenceDirective, {static: true}) private host!: PreferenceDirective;
  
  private preferences: PreferenceItem[] = [{
    component: MyCustomComponent,
    info: 'example'
  }, {
    component: MyOtherCustomComponent,
    info: {
      isTrue: true
    }
  }];
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {
    const preferredItem = this.preferences[0];
    const compRef = this.host.viewContainerRef.createComponent&lt;PreferenceComponentInterface&gt;(preferredItem);
    compRef.instance.data = preferredItem.info;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Notice you didn’t have to inject the <code>ComponentFactoryResolver</code> to do this. The API is more straightforward to use. A more realistic use case might be a custom claim for the department and displaying customized content based on the authenticated user’s department.</p>

 Clean-up after each test 

<p>Testing Angular apps is much improved in v13, and better cleanup of the DOM between tests is the new default. Now, Angular does a better job of cleaning up the DOM, and tests run faster and more performantly with better isolation between tests.</p>

<p>The clean-up behavior is configurable when configuring or resetting the <code>TestBed</code>. Let’s look at an example test where we greet the user after they’ve logged in.</p>

<p>Component code</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-profile',
  template: `
    &lt;ng-container *ngIf="name$ | async as name "&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;Welcome {{name}}!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/ng-container&gt;
  `
})

export class ProfileComponent {
  public name$: Observable&lt;string&gt; = this._authStateService.authState$.pipe(
    filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s &amp;&amp; !!s.isAuthenticated),
    map((s: AuthState) =&gt; s.idToken?.claims.name ?? 'stranger')
  );

  constructor(private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService) { }
}
</code>   

<p>Test code</p>

   <code>describe('ProfileComponent', () =&gt; {
  let component: ProfileComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture&lt;ProfileComponent&gt;;

  let authStateSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj&lt;OktaAuthStateService&gt;([], { authState$: of(authState) });

  beforeEach(() =&gt; {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [ ProfileComponent ],
      providers: [
        { provide: OktaAuthStateService, useValue: authStateSpy }
      ],
      teardown: { destroyAfterEach: false } // flakey tests!
    });
  });

  it('should show text that welcomes the user by name', () =&gt; {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ProfileComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
      
    const spanEl = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('span'));
    expect(spanEl).toBeTruthy();
    expect(spanEl.nativeElement.innerHTML).toEqual('Welcome Test Name!');
  });

  it('should show text that welcomes a user with no name', () =&gt; {
    (Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(authStateSpy, 'authState$')?.get as jasmine.Spy).and.returnValue(of({
      isAuthenticated: true,
      idToken: {...idToken, claims: {sub: 'sub'}}
    }));
      
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ProfileComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();

    const spanEl = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('span'));
    expect(spanEl).toBeTruthy();
    expect(spanEl.nativeElement.innerHTML).toEqual('Welcome stranger!');
  });
});
</code>   

<p>We can configure the teardown cleanup in this test suite by changing the value of <code>destroyAfterEach</code>. With this change enabled by default, you have the option of writing new tests with better performance. Plus, you can disable the default for tests that aren’t ready to consume the changes. Angular has our backs on non-breaking updates!</p>

 Enhanced developer tooling 

<p>Creating Angular apps is now easier with developer tooling enhancements and compilation time improvements.</p>

<p>The first thing you might notice is how much faster the build time is. A lot of work went into improving the build time. By adding <a href="https://angular.io/cli/cache">a build cache</a>, the Angular team found build time improvements of up to 65+%!</p>

<p>The Angular Language Service’s tooling improvement to auto-apply optional chaining feels like a small thing but is such an appreciated feature. I can focus on the object property I want to use, and the tooling handles the optional chaining for me!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: The example demo shown above is for demonstration purposes, and exaggerates capabilities to showcase the new feature. Please remember to apply sound software development practices to your real-world applications.</p>

 So long, Internet Explorer! 

<p>In this release, we also say goodbye to Internet Explorer. <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41840">Dropping Internet Explorer support</a> means lots of doors open up for new features, refactoring the code base, and keeping up with security best practices. With extra polyfills, you can use Okta’s Auth JS library in Internet Explorer, but the recommendation is to migrate away from it.</p>

 All the Angular v13 details 

<p>These are the features that I found most interesting, but there are lots more in Angular v13! You can read more about them in the <a href="https://blog.angular.io/angular-v13-is-now-available-cce66f7bc296">Angular team’s blog post</a>. You can read about the changes in the new version of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-4/">TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://rxjs.dev/6-to-7-change-summary">RxJS</a>.</p>

 Upcoming changes 

<p>Angular keeps improving and growing. The <a href="https://angular.io/guide/roadmap">subsequent releases</a> should prove exciting, with features such as strict typing for forms and standalone components in the works.</p>
